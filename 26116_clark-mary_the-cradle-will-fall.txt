mary higgins clark the cradle will fall chapter one if her mind had not been on the case she had won katie might not have taken the curve so fast but the intense satisfaction of the guilty verdict was still absorbing her it had been a close one roy oconnor was one of the top attorneys in new jersey the defendants confession had been suppressed by the court a major blow for the prosecution but still she had convinced the jury that teddy copeland had viciously murdered eightyyearold abigail rawlings during a robbery miss rawlings sister margaret was in court to hear the verdict you were wonderful mrs demaio shed said to katie afterward you look like a young college girl i never would have thought you could do it but you proved every point you made them feel what he did to abby her eyes filled with tears i keep thinking how frightened abby must have been it would have been awful if hed gotten away with it he didnt get away with it katie said the memory of that reassurance distracted her now made her press her foot harder on the accelerator as she rounded the curve the car fishtailed on the sleetcovered road oh no she gripped the wheel frantically the car raced across the divider and spun completely around she could see headlights approaching she turned the wheel into the skid but the car careened onto the shoulder of the road poised for an instant at the edge and slammed down the embankment into the woods katie felt the sickening crunch as metal tore into bark her body was flung forward against the wheel then backward she raised her arms to protect her face from the glass that exploded from the windshield biting pain attacked her wrists and knees velvety blackness was closing over her as she heard a siren in the distance the car door opening a blast of cold air its katie demaio a voice she knew tom coughlin that nice young cop he had testified at a trial last week shes unconscious she tried to protest but her lips wouldnt form words she couldnt open her eyes looks like shes cut an artery something tight was being pressed against her arm a different voice she may have internal injuries westlakes right down the road ill call for an ambulance hands lifting her onto a stretcher a blanket covering her sleet pelting her face she was being carried an ambulance doors opening and closing if only she could make them understand i can hear you im not unconscious tom was giving her name kathleen demaio lives in abbington shes an assistant prosecutor judge demaios widow johns widow a terrible sense of aloneness the blackness was starting to recede a light was shining in her eyes shes coming around how old are you mrs demaio the question so practical so easy to answer twentyeight the tourniquet tom had wrapped around her arm was being removed her arm was being stitched needles of pain x rays the emergencyroom doctor youre fortunate mrs demaio some severe bruises but no fractures ive ordered a transfusion your blood count is very low dont be frightened its just she bit her lip managed to stop herself before she blurted out that terrible childish fear of hospitals tom asking do you want us to call your sister no mollys just over the flu theyve all had it her voice was so weak that tom had to bend over to hear her all right dont worry katie ill have your car hauled out she was wheeled into a curtainedoff section of the emergency room blood began dripping through a tube inserted into her right arm a nurse was smoothing her hair back from her forehead youre going to be fine mrs demaio why are you crying im not crying but she was she was wheeled into a room the nurse handed her a paper cup of water and a pill this will help you rest mrs demaio it must be a sleeping pill katie was sure it would give her nightmares the nurse turned off the light as she left katie slid into sleep knowing a nightmare was inevitable this time it took a different form she was on a roller coaster and she couldnt control it it kept climbing higher and higher and then it went off the tracks and it was falling she woke up trembling just before it hit the ground sleet rapped on the window she sat up the window was open a crack and the shade which was pulled halfway down was rattling shed close the window and raise the shade then maybe shed be able to sleep unsteadily she walked over to the window the hospital gown theyd given her barely came to her knees her legs were cold she leaned against the windowsill looked out sleet was mixed with rain now the parking lot was running with streams of water katie gripped the shade and stared down into the lot one story below the trunk lid of a car was going up slowly she was so dizzy now she let go of the shade it snapped up was something white floating down into the trunk a blanket a large bundle she must be dreaming she thought then she pushed her hand over her mouth to muffle the shriek that tore at her throat the trunk light was on through the waves of sleetfilled rain that slapped against the window she watched the white substance part as the trunk closed she saw a facethe face of a woman grotesque in the uncaring abandon of death the alarm had awakened him promptly at two oclock he was instantly alert getting up he went over to the examiningroom sink splashed cold water on his face pulled his tie into a smooth knot combed his hair and put on his steelrimmed glasses his socks were still wet when he took them off the radiator grimacing he pulled them on and slipped into his shoes he reached for his overcoat it was soaked through hed wear the old burberry raincoat he kept in the closet it was unlined hed freeze but it was the only thing to do besides it was so ordinary that if anyone saw him there was less chance of being recognized he hurried to the closet put on the raincoat and hung up the heavy wet chesterfield he went over to the window and pulled the shade back an inch there were still enough cars in the parking lot so that the absence of his own would hardly be noticed he bit his lip as he realized that the back of his car was silhouetted by the light at the far side of the lot he would have to walk in the shadows of the other cars and get the body into the trunk as quickly as possible it was time unlocking the medical supply closet he bent down and picked up the body she had once weighed around one hundred ten pounds but she had gained a lot of weight during her pregnancy his muscles felt every ounce as he carried her to the examining table there he wrapped a blanket around her noiselessly he opened the door to the parking lot grasping the trunk key in two fingers he moved to the table and picked up the dead woman now for the twenty seconds that could destroy him eighteen seconds later he was at the car sleet pelted his cheek the blanketcovered burden strained his arms shifting the weight he inserted his key into the trunk lock the lid rose slowly he glanced up at the hospital windows from the center room on the second floor a shade snapped up was anyone looking out impatient to have the blanketed figure out of his arms he moved too quickly the instant his left hand let go of the blanket the wind blew it open revealing her face wincing he dropped the body and slammed the trunk closed the trunk light had been on the face had anyone seen he looked up again at the window where the shade had been raised was someone there he couldnt be sure later he would have to find out who was in that room driving swiftly from the lot he kept the headlights off until he was well along the road incredible that this was his second trip to chapin river tonight suppose he hadnt been leaving the hospital when vangie lewis burst out of dr fukhitos office and hailed him vangie had been close to hysteria as she limped down the covered portico to him doctor im going to minneapolis tomorrow im going to see the doctor i used to have dr emmet salem maybe ill even stay there and let him deliver the baby if he had missed her everything would have been ruined instead he had persuaded her to come into the office with him talked to her calmed her down offered her a glass of water at the last minute shed suspected that beautiful petulant face had filled with fear and then the horror of knowing that even though hed managed to silence her the chance of discovery was still so great he had locked her body in the medical supply closet and tried to think her bright red lincoln continental had been the immediate danger it would surely have been noticed in the hospital parking lot after visiting hours he knew she lived on winding brook lane in chapin river shed told him that her husband a united airlines pilot wasnt due home until tomorrow hed leave her body in the closet while he took her car and handbag to the house to make it seem as though shed driven home hed dispose of the body later it had been unexpectedly easy the houses in chapin river were placed far back from the road and reached by winding driveways hed parked the car inside her garage the door from the garage to the den was unlocked there were lamps on throughout the house probably on a timing device hed hurried through the den and down the hall the master bedroom was the last one on the right there were two other bedrooms one a nursery with colorful elves and lambs on the wallpaper and an obviously new crib and chest that was when he realized he might be able to make her death look like a suicide if shed begun to furnish the nursery three months before the baby was expected the threatened loss of that baby would provide a powerful motive he would have to get her body back here put it on top of her own bed it was dangerous but not as dangerous as dumping her body in the woods somewhere that would have meant an intensive police investigation he had left her handbag on the chaise longue in the master bedroom and then walked the four miles back to the hospital there he skirted the main entrance and let himself into his office through the door from the parking lot it was just ten oclock his coat and shoes and socks were soaked he was shivering he realized it would be too dangerous to carry the body out until there was a minimal chance of encountering anyone hed set the alarm for two oclock then lain down on the examining table and managed to sleep until the alarm went off now for the second time that night he was pulling into vangies driveway turn off the headlights back the car up to the garage put on surgical gloves open the garage door open the trunk carry the wrapped form past the storage shelves to the inside door he stepped into the den in a few minutes hed be safe he hurried down the hall to the master bedroom and placed the body on the bed pulling the blanket free in the adjoining bathroom he shook crystals of cyanide into the flowered blue tumbler added water and poured most of the contents down the sink he rinsed the sink carefully and returned to the bedroom placing the glass next to the dead womans hand he allowed the last drops of the mixture to spill on the spread he folded the white blanket carefully the body was sprawled face up on the bed eyes staring lips contorted in an agony of protest that was all right most suicides changed their minds when it was too late had he missed anything no her handbag with the keys was on the chaise there was a residue of the cyanide in the glass coat on or off hed leave it on the less he handled her the better shoes off or on would she have kicked them off he lifted the long caftan she was wearing and felt the blood drain from his face the swollen right foot wore a battered moccasin her left foot was covered only by her stocking the other moccasin must have fallen off where he ran from the bedroom searching retracing his steps the shoe was not in the house or garage frantic he ran out to his car and looked in the trunk the shoe was not there it had probably come off when he was carrying her in the parking lot because of her swollen foot shed been wearing the moccasins recently hed heard the receptionist joke with her about them he would have to go back and search the parking lot suppose someone said why i saw her moccasin lying in the parking lot she must have lost it on her way home monday night but if she had walked even a few feet off the portico without a shoe the sole of her stocking would be badly soiled the police would notice that it was not rushing back to the bedroom he opened the door of the walkin closet a jumble of womens shoes were scattered on the floor most of them had impossibly high heels for a woman in her condition to wear then he saw a pair of sensible lowheeled shoes the kind most pregnant women wore they looked fairly new relieved he grabbed them hurrying to the bed he pulled the one moccasin from the dead womans foot and placed the shoes on her feet the right one was tight but he managed to lace it jamming the moccasin into the wide loose pocket of his raincoat he picked up the white blanket and strode quickly to the garage at the hospital parking lot he drove to a far corner and parked the car then he hurried to retrace his steps from the space where hed kept the car to the door of the office the shoe might have fallen off when hed shifted the body to open the trunk bending forward he searched the ground working his way closer to the hospital headlights came around the bend into the parking lot a car screeched to a halt the driver probably looking for the emergency entrance made a uturn and raced out of the lot he had to get out of here he fell forward as he tried to straighten up his hand slid across the slippery macadam and then he felt leather under his fingers he had found the shoe fifteen minutes later he was turning the key in the lock of his home peeling off the raincoat he hung it in the foyer closet the fulllength mirror on the door reflected his image shocked he realized that his trouser knees were wet and dirty his hair was badly disheveled his cheeks were flushed and his eyes were bulging and dilated he looked like a caricature of himself rushing upstairs he undressed bathed got into pajamas and a robe he was too keyed up to sleep and savagely hungry the housekeeper had left slices of lamb on a plate crisp tart apples were in the fruit bin of the refrigerator carefully he prepared a tray and carried it into the library from the bar he poured a generous whiskey and sat at his desk as he ate he reviewed the nights happenings if he had not stopped to check his calendar he would have missed her been unable to stop her unlocking his desk he opened the large center drawer and slid back the false bottom where he kept his current special file he took out a single manila folder then he reached for a fresh sheet of paper and made a final entry february at pm this physician was locking the rear door of his office subject patient had just left fukhito she approached this physician and said she was going home to minneapolis and would have her former doctor emmet salem deliver her baby hysterical patient was persuaded to come inside obviously patient could not be allowed to leave getting her a glass of water this physician dissolved cyanide crystals into the glass and forced patient to swallow the poison patient expired at pm fetus was weeks old had it been born it might have been viable laying down the pen he slipped the final entry into the manila folder then walked over to a panel on the bookcase reaching behind a book he touched a button and the panel swung open revealing a wall safe quickly he opened the safe and inserted the file subconsciously noting the growing number of folders he could have recited the names on them by heart elizabeth berkeley anna horan maureen crowley linda evansover six dozen of them the successes and failures of his medical genius he closed the safe snapped the panel back into place then went upstairs and got into bed had he overlooked anything hed put the vial of cyanide in the safe hed get rid of the moccasins tomorrow night the events of the last hours whirled furiously through his mind hed drop his suit at the cleaners on the way to the hospital hed find out what patient was in the center room on the second floor of the hospitals east wing what that patient could have seen now he must sleep if you dont mind wed like you to leave through the rear entrance the nurse told katie the front driveway froze over terribly and the workmen are trying to clear it the cab will be waiting in back i dont care if i climb out the window just as long as i can get home katie said fervently and the misery is that i have to come back here friday im having minor surgery on saturday oh the nurse looked at her chart whats wrong i seem to have inherited a problem my mother used to have i practically hemorrhage every month during my period that must be why your blood count was so low when you came in whos your doctor dr highley oh hes the best hes top man in this place you know she helped katie with her coat the morning was cloudy and bitterly cold katie shivered as she stepped out into the parking lot in her nightmare this was the area she had been looking at from her room a cab pulled up gratefully she got in wincing at the pain in her knees where to lady the driver asked and pressed the accelerator from the window of the room that katie had just left a man was observing her departure her chart was in his hand it read kathleen n demaio woodfield way abbington place of business prosecutors office valley county new jersey he felt a thrill of fear go through him katie demaio there was a note on the chart that the night nurse had found her sitting on the edge of the bed at two eight am in an agitated state and complaining about nightmares the chart also showed she had been given a sleeping pill so she would have been pretty groggy but how much had she seen even if she thought shed been dreaming her professional training would nag at her she was a risk an unacceptable one chapter two shoulders touching chris lewis and joan moore sat in the end booth of the eightyseventh street drugstore sipping coffee her left arm rested on the gold braid on his right sleeve their fingers were entwined ive missed you he said carefully ive missed you too chris thats why im sorry you met me this morning it just makes it worse joan give me a little time i swear well work this out she shook her head he saw how unhappy she looked her hazel eyes were cloudy her light brown hair pulled back in a chignon emphasized the paleness of her smooth clear skin for the thousandth time he asked himself why he hadnt made a clean break with vangie when he was transferred to new york last year why had he given in to her plea to try a little longer to make a go of their marriage when ten years of trying hadnt done it and now a baby coming he thought of the ugly quarrel hed had with vangie before he left should he tell joan about that no it wouldnt do any good joan was a flight attendant with pan american she was based in new york and shared an apartment with two other pan am attendants chris had met her six months ago at a party in hawaii incredible how right some people are together from the first minute hed told her he was married but was able to say honestly that he had wanted to break with his wife when he transferred from minneapolis to new york but he hadnt joan was saying you got in last night yes we had engine trouble in chicago and the rest of the flight was canceled got back around six and stayed in town why didnt you go home because i wanted to see you vangie doesnt expect me till later this morning so dont worry chris i told you i applied for a transfer to the latin american division its been approved im moving to miami next week joan no im sorry but its not my nature to be an available lady for a man who is not only married but whose wife is finally expecting the baby shes prayed for for ten years im not a home wrecker our relationship has been totally innocent in todays world who would believe that she finished her coffee no matter what you say chris i still feel that if im not around theres a chance that you and your wife will grow closer a baby has a way of creating a bond between people gently she withdrew her fingers from his id better get home it was a long flight and im tired youd better go home too they looked at each other chris tried to smile im not giving up joan im coming to miami for you and when i get there ill be free the cab dropped katie off she hurried painfully up the porch steps thrust her key into the lock opened the door and murmured thank god im home she felt that shed been away weeks rather than overnight and with fresh eyes appreciated the soothing earth tones of the foyer and living room the hanging plants katie hung up her coat and sank down on the livingroom couch she looked at her husbands portrait over the mantel john anthony demaio the youngest judge in essex county she could remember so clearly the first time shed seen him hed come to lecture to her class at seton hall law school when the class ended the students clustered around him katie said judge i have to tell you i dont agree with your decision in the kipling case john had smiled that obviously is your privilege miss katie kathleen callahan she never understood why at that moment shed dragged up the kathleen but hed always called her that theyd gone out for coffee that day the next night hed taken her to dinner in new york later when hed dropped her off he said you have the loveliest blue eyes ive ever had the pleasure of looking into i dont think a twelveyear age difference is too much do you kathleen three months later when she was graduated they were married and came to live in the house john had inherited from his parents im pretty attached to it kathleen but maybe you want something smaller john i was raised in a threeroom apartment in queens i slept on a daybed in the living room i love this house besides being so much in love they were good friends shed told him about her recurring nightmare it started when i was eight years old my father had been in the hospital recovering from a heart attack and then he had a second attack the old man in the room with him kept buzzing for the nurse but no one came by the time someone finally got there it was too late in my nightmare im in a hospital going from bed to bed looking for daddy i keep seeing people i know asleep in the beds finally i see a nurse and run up to her and ask her where daddy is she smiles and says oh hes dead all these people are dead youre going to die in here too you poor kid oh john i missed him so much i was always such a daddys girl all through school i kept thinking what fun it would be if he were at the plays and the graduations kathleen darling im going to uproot that sadness in you you already have judge theyd spent their honeymoon traveling through italy johns pain had begun on that trip hed had a checkup a month after they got home the overnight stay at mount sinai hospital stretched into three days of additional tests then one evening hed been waiting for her at the elevator a wan smile on his face he said weve got trouble darling back in his room hed told her its a malignant tumor both lungs apparently it seemed incredible judge demaio not thirtyeight years old had been condemned to an indeterminate sentence of six months to life for him there would be no parole no appeal knowing their time was slipping away they made every minute count but the cancer spread and the pain got steadily worse hed go to the hospital for chemotherapy her nightmare began again it came regularly toward the end he said im glad molly and bill live nearby theyll look out for you and you enjoy the children theyd both been silent then bill kennedy was an orthopedic surgeon he and molly lived two towns away in chapin river and had six kids john had bragged that he and katie would beat bill and mollys record well have seven hed declared the last time he went in for chemotherapy he was so weak they had him stay overnight he was talking to her when he slipped into a coma he died that night the next week katie applied to the prosecutors office for a job and was accepted the office was chronically shorthanded and she always had more cases than she could reasonably handle it was good therapy there was no time for introspection shed kept the house although it seemed silly for a young woman to own a large home surrounded by five acres youll never put your life with john behind you until you sell it bill had told her he was probably right now katie shook herself and got up from the couch shed better call molly and tell her about the accident maybe molly would come over for lunch and cheer her up glancing into the mirror over the couch katie saw that a bruise under her right eye was turning a brilliant purple her olive complexion was a sickly yellow her collarlength dark brown hair which usually bounced full and luxuriant in a natural wave was matted against her face and neck after she talked to molly shed bathe and change before she could pick up the phone it began to ring it was richard carroll the medical examiner katie how are you just heard that you were in some kind of accident last night nothing much i took a little detour off the road the trouble is there was a tree in the way why the blazes didnt you call me richards concern was both flattering and threatening he and mollys husband were good friends several times molly had pointedly invited katie and richard to small dinner parties but katie wasnt looking to get involved especially with someone she worked with next time i run into a tree ill remember she said youre going to take a couple of days off arent you oh no im going to see if mollys free for lunch then ill go in to the office im trying a case on friday theres no use telling you youre crazy okay gotta go ill poke my head in your office around five thirty and catch you for a drink then dinner he hung up before she could reply katie dialed mollys number when her sister answered her voice was shaken katie i guess youve heard about it people from your office are just getting there heard about what getting where next door the lewises that couple who moved in last summer that poor man he came home and found his wife vangie shes killed herself katie she was six months pregnant the lewises katie had met them at molly and bills new years day open house vangie a very pretty blonde chris an airline pilot numbly she heard mollys shocked voice katie why would a girl who wanted a baby so desperately kill herself the question hung in the air cold chills washed over katie last nights nightmare the face shed glimpsed through the hospital window was vangie lewis richard carroll parked his car within the police lines on winding brook lane he was shocked to realize that the lewises lived next door to bill and molly kennedy bill had been a resident when richard interned at st vincents later hed specialized in forensic medicine bill in orthopedics they had bumped into each other in the valley county courthouse when bill was appearing as a witness in a malpractice trial and their friendship was revived now they golfed together frequently and richard often stopped at the kennedy house for a drink hed met mollys sister katie demaio in the prosecutors office and had been immediately attracted to the dedicated young attorney with her dark hair and intense blue eyes katie had subtly discouraged him and hed tried to dismiss her from his thoughts but in the past few months hed seen her at a couple of parties at bill and mollys and had found that he was far more intrigued by katie demaio than he wanted to be richard shrugged he was here on business it was his job to look for any medical signs that might indicate vangie lewis had not taken her own life later in the day hed perform an autopsy a young cop from chapin river let him in a man in an airline captains uniform was sitting in the living room clasping and unclasping his hands he was pale and trembling richard felt a twinge of sympathy some brutal kick to come home and find your wife a suicide which way he asked the cop back here he nodded to the rear of the house shes in the master bedroom in death vangie lewis was not a pretty sight the long blond hair seemed a muddy brown now her face was contorted her coat was buttoned and the soles of her shoes were barely showing under a long flowered caftan richard pulled the caftan up past her ankles the sides of her right shoe bit into the flesh of her swollen foot expertly he picked up one arm held it for an instant let it drop he studied the mottled discoloration where the poison had burned her mouth charley nugent the detective in charge of the homicide squad was beside him how long you figure anywhere from twelve to fifteen hours shes pretty rigid richards voice was noncommittal but his sense of harmony was disturbed coat on shoes on had she just come home or had she been planning to go out the tumbler was beside her on the bed bending down he sniffed itthe unmistakable bitteralmond scent of cyanide he straightened up did she leave a note charley shook his head no letters no nothing been married ten years to the pilot he seems pretty broken up theyre from minneapolis moved east less than a year ago she always wanted to have a baby finally got pregnant and was in heaven starts decorating a nursery talks baby morning noon and night then she kills it and herself her husband says lately shes been afraid she was going to lose the baby other times shed act scared about giving birth apparently she was showing signs of a toxic pregnancy and rather than give birth or face losing the baby she kills herself richards tone was skeptical he could tell charley wasnt buying it either who found her he asked the husband he just got in from a flight richard stared at the burn marks around vangie lewis mouth she must have really splashed that in he said or maybe tried to spit it out can we bring the husband in here sure charley nodded to the young cop at the bedroom door when christopher lewis came in he looked sick his complexion was now green perspiration beaded his forehead he had pulled open his shirt and tie richard studied him appraisingly lewis looked distraught nervous but not like a man whose life has just been shattered charley questioned him captain this is tough for you but we wont be long when was the last time you saw your wife two nights ago i was on a run to the coast and you arrived home at what time about an hour ago did you speak with your wife in those two days no what was your wifes mental state when you left i told you vangie was worried that she might miscarry shed become quite heavy and she was retaining fluid did you call her obstetrician to discuss this with him no all right captain lewis will you look around this room and see if you notice anything amiss it isnt easy but will you study your wifes body carefully and see if theres anything that in some way is different chris obeyed his face going white as he looked at every detail of his dead wifes appearance through narrowed eyes charley and richard watched him no he whispered finally nothing charleys manner became brisk okay as soon as we take some pictures well remove your wifes body for an autopsy i have some calls to make lewis said vangies father and mother theyll be heartbroken ill phone them from the den after hed left richard and charley exchanged glances he saw something we missed charley said flatly richard nodded grimly i know chapter three before shed hung up katie had told molly about the accident and invited her over for lunch but mollys twelveyearold jennifer and her sixyearold twin boys were home from school recovering from flu she would pick up katie and bring her back to her own house while she waited katie bathed quickly then put on a red wool sweater and tweed slacks as she got herself ready she tried to rationalize last nights hallucination had she even been at the window or was that part of the dream it had seemed so real the trunk light had shone directly on the staring eyes the long hair the higharched eyebrows what frightened her was the clarity of the image would she tell molly about it of course not molly had been worried about her lately katie youre too pale you work too hard youre getting too quiet molly had bullied her into the operation scheduled for saturday you cant let that hemorrhaging condition go on indefinitely it can be dangerous from outside a horn blew loudly as molly pulled up in her battered station wagon katie struggled into a warm beaver jacket and hurried out as fast as her swollen knees would allow molly pushed open the car door and eyed her critically youre not exactly blooming how badly were you hurt it could have been a lot worse the car smelled vaguely of peanut butter and bubble gum it was a comforting familiar smell and katie felt her spirits lift but the mood was broken when molly said our block is some mess your people have the lewis place blocked off and some detective from your office is going around asking questions big guy beefy face nice phil cunningham hes a good man what kind of questions pretty routine had we noticed what time she left or got backthat kind of thing we hadnt of course they were approaching the turn to winding brook lane katie bit her lip molly drop me off at the lewis house wont you molly looked at her astonished why katie tried to smile well im an assistant prosecutor and adviser to the chapin river police department as long as im here i think i should go in the hearse from the medical examiners office was just backing into the driveway of the lewis home richard stood in the doorway watching he came over to the car when molly pulled up quickly molly explained katies having lunch with me and thought she should stop by here why dont you come over with her if you can he agreed and helped katie out of the car im glad youre here he said theres something about this setup i dont like now that she was about to see the dead woman katie felt her mouth go dry she remembered the face in her dream the husband is in the den richard said in the bedroom katie forced herself to look at the face she recognized it instantly she shuddered and closed her eyes you all right katie richard asked sharply im fine id like to talk to captain lewis now when they got to the den the door was closed without knock ing richard opened it quietly chris lewis was on the phone his back to them his voice was low but distinct i know its incredible but i swear to you joan she didnt know about us richard closed the door noiselessly he and katie stared at each other katie said im going to recommend that we launch a full investigation ill do the autopsy as soon as they bring her in richard said come on lets make the stop at mollys a quick one mollys house like her car was a haven of normality the smell of good food cooking the blare of the television set the kids shouting when katie went there it was like reentering the real world especially after a day of dealing with murderers muggers vandals and crooks the twins came whooping up to greet them did you see all the cop cars katie something happened next door peter older than his twin by ten minutes was always the spokesman next door john echoed molly called them pete and repeat get lost you two she ordered wheres jennifer katie asked shes in bed poor kid still feels lousy they settled at the kitchen table molly produced corned beef sandwiches and poured coffee but when katie tried to eat she found her throat was closed she glanced at richard he was eating with obvious pleasure she envied him his detachment on one level he could enjoy a good sandwich on the other she was sure that he was concentrating on the lewis case his forehead was knitted his thatch of brown hair looked ruffled his bluegray eyes were thoughtful shed have bet they were both pondering the same question who had been on the phone with chris lewis she remembered the only conversation shed had with the airline captain it had been at mollys new years party and hed been interesting intelligent pleasant with his rugged good looks he was very appealing she also remembered that hed been unenthused when she congratulated him on the coming baby molly what was your impression of the lewises marriage she asked molly looked troubled i think it was on the rocks whenever they were here she kept yanking the conversation back to babies and he was upset about it since i had a hand in the pregnancy it was a real worry for me richard looked up you had what i mean well you know me katie the day they moved in last summer i went rushing over and invited them to dinner right away vangie told me how much she wanted a baby and i told her about liz berkeley she never was able to conceive until she went to a gynecologist whos something of a fertility expert liz had just given birth to a little girl so i told vangie about dr highley she went to him and a few months later she conceived dr highley katie looked startled molly nodded yes the one whos going to katie shook her head and mollys voice trailed off edna burns liked her job she was receptionistbookkeeper for the two doctors on the westlake maternity concept team dr edgar highley was a gynecologistobstetrician as edna told her friends its a riot to see the way his patients act when they finally get pregnant so happy youd think they invented kids he charges plenty but hes a miracle worker on the other hand highley is also the man to see if youve got an internal problem that you dont want to grow if you know what i mean dr jiro fukhito was the psychiatrist on the team the westlake maternity concept was one of holistic medicine it was based on the idea that mind and body must be in harmony to achieve a successful pregnancy edna enjoyed telling her friends that the westlake concept had been dreamed up by old dr westlake who had died before he could act on it then eight years ago his daughter winifred had married dr highley bought the river falls clinic renamed it for her father and set up her husband there she and the doctor were crazy about each other edna would sigh she was ten years older than he and nothing to look at but they were real lovers it was some shock when she died no one ever knew her heart was that bad but shed say philosophically he keeps busy ive seen women who never were able to conceive become pregnant two and three times of course a lot of them dont carry the babies to term but at least they know theres a chance you can read about it yourself shed add newsmaker magazine is doing an article about him they photographed him last week in his office and if you think were busy now wait till that article comes out edna was a born bookkeeper dr highley always complimented her on the excellent records she maintained the only time he gave her the rough side of his tongue was once when he overheard her talking to one patient about anothers problems he had finished by saying any more talking and youre through edna sighed she was tired last night both doctors had had evening hours and it had been hectic now while it was quiet shed check the calendar to make sure shed made all the necessary future appointments she had been told by dr highley that she was to make followup appointments with people as they left frowning she leaned her broad freckled face on a thick hand she was an overweight woman of fortyfour who looked ten years older her youth had been spent taking care of aging parents when edna looked back at pictures of herself from secretarial school she was always surprised at what a pretty girl shed once been a mite too heavy but pretty nevertheless her mind was only half on the page she was reading then something triggered her full attention last night the eightoclock appointment vangie lewis had with dr fukhito vangie had come in early and sat talking with edna she was sure upset vangie had put on a lot of weight during the pregnancy she really wasnt well last month shed started wearing moccasins because her other shoes didnt fit anymore shed shown them to edna look at this my right foot is so swollen i can only wear these clodhoppers my cleaning woman left behind the left one is always falling off edna had tried to kid her well with those glass slippers ill just have to start calling you cinderella well call your husband prince charming vangie was nuts about her husband but vangie had just pouted and said impatiently prince charming was sleeping beautys boy friend not cinderellas edna had just laughed never mindbefore you know it youll have your baby and be back in pretty shoes again last night vangie had pulled up that long caftan shed started wearing to hide her swollen leg edna shed said now i can hardly even get this clodhopper on and for what for what shed been almost crying oh youre just down in the dumps edna had said good thing you came in to talk to dr fukhito hell relax you just then dr fukhito had buzzed and asked her to send in mrs lewis as vangie started down the corridor to his office she stumbled shed walked right out of that loose left shoe oh to hell with it she cried and just kept going edna had picked up the moccasin figuring vangie would come back for it when she finished with dr fukhito but when edna was ready to go home around nine oclock vangie still hadnt come back edna decided to ring dr fukhito and tell him she had the shoe but there was no answer vangie must have left by the door that led directly to the parking lot that was crazy shed catch her death of cold getting her foot wet irresolutely edna had held the moccasin in her hand and locked up she went out to the parking lot toward her own car just in time to see vangies big red lincoln continental pull out with dr highley at the wheel shed run a few steps to wave to him but it was no use so shed just gone home now checking her calendar she wondered if dr highley had already made a new appointment with vangie she decided to phone her just to be sure she dialed the number the lewis phone rang once twice a man answered lewises residence mrs lewis please this is dr highleys office we want to set up mrs lewis next appointment hold on she heard muffled voices talking what could be going on the voice returned this is detective cunningham of the valley county prosecutors office im sorry but mrs lewis has died suddenly you can tell her doctor that someone on our staff will contact him tomorrow mrs lewis died ednas voice was a howl of dismay oh what happened it seems she took her own life the connection was broken slowly edna lowered the receiver it just wasnt possible the twooclock appointments arrived together mrs volmer for dr highley mrs lashley for dr fukhito are you all right edna mrs volmer asked curiously edna knew mrs volmer had sometimes talked to vangie in the waiting room it was on the tip of her tongue to tell her she was dead but some instinct warned her to tell dr highley first his onethirty appointment came out he was on the intercom send mrs volmer in edna doctor may i step into your office for a moment please id like to have a word with you certainly he didnt sound very happy about it she hurried down the hall to his office then timidly stepped inside doctor she began youll want to know i just phoned vangie lewis to make an appointment a detective answered and said she killed herself theyre coming to see you tomorrow mrs lewis did what now that she could talk about it ednas words came tumbling out in a torrent she was so upset last night wasnt she doctor she acted like she didnt care about anything but you must know that i thought it was the nicest thing when i saw you drive her home i waved to you but you didnt see me so i guess of all people you know how bad she was edna how many people have you discussed this with there was something in his tone that made her nervous flustered she replied why nobody sir i just heard this minute you did not discuss mrs lewis with mrs volmer or with the detective on the phone no sir edna tomorrow when the police come you and i will tell them everything we know about mrs lewis frame of mind but listen to me now he pointed his finger at her and leaned forward i dont want mrs lewis name mentioned by you to anyoneanyone do you hear her suicide reflects very badly on our hospital how do you think its going to look if it comes out that she was a patient of mine if i hear you have so much as mentioned the lewis case youre finished here is that clear yes sir are you going out with friends tonight you know how you get when you drink edna was close to tears im going home tonight i want to have my wits about me tomorrow when the police talk to me poor little cinderella tears came to her eyes but then she saw the expression on his face angry disgusted edna straightened up dabbed at her eyes ill send mrs volmer in doctor and you dont have to worry she added with dignity i value our hospital i know how much your work means to you and to our patients im not going to say one single word the afternoon was busy she managed to push the thought of vangie to the back of her mind finally at five oclock she could leave warmly wrapped in a leopardspotted fake fur coat she drove home to her apartment in edgeriver six miles away chapter four in the autopsy room of the valley county morgue richard carroll gently removed the fetus from the corpse of vangie lewis it was a boy and he judged that it weighed about two and a half pounds he noted that the amniotic fluid had begun to leak vangie lewis could not have carried this baby much longer she had been in an advanced state of toxemia it was incredible that any doctor had allowed her to progress so far in this condition richard had no doubt that it was the cyanide that had killed the woman shed swallowed a huge gulp of it and her throat and mouth were badly burned the burns on the outside of her mouth richard tried to visualize the moment shed drunk the poison shed started to swallow felt the burning changed her mind tried to spit it out it had run over her lips and chin to him it didnt make sense there were fine white fibers clinging to her black coat they looked as though theyd come from a blanket he was having them analyzed but of course they might have been picked up at any time her body had become so bloated that it looked as though she had just put on any clothes she could find that would cover her except for the shoes they were an incongruous note they were well cut expensive and looked quite new it was unlikely that vangie could have been outdoors on monday in those shoes there were no water spots on them even though the ankles of her panty hose were spattered which suggested that she must have been out come in decided to leave again changed her shoes and then committed suicide that didnt make sense either another thing those shoes were awfully tight particularly on the right foot considering the way she was dressed why bother to put on shoes that will kill you richard straightened up he was just about finished once more he turned to study the fetus suddenly something struck him was it possible it was a hunch he had to check out dave broad was the man for him dave was in charge of prenatal research at mount sinai hed send this fetus to him and ask for an opinion if what he believed was true there was a good reason why chris lewis would have been upset about his wifes pregnancy maybe upset enough to kill her scott myerson the valley county prosecutor had scheduled a fiveoclock meeting in his office for katie richard and the two homicide squad detectives assigned to the lewis suicide katie arrived first as she eased herself into a chair scott looked at her with a hint of a smile he was a small man with a surprisingly deep voice largerimmed glasses a dark neat mustache and meticulously tailored conservative suit made him look more like a banker than a law enforcer now he observed katies bandaged arm and the bruise under her eye thanks for coming in katie he said if you start feeling rotten youd better go home then he became businesshke the lewis case what have we got on it while she was talking richard came in with charley nugent and phil cunningham silently they settled in the remaining chairs scott listened to katie then turned to the detectives what did you come up with phil cunningham pulled out his notebook that place was no honeymoon cottage the neighbors liked chris lewis but they thought vangie was a pain in the neck at parties she was always hanging on him got upset if he talked more than five minutes to another woman then when she got pregnant she was really insufferable talked baby all the time charley opened his notebook her obstetricians office called to make an appointment i said wed talk to her doctor tomorrow richard spoke quietly there are a few questions id like to ask that doctor about vangie lewis condition scott looked at richard youve finished the autopsy yes it was definitely cyanide she died instantly which leads to the crucial point there were some paper cups and a water pitcher on top of the file cabinet walking over to the file richard poured a generous amount of water into a cup suppose this is filled with dissolved cyanide he said i take a large gulp quickly he swallowed he held up the paper cup it was still nearly half full in my judgment vangie lewis must have drunk at least the approximately three ounces i just swallowed in order to have the amount of cyanide we found in her system but heres the problem the outside of her lips and chin and even her neck were burned the only way that could have happened would have been if she spit a lot of the stuff out but would she then take another mouthful no way the reaction is instantaneous richard went on to explain his belief that vangie lewis could not have walked comfortably in the shoes that had been laced on her feet while katie listened she visualized vangies face the face she had seen in the dream and the face shed seen on the bed slid back and forth in her mind she forced her attention back to the room charley was saying richard and i feel the husband noticed something about the body that he didnt tell us i think it was the shoes richard said katie turned to scott i told you about the phone call chris lewis made you did scott myerson leaned back in his chair all right you twohe pointed to charley and philfind out everything you can about lewis see who this joan is find out what time his plane came in this morning check on phone calls vangie lewis made the last few days katie try to see mrs lewis doctor and get his opinion of her mental and physical condition i can tell you about her physical condition richard said if she hadnt delivered that baby soon she could have saved her cyanide theres another thing where did she get the cyanide no trace of it in the house charley reported not a drop anything else scott asked there may be richard said but its so far out give me another twentyfour hours then i may have something scott stood up i believe we all agree were not closing this as a suicide he looked at richard is there any chance that she died somewhere else and was put back on her bed richard frowned its possible katie started to get up i know its insane but she felt richards arm steadying her you sure look stiff he interrupted shed been about to describe the crazy dream shed had in the hospital his voice snapped her back to reality what a fool shed have appeared to them gratefully she smiled at richard stiff in the head mostly i think she commented he could not let edna destroy everything hed worked for his hands gripped the wheel he could feel them trembling he had to calm down it was ironic that she of all people had seen him drive the lincoln out of the parking lot obviously shed assumed that vangie was with him the minute she told her story to the police everything would be over edna had to be silenced his medical bag was on the seat next to him in it he had put the paperweight from his office desk he didnt usually carry a bag anymore but hed taken it out this morning planning to put the moccasins in it hed intended to drive into new york for dinner and leave them in separate litter cans but this morning his housekeeper hilda had come in early shed stood talking to him while he put on his tweed overcoat hed had no chance to transfer the moccasins from his burberry to the bag no matter hed get rid of the shoes tomorrow night it was a stroke of luck that edna lived quite near the hospital several times hed dropped off work for her when she was laid up with sciatica that was why he knew her apartment hed make it look like a murder committed during a felony take her wallet grab any bits of jewelry she had once when hed left some work at her place shed shown him a butterflyshaped pin with a minuscule ruby and her mothers engagement ring with a dot of a diamond in it she kept them in a plastic jewelry box in the nighttable drawer he thought about the apartment how would he get in did he dare ring the bell suppose she wasnt alone but she would be alone he was sure of it she was going home to drink he could tell thats why he waited a few hours before coming so that shed be drunk watching her from the corridor hed seen how agitated she was obviously filled with the stories she wanted to tell to the police tomorrow he was driving into her apartment area she lived on the ground floor at the end of her building thick bushes and a rusting chain link fence separated the complex from a steep ravine that dropped down a dozen feet and terminated in railroad tracks ednas bedroom window backed onto the parking lot by now she must be very drunk he could go in and out by the window that would lend credence to a burglary he parked his car then pulled on his surgical gloves he put the paperweight in his coat pocket and slid cautiously out closing the door noiselessly ednas bedroom shade was pulled down most of the way but she had a plant in the window the shade rested on the top of the plant and he could see in clearly the room was partially lighted by a fixture in the hall the window was open a crack she must be in the living room he could hear the faint sound of a television program glancing about to make sure that the area was deserted he raised the window pulled up the shade carefully lifted the plant out onto the ground he hoisted himself up to the sill he was inside in the dim light he observed the virginal tidiness the crucifix over the bed the lace runner on the dresser now for the part he detested he felt for the paperweight in his pocket and began to tiptoe down the short hall past the bathroom to the living room cautiously he peered in the television set was on but the room was empty he heard the sound of a chair creaking she must be at the table in the dinette with infinite care he moved into the living room this was the moment if she saw him and screamed but her back was to him wearing a woolly blue robe she sat slumped at the table one hand next to a cocktail glass the other in her lap a tall pitcher was almost empty her head was on her chest she must be asleep quickly he appraised the situation his eye fell on the hissing radiator to the right of the door it was the oldfashioned kind with sharp exposed pipes was it possible he didnt need the paperweight after all maybe edna he whispered softly as he came around the table wha she looked up at him with bleary eyes confused she began to rise twisting in her chair doctor a mighty shove sent her smashing backward her head cracked against the radiator blinding lights exploded in her brain oh the pain the pain edna sighed floated into darkness he jumped clear of the spattered blood as he watched the pulse in her throat flickered and stopped he bent over her carefully she had stopped breathing he slipped the paperweight back into his pocket he wouldnt need it now he wouldnt have to bother robbing her it would look as though shed fallen quickly retracing his steps he went back into the bedroom he scanned the parking area then stepped out the window replaced the plant pulled down the shade and closed the window to the exact place where edna had had it as he did he heard the persistent chiming of a doorbellher doorbell frantically he ran back to his car he started the engine and drove out of the apartment complex not turning on his headlights until he approached route who was standing on ednas doorstep it had been close so terribly close adrenaline pounded through his veins now there was only one threat left katie demaio he would begin to remove that threat at once her accident had given him the excuse he needed to start medication it was a matter of hospital record that her blood count was low he would order another transfusion for her on the pretense of building her up for the operation he would give her large doses of coumadin pills to shortcircuit her bloodclotting mechanism and negate the benefits of the transfusion by friday when she came to the hospital for surgery shed be on the verge of hemorrhaging the surgery would then be very dangerous and he would make it even worse by giving her heparin another anticoagulant the initial low blood count the coumadin and the heparin would be as effective on katie demaio as the cyanide had been on vangie lewis after the meeting in scott myersons office richard drove katie to a rustic restaurant perched precariously on the palisades the small dining room was warmed by a blazing fire and lighted by candles the proprietor obviously knew richard well dr carroll a pleasure he said as he guided them to the table in front of the fireplace richard ordered a bottle of wine a waiter produced hot garlic bread they sat in companionable silence sipping and nibbling richard was a big man with a wholesome look a thick crop of dark brown hair strong even features and broad rangy shoulders do you know ive been wanting to ask you out for months he said but you release a donotdisturb signal why i dont believe in going out with anyone i work with i can understand that but thats not what were talking about we enjoy each others company we both know it and youre having none of it heres the menu his manner changed became brisk lentrecote and steak au poivre are the specialties here he told her when she hesitated he suggested try the steak au poivre its fantastic he ordered salads and baked potatoes then leaned back and studied her are you having none of it katie the salad the steak all right im not being fair im trying to pin you down and youre a captive audience but tell me what you do when youre not at the office or your sisters i know you ski yes i rent a condominium in vermont with some friends maybe youll invite me up sometime with you he did not wait for an answer sailing is my sport i took my boat to the caribbean last spring heres your steak they lingered over coffee by then richard had told her about himself i was engaged during med school to the girl next door what happened katie asked we kept postponing the wedding jean was a very nice girl but there was something missing no regrets no second thoughts katie asked not really that was seven years ago im a little surprised that the something missing didnt turn up long before now he did not seem to expect her to comment instead he began to talk about the lewis case it makes me so angry the waste of life vangie lewis had a lot of years ahead of her youre convinced it wasnt a suicide ill need much more information before i pass judgment i dont see chris lewis as a murderer its too easy to get a divorce today if you want to be free theres another angle to that richard pressed his lips together lets hold off talking about it it was nearly ten thirty when they turned into katies driveway richard looked quizzically at the handsome fieldstone house how big is this place he asked how many rooms twelve katie said reluctantly it was johns house richard did not give her the chance to say good night at the door taking the key from her hand he unlocked it and followed her in im not going to stay but i do admit to an overwhelming curiosity as to where you keep yourself she turned on some lights and watched somewhat resentfully as he looked over the foyer then the living room he whistled very nice he studied johns portrait i hear he was quite a guy yes he was how long were you married katie one year he watched as a look of pain flickered over her face when did you find out that he was sick shortly after we got back from our honeymoon and ever since its been a deathwatch sorry katie my job makes me too blunt for my own good ill take off now he hesitated dont you draw these drapes when youre alone here she shrugged why no ones going to come barging in on me you of all people should be aware of the number of home burglaries do you mind he went to the window and pulled the draperies shut see you tomorrow how will you get to work the servicestation people are going to lend me a car theyll drop it off in the morning okay for a moment he stood with his hand on the knob of the door then in a highly credible brogue said ill be leavin ye katie scarlett lock your door now i wouldnt want anyone tryin to break into tara he bent down kissed her cheek and was gone smiling katie closed the door the clock chimed musically after richards bearwarm presence the room seemed hollow quickly she turned out the lights and went upstairs the phone rang just as she got into bed mrs demaio it was a mans voice yes this is dr highley i hope im not calling too late but ive tried several times to reach you this evening the fact that you were in an accident and were in our hospital overnight has come to my attention how are you feeling quite well doctor how nice of you to call how is the bleeding problem im afraid its about the same well it will all be behind you by this time next week but i do want you to have another transfusion to build you up for the surgery and i also want you to start in on some pills can you come to the hospital tomorrow afternoon yes as a matter of fact i was planning to come anyhow youve heard about mrs lewis i have a terrible situation id like to discuss her emotional and physical states with you fine call in the morning to arrange a time thank you doctor katie said as she hung up she reflected that dr highley hadnt really appealed to her at first because of his aloof attitude it shows how you can misjudge people she decided chapter five bill kennedy rang the bell of the lewis house tall prematurely white and scholarly bill was an orthopedic surgeon at lenox hill hospital he had not heard about vangie lewis death until he returned home briefly molly had told him about it i called and asked chris to come to dinner he doesnt want to but you go drag him here as he walked between the houses bill considered what a shock it would be to come home and find he had lost molly but no one in his right mind could think that the lewises marriage had been anything like his and mollys bill had never told molly that one morning when he was having coffee at a drugstore in manhattan hed seen chris with a very pretty girl in her early twenties chris lewis opened the door and bill saw the sadness in his eyes he gripped the younger mans arm im terribly sorry chris nodded woodenly the meaning of the day was sinking in on him vangie was dead had their quarrel driven her to kill herself he felt lonely frightened and guilty he allowed bill to persuade him to come to dinner numbly reaching for a jacket he followed bill down the street bill poured him a double scotch chris gulped it calm down he thought calm down be careful the kennedy kids came into the den to say good night nice kids all of them well behaved too chris had always wanted children but not vangies now his unborn child had died another guilt his child and he hadnt wanted it and vangie had known it what had who had driven her to kill herself who that was the question because vangie hadnt been alone last night he hadnt told the police they would start an investigation and where would that lead to joan to him the motel clerk in new york had seen him leave last night hed gone home to have it out with vangie let me go please i cant spend any more of my life with you its destroying both of us hed arrived at the house sometime after midnight hed driven in and the minute he opened the garage door he knew something was up because shed parked the lincoln in his space no someone else had parked her car in his space vangie always used the wider side of the garage and she needed every inch she was a lousy driver but last night the lincoln had been expertly parked in his spot on the narrower side hed gone in and found the house empty vangies handbag was on the chaise in their room hed been puzzled but not alarmed obviously shed gone off with a girl friend to stay overnight taking a suitcase and leaving her heavy purse behind the house had depressed chris hed decided to go back to the motel and then this morning hed found vangie dead somebody had parked the car for her before midnight somebody had driven her home after midnight and those shoes the one day shed worn them shed complained endlessly about how the right shoe dug into her ankle for weeks now shed worn nothing but those dirty moccasins where were they chris had searched the house thoroughly whoever had driven her home might know he hadnt told the police any of this he hadnt wanted to involve joan besides maybe the shoes really werent that important vangie might have wanted to be fully dressed when she was found that swollen leg embarrassed her but he should have told the cops about his having been here about the way the car was parked chris come into the dining room youll feel better if you eat something mollys voice was gentle wearily chris brushed a hand over burning eyes ill have something molly he said but ill have to leave pretty quickly the funeral director is coming to the house for vangies clothes when is the funeral bill asked the coffin will be flown to minneapolis tomorrow afternoon and the service will be the next day the words hammered in his ears coffin funeral oh vangie he thought i wanted to be free of you but i didnt want you to die at eight he went back to his house at eight thirty when the funeral director came he had a suitcase ready with underwear and the flowing caftan vangies parents had sent her for christmas the funeral director was quietly sympathetic he requested the necessary information quickly born april he jotted down the year died february just two months short of her thirtyfirst birthday he commented chris rubbed the ache between his eyes something was wrong no he said todays the sixteenth not the fifteenth the death certificate clearly states that mrs lewis died be tween eight and ten last night february fifteenth the man said youre thinking the sixteenth because you found her this morning but the medical examiner pinpointed the time of death chris stared at him waves of shock swept over him he had been home at midnight and the car and vangies purse had been here hed assumed that vangie had come in and killed herself sometime after he drove back to new york but at midnight shed been dead two to four hours that meant that after hed left someone had brought her body here put it on the bed and laid the empty glass beside it someone had wanted to make it seem that vangie had committed suicide oh lord chris whispered at the last moment vangie must have known someone had forced that poison into her viciously killed her and the baby she was carrying he had to tell the police and there was one person they would inevitably accuse as the funeral director stared at him chris said aloud theyre going to blame it on me dr highley hung up the phone slowly katie demaio suspected nothing her office apparently wanted nothing more of him than to discuss vangie lewis emotional state unless of course someone had questioned vangies apparent suicide perhaps raised the possibility that her body had been moved the danger was still great he was in the library of the westlake homehis home now the house was a manorlike tudor with archways marble fireplaces and tiffany stainedglass windows the westlake house the westlake hospital the westlake maternity concept the name had given him immediate entree socially and professionally marrying winifred westlake and coming to america to carry on her fathers work had been a perfect excuse for leaving england no one including winifred knew about the years before liverpool the years at christ hospital in devon toward the end she had started to ask questions it was nearly eleven oclock and he hadnt had dinner yet knowing what he was going to do to edna had robbed him of the desire to eat but now that it was over he craved food he went into the kitchen hilda had left dinner for him in the microwave ovena cornish hen with wild rice he just needed to heat it up because he needed the freedom of the house the privacy of his library hed gotten rid of winifreds livein housekeeper she had looked at him with sour sullen eyes swollen with weeping miss winifred was almost never sick until she was going to say until she married you but she didnt finish winifreds cousin resented him too he had tried to make trouble after winifreds death but couldnt prove anything theyd dismissed the cousin as a disgruntled exheir selecting a chilled bottle of wine from the refrigerator highley sat down to eat in the breakfast room as he ate his mind ran over the exact dosage he would give katie demaio traces of the heparin and the coumadin might show in her bloodstream if there were a thorough autopsy but he could circumvent that before going to bed he went out to the foyer closet hed get those moccasins safely into his bag now reaching into one pocket of the burberry he pulled out a misshapen moccasin expectantly he put his free hand in the other pocketfirst matteroffactly then rummaging frantically finally he pawed through the overshoes stacked on the closet floor at last he stood up staring at the battered moccasin he was holding the right one the one he had tugged off vangies right foot hysterically he began to laugh somehow in the dark the moccasin had fallen out of his pocket the one hed found after crawling around in the parking lot like a dog was the one hed already had somewhere the left moccasin that vangie lewis had been wearing was waiting to trace her footsteps back to him katie had set the clock radio for six am but she was wide awake long before her sleep had been troubled several times shed almost started to jump up frightened by a vague worrisome dream shivering she adjusted the thermostat then ran to the kitchen quickly made coffee and took a cup back upstairs to bed propped against the pillows the comforter wrapped around her she eagerly sipped as the heat of the cup warmed her fingers thats better she murmured now whats the matter with me she glanced into the mirror of the antique mahogany dresser opposite the bed her hair was tousled the bruise under her eye was now purple tinged with yellow her eyes were swollen with sleep i look like something the cat dragged in she reflected but it was more than the way she looked it was a heavy feeling of apprehension had she dreamed that queer frightening nightmare again she couldnt be sure vangie lewis it seemed impossible that anyone would choose to kill her by forcing cyanide down her throat she simply didnt believe chris lewis was capable of that kind of violence she thought of dr highleys call that damn operation well at least she was getting it over with check in friday night operation saturday home sunday at work monday no big deal as she sipped her coffee she glanced instinctively at johns picture a handsome gravelooking man with gentle penetrating eyes maybe richard was right maybe she was keeping a deathwatch john would be the first one to blast her for that a hot shower picked up her spirits she had a pleabargaining session scheduled for nine a sentencing at ten and fridays trial to prepare for id better get a move on she thought she dressed quickly selecting a soft brown wool skirt and a turquoise silk shirt with long sleeves that covered the bandage on her arm the car from the service station arrived as she finished a second coffee she took the driver back and drove to the office it had been a busy night in the county there had been a drunkendriving accident resulting in four deaths and two armed robberies scott myerson was just coming out of his office lovely night katie observed he nodded look im interested in the psychiatrist vangie lewis was going to id like his opinion of her mental state i can send phil but a woman would be less noticeable over there katie hesitated maybe i can help out dr highley is my gynecologist i actually have an appointment with him today perhaps i could see dr fukhito before or after scotts eyebrows shot up in surprise what do you think of highley richard made some crack yesterday about vangies condition seemed to think that he was taking chances with her katie shook her head i dont agree highleys specialty is difficult pregnancies thats the point he tries to save the babies other doctors lose she thought of his phone call to her i can vouch for the fact that hes a very concerned doctor scott frowned how long have you known him not long my sister molly has a friend who raves about dr highley so i went to see him last month she remembered his words youre quite right to have come hed said i think of the womb as a cradle that must always be kept in good repair the one thing that had surprised her was that he did not have a nurse in attendance during the examination unlike other gynecologists all right scott said talk to highley and the shrink too find out whether or not they think she was capable of suicide see if she talked about her husband charley and phil are checking on chris lewis now talk to the nurses too not the nurses katie smiled the receptionist edna she knows everybodys business i wasnt in the waiting room two minutes before i found myself giving her my life history katie went into her office for her files then rushed to her appointment with a defense attorney about an indicted defendant from there she hurried to a secondfloor courtroom to hear the sentencing of a youth she had prosecuted for armed robbery when she returned she had two messages to call dr carroll she tried to reach him but he was out on a case she phoned dr highleys office fully expecting to hear the nasal warmth of ednas voice but whoever answered was a stranger doctors offices katie decided to ask for edna is miss burns there she called in sick today im mrs fitzgerald katie realized then how much she had counted on talking to edna briefly she explained that dr highley expected her to call for an appointment and that shed also like to see dr fukhito mrs fitzgerald put her on hold a few minutes and then said dr fukhito is free at a quarter to four dr highley would prefer three oclock if it is convenient katie confirmed the appointments then turned to the work on her desk at lunchtime maureen crowley one of the office secretaries popped her head in and offered to bring katie a sandwich deep in preparation for fridays trial katie nodded ham on rye with mustard and lettuce maureen said katie looked up surprised am i that predictable the girl was about nineteen with a mane of redgold hair emeraldgreen eyes and a lovely pale complexion katie about food youre in a rut the door closed behind her youre on a deathwatch youre in a rut katie was astonished to realize she was close to tears i must be sick if im getting this thinskinned she thought when the lunch arrived she ate it only vaguely aware of what she was having vangie lewis face was constantly before her but why had she seen it in a nightmare chapter six richard carroll was in his office just after nine twice he tried phoning katie hoping to catch her between court sessions he wanted to hear the sound of her voice for some reason hed felt edgy about leaving her alone in that big house last night why did he have a hunch that something was troubling her he went out on a case when he returned to his office at four thirty he was absurdly pleased to see that katie had returned his calls quickly he phoned her but the switchboard operator said that she had left for the day that meant he wouldnt get to talk to her today he was having dinner in new york with clovis simmons a tv actress clovis was fun but the signs were that she was getting serious richard made a resolve this was the last time hed take clovis out it wasnt fair to her refusing to consider the reason for that sudden decision he turned his thoughts again to the lewis case he had not been exaggerating when hed said that if vangie lewis had not delivered her baby soon she wouldnt have needed cyanide how many women got into that same condition under the westlake maternity concept had there been anything unusual about the ratio of deaths among westlakes patients richard asked his secretary to come in marge was in her midfifties an excellent secretary who thoroughly enjoyed the drama of the department marge he said i want to do some unofficial investigating of westlake hospitals maternity section id like to know how many patients died either in childbirth or from complications during pregnancy i also want to know the ratio of deaths to the number of patients treated there do you know anybody at westlake who might look at the hospital records for you on the quiet his secretary frowned let me work on it good and check into any malpractice suits that have been filed against either of the doctors satisfied at getting the investigation under way richard dashed home to shower and change seconds after he left his office a call came for him from dr david broad at mount sinai hospital marge took the message asking richard to contact dr broad in the morning the matter was urgent katie was a few minutes early for her appointment with dr highley the other receptionist mrs fitzgerald was coolly pleasant but when katie asked about ednas illness the woman seemed nervous its just a virus she replied stiffly a buzzer sounded the receptionist picked up the phone mrs demaio dr highley will see you now she said katie walked quickly down the corridor to dr highleys office she knocked then opened the door and stepped inside the office had the air of a comfortable study bookshelves lined one wall pictures of mothers with babies nearly covered another a club chair was placed near the doctors elaborately carved desk the doctor stood up to greet her mrs demaio his tone was courteous the faint british accent barely perceptible his face was round and smoothskinned thinning sandy hair streaked with gray was carefully combed in a side part eyebrows and lashes the same sandy shade accentuated protruding steelgray eyes not an attractive man but authoritative as they sat down katie thanked him for the phone call he dismissed her gratitude if you had told the emergencyroom doctor that you were my patient he would have given you a room in the west wing far more comfortable i assure you and about the same view katie fished in her shoulder bag and took out her notebook and pen she looked up quickly anything would be better than the view i thought i had the other night she stopped she was here on official business not to talk about her nightmares doctor if you dont mind lets talk about vangie lewis she smiled i guess our roles are reversed for a few minutes i get to ask the questions his expression became somber that poor girl ive thought of little else since i heard the news katie nodded when was the last time you saw her he leaned back in the chair his fingers interlocked under his chin it was last thursday evening id been having mrs lewis come in weekly since the halfway point of her pregnancy how was she katie asked physically and emotionally her physical condition was a worry there was danger of toxic pregnancy which i was watching very closely but every additional day she carried increased the babys chance of survival could she have carried the baby to full term impossible in fact i warned mrs lewis last thursday that wed have to bring her in soon and induce labor how did she respond to that news he frowned i expected her to be concerned for the babys life but the closer she came to delivery the more it seemed to me that she was morbidly fearful of giving birth did she show any specific depression dr highley shook his head i did not see it but dr fukhito should answer that he saw her on monday night and hes better trained than i to recognize the symptoms a last question katie said your office is right next to dr fukhitos did you see mrs lewis at any time monday night i did not thank you youve been very helpful she slipped her notebook back into her bag now its your turn to ask questions you answered them last night now when youve finished talking with dr fukhito please go to room youll be given a trans fusion wait about half an hour before driving after youve received it also he reached into the side drawer of his desk and selected a bottle containing a number of pills take one of these tonight then one every four hours tomorrow the same on friday i must stress that this is very important if this operation does not cure your problem we must consider more radical surgery perhaps a hysterectomy ill take the pills katie said good youll be checking in around six oclock friday evening ill look in on you he opened the door for her till friday then mrs demaio he said softly the investigative team of phil cunningham and charley nugent returned to the prosecutors office at four pm exuding the excitement of hounds who have treed their quarry rushing into scotts office they proceeded to lay their findings before him the husbands a liar phil said crisply he wasnt due back till yesterday morning but his plane developed engine trouble the passengers were offloaded in chicago and he and the crew deadheaded back to new york he got in monday evening monday evening scott exploded yeah we talked to his crew on the monday flight lewis gave the purser a ride into manhattan told him his wife was away and he was going to stay in the city overnight and take in a show

records show he brought it back at ten and get this he took off again at midnight and came back at two scott whistled he lied to us about his flight he lied to the purser about his wife he was

joan moore lives on east eightyseventh street her doorman told us that captain lewis drove her home from the airport yesterday morning she left her bag with him and they went for coffee in the

tomorrow after the service find out what plane hes on and invite him here for questioning and i want to talk to miss moore what do you know about her she shares an apartment with two other stewardesses shes planning to switch to pan ams latin american division and fly out of miami shes down there now signing a lease on an apartment shell be back friday afternoon meet her plane too scott said bring her here for a few questions where was she monday night in flight on her way to new york all right he paused something else i want the phone records from the lewis house particularly from the last week see if they had an answering service since hes with an airline and look again for cyanide weve got to find out fast where vangie lewis got the stuff that killed her or where captain lewis got it dr fukhitos office was spacious and bright there was a long writing table graceful canebacked chairs with upholstered seats and a matching chaise a series of exquisite japanese woodcuts decorated the walls dr fukhito was conservatively dressed pinstriped suit light blue shirt blue silk tie his jetblack hair and small neat mustache complemented pale gold skin and brown eyes he was a strikingly handsome man katie thought as she reached for her notebook doctor you saw vangie lewis at about eight oclock monday night how long did she stay about forty minutes she phoned monday afternoon and asked for an appointment she sounded quite distressed i told her to come in at eight why was she so distressed doctor he chose his words carefully she had quarreled with her husband she was convinced he did not love her or want the baby and physically the strain of the pregnancy was beginning to tell on her she was quite immature reallyan only child who had been inordinately spoiled and fussed over the physical discomfort was appalling to her and the prospect of the birth had become frightening his eyes shifted away this man was nervous katie thought what advice had he given vangie that had sent her rushing home to kill herself or had sent her to a killer leaning forward katie said doctor i realize that mrs lewis discussions with you are confidential but we need to know all you can tell us about the quarrel she had with her husband he looked at katie mrs lewis told me that she believed her husband was in love with someone else shed accused him of that shed warned him that when she found out who the woman was shed make her life hell she was angry bitter and frightened what did you tell her i told her that the baby might be the instrument to give her marriage more time she began to calm down but then i felt it necessary to warn her that if her marriage did not improve she should consider the possibility of divorce she became furious she swore that she would never let her husband leave her that i was on his side like everyone else she got up grabbed her coat and left she used my private entrance to go out the back way and you never heard from her again no i see katie got up and walked over to the wall with the pictures dr fukhito was holding something back i was a patient here myself monday night doctor she said i had a minor automobile accident and was brought here around ten oclock can you tell me is there any chance that vangie lewis did not leave the hospital shortly after eight thirty that after i was brought in semiconscious i might have seen her dr fukhito stared at katie i dont see how he said but katie noticed that his knuckles were clenched and white and somethingwas it fury or fearflashed in his eyes chapter seven at five oclock gertrude fitzgerald turned the phone over to the answering service and locked the reception desk nervously she dialed ednas number again there was no answer there was no doubt edna had been drinking more and more lately she was such a good person they had both worked for dr highley for several years and often had lunch together sometimes edna would want to go to a pub for a manhattan gertrude understood her need to drink understood that hollow feeling when all you do is go to work and then go home and stare at four walls gertrude was a widow but at least she had the children and grandchildren to care about her she had her own lonely times but it wasnt the same as it was for edna shed lived she had something to look back on she could swear dr highley had known she was lying when she said edna had called in sick but suppose edna hadnt been drinking suppose she was sick or something shed have to find out shed drive over to her house right now her mind settled gertrude left the office briskly and drove the six miles to ednas apartment she parked in the visitors area and walked around to the front as she neared ednas door she heard the faint sound of voices the television set of course gertrude rang the bell and waited there was no familiar voice calling right with you gertrude firmly pushed the bell again maybe edna was sleeping it off by the time shed rung the bell four times gertrude was thoroughly alarmed something was wrong the superintendent mr krupshak lived across the court hurrying over gertrude told her story the super was eating dinner and looked annoyed but his wife gana reached for the keys ill go with you she said the two women hurried across the courtyard together ednas a real friend gana krupshak volunteered sometimes in the evening i pop in on her just last night i stopped over at about eight i had a manhattan with her and she told me that one of her favorite patients had killed herself well here we are they were on the small porch leading to ednas apartment the superintendents wife inserted the key into the lock twisted it and pushed open the door the two women saw edna at the same moment lying on the floor her legs crumpled under her her graying hair plastered around her face her eyes staring crusted blood making a crimson crown on the top of her head no no gertrudes voice rose high and shrill she pressed her knuckles to her mouth in a dazed voice gana krupshak said its just last night i was sitting here with her and she was talking about a patient who killed herself and then she phoned the womans husband gana began to sob and now poor edna is dead too chris lewis stood next to vangies parents at the right of the coffin numbly acknowledging the sympathetic utterances of friends when hed phoned her parents about her death they had agreed that they would view her body privately and have a memorial service the next morning followed by a private interment instead when hed arrived in minneapolis he found that they had arranged for a public viewing that night so many friends will want to say goodby to our little girl her mother sobbed our little girl if only you had let her grow up chris thought it might all have been so different vangies parents looked old and tired and shattered with grief they were plain hardworking people who had brought up their unexpectedly beautiful child to believe her wish was law would it be easier for them when it was revealed that someone had taken vangies life or did he owe it to them to say nothing to keep that final horror from them he wanted badly to talk to joan shed been so upset when she heard about vangie did she know about us hed finally had to admit to her that vangie suspected he was interested in someone else joan would be back from florida on friday two days away he was going to return to new jersey tomorrow right after the funeral he would say nothing to the police until he had warned joan that she might be dragged into this the police would be looking for a motive for him to kill vangie in their eyes joan would be the motive chris glanced over at the coffin at vangies now peaceful face the quietly folded hands he and vangie had scarcely lived as man and wife in the past few years theyd lain side by side like strangers he emotionally drained from the endless quarreling she wanting to be cajoled babied a suspicion that had been sitting somewhere in his subconscious sprang to life was it possible that vangie had become involved with another man a man who did not want to take responsibility for her and a baby had she confronted that other man hurled hysterical threats at him he realized that he was shaking hands murmuring thanks to a man in his midsixties he was slightly built but sturdily attractive with gray hair and bushy brows over keen penetrating eyes im dr salem he said emmet salem i delivered vangie and was her first gynecologist she was one of the prettiest things i ever brought into this world and she never changed i only wish i hadnt been away when she phoned my office monday chris stared at him vangie phoned you monday yes my nurse said she was quite upset wanted to see me immediately i was teaching a seminar in detroit but the nurse made an appointment for her for today she was planning to fly out yesterday maybe i could have helped her why had vangie called this man chris tried to think what would make her go back to a doctor she hadnt seen in years a doctor thirteen hundred miles away had vangie been ill dr salem was looking at him curiously no not ill chris said as you probably know she was expecting a baby and it was a difficult pregnancy vangie was pregnant the doctor stared in astonishment i know she had just about given up hope but in new jersey she started the westlake maternity concept you may have heard of it or of dr highleydr edgar highley captain lewis may i speak with you privately the funeral director had a hand under his arm excuse me chris said to the doctor he allowed the funeral director to guide him into the office the director closed the door ive just received a call from the prosecutors office in valley county new jersey he said written confirmation is on the way we are forbidden to inter your wifes body it is to be flown back to the medical examiners office in valley county immediately after the service tomorrow they know it wasnt suicide chris thought without answering the funeral director he turned and left he wanted to see dr salem find out what vangie had said to the nurse on the phone but dr salem was already gone vangies mother rubbed swollen eyes with a crumpled handkerchief what did you say to dr salem that made him leave like that she asked why did you upset him so terribly wednesday evening edgar highley arrived home at six oclock hilda was just leaving he knew she liked this job why not a house that stayed neat no mistress to constantly give orders no children to clutter it no children he went into the library poured a scotch and watched from the window as hilda disappeared down the street he had gone into medicine because his own mother had died in childbirth his birth your mother wanted you so much his father had told him again and again she knew she was risking her life but she didnt care sitting in the chemists shop in brighton watching his father prepare prescriptions asking questions what is that what will that pill do why do you put caution labels on those bottles hed gone to medical school finished in the top ten percent of his class hed interned at christ hospital in devon with its magnificent research laboratory hed become a member of staff his reputation as an obstetrician had grown rapidly but his project had been held back by his inability to test it at twentyseven hed married claire a distant cousin of the earl of sussex she was infinitely superior to him in social background but his growing reputation had been the leveler and what incredible ignominy he who dealt in birth and fertility had married a barren woman when had he started to hate claire it took a long timeseven years it was when he realized that her disappointment was faked that shed known all along that she could not conceive impatiently he turned from the window it would be another cold windfilled night when all this was over hed take a vacation he was losing his grip on his nerves he had nearly given himself away this morning when gertrude told him that edna had phoned in sick hed grasped the desk watched his knuckles whiten then hed realized gertrude was covering for her friend the missing shoe this morning hed gone to the hospital soon after dawn and once again searched the parking lot and the office had vangie been wearing it when she came into his office monday night he couldnt be sure the other shoe the right one was still in his bag in the trunk of the car even if the police started an investigation into vangies death there was no evidence against him her file in the office could bear intensive scrutiny all the true records of the special cases were here in the wall safe and he defied anyone to locate that safe it wasnt even in the original plans of the house anyway no one had any reason to suspect himno one except katie demaio fukhito had come in to see him just as he was locking up tonight hed said mrs demaio was asking a lot of questions is it possible that they dont believe mrs lewis committed suicide i really dont know hed enjoyed fukhitos nervousness the interview you gave to that magazine comes out tomorrow yes but i gave them the impression i use a number of psychiatric consultants your name will not appear in the article still its going to put the spotlight on us on yourself isnt that what youre saving doctor hed almost laughed aloud at the troubled guilty look on fukhitos face now finishing his scotch he realized that he had been overlooking another avenue of escape if the police concluded that vangie had been murdered if they did investigate wesdake he could reluctantly suggest that they interrogate dr fukhito especially in view of his past after all fukhito was the last person known to have seen vangie lewis alive chapter eight after leaving dr fukhito katie went to the east wing of the hospital for the transfusion she had a long wait and didnt leave the hospital until nearly six oclock she was hungry and the idea of going home did not appeal to her she thought she had learned to cope with loneliness the feeling of emptiness that had been coming over her lately was something new she passed the restaurant where she and richard had eaten the night before and on impulse swung into the parking area maybe in the warm intimate atmosphere shed be able to think the proprietor recognized her beamed with pleasure and led her to a table near the one she had shared with richard nodding at the suggestion of a glass of burgundy katie leaned back now if she could just sort out the impressions shed received talking with dr highley and dr fukhito taking out her notebook she began to scan what she had jotted down during the interviews dr highley hed explained that vangie lewis was in serious trouble with her pregnancy what he told katie was completely reasonable what then what more did she want of dr highley hed expressed regret over vangies death but certainly not sorrow of course a doctor had to stay objective as shed heard both bill and richard say richard her eyes slid over to the table where theyd sat together was it possible that it could happen twice in a lifetime that from the very beginning you know someone is right when she and richard were leaving mollys after lunch yesterday molly had asked them both to dinner thursday nighttomorrowto meet liz and jim berkeley shes the one who thinks dr highley is god molly had said katie realized how much she was looking forward to that dinner again she looked down at her notes dr fukhito something was wrong there the way hed weighed every word when hed discussed vangies mondaynight visit it had been like watching someone walk step by step through a minefield what was he afraid of he had said vangie left by his private entrance no one had seen her go suppose she hadnt left suppose hed gone with her or followed her home suppose hed realized that she was suicidal that he was responsible in some way the waiter arrived to take her order she made one final entry in her notebook investigate fukhitos background even before he crossed the george washington bridge richard knew that he should have canceled the date with clovis he was preoccupied with vangie lewis death he had missed something in the autopsy what was it and he was worried about katie she had looked so thin and pale last night she wasnt well that accident was it possible that shed been hurt more than anyone realized the thought haunted richard as he turned into east fiftyfourth street and headed for clovis apartment clovis had a pitcher of martinis waiting and a plate of crabmeat puffs fresh from the oven with her flawless skin and viking coloring she reminded richard of a young ingrid bergman until recently hed thought they might end up together but as he returned her kiss he was acutely aware that hed never worry about clovis the way he was now worrying about katie he realized clovis was talking to him as she filled two glasses and i just got home so i fixed the drinks and figured you could relax while i get dressed hey are you listening to me richard accepted the drink and smiled apologetically im sorry do you mind if i make some calls while you get ready go ahead and dial away she picked up her glass and started toward the hall that led into the bedroom and bath richard took out his credit card and dialed the operator he gave his account number and the call went through the phone rang a dozen times before he gave up katie wasnt home next he tried mollys house but molly had not spoken to katie today shell probably call me later but i wish she was home by now she should take it easy it was the opening he needed molly whats the matter with katie there is something wrong physically isnt there besides the accident i mean molly hesitated youd better talk to katie about that cold fear washed over him whats the matter with her oh not much i promise you that but its nothing she wants discussed see you tomorrow night dont forget the connection broke richard frowned into the dead receiver then he called the prosecutor anything going on scott did not waste time on preliminaries the body of a woman was found in an apartment in edgeriver she was the receptionist katie wanted to talk to at westlake names edna burns were heading over there and we need you give me the address bichard said he wrote it quickly and hung up the phone vangie lewis and now edna burns he knocked on clovis bedroom door wrapped in a terrycloth robe she opened it hey whats the hurry clo im sorry quickly he explained he was frantic to get away she was clearly disappointed oh of course i understand go but lets have dinner tomorrow night promise richard temporized well very soon on the way home from the restaurant katie thought about the conversation shed had with edna burns on her first visit to dr highley edna was a bom listener how much had vangie told her and how much did edna know about dr fukhito katie pulled up in front of her house and decided not to put the car away yet suppose she phoned edna and suggested driving over to see her if katie was any judge edna burns would love a chance to have a cup of tea and gossip about vangie lewis inside katie looked up ednas number in the telephone book and quickly dialed it the phone rang once and was picked up a man said yes the short word was delivered in a clipped familiar voice it belonged to charley nugent from the prosecutors office charley its katie what are you doing in ednas apartment shes dead fellor was pushedinto the radiator split her head open his voice became a whisper get this katie she was last seen alive around eight oclock last night a neighbor was with her the neighbor heard her on the phone with chris lewis edna burns told lewis that she was going to talk to the police about vangies death you better come right down after he finished a second scotch highley went into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator he had told hilda not to prepare anything for him tonight but had given her a shopping list lamb chops fresh asparagus and watercress for a salad emotional exhaustion always compelled him to eat after winifreds death hed left her relatives and friends at the grave site refusing invitations to join them for dinner no no i need to be alone then hed driven to the carlyle hotel in new york there he had requested a quiet table and ordered dinner halfway through the meal he looked up and saw winifreds cousin glenn nickerson seated at a table across the room he was dressed in the dark blue suit and black tie hed worn to the funeral it was obvious that he had followed highley to the carlyle nickerson had lifted his glass in a toast a mocking smile on his face he might as well have shouted to the grieving widower a week later alan levine the doctor whod treated winifred indignantly told him that glenn nickerson had asked to see winifreds medical records i told him that winifred had developed classic angina symptoms even then he had the gall to speak to the police i had a call from a fellow in the prosecutors office asking if a heart ailment could be induced i told him that being alive today was enough to induce heart trouble they backed off said it was obviously a disinherited relative trying to cause problems but you can induce heart trouble dr levine you can prepare intimate little dinners for your dear wife you can use her susceptibility to gastroenteritis to bring on attacks that register as heart seizures on her cardiogram after enough of these the lady has a fatal seizure no one suggests an autopsy and even if someone had there would have been little risk but if they had thought to delve into claires death the chops were nearly cooked he expertly seasoned the watercress removed the asparagus from the steamer and took a half bottle of beaujolais from the wine rack in the pantry he had just begun to eat when the phone rang he hurried to the extension in the kitchen dr highley he said curtly a sob sounded over the phone oh doctor its gertrude fitzgerald i decided to go see edna on my way home he tightened his grip on the receiver doctor edna is dead the police are here she fell doctor could you come right away theyre talking about performing an autopsy she hated autopsies she used to say how terrible it was to cut up dead people doctor oh please come here and convince them that she fell and that they dont have to cut her up katie made a cup of tea and took it with her in the car shed planned to have tea with edna and now edna was dead how could a person shed met only once have made such an impression on her in that one conversation theyd had edna had understood perfectly about john shed said i know what it is to watch someone die you want the misery to be over for them but you dont want to let them go when mom and dad died all my friends said now youre free edna and i said free for what i bet you felt that way too edna had reassured her about dr highley you couldnt find a better doctor thats why it makes me so mad when i hear him criticized and those people who file malpractice suits i could shoot them i tell you when a doctor loses a patient today he has to worry i guess nobodys supposed to die anymore what had charley meant by saying that edna had phoned chris lewis last night was charley suggesting that edna might in some way have threatened him as she drove into the parking lot of ednas apartment complex she slowed down a black mediumsize car was pulling in ahead of her the driver chose the first spot available on the right katie found a space directly behind the building parked and got out of the car suddenly she heard footsteps and turned quickly a figure loomed near her a silhouette accentuated by the dim light from a solitary lamppost excuse me i hope i didnt startle you the cultured voice had a faint english accent dr highley did my office call you mrs demaio we didnt expect to see each other so soon and under such tragic circumstances here lets take this footpath around the building lightly touching her elbow he followed her on the path mrs fitzgerald called me evidently she was the one who found edna they were turning the corner to the front of the building when richard appeared she was very glad to see him he grasped both her shoulders and pulled her to him then his hands dropped scott reached you no i happened to call edna myself oh richard this is dr edgar highley the two men shook hands charley let them into the apartment he said to richard weve got pictures but id like you to have a look too katie was used to death she often studied gory pictures of crime victims but it was a different matter to see edna crumpled against the radiator to see the solid evidence of lonelinessthe slices of canned ham the empty cocktail glass gertrude fitzgerald was sitting on a couch sobbing softly katie and dr highley sat down beside her as richard went into the dinette to examine the dead woman gertrude tried to talk to them oh dr highley mrs demaio isnt this just terrible the words brought a fresh burst of sobs she was always such fun she always made me laugh maybe she had that little weakness but she never bothered anyone with it oh dr highley youll miss her too i surely will mrs fitzgerald doctor gertrude blurted out i told them youve been here that you knew about ednas little problem its just silly to say she didnt fall why would anyone want to hurt her dr highley looked at katie edna suffered from sciatica and a few times when she was laid up i dropped off work for her to do at home on one occasion i came unexpectedly it was then i realized that she had a drinking problem katie nodded looking past him richard had completed examining the body getting up she walked over to him and asked what he had found he shrugged ill have to see how bad the fracture is certainly it was a hell of a smash but she might have stumbled when she tried to get up any sign of forced entry katie asked charley none but you could spring these locks with a credit card if she was as drunk as we think anyone could have walked in what were you telling me on the phone about chris lewis the superintendents wifenames gana krupshakwas a buddy of edna burns she was with mrs fitzgerald when the body was found we let her go to her own apartment just before you came shes shook up bad anyhow last night she came over here around eight oclock she said edna already had a bag on she stayed till eight thirty then put out the ham hoping edna would eat something and sober up edna told her about vangies suicide then when mrs krupshak went into the kitchen she heard edna on the phone she swears edna called whoever she was talking to captain lewis and told him she had to talk to the police tomorrow and get this krupshak swears she heard edna give lewis directions for driving here then edna said something about prince charming prince charming charley shrugged your guess is as good as mine richard said obviously well treat this as a potential homicide i know scott has a hunch about lewis i can see why katie thought i do not believe chris lewis could have done this to edna i dont believe he killed his wife she looked around are you sure theres nothing valuable missing charley shrugged her wallets in her pocketbook eighteen dollars there credit cards the usual no sign of anything being disturbed let alone ransacked all right katie returned to dr highley and gertrude mrs fitzgerald i think it would be best if we have you driven home dr highley reached into his pocket i brought these sedatives along in case you needed them here take one now ill get a glass of water katie said she went down the hall to the bathroom then came back to gertrude and sat beside her mrs fitzgerald do you know whether edna kept any valuables hereany jewelry perhaps she had a ring and a pin she wore on special occasions i wouldnt know where she kept them oh wait a minute doctor i remember that edna said she showed you her ring and pin when you were here perhaps you can help mrs demaio katie looked into the cold gray eyes he hates this she thought hes angry about being here one time edna did show me a pin and ring that were in a box in her nighttable drawer would you show me doctor katie asked together they walked down the hall into the bedroom it was in there dr highley told her pointing to the night table on the right side of the bed using only the tips of her fingers katie opened the drawer she knew that the fingerprint experts would be called in the drawer was deep reaching in katie pulled out a blue plastic jewelry case she raised the lid to find a small butterflyshaped brooch and a thin old diamond ring nestled against cotton velvet that eliminates the robbery theory i guess katie said she started to close the drawer then stopped oh doctor look setting the jewelry box on the bed she reached back into the drawer my mother kept her mothers old black hat for sentimental reasons edna must have done the same thing she was holding up an object for him to see it was a scuffed brown moccasin shaped for the left foot as dr highley stared at the shoe katie said this was probably her mothers and she considered it such a treasure she kept it with that pathetic jewelry oh doctor if memorabilia could talk wed hear a lot of stories wouldnt we edgar highley stared at katie demaio as she stood there holding that shoe in her hand was she mocking him no she believed that the shoe had had some sentimental meaning for edna suppose she showed it to the detectives or to gertrude shed been at the desk many times when vangie came in he had to have that shoe katie put it back closed the drawer and walked out of the bedroom the jewelry box tucked under her arm he followed her desperate to hear what she would say but she simply handed the jewelry box to the detective the ring and pin are here charley she said i guess that shoots any possibility of burglary there was a rap at the door and katie opened it to admit two men carrying a stretcher edgar highley said to gertrude ill get you more water mrs fitzgerald the others were watching the attendants as they lifted the body it was his chance he had to risk taking the shoe he walked rapidly to the bathroom turned on the tap then slipped across the hall to the bedroom using his handkerchief to avoid fingerprints he opened the nighttable drawer he was reaching for the shoe when he heard footsteps coming down the hall quickly he pushed the drawer shut stuffed his handkerchief into his pocket and was standing at the door of the bedroom when richard carroll appeared dr highley he said coldly id like to ask you a few questions about edna burns certainly then in what he hoped was a casual tone highley said excuse me im letting the tap run i want to get mrs fitzgerald a glass of cold water the poor womans terribly distressed richard carroll stood aside to let him pass highley filled the glass and took it to gertrude the attendants had left with the body and katie demaio was not in the room has mrs demaio left he asked the detective shes talking to the supers wife shell be right back he could not leave until he was sure that katie did not talk about the shoe when she came back a few minutes later she did not mention it they left the apartment together deliberately he stayed with katie as she walked to her car but then richard carroll joined them lets get some coffee at the golden valley diner katie he said and highley watched them drive off on his way home edgar highley decided there must be a personal relationship between katie demaio and richard carroll when katie bled to death carroll would be both professionally and emotionally interested in the cause of death he would have to be very careful he drove into his garage then entered the house the cold lamb chops were on the plate the asparagus had wilted the salad was limp and warm he would reheat the food in the microwave oven prepare a fresh salad as he set to work he found himself becoming calm he was so near to being safe and soon it would be possible to share his genius with the world he already had his success he could prove it beyond doubt he had accurate records pictures x rays the stepbystep accounts of how he had dealt with all the problems that had arisen all in the files in his secret safe when the proper time came he would burn the files on the failures and claim the recognition that was due him by then there would surely be more triumphs he sat down at the table and slowly ate his dinner as always food restored his sense of wellbeing tomorrow the newsmaker article would appear it would enhance his social as well as his medical prestige my patients are not allowed to drink or smoke during their pregnancies he had told the newsmaker interviewer they are required to follow a specific diet i will not accept a patient who will not cooperate with my methods i can show you dozens of women i have treated who have had a history of several miscarriages but now have children many more could experience that same joy if they were willing to change their habits particularly their eating and drinking habits the newsmaker reporter had been impressed but her next question was a loaded one doctor isnt it true that a large number of women have miscarried even after following your schedule rigidlyand paying you ten thousand dollars it would be insane for me to claim that i bring every difficult pregnancy to term yes there have been occasions where a desired pregnancy was spontaneously aborted after several of these occurrences i suggest that my patient adopt a child and i help to arrange a suitable adoption for a fee young woman i assume you are being paid to interview me why dont you use your time for volunteer work it had been foolish to antagonize her foolish to give her any reason to want to discredit him or to delve into his background the interviewers next question had been meant to entrap him doctor you also perform abortions isnt it incongruous to try to save one fetus and to eliminate another i refer to the womb as a cradle i despise abortion but i also deplore the grief i witness when women come to me who cannot conceive because their wombs have been damaged during abortions it is my wish that all women carry their babies to term for those who do not want to at least i can make sure that when they do want a child they will still be able to have one that point had been well received he finished eating leaned back in the chair and poured himself more wine he was feeling expansive tomorrow morning he had a cesarean section scheduledanother difficult case that would add to his reputation the mother was from the socially prominent payne family the father delano aldrich was an officer of a prestigious foundation this was the sort of family whose championship he needed only one obstacle left he had brought katie demaios file home from the office he would begin now to prepare the substitute file that he would show to the police after her death instead of the history shed given him of prolonged periods of bleeding he would write patient complains of frequent hemorrhaging unrelated to monthly cycles instead of sponginess of uterine walls a condition that could be remedied by a simple operation he would note signs of vascular breakdown instead of a slightly low hemoglobin he would indicate that the hemoglobin was chronically in the danger zone he went into the library her official file was on top of his desk from the drawer he extracted a new folder put katies name on it and set down her previous medical history this was the folder he would take to the hospital he added several paragraphs to the file he would put in the wall safe when completed patient was in minor automobile accident on monday night february at am sedated patient observed the transferal of the remains of vangie lewis by this physician patient still does not understand that what she observed was a true event rather than a hallucination but inevitably she will she cannot be permitted to remain as a threat to this physician on pretense of preparation for saturday surgery this physician prescribed anticoagulant medication to be taken on regular basis until friday night he laid down his pen it was easy to imagine how he would complete this report patient entered the hospital at pm friday february complaining of dizziness and general weakness at pm this physician accompanied by nurse renge found the patient hemorrhaging blood pressure was falling rapidly emergency surgery was performed at pm the patient expired at pm he smiled in anticipation every detail was perfectly planned even to assigning nurse renge to floor duty friday night she was young inexperienced and terrified of him putting the file in the temporary hiding place in the top desk drawer he went upstairs to bed and slept soundly until six in the morning three hours later he delivered a healthy baby boy by cesarean section to mrs delano aldrich and accepted as his due the tearful gratitude of the patient and her husband chapter nine at eight am thursday morning the investigative squad of the homicide division of valley county pulled up to the lewis home the sixman team was headed by phil cunningham and charley nugent the detectives in charge of fingerprinting were told to concentrate on the master bedroom and bath and the kitchen according to the lab report vangies fingerprints had been found on the tumbler that had been lying next to her she had been righthanded when she poured the cyanide crystals into the glass it would have been natural for her to hold the glass with her left hand and pour with her right yet only her right prints were on the tumbler this further discredited the suicide theory every bottle in the medicine chest was opened sniffed but the bitteralmond scent they were looking for was not to be found the bedroom was carefully vacuumed in the hope of finding human hair as phil put it any house can have hairs from delivery people neighbors anybody were all shedding hair all the time but most people dont bring even good friends into the bedroom so if you find human hair that doesnt belong to the people who sleep in the bedroom you might have something close attention was given to the shelves in the garage the usual garden tools hoses insecticides and weed killer were there in abundance phil grunted in annoyance as a prong of a gardening fork pulled at his jacket the prongs had been protruding over the edge of the shelf the handle wedged in by a heavy paint can bending to free his sleeve he noticed a sliver of printed cotton hooked on the prong that flowered print hed seen it recently it was the dress vangie lewis was wearing when she died he called the police photographer out to the garage get a picture of that he said pointing to the tool when the picture was taken he removed the material and sealed it in an envelope in the house charley was going through the desk when phil came in charley said weve come up with a big zero wait a minute they had an answering service wed better check it for messages he got the number of the answering service from a file in the desk then dialed and identified himself give me any messages left for either captain or mrs lewis starting with monday taking out his pen he began to write monday february pm northwest orient reservations phoned mrs lewis is confirmed on flight at pm from la guardia airport to minneapolisst paul on tuesday february charley asked did mrs lewis receive that message oh yes the operator said i gave it to her myself at about seven thirty monday evening she sounded very relieved all right charley said what else have you got also on monday a miss edna burns called at ten pm she wanted mrs lewis to phone her no matter how late it was but mrs lewis never contacted us again that night there were no further messages on the service but the operator knew a call had come through tuesday evening and had been picked up by captain lewis i was just starting to answer when he came on she explained i got right off charley thanked the operator then hung up the receiver and looked at phil lets go scotts going to want to hear about this how do you read it phil asked charley snorted how else can i read it as of seven thirty monday evening vangie lewis was planning to go to minneapolis a couple of hours later shes dead as of ten oclock monday night edna burns had an important message for vangie the next night ednas dead and the last person who saw her alive heard her telling chris lewis she had information for the police for katie wednesday night had seemed endless shed gone to bed as soon as she returned from ednas apartment first taking one of the pills dr highley had given her shed awakened feeling vaguely troubled her grandmothers old black hat why was she thinking about that hat of course because of that shabby old shoe edna obviously prized but why just one shoe grimacing she got out of bed the soreness throughout her body had intensified during the night hoping that a hot bath might soak some of the achiness away she went into the bathroom and turned on the taps in the tub a wave of dizziness made her sway and she grabbed the side of the tub to keep from falling the bathroom mirror revealed the deathly pallor of her skin its this bleeding she thought if i werent going into the hospital tomorrow night id probably end up being carried in the bath did reduce some of the stiffness and foundation makeup minimized the paleness with her orange juice katie swallowed another of dr highleys pills then she grabbed a coat and her handbag and went out to the car charley and phil were searching the lewis house this morning scott was drawing a web around chris lewis if only she could find another avenue to explore before chris was indicted she arrived at the office just before eight and found maureen crowley already there maureen katie said ive got a job could you come in when you have a minute the girl got up quickly she had a narrowwaisted gracefulyoung body the green sweater she was wearing accentuated the vivid green of her eyes how about coffee katie great but no ham on ryeat least not yet maureen looked embarrassed im sorry i said that yesterday you of all people are not in a rut im not sure about that katie hung up her coat and settled down with her notebook maureen brought in the coffee pulled up a chair and waited silently her steno pad on her lap katie said slowly were not satisfied that the vangie lewis death is a suicide yesterday i talked with her doctors dr highley and dr fukhito at westlake hospital she heard a sharp intake of breath and looked up quickly the girls face had gone dead white maureen is anything the matter no no im sorry unconvinced katie looked back at her notes as far as we know dr fukhito was the last person to see vangie lewis alive i want to find out as much as i can about him find out where he came from where he went to school other hospitals hes been connected with his personal background you dont want me to talk to anyone at westlake hospital no i dont want them to know were checking on him for some reason the younger woman seemed relieved ill get right on it youd be a good lawyer katie said meaning it im surprised you didnt go to college i was insane enough to get engaged the summer i finished high school my folks persuaded me to take a secretarial course before i got married so at least id have some kind of skill how right they were the engagement didnt stand the years wait she looked unhappy and katie decided she must have been pretty hurt about the breakup maureen went out of the room the telephone rang it was richard katie ive just been talking to dave broad the head of prenatal research at mount sinai on a hunch i sent him the fetus vangie lewis was carrying my hunch was right vangie was not pregnant with lewis child the baby was distinctly oriental chapter ten the funeral service for vangie lewis was held on thursday morning in the chapel of a minneapolis funeral home chris stood beside vangies parents their muffled sobs assaulting him like hammerblows they had been outraged to hear that vangie could not be buried that her body was to be shipped back east then returned later for burial why i simply dont know there was no use saying morenot now he thought of ednas call could she throw some light on vangies death before he left minneapolis he had to call dr salem what did he know about vangie that had made him react with such shock last night why had vangie wanted to see him there had been someone else in vangies life he was sure of it now suppose vangie had killed herself in front of someone and that person had brought her home the minister was saying the final prayer when every tear shall be dried chris led vangies parents into the anteroom to accept the sympathy of their friends when he was able to get away to a phone chris called dr salems office this is vangie lewis husband he said its urgent i speak with the doctor immediately im sorry the nurse told him dr salem left a short time ago for the american medical association convention in new york he will not be back until next week new york can you tell me where hes staying please the nurse hesitated i suppose its all right i know dr salem intends to get in touch with you he took your wifes medical records with him you can reach him at the essex house hotel on central park south scott myerson had called a noon meeting to discuss vangie lewis death when katie arrived maureen was there with a pen and paper were bringing sandwiches in scott said im due in court again at one thirty weve got to move fast on captain lewis as katie had expected scott was zeroing in on chris she looked at maureen the girl had an aura of nervousness around her any results on dr fukhito so far not much hes not a member of the ama or the valley county medical society but i have a call in to the university of massachusetts he attended medical school there who told you that katie asked i remember hearing it somewhere katie sensed that maureen was being evasive at that moment richard charley and phil came into the office quickly they gave maureen their lunch choices scott began to speak by now you all know that the lewis baby had oriental characteristics so that opens two possibilities one with the birth imminent vangie panicked and killed herself because she knew she could never pass the baby off as her husbands two chris lewis found out that his wife had been having an affair and killed her she could have been rushing home to minneapolis because she was afraid of him from what katie tells us the psychiatrist claims she ran out of his office nearly hysterical the japanese psychiatrist katie said are you suggesting there was something between him and vangie im not suggesting anything yet vangie could have known another oriental man but he was nervous when i spoke with him yesterday he carefully chose every word he said to me and i certainly did not get the whole truth from him which brings us to edna burns scott said what about it richard did she fall or was she pushed its possible that she fell the alcohol level in her blood was point two five she was blotto but it is possible she was murdered scott persisted absolutely and edna was heard talking to chris lewis about prince charming katie thought of the handsome psychiatrist would edna refer to him as prince charming maybe vangie told her something monday night charley suggested maybe she knew chris and vangie had quarreled and why theyd quarreled maybe she was putting the arm on lewis she did threaten to go to the police she said she had something to tell the police katie objected thats the way the supers wife put it all right scott said what turned up at the lewis house not much said charley theres a phone number with a area code scribbled on the pad beside the kitchen phone we thought wed call it from here the other thing is that she tore her dress on a prong sticking out from a shelf in the garage scott picked up the message pad charley had handed him and tossed it to katie why dont you try this number now katie dialed the number and waited while the phone rang dr salems office perhaps you can help me im kathleen demaio from the valley county new jersey prosecutors office were conducting an inquiry into the death of vangie lewis last monday she had dr salems phone number on her pad oh that is a coincidence i was just about to call your medical examiner dr salem wants to talk with him the doctor is on his way to new york right now for the ama convention can your medical examiner phone him around five pm at the essex house hotel on central park south yes ill give him the message then on a chance katie added do you know anything about mrs lewis call did she speak with the doctor no she spoke to me she called monday and was so disappointed that he wasnt going to be back till wednesday i made an emergency appointment for her for wednesday one last question what kind of doctor is dr salem oh hes a prominent obstetrician and gynecologist i see thank you youve been very helpful katie hung up the phone and reported the conversation to the others there was a knock at the door and maureen came in with coffee and sandwiches katie she said that call from massa chusetts about dr fukhito is just coming in want to take it katie nodded and picked up the phone as she waited for the call to be switched she became aware of a slow persistent head ache im not operating on all cylinders she thought so many things were teasing her mind what was she trying to recall the personnel director at the university of massachusetts medical school answered guardedly yes dr fukhito graduated from u mass he interned at massachusetts general and later became affiliated with the hospital he also had a private practice he left the hospital seven years ago why did he leave katie asked you must understand this is a police investigation all information will be kept confidential there was a pause dr fukhito was asked to resign he was found guilty of unethical behavior after he unsuccessfully defended a malpractice suit what was the cause of the suit katie asked a patient sued dr fukhito for inducing her to have a personal relationship with him she bore dr fukhitos child molly bustled around her kitchen rejoicing in the fact that all the children were back in school bill was not going into new york for another half hour they were enjoying a rare chance to chat in peace as bill sat at the table sipping coffee and molly sliced vegetables im sure katie and richard and the berkeleys will enjoy each other molly was saying now if liz just doesnt spend the whole evening talking about the baby when i phoned to invite her she spent the first twenty minutes on maryannes latest trick which is to blow her oatmeal all over the place isnt that cute it is if its your first baby and you waited fifteen years to have one bill commented anyhow even if liz does rave about the baby tonight maybe a little of it will sink in on katie and richard bills eyebrows rose molly youre not very subtle youd better watch out or theyll start avoiding each other havent you noticed the way they act together theres something smoldering there and richard called me last night and wanted to know if there was something the matter with katie did you tell him about the operation no katie doesnt want me to but the poor guy is so worried about her i dont think its fair to him bill got up and put his cup and saucer in the dishwasher if katie doesnt want to tell richard about this operation dont fill him in thats not fair to her youve gotten them together now now bug off molly sighed something like that and tomorrow night when katie goes into the hospital you and i are going to the opera you can be at the recovery room saturday morning but it wont hurt to have her wish she had someone with her friday evening maybe shell do a little thinking let her go into the hospital by herself molly protested by herself bill said firmly shes a big girl the telephone rang molly picked it up hello liz hi she listened oh for heavens sake bring her along she can sleep up in our room great see you at seven by she hung up liz berkeleys regular babysitter had to cancel so shes bringing the baby along fine bill looked at the clock id better go he kissed mollys cheek will you quit worrying about your little sister molly bit her lip i cant ive got this creepy feeling about katie like something might happen to her chapter eleven when richard returned to his office after the meeting with scott and the others he stood for a long time staring out the window in the pocketsize park in front of the courthouse a flurry of snow pelted the already frozen grass he glanced up at the sky vangie lewis body was being flown to newark from minneapolis on a twothirty flight it would be brought to the morgue and tomorrow morning hed reexamine it there was something about her left foot or leg that he had noticed and dismissed as irrelevant he pushed that thought aside it was useless to speculate until he could reexamine the body sighing he snapped on the intercom and asked marge to bring in his phone messages she hurried in with a sheaf of slips in her hand none of these are too important she said but i got the statistics on the westlake obstetrical patients in the eight years of the westlake maternity concept sixteen patients have died either in childbirth or of toxic pregnancies sixteen sixteen marge repeated with emphasis however the practice is huge and all the women who died had been warned by other doctors that they were high pregnancy risks ill study the fatalities richard said anything else maybe two people filed malpractice suits against dr highley both were dismissed and a cousin of his wifes claimed that he didnt believe shed died of a heart attack the prosecutors office contacted her physician dr alan levine and he said the cousin was crazy the cousin had been the sole heir before winifred westlake married dr highley ill have a talk with dr levine and these are the people who filed the malpractice suits richard looked down at the two names on the sheet of paper marge handed him anthony caldwell old country lane peapack new jersey and anna horan walnut street ridgefield park new jersey you do nice work marge he said she nodded i know he phoned dr levine and caught him as he was leaving his office they agreed to meet at the parkwood country club alan levine was a jimmy stewart lookalike which endeared him to his older patients he and richard enjoyed the easy cordiality of professionals who respected each other at the club richard came directly to the point winifred westlake was your patient her cousin suggested that she did not die of a heart attack what can you tell me about it levine sipped his martini and glanced out the picture window at the snowcovered fairway i have to answer that question on a couple of levels first winifred for years had all the classic symptoms of a duodenal ulcer except it never showed up on x ray when shed experience pain id prescribe an ulcer diet and shed feel relief almost immediately no great problem then the year before she married highley she had a severe attack of gastroenteritis which actually altered her cardiogram i put her in the hospital for a suspected heart attack but after two days the cardiogram was well within the normal range so there might or might not have been a heart problem i didnt think there was but her mother died of a heart attack at fiftyeight and winifred was nearly fiftytwo when she died she was older than highley by some ten years several years after her marriage she began to complain of frequent chest pains the tests produced nothing significant i told her to watch her diet and then she had a fatal attack richard asked the other doctor nodded one evening during dinner she had a seizure highley had his service call me when i got there he was still trying to revive her but it was hopeless she died a few minutes after i arrived and youre satisfied it was heart failure there was a hint of hesitation i was satisfied at the time at the time richard underscored the words i suppose the cousins absolute conviction that something was wrong about her death has troubled me these three years i practically threw glenn nickerson out of my office when he came in and as much as accused me of falsifying records but he is a family man active in his church on the town council certainly not the kind to go off halfcocked at being disinherited and he must have known that winifred would leave her estate to her husband she was crazy about highley why i never could see but ive got to hand it to him hes an excellent doctor excellent enough to have chemically induced a heart attack in his wife dr levine looked directly at richard frankly ive often wished id insisted on an autopsy they parted at the entrance to the bar richard fished in his pocket for change went over to the public telephone and dialed the essex house in new york dr emmet salem please there was the repeated sound of a phone ringing the operator broke in im sorry but theres no answer are you sure dr salem has checked in richard asked yes sir he called specifically to say that he was expecting an important call and he wanted to be sure to get it that was only twenty minutes ago but i guess he changed his mind because we are definitely ringing his room and theres no answer chapter twelve the newsmaker article was on the stands thursday morning the phone calls had begun as soon as highley went to his office after delivering the aldrich baby the response was beyond his expectations the dartmouth medical school phoned would he consider a guest lecture a writer for ladies home journal wanted an interview would dr highley appear on eyewitness news smiling he signaled for his first patient to come in she was an interesting case her womb was so tipped that shed never conceive without intervention she would be his next vangie the phone call came at noon just as he was leaving for lunch the nurse covering the reception desk was apologetic its long distance from a dr emmet salem in minneapolis emmet salem he picked up the phone edgar highley here dr highley from christ hospital in devon yes he felt a chill sickening fear doctor i learned last night that you treated my former patient vangie lewis im leaving for new york immediately in fact im at the airport now i am planning to consult with the medical examiner in new jersey about mrs lewis death i have her records with me in fairness to you i suggest we discuss her case first doctor im troubled by your tone and insinuations ill be checking into room at the essex house shortly before five you can call me there the connection was broken highley was waiting at the hotel when emmet salem emerged from the cab swiftly he took an elevator to the thirtysecond floor walked past room and around a corner another elevator stopped at the floor he listened as a key clicked and a bellman said here we are doctor a minute later the bellman emerged from the room thank you sir highley waited until the corridors were silent quickly he opened his bag and took out the paperweight he slipped it into his coat pocket put on his gloves grasped the bag firmly in his left hand and knocked on the door emmet salem pulled the door open he had just removed his suit coat dr salem highley reached for salems hand walking forward backing the older man into the room closing the door behind him im edgar highley its good to see you again you got off the phone so abruptly that i couldnt tell you i was coming into town for dinner i have only a few minutes but im sure we can clear up any questions he was still walking forward forcing the other man to retreat the window behind salem was wide open hed probably had the bellman open it because the room was very hot the sill was low i tried to phone you but your extension is out of order impossible i just spoke to the operator salem stiffened then i do apologize but im so anxious to go over the lewis file with you i have it right here he put his bag down and reached for the paperweight in his pocket then cried doctor behind you watch out the other man spun around highley crashed the paperweight on salems skull emmet salem slumped against the windowsill jamming the paperweight back into his pocket edgar highley cupped his palms around salems foot and shoved up and out no no please the halfconscious man slid out the window and landed on the roof of the extension some fifteen floors below the body made a muffled thud from salems suit coat on the bed highley pulled out a key ring the smallest key fitted the attache case on the luggage rack the vangie lewis file was on top grabbing it he shoved it into his own bag relocked salems bag returned the keys to the suitcoat pocket he placed the bloodstained paperweight in his bag then glanced around the room was in perfect order he opened the door and looked along the corridor it was empty as he stepped out the phone in salems room began to ring an elevator was just stopping he got on his eyes scanning the passengers no one he knew at the lobby he walked rapidly to the fiftyeighth street exit ten minutes later he reclaimed his car from a parkandlock garage tossed his bag into the trunk and drove away when she left scotts office katie called in rita castile one of the investigators and together they went over the material katie would need for upcoming trials that armed robbery on the twentyeighth where the defendant had his hair cut the morning after the crime well need the barber to testify its no wonder the witnesses couldnt make a positive identification even though we made him wear a wig in the lineup he didnt look the same rita jotted down the barbers address thats about all i have for you now katie said but i wont be coming in over the weekend so next week will really be a mess be prepared you wont be coming in rita raised her eyebrows well its about time you havent taken a full weekend in a couple of months i hope youre planning to have some fun katie grinned i dont know how much fun it will be oh rita i have a hunch that maureen is upset about something is it the breakup with her fiance rita shook her head no that was just kid stuff and she knew it the problem is just about the time they broke up she realized she was pregnant and had an abortion shes weighted down with guilt about it she told me that she keeps dreaming about the baby that shed do anything to have had it even though she would have given it out for adoption katie remembered how much she had hoped to conceive johns child that does explain it thanks for telling me i was afraid id said something to hurt her after rita left katie called westlake hospital she wanted to talk again with the receptionist gertrude fitzgerald then she would call gana krupshak the hospital told her that mrs fitzgerald was home ill and gave katie her home phone number when the woman answered her voice was weak and shaking i have one of my migraines she said and no wonder every time i think of poor edna i would like to ask you something katie said did edna ever call either of the doctors she worked for prince charming prince charming dr highley or dr fukhito why would she call either of them prince charming my heavens no all right it was just a thought katie said goodby and dialed mrs krupshak the superintendent answered his wife was out he explained shed be back around five katie glanced at the clock it was four thirty do you think shed mind if i stopped to talk to her for a few minutes suit yourself the man answered shortly mrs krupshak was home when katie rang her bell now isnt that timing she exclaimed for her the shock of discovering ednas body had worn off and she was enjoying the excitement this is my bingo afternoon she explained when i told my friends what happened they could hardly keep their cards straight she ushered katie into an lshaped living room and they both sat down on an imitationleather couch mrs krupshak katie said i wonder if you would go over with me very carefully what happened tuesday night how long you were with edna what you talked about when she spoke to captain lewis did you get the impression that she made an appointment with him gana krupshak leaned back now lets see i went over to ednas right at eight oclock because gus started to watch the basketball game and i thought id go have a beer with edna the thing is edna had made a pitcher of manhattans and they were about half gone and she was pretty rocky she talked in a sort of rambly way about this patient who had died how beautiful shed been how sick shed been getting and how sheedna i meancould tell the cops a lot about her then what happened katie asked well i had a manhattan or two with her and then figured id better get home but i hated to see edna drink much more so i got out that nice canned ham for her and that was when she made the call to captain lewis and mentioned prince charming as god is my witness all right but one last thing mrs krupshak do you know if edna kept any articles of clothing of her mothers as a sentimental keepsake i noticed a shabby old moccasin in ednas nighttable drawer did she ever show it to you or mention it gana krupshak looked directly at katie absolutely not she said flatly chris lewis arrived at the twin cities airport at one thirty he had an hour to wait before his plane left for newark vangies body would be on that plane at newark the medical examiners office would be waiting for it and the prosecutors office would be waiting for him of course if they were suspicious in any way about vangies death they were going to look to him for answers if theyd investigated at all they knew by now that hed returned to the new jersey area monday night he had to see dr salem find out why he had been so upset if chris were detained for questioning he might not be able to talk to him he also had to talk to joan he had the number of the stewardess kay corrigan with whom she was staying in florida not knowing what he would say he put through the call kay answered its chris kay is joan there chris the valley county prosecutors office has been calling here asking questions about you two joan is frantic is she there no she wont be here till about eight tonight tell her to stay in till i call her tell her he broke the con nection leaned against the phone and pushed back a sob it was all too much he didnt know what to do in a few hours hed be in custody suspected of killing vangie no there was another way hed get the flight into la guardia he could still make it then hed be able to see dr salem at almost the same time he reached the hotel maybe dr salem could help him somehow he barely made the la guardia flight on the plane he listlessly thumbed through newsmaker magazine his eye caught the headline westlake maternity concept offers new hope to childless couples westlake he read the first paragraph for the past eight years a private clinic in new jersey has been making it possible for childless women to become pregnant the program is carried on by dr edgar highley highley vangies doctor funny she never talked very much about him it was always the psychiatrist fukhito the plane landed at four thirty chris hurried through the terminal and hailed a cab it was five when he reached the essex house he headed for a lobby telephone asked the operator for dr salems room number and dialed it the phone rang again again after six rings he hung up he dialed the operator and asked her to try it for him the operator hesitated sir when dr salem checked in he told me that he expected an important call but apparently hes stepped out why dont you try again in a few minutes ill do that chris hung up the phone walked over to a lobby chair facing an elevator bank and sat down the elevators opened dislodged passengers filled again disappeared one elevator caught his attention there was something vaguely familiar about someone on it a middleaged man with a turnedup coat collar dr salem no not salem at five thirty chris tried again and at quarter to six at five past six he heard the whispers that ran through the lobby like a flash fire someone jumped out a window from outside came the wail of an ambulance and the yipyip of police cars chris went to the bell captains desk who was it he asked dr emmet salem a big shot in the ama room walking like an automaton chris pushed through the revolving door to fiftyeighth street he hailed a cab and got in la guardia please he said there was a sevenoclock flight to miami he had to get to joan try to make her understand before he was arrested chapter thirteen twelveyearold jennifer threw open the door for katie katie hi the two smiled at each other with her intense blue eyes dark hair and olive skin jennifer was a young katie hi jennie anybody here yet everybody the berkeleys brought their baby richard is here too his first question was is katie here yet hes got a case on you katie jennifer half laughing half irritated katie walked inside in the den liz and jim berkeley were seated on the couch molly was passing hors doeuvres richard was standing by the window talking to bill he turned and saw her katie he came hurrying over ive been listening for the doorbell so often since johns death shed entered a room where she was the outsider the loner amid couples tonight richard had been waiting for her listening for her before she had time to consider her feelings everyone was saying hello on the way to the dining room she asked richard if hed reached dr salem he said i just missed him at five i left this number with the hotel operator and with my answering service at dinner liz berkeley said im holding my breath hoping maryanne wont wake up poor kid her gums are swollen jim berkeley laughed he was darkly handsome with brown eyes and thick black eyebrows when maryanne was born liz used to wake her up every fifteen minutes to make sure she was okay now its always quiet dont wake up the baby liz who was a slender woman with flashing brown eyes made a face at her husband im calming down but she is a miracle to us id just about given up hope dr highleys a genius richard s eyes narrowed you really think so positively he isnt the warmest person liz began but he knows his business her husband interrupted he put liz to bed in the hospital almost two months before the delivery and personally checked on her three or four times a day listen i pray for that man every night liz said the difference that baby has made in our lives dont let jim fool you hes up ten times a night to make sure that maryanne is covered as the others chatted katie only half listened she felt tired and lightheaded but she did not want to break up the party her chance came as they headed for the living room for a nightcap im going to say good night katie said im bushed molly did not protest richard said ill take you to your car the night air was cold and she shivered as they started down the walk katie im worried about you richard said i know youre not feeling up to par you dont seem to want to talk about it but at least lets have dinner tomorrow night richard im sorry i cant im going away this weekend youre what with all thats happening at the office i im committed what a lame thing to say katie thought this is ridiculous she would tell richard that shed be in the hospital suddenly the front door was thrown open richard jennifer shouted clovis simmons is on the phone clovis simmons katie said the actress yes oh hell i was supposed to call her ill see you in the morning katie got into the car and closed the door richard hesitated then hurried into the house as katie drove away his hello clovis was brusque well doctor its a shame i have to track you down but we did discuss dinner didnt we im sorry clovis let me call you tomorrow i cant talk now there was a sharp click in his ear richard hung up the phone slowly tomorrow he must call and apologize and tell her that there was someone else for now hed make his excuses and go home maybe try dr salem again he went into the living room molly bill and the berkeleys were there and swathed in blankets sitting on lizs lap was a baby girl maryanne decided to join the party liz said what do you think of her proudly she turned the baby to face him it might have been a magazine cover the smiling parents the beautiful offspring the mother and father oliveskinned browneyed squarefeatured the baby faircomplexioned red blond with a heartshaped face and brilliant green eyes richard stared at the family group who do they think theyre kidding he thought that child has to be adopted phil cunningham and charley nugent watched in disgust as the final stragglers came through newark airports gate thats it charley shrugged lewis must have figured wed be waiting for him lets go from a nearby pay phone he dialed scott you can go home boss he said the captain didnt feel like flying tonight he wasnt on board how about the coffin that came in richards guys are picking it up want us to hang around there are a couple of other flights he might be on forget it if he doesnt contact us tomorrow im issuing a pickup order for him as a material witness and first thing in the morning you two go through edna burnss apartment again charley hung up he turned to phil if i know the boss id say that by tomorrow night at this time therell be a warrant out for lewis arrest richard phoned the essex house as soon as he got home from the kennedys again there was no answer in dr salems room the operator came back on the line operator did dr salem receive the message to phone me im dr carroll the womans voice was hesitant ill check sir while he waited richard flipped on the television to eyewitness news the camera was focusing on central park south he watched as the marquee of the essex house appeared on the screen even as the telephone operator said im connecting you with our supervisor the television reporter was saying this evening in the prestigious essex house hotel dr emmet salem of minneapolis minnesota fell or jumped to his death joan moore sat distractedly by the phone in miami kay what time did he say hed phone she asked her voice trembling i told you said the other young woman he said hed be in touch with you tonight and that you should wait for his call he sounded upset the doorbell rang insistently making them both jump from their chairs joan ran to the door and yanked it open chrisoh chris she threw her arms around him he was ghastly white he swayed as she held him chris what is it his voice was nearly a sob i dont know whats happening theres something wrong about vangies death and now the only man who might have told us about it is dead too he had planned to go directly home from the essex house but after he drove out of the garage he changed his mind he was very hungry he needed to correct the terrible depletion of energy now that the business with salem was over hed go to the carlyle for dinner after tomorrow hed be safe inevitably thered be an investigation when kathleen demaio died but her former gynecologist had moved away no old medical records would loom up from the past right now at the ama convention doctors were probably discussing the newsmaker article and the westlake maternity concept he was on the path to fame and salem who might have stopped him was out of the way he was anxious to go through vangies medical history in salems file it would be invaluable in his future research he parked on the street in front of the carlyle his bag was locked in the trunk salems file on vangie the paperweight and the moccasin were in it he could dispose of the shoe and the paperweight in one of the citys trash baskets theyd be lost among the decaying food and discarded newspapers hed do it on the way home under cover of darkness he got out of the car and carefully locked it he walked to the entrance of the carlyle his dark blue suit covered by a blue cashmere coat his shoes shined to a soft luster the doorman held the door open for him good evening dr highley in the dining room the maitre d led him to the corner table he preferred wine warmed and soothed him the dinner restored him as he had anticipated he was just signing his check when the maitre d came hurrying over dr highley im afraid theres a problem his fingers tightened on the pen he looked up its just sir that a young man was observed prying the trunk of your car the doorman saw him just as he got it open before he could be stopped he had stolen a bag from the trunk the police are outside they believe it was a drug addict who chose your car because of the md license plates when highley spoke his voice was surprisingly steady do the police believe that my bag will be recovered im afraid they dont know sir it might be discarded a few blocks from here after hes taken what he wants from it or it might never show up again only time will tell before she went to bed katie packed an overnight bag for her stay in the hospital she realized how glad shed be to get the operation over with the sense of being physically out of tune was wearing her down she felt depleted exhausted depressed it was all physical wasnt it or was part of it the thought that richard might be involved with someone else by monday shed be feeling better wearily she showered brushed her teeth and got into bed a minute later she pulled herself up on one elbow reached for her handbag and fished out the small bottle dr highley had given her almost forgot to take this she thought as she swallowed the pill with water from the glass on her night table gertrude fitzgerald opened the prescription bottle the migraine was letting up this last pill should do it something was bothering her something over and beyond ednas death it had to do with mrs demaios call prince charming edna had mentioned him in the last couple of weeks if she could only remember it was eluding her the exact circumstance when this headache was gone shed be able to think she swallowed the pill got into bed closed her eyes ednas voice sounded in her ears and i said that prince charming wont she couldnt remember the rest at four am richard gave up trying to sleep he had phoned scott myerson about emmet salems death and scott had in formed the new york police of their interest more than that had been impossible to accomplish mrs salem was not at home in minneapolis nor could he reach the doctors nurse richard got up and began making notes why did salem want to talk to him why did vangie want to see salem the berkeley baby the baby was the key was the westlake maternity concept as successful as had been touted or was it a coverup for secret adoptions were the women being put to bed in the hospital two months before the supposed delivery to hide the fact that they were not pregnant but vangie lewis had been pregnant so she didnt fit into the adoptive pattern she was desperate to have a child but how did she expect to pass off an oriental baby on her husband the malpractice suits he had to find out the reason those people sued highley and emmet salems office would have vangies medical records that would be a place to start vangies body was back in the lab now first thing in the morning hed review the autopsy findings go over the body again there was something at five thirty richard set the alarm for seven and turned out the light when sleep came at last he dreamed of katie she was standing looking in the rear window of edna burnss apartment and dr edgar highley was watching her chapter fourteen edna burns had kept meticulous records when the search team headed by phil cunningham and charley nugent descended on her apartment on friday morning they found a statement in the oldfashioned breakfront i leave my worldly goods to my friends gertrude fitzgerald and gana krupshak mrs fitzgerald is to receive my diamond ring and whatever household possessions she cares to have mrs krupshak is to receive my ruby pin my imitation fur coat and whatever household possessions mrs fitzgerald does not wish to have my insurance policy less funeral expenses is assigned to the nursing home which took such fine care of my parents methodically the team dusted for fingerprints vacuumed for hair and fibers searched for signs of forced entry as the final step they asked the neighbors if anyone had noticed any strangers in the vicinity on tuesday night at the last apartment they had a break an elevenyearold boy had just come home from school for lunch he heard the question asked of his mother oh i told a man in a car which apartment miss burns lived in he reported you remember ma when you made me walk porgy just before i went to bed that was about nine thirty the boys mother said what did the man look like charley asked he had sort of dark hair his car was neat it was a corvette charley looked at phil chris lewis drives a corvette he said flatly through the long sleepless night edgar highley rationalized the problem of the stolen bag the odds were it would be abandoned after the thief went through it few people would take the trouble to return it suppose the new york police recovered the bag intact his name and address were inside it if they phoned and asked him for a list of the contents hed simply mention some standard drugs and a few patients files they would assume that vangie lewis file was his if they asked about the shoe and the bloodstained paperweight hed say that the thief must have put them there it would be all right and tonight the last risk would be removed at five am he gave up trying to sleep showered and went downstairs he was not going in to the office until noon meanwhile hed go over his research notes yesterdays patient would be his new experiment but he hadnt yet chosen the donor on friday morning katie got in to the office by seven oclock and began a review of the case she was trying the defendants were teenage brothers accused of setting fires in two schools maureen came in at eight thirty and immediately made fresh coffee katie looked up boy im going all out to nail those two she said they did it for kicks its sickening maureen reached for katies coffee cup and filled it katie katie looked into troubled green eyes yes rita told me that she told you about about the baby yes she did im terribly sorry maureen the thing is i cant seem to get over it ive been trying to forget and now this vangie lewis case brings it back katie nodded maureen id have given anything to have had a baby when john died that year i prayed id get pregnant so id have something of him when i think of all the friends i have who elect never to have children i wonder about the way life works out but well both have children someday and well appreciate them because of not having the ones we wanted before maureens eyes were filled with tears i know but the thing about the vangie lewis case is the telephone rang katie reached for it it was scott myerson glad youre in katie can you run over here for a minute of course katie got up scott wants me now well talk later maureen impulsively she hugged the girl scott was standing by the window staring out he turned when she came in youre on trial todaythe odendall brothers yes we have a good case well get them you usually do katie have you heard about dr salem the doctor from minneapolis no i havent spoken to anyone this morning i went straight to my office he fellor was pushedout a window in the essex house a few minutes after he checked in were working with the new york police on it incidentally vangie lewis body arrived from minneapolis yesterday lewis wasnt on the flight katie stared at scott what are you saying im saying that he probably took the flight that went into la guardia it would have gotten him into new york about the time salem checked in im saying that if we find he was anywhere in the vicinity of that hotel we may be able to wrap this case up i dont believe chris lewis is a murderer katie said flatly where do you think he is now scott shrugged i think his girl friend will lead us to him shes due in from florida tonight can you hang around katie hesitated this is one weekend i have to be away but ill be honest scott i feel so lousy that im not thinking straight ill get through this trial but then i will leave scott studied her you should have a checkup you look paler than you did right after your accident all right get the trial over with and clear out of here well go over everything monday morning katie went back to her own office it was nearly nine and she was due in the courtroom mentally she reviewed the schedule of the pills dr highley had given her shed taken one last night one early this morning she swallowed another washing it down with the last sip of coffee from the cup on her desk then gathered her file the sharp edge of the top page of the brief slit her finger she gasped at the quick thrust of pain and wrapping a tissue around it hurried from the room half an hour later as she rose with the rest of the people in the courtroom to acknowledge the entrance of the judge the tissue was still wet with blood edna burns was buried on friday morning after a mass at st francis xavier church gana krupshak and gertrude fitzgerald followed the coffin to the nearby cemetery and watched edna placed in the grave beside her parents after the ceremony the priest father durkin escorted them back to their cars will you ladies join me for a cup of coffee he asked gertrude dabbed at her eyes and shook her head i really have to get to work she said mrs krupshak also declined then turning to gertrude she said why dont you come by for dinner tonight gertrude quickly accepted it would be good to talk about edna and about what a shame it was that neither of the doctors had come to the mass although at least dr fukhito had sent flowers maybe talking with gana would help her get a handle on the thought that kept buzzing around inside her headabout something that edna had said to her she said goodby to gana and the priest got into her car turned on the ignition dr highleys face loomed in her mind those big fishlike cold eyes thered been something funny about him wednesday night like when he went to get her a drink of water shed started to follow him hed turned on the tap then gone into the bedroom from the hall shed seen him take out his handkerchief and start to open ednas nighttable drawer then that nice dr carroll had started to come down the hall and dr highley had closed the drawer gertrude had let dr carroll pass her then slipped back into the living room she didnt want them to think she was trying to eavesdrop but if dr highley wanted something from that drawer why didnt he just say so and get it and why on earth would he open the drawer holding a handkerchief over his fingers why ednas apartment was immaculate the lifeless body of vangie lewis was placed on the slab in the autopsy room of the valley county medical examiner richard watched as his assistant removed the silk caftan that was to have been vangies burial robe he had missed something on tuesday afternoonsomething to do with her legs or feet minutes later he found what he was seeking a fresh twoinch scratch on vangies left foot that was what had bothered him vangies foot had been scratched shortly after her death and charley had found a piece of the dress she was wearing when she died dangling from a sharp implement in the garage richard turned to his assistant dress mrs lewis in the clothes she had on monday night call me when shes ready back in his office he scribbled on a pad shoes she was wearing were cut fairly high could not have been wearing them when foot was scratched he began to examine the notes hed made during the night the berkeley baby he was going to talk to jim berkeley get him to admit that the baby was adopted once that admission was made the whole westlake maternity concept would be exposed as a fraud would someone kill to prevent that fraud from being exposed he needed to see dr salems medical records on vangie quickly he dialed scott have you spoken to salems nurse yes and also to his wife theyre terribly broken up both swear he had no history of high blood pressure or dizziness no personal problems no money problems i say forget both the suicide and the accidentalfall angles how about vangie lewis what did the nurse know dr salem asked her to get out vangies file yesterday morning she saw him put it in his attache case that case was found in his hotel room but the lewis file wasnt in it and get this after dr salem left his office chris lewis phoned said he had to talk to salem the nurse told him where salem would be staying in new york ill tell you something richard by the end of the day i expect to be swearing out a warrant for lewis arrest you mean you think there was something in that file that chris lewis would kill to get i find that hard to believe someone wanted that file scott said richard hung up the phone who would know what was in a medical file that might be threatening a doctor was katie right in her suspicions about the psychiatrist and what about edgar highley impatiently richard searched on his desk for the slip of paper marge had given him with the names of the two patients who had filed malpractice suits against edgar highley anthony caldwell of peapack anna horan of ridgefield park over the intercom he asked marge to phone them both and to try to reach jim berkeley she came in a few minutes later berkeley wasnt in i left a message anthony caldwell moved to michigan last year i got one of his former neighbors on the phone she told me that his wife died of a tubal pregnancy mrs caldwell had been told by two other doctors that shed never conceive but as soon as she started at westlake she became pregnant she was terribly sick all the time however and died in her fourth month that gives me what i need richard said were going to subpoena the hospital records what about mrs horan i caught her husband home says she works as a computer programmer heres her office number richard dialed it mrs horan he said yes richard introduced himself mrs horan you filed a malpractice suit last year against dr highley i wonder if i might ask you some questions about that case are you free to talk her voice became agitated no not here she had an accent he could not place i understand but its urgent would it be possible for you to stop by the prosecutors office after work today and talk with me yes all right i know where it is ill be there by five thirty the connection was broken it was nearly noon richard decided to go to the courtroom where katie was trying her case and see if shed have lunch with him he wanted to ask her about highley would she agree that maybe something was wrong at westlakea baby ring or a doctor who took criminal chances with his patients lives the courtroom was deserted except for katie who still sat at the prosecutors table preoccupied with her notes she shook her head when he came over and asked her to lunch richard those skunks are trying to say someone else set the fires and i swear the jury is falling for it richard studied her her skin was deadly pale he noticed the tissue wrapped around her finger gently he unwound it that darn thing katie said it must be deep its been bleeding off and on all morning richard studied the cut released from the tissue it began to bleed rapidly pressing the tissue over the cut he picked up a rubber band and wound it above the cut this should stop it have you been having any clotting problems katie yes some but i cant talk about it now this case is running away from me and i feel so lousy her voice broke richard reached down and hugged her head against his chest katie im going to clear out of here but wherever you go this weekend do some thinking because im throwing my hat in the ring i want you i want to take care of you he straightened up now go and win your case you can do it and please take it easy this weekend monday im going to need your input on an angle i see in the lewis case all morning shed felt so coldso desperately icy cold even the longsleeved wool dress hadnt helped now close to richard she felt the warmth of his body as he turned to leave she impulsively grasped his hand and held it against her face monday she said monday he agreed and left the courtroom before they left ednas apartment complex charley and phil rang the krupshaks doorbell were finished with our examination charley told cana youre free to enter the apartment he showed her ednas note you and mrs fitzgerald can look the stuff over and divide it between yourselves but dont remove anything yet the two investigators returned to the office and went directly to the lab where they turned in the contents of the vacuum bag run this through right away phil directed scott was waiting for them in his office at the news that chris had been in the vicinity of ednas apartment on tuesday night he grunted with satisfaction lewis seems to have been all over the map this week he said and wherever hes been someone has died two bellmen positively identify him as being in the lobby of the essex house around five oclock the phone rang impatiently he answered it then his expression changed put her on he said quickly holding his hand over the mouthpiece he said chris lewis girl friend is calling from florida hello yes this is the prosecutor yes we are looking for captain lewis do you know where he is scotts forehead furrowed as he listened newark at seven very well im glad hes surrendering voluntarily if he wishes a lawyer he may want to have one here he hung up the phone lewis is coming in he said well crack this case open tonight now lets see what richards got the three men went to the autopsy room with richard they studied the body of vangie lewis now dressed in the clothes in which she had died the scrap of flowered material that had been found on the prong in the garage exactly fitted the tear near the hem of her dress the panty hose on her left foot showed a twoinch slash directly over the fresh cut no blood on the hosiery richard said she was already dead when her foot caught on the prong how high was the shelf that prong was on scott asked about three feet from the floor phil answered so someone carried her in through the garage laid her on her bed and tried to make it look like suicide scott said without question richard agreed a few moments later he left the autopsy room and returned to his office at four thirty jim berkeley called i understand youve been trying to reach me his voice was guarded its important can you stop in my office on your way home yes i can now jims voice became resigned and i think i know what you want to talk about edgar highley turned from the girl on the examining table you may get dressed now she had claimed to be twenty but he was sure she wasnt more than sixteen or seventeen am i yes my dear you are very definitely pregnant about five weeks i want you to return tomorrow morning and we will terminate the pregnancy i was wondering do you think i should maybe have the baby and have it adopted have you told your parents about this no theyd be so upset then i suggest you postpone motherhood for several years at least ten oclock tomorrow he left the room went into his office and looked up the phone number of the new patient he had chosen yesterday mrs englehart this is dr highley i want to begin your treatment kindly come to the hospital tomorrow morning at eight thirty chapter fifteen while the jury was deliberating katie went into the courthouse cafeteria and sat at a table with her back to the room she did not want anyone to join her she felt fatigued and weak but not hungry just a cup of tea she thought mama always said that a cup of tea would cure the ills of the world she sat for nearly an hour sipping the tea reviewing the proceedings the odendall boys were blaming the fires on a friend who was killed in a motorcycle accident last november had she convinced the jury that they were lying at five oclock she returned to the courtroom five minutes later the jury came in and the foreman announced the verdict robert and jonathan odendall were not guilty on all counts i dont believe it katie wasnt sure if she had spoken aloud the judge dismissed the jury curtly and told the defendants to stand up you are very lucky he snapped luckier than i hope youll ever be again now clear out of my courtroom and if youre smart youll never appear before me again katie stood up no matter if the judge clearly felt the verdict was erroneous she had lost the case she saw the victorious smile the defense attorney shot at her she stuffed her notes into her file maybe if she hadnt felt so lousy all week shed have conducted a better case she should have had this hemorrhaging problem taken care of a year ago instead of putting it off because of her childish fear of hospitals will the state please approach the bench she walked over to the judge your honor katie managed to keep her voice steady the judge leaned forward and whispered to her dont let it get you down katie you proved that case theyll be back here in two months on other charges next time youll nail them katie tried to smile thanks judge she left the courtroom and went back to her office maureen looked up hopefully but katie shook her head maureens expression changed to sympathy katie im sorry about the odendall verdict but try not to take it too hard you really look sick are you all right to drive youre not dizzy or anything no really im not going far then i wont budge till sunday jim berkeley parked his car in the courthouse lot went into the main lobby and checked the directory for the medical examiners office he had seen the expression on richard carrolls face last night when hed looked at the baby angered hed wanted to say so the baby doesnt look like us so what after several wrong turns he found richards office the door was open and richard came out immediately jim its good of you to come jims own greeting was reserved and cautious as they went inside richards manner became businesslike jim were investigating vangie lewis death she was a patient at westlakes maternity clinic where your wife had the baby jim nodded richard chose his words carefully our investigation is turning up some disturbing problems now i want to ask you a few questions and i swear to you that your answers will remain in this room but you can be of tremendous help to us if if i tell you that maryanne is adopted is that it yes jim thought of maryanne whatever the cost she was worth having no she is not adopted i was present at her birth i filmed it it is quite unlikely for two browneyed parents to have a greeneyed child richard said flatly then he stopped are you the babys father he asked quietly if you mean did liz have an affair with another man no id stake my life on that how about artificial insemination richard asked liz and i rejected that possibility years ago might liz have changed her mind and not told you jim looked away a moment and then said ive often wondered about maryannes coloring but i havent let it bother me that baby is everything to us he looked at richard my wife is the most honest person ive ever known last month i decided to make it easy for her i said that id been wrong about artificial insemination that i could see why people went ahead with it what did she say richard asked she said that if i thought she could make a decision like that and not tell me i didnt understand our relationship i swore i didnt mean that went through hell trying to reassure her finally she believed me but of course i know she did have artificial insemination she was lying or else she wasnt aware of what highley did to her richard said flatly at the hospital the admitting clerk was briskly bright you certainly rate mrs demaio dr highley has given you suite one on the third floor of the west wing thats like going on a vacation youll never dream youre in a hospital he said something about that katie murmured she was not about to confide her fear of hospitals to this woman you may be a bit lonesome up there the other two suites on that floor are empty and dr highley is having the living room of your suite redecorated why i dont know it was done less than a year ago anyhow if you want anything all you have to do is press the buzzer now heres your wheelchair well just whisk you upstairs katie stared i have to use a wheelchair hospital regulations the admitting clerk said firmly john in a wheelchair going up for chemotherapy johns body shrinking as she watched him die the antiseptic hospital smell katie sat down in the chair and closed her eyes there was no turning back the attendant a middleaged volunteer pushed the chair down the corridor to the elevator youre lucky to have dr highley she informed katie his patients get the best care in the hospital they got off the elevator at the third floor the corridor was carpeted in soft green reproductions of monet and matisse paintings hung on the walls in spite of herself katie was reassured the corridor turned to the right youre in the end suite the volunteer explained its kind of far off she wheeled katie into a bedroom the walls were ivory the carpet the same soft green as in the corridor the furniture was antique white printed draperies in shades of ivory and green matched the bedspread oh this is nice katie exclaimed i thought youd like it the nurse will be in in a few minutes why dont you just make yourself comfortable she was gone katie undressed put on a nightgown and warm robe she put her toilet articles in the bathroom and hung her clothes in the closet suddenly she was swaying she held on to the dresser until the lightheaded feeling passed it was probably just the rushing and the aftermath of the trial and lets face it she thoughtapprehension she was in a hospital daddy john the two people shed loved best in the world had gone into the hospital and died no matter how she tried she could not lose that terrible feeling of panic there were four doors in the room the closet door the bathroom door the one leading to the corridor the other one must go into the living room she opened it and glanced in as the admitting clerk had said it was pulled apart the furniture was in the middle of the room covered with painters drop cloths she closed the door and walked over to the window the hospital was ushaped with the two side wings facing each other across the parking lot on monday night shed been exactly opposite where she was now where was the parking stall shed dreamed about oh of coursethat one over to the side directly under the last light post there was a car parked there now a black car just as in her dream those wire spokes on the wheels the way they glinted in the light how are you feeling mrs demaio she spun around dr highley was standing in the room a young nurse was hovering at his elbow oh you startled me im fine doctor he came over to the window and drew the draperies these windows are drafty suppose you sit on the bed and let me check your pressure well want blood samples too the nurse followed him katie noticed that the girls hands were trembling she was obviously in awe of dr highley the doctor wrapped the pressure cuff around katies arm a wave of dizziness made her feel as though the walls of the room were receding she clutched at the mattress is there anything wrong the doctors voice was gentle no not really im just a touch faint he began to pump the bulb nurse renge kindly get a cold cloth for mrs demaios forehead he studied the pressure gauge youre low frankly if you hadnt scheduled this operation im sure youd have had it on an emergency basis the nurse came out of the bathroom with a neatly folded cloth she was biting her lower lip to keep it from quivering katie felt a rush of sympathy for her she neither wanted nor needed a cold compress but she let the nurse put it on her forehead the cloth was soaking and freezing water ran down her hairline a flash of humor raised her spirits she could just see telling richard about this poor scared kid whod practically drowned her richard she should have told him she was coming here she wanted him with her now dr highley drew blood from a vein in her right arm and put the bloodfilled tubes on the tray the nurse held out to him i want these run through immediately he said brusquely yes doctor the nurse scurried out dr highley sighed im afraid that timid young woman is on desk duty tonight but you wont require anything special im sure did you take all the pills i gave you katie realized that she had not taken the threeoclock pill and it was now nearly seven im overdue for the last one theyre in my handbag she glanced at the dresser dont get up ill hand it to you when she took the bag from him she unzipped it fished inside and brought out the small bottle which she held out to him there were just two pills in it dr highley poured a glass of water from the carafe on the night table take these he said he handed her the glass and dropped the empty bottle into his pocket obediently she swallowed the pills feeling his eyes on her his steelrimmed glasses glinted under the overhead light the glint the spokes of the car glinting there was a blur of red on the glass as she laid it down he noticed it reached for her hand and examined her finger the tissue had become damp again whats this he asked oh nothing just a paper cut but it keeps bleeding i see he stood up ive ordered a sleeping pill for later i really prefer not to take sleeping pills doctor im afraid i insist i want you well rested in the morning oh heres your dinner now a thin sixtyish woman carrying a tray came into the room and glanced nervously at the doctor theyre all petrified of him katie thought unlike the usual plastic or metal hospital tray this one was made of white wicker and had a side basket that held the evening newspaper a single red rose stood in a slender vase double loin lamb chops were carefully arranged on the dinner plate the china was delicate the attendant turned to go wait dr highley commanded he said to katie as you will see all my patients are served fare that compares favorably with the food in a firstclass restaurant he frowned then added however i would prefer if you did not eat dinner tonight ive come to believe that the longer a patient fasts before surgery the less likelihood she will experience discomfort after it im not at all hungry katie said fine he nodded to the attendant she picked up the tray and hurried out ill leave you now dr highley told katie at the door he paused oh i regret your phone apparently isnt working the repairman will take care of it in the morning is there anyone you expect to call you here tonight any visitors no my sister is the only one who knows im here and shes at the opera tonight he smiled i see well good night mrs demaio and please relax you can trust me to take care of you im sure i can he was gone she leaned back on the pillow closing her eyes she was floating somewhere her body was drifting like mrs demaio the young voice was apologetic katie opened her eyes it was nurse renge carrying a tray with a pill in a small paper cup youre to take this now its the sleeping pill dr highley said i was to stay and be sure you took it oh katie put the pill in her mouth swallowed water from her carafe then she pulled herself up and went into the bathroom while the nurse turned down the covers in the bathroom she removed the sleeping pill from under her tongue no way she thought id rather be awake than have nightmares she splashed water on her face brushed her teeth and returned to the bedroom she felt so weak so vague the nurse helped her into bed you really are tired arent you just push the buzzer if you need me for anything thank you her head was so heavy nurse renge went to pull down the shade open the drapes and raise the window about an inch wont you katie murmured i like fresh air in my bedroom certainly shall i turn off the light now mrs demaio please she didnt want to do anything except sleep the nurse left katie closed her eyes minutes passed her breathing became even she was not aware of the faint sound when the door from the living room began to open chapter sixteen after gana krupshaks excellent potroast dinner gertrude gratefully accepted a generous slice of homemade chocolate cake i dont usually eat this much she apologized but i havent swallowed a morsel since we found poor edna gana nodded soberly her husband picked up his coffee cup im gonna watch the knicks he announced not ungraciously he settled himself in the living room in front of the television gana sighed the knicks the mets the giants but at least hes here when i come home from bingo i know im not going into an empty place like poor edna always had to i know gertrude thought of her own solitary home then reflected on nan her oldest granddaughter gran why not come to dinner or gran are you going to be home sunday we thought wed drop in to say hello she could have it a lot worse maybe we should go take a look at ednas place gana said i kind of hate to do it but its something you cant avoid ill get the key as they hurried across the courtyard gana thought of ednas lovely imitationleopard coat maybe she could take it home tonight it was hers inside the apartment they became quiet inadvertently they both stared at the spot where ednas crumpled body had lain theres still blood on the radiator gana muttered yes gertrude shook herself get this over with gana went to the closet and removed the leopard coat it did not take them long to finish sharing the contents of the apartment gana had little interest in the furniture what gertrude did not want gana was giving to the salvation army but she was delighted when gertrude suggested she take the silver plate and good china i guess thats it gana sighed except for the jewelry and the police will give that back to us pretty soon the jewelry in the nighttable drawer gertrude thought of dr highley he had started to open that drawer that reminds me she said we never did look there lets make sure we didnt forget anything she pulled it open the police had removed the jewelry box but the deep drawer was not empty a scuffed moccasin lay at the bottom of it now why would edna save that thing gana said she held it up it was stained and out of shape thats it gertrude cried thats what had me mixed up gana looked mystified and gertrude tried to explain mrs demaio asked me if edna called one of the doctors prince charming she didnt of course but edna did tell me how mrs lewis wore terrible old moccasins for her appointments the left shoe was too loose and mrs lewis was always walking out of it edna used to tease her that she must be expecting prince charming to pick up her glass slipper gertrude reflected i wonder could mrs lewis shoe be what dr highley wanted from this drawer you know ive half a mind to go to mrs demaios office and talk to her or at least leave a message somehow i feel i shouldnt wait till monday gana thought of gus who wouldnt have his eyes off the set until midnight her desire for excitement surged tell you what ill drive over there with you gusll never know im gone dannyboy duke zigzagged across third avenue racing toward fiftyfifth and second where he had the car parked the woman had missed her wallet just as he got on the escalator hed heard her scream that man robbed me she had come rushing down the escalator after him shouting and pointing as he went out the door the security guard would probably chase him if he could just get to the car he couldnt ditch the wallet it was stuffed with bills hed seen them and he needed a fix was he being followed he didnt dare look back hed call too much attention to himself in a minute hed be in the car hed drive home to jackson heights and get his fix he looked back no one running no cops last night had been so lousy the doorman had almost grabbed him when he broke into that doctors car and what did he get for his risk no drugs in the bag a medical file a messy paperweight and an old shoe hed have to get rid of it all he was at the car he opened it slipped in he put the key into the ignition turned on the engine then heard the siren as the police car came racing the wrong way up the block he tried to pull out but the squad car cut him off a cop his hand on the butt of his pistol jumped out the cop yanked open the door reached in and pulled out the ignition key well dannyboy he said youre still at it right dont you never learn any new tricks the plane circled over newark the descent was bumpy chris glanced at joan she was holding his hand tightly but he knew it had nothing to do with flying her face was composed chris shed said i cant bear thinking that vangie committed suicide because of me dont worry about dragging me into this tell the truth dont hold anything back if they ever got through this theyd have a good life together joan was a woman he still had so much to learn about her he hadnt even realized he could trust her with the simple truth maybe because hed gotten so used to shielding vangie they were silent as the plane taxied to the gate inside chris was not surprised to see two detectives waiting for himthe same two who had been at the house after he found vangie molly settled back as the orchestra began the overture to otello bill was already totally absorbed but she couldnt relax she glanced around the met was packed as usual overhead the twinkling chandeliers began to fade into darkness at the first intermission shed phone katie she should have insisted on going to see her in the hospital tonight but shed be there in the morning before the operation and make sure katie wasnt too nervous the first act seemed interminable finally intermission came and molly hurried to a phone a few minutes later whitelipped she rushed to bill half sobbing she grabbed his arm somethings wrong the hospital wouldnt put the call through to katies room they said the doctor forbade calls i got the desk and insisted the nurse check on katie she just came back shes a kid shes hysterical katies not in her room katies missing chapter seventeen edgar highley had left katies room with a smile of satisfaction on his face the pills were working the cut on her finger proved that her blood was no longer clotting he went down to the second floor and stopped in to see mrs aldrich the baby was in a crib by her bed her husband was with her dr highley smiled then bent over the child a handsome specimen he proclaimed i dont think well trade him in he knew his humor was heavyhanded but sometimes it was necessary these people were important delano aldrich could direct thousands of dollars of research funds to westlake delano aldrich was staring at his son his face a study in awe and admiration doctor we still cant believe it everyone else said wed never have a child everyone else was obviously wrong her anxiety had been the main problem fukhito had spotted that muscular dystrophy in her fathers family she knew she might be a carrier and she had some fibroid cysts hed taken care of the cysts and shed become pregnant then hed done an early test of the amniotic fluid and had been able to reassure her on the dystrophy question still she was highly emotional shed had two miscarriages over ten years ago so hed put her to bed two months before the birth and it had worked ill stop by in the morning these people would be witnesses for him if there were any questions about katie demaios death but there shouldnt be any questions the dropping blood pressure was a matter of hospital record the emergency operation would take place in the presence of the top nurses on the staff hed ask the emergencyroom surgeon to assist theyd tell the family that it had been impossible to stop the hemorrhaging leaving the aldriches he went to the nurses desk nurse renge she stood up quickly her hands fluttering nervously i am quite concerned about mrs demaio i will be back right after dinner to see the lab report on her blood count i would not be surprised if we have to operate tonight he had made a point of speaking to several people in the lobby and then gone to the restaurant adjacent to the hospital grounds for dinner he wanted to be able later to present the image of a conscientious doctor instead of going home i had dinner next door and went back to the hospital to check on mrs demaio at least we tried at a quarter to eight he was in the restaurant ordering a steak katie had been given the sleeping pill at seven thirty by eight thirty it would be safe to take the last necessary step while he waited for his coffee to be served hed go up the back fire stairs of the hospital to the third floor hed give her a shot of heparin the powerful anticoagulant that combined with the pills would send her blood pressure and blood count plummeting hed come back here and have his coffee pay the bill and then return to the hospital hed take nurse renge up with him to check on katie ten minutes later katie would be in surgery that would be the end of the danger his bag had not shown up it probably never would he had eliminated the salem threat edna had been buried this morning the moccasin in her drawer would mean nothing to whoever disposed of her belongings a terrible week and so unnecessary if hed been allowed to pursue his work openly but now nothing would stand in his way someday he would receive the nobel prize for contributions to medicine not imagined possible singlehandedly he had solved the abortion problem and the sterility problem did you enjoy your dinner doctor the waitress asked very much indeed id like cappuccino please certainly doctor but that will take about ten minutes while youre getting it ill make some phone calls hed be gone less than ten minutes the waitress wouldnt miss him slipping out the side door near the hallway with the telephones and rest rooms he hurried across the parking lot he kept in the shadows he had his key to the fire exit at the rear of the maternity wing no one ever used those stairs he let himself in the stairway was brightly lighted he turned off the switch he could find his way through this hospital blindfolded at the third floor he opened the door and listened there was no sound noiselessly he stepped into the hall an instant later he was in the living room of katies suite that had been another problem hed anticipated suppose someone had accompanied her to the hospitalher sister a friend suppose that person had asked to stay overnight on the sofa bed in the living room by ordering the room repainted hed blocked that possibility planning planning it was everything that afternoon he had left the needle with the heparin in a drawer of an end table under the painters drop cloth a light from the parking lot filtered through the window giving him enough visibility to find the table he reached for the needle now for the most important moment of all he was in the room bending over her the drapery was open faint light was coming into the room her breathing was uneven she must be dreaming he took her arm slipped the needle in squeezed she winced and sighed her eyes cloudy with sleep opened as she turned her head she looked up at him puzzled dr highley she murmured why did you kill vangie lewis scott myerson was more tired than angry since vangie lewis body had been found tuesday morning two other people had died two very decent peoplea hardworking receptionist who deserved a few years of freedom after caring for her aged parents and a doctor who was making a real contribution to medicine they had died because he had not moved fast enough if only he had brought chris lewis in for questioning immediately edna burns and emmet salem would be alive now scott couldnt wait for the chance to get to lewis he and his girl friend had landed at seven they should be here by eight lewis was cool all right knew better than to run thought he could brazen it out knows its all circumstantial but circumstantial evidence can be a lot better than eyewitness testimony when properly presented in court at seven fifty richard walked into scotts office i think weve uncovered a cesspool he said and its called the westlake maternity concept if youre saying that the shrink was probably playing around with vangie lewis i agree scott said thats not what im talking about said richard its highley im after i think hes experimenting with his patients i just spoke to the husband of one of them hes been thinking that his wife agreed to artificial insemination without his permission i think it goes beyond that i think highley is performing artificial insemination without his patients knowledge scott snorted you think highley would inject vangie lewis with the semen of an oriental and expect to get away with it maybe he made a mistake doctors dont make mistakes like that even allowing your theory to be trueand frankly i dont buy itthat doesnt make him vangies murderer look well investigate westlakes maternity clinic if we find any kind of violation there well prosecute but right now chris lewis is my first order of business do this richard persisted go back further with the check on highley im already looking into the malpractice suits against him but newsmaker said he was in liverpool in england before he came here lets phone there and see what we can find scott shrugged sure go ahead the buzzer on his desk sounded he switched on the intercom bring him in he said leaning back in his chair he looked at richard the bereaved widower captain lewis is here with his paramour dannyboy duke sat in the precinct house miserably hunched forward in a chair he was trembling and perspiring in another thirty seconds hed have gotten away hed be in his apartment now feeling the blissful release of the fix instead this steamy hell give me a break he whispered the cops werent impressed you give us a break danny theres blood on this paperweight whod you hit with it i dont know what youre talking about danny said sure you do the doctors bag was in your car we know you stole it last night the doorman at the carlyle hotel can identify you but whod you hit with that paperweight danny and what about that shoe since when do you save beatup shoes it was in the bag danny said the two detectives looked at each other the younger one shrugged and turned to the newspaper on the desk behind him the other dropped the file he had been examining back into the bag all right danny were calling dr salem to find out just what he had in this bag thatll settle it the younger detective looked up from the paper dr salem yeah thats the name on the file oh i see the nameplate on the bag says dr edgar highley guess he had some other doctors file the younger detective came over to the table carrying the daily news he pointed to page three salems the doctor whose body was found at the essex house last night the police officers looked at dannyboy with renewed interest h e watched katies eyes close her breathing become even shed fallen asleep again the question about vangie had come from her subconscious triggered perhaps by a duplication of her mental state of monday night suppose she asked it again in the operating room before they anesthetized her he had to kill her before nurse renge made her check in less than an hour after the coumadin pills she had taken the heparin shot would further act to anticoagulate her blood he had planned on several hours to complete the procedure now he couldnt wait he had to give her a second shot immediately he had heparin in his office hed have to go down the fire stairs to the parking lot use the private door to his office refill the hypodermic and come back up here it would take at least five minutes the waitress would question his absence from the table but there was no help for that satisfied that katie was asleep he hurried from the room the technician in the valley county forensic lab worked overtime on friday evening dr carroll had asked him to compare all microscopic samples from the home of the presumed suicide vangie lewis with all microscopic samples from the home of the presumed accident victim edna burns the technician had a superb instinct for microscopic evidence a hunch factor that rarely failed him he was particularly interested in loose hair and he was fond of saving its astonishing how much hair we are constantly shedding sifting the vacuumbag contents from the lewis home he found many strands of the ashblond hair of the victim and hed discovered a fair quantity of medium brown hairundoubtedly the husbands but there were also a number of silverish sandy hairs in the victims bedroom the length suggested that the hair was a mans some of the same strands were on the coat the victim had been wearing and then the technician found the connection richard carroll had been seeking several sandy hairs with silver roots were clinging to the faded blue bathrobe of edna bums the technician reached for the phone to call dr carroll chapter eighteen she tried to wake up there was a click a door had closed someone had just been here her arm hurt dr highley she dropped off what had she said to dr highley katie woke up a few minutes later and remembered the black car and the shiny spokes and the light on his glasses shed seen him put vangie lewis in his trunk monday night dr highley had killed vangie and now he knew she knew about him why had she asked him that question hed be back she had to get out of here he was going to kill her too help she needed help why was she so weak her finger was bleeding the pills he had given her since shed been taking them shed been so sick the pills were making her bleed oh god help me please the phone katie fumbled for it knocked it over she pulled it up by the cord put the receiver to her ear the line was dead highley had said the phone was being repaired she pushed the bell for the nurse the nurse would help her but there was no click to indicate that the light was on outside her door she was sure the signal wasnt lighting the nurses panel either she had to get out of here before highley came back fighting waves of dizziness she stood up shed go down to the second floor there were people thereother patients nurses from nearby a door closed he was coming back frantically katie looked at the open door to the corridor hed see her if she went out there stumbling to the livingroom door she opened it got inside closed it before he came into the bedroom where could she go she couldnt stay here she heard a door open inside he was in the bathroom looking for her hide under the drop cloth no hed find her drag her out dizziness clawed at the space behind her eyes her legs were rubbery she stumbled to the door that led to the hall there was a fire exit there shed seen it when she was wheeled in shed go down that way to the second floor shed get help the door to the fire stairs was heavy she tugged at it tugged again reluctantly it gave way she stepped inside it closed so slowly would he see it closing the stairs it was so dark here terribly dark she grabbed the banister the stairs were steep there was a landing after eight steps another short flight then she was at the door she tried the handle it was locked it could be opened only from the other side then she heard the thirdfloor door open and heavy footsteps coming down the stairs chris refused to call a lawyer he sat opposite the prosecutor he looked at the two detectives who had met him at the airport i have nothing to hide he said scott was unimpressed a young man carrying a stenographers pad came into the room sat down and took out a pen scott looked directly at chris captain lewis it is my duty to inform you that you are a suspect in the deaths of vangie lewis edna burns and dr emmet salem you may remain silent you are not required to answer any questions you are entitled to the services of a lawyer any statement that you make can be used against you is that perfectly clear yes scott shoved a paper across the desk this is a copy of the miranda warning you have just heard please read it carefully be sure you understand it if you are so disposed sign it chris read the statement signed it and handed it back he braced himself for scotts question did you murder your wife vangie lewis chris looked directly at him i did not murder my wife i do not know if she was murdered but i do know this if she died before midnight monday she did not kill herself in our home scott charley and phil were astonished as chris calmly said i was there a short time after midnight monday vangie was not home i returned to new york at eleven the next morning i found her on the bed it wasnt until the funeral director told me the time of death that i realized her body must have been returned to our house but even before that i knew something was wrong my wife would never have worn the shoes she was wearing when she was found her right leg and foot were badly swollen and the only shoes she could wear were a pair of battered moccasins it was easier than he had expected the questions came at him you left the motel at eight monday night and returned at ten where did you go to a movie in greenwich village after i got back to the motel i couldnt sleep i decided to drive home and talk to vangie that was shortly before midnight then the hammerblow did you know your wife was carrying an oriental fetus oh my god horror mingled with a sense of release flooded over chris it hadnt been his baby an oriental fetus that psychiatrist oh the poor kid that must have been why she had called dr salem she wanted to hide you didnt know she was involved with another man no no why did you go to edna burnss apartment tuesday night wait pleasecan we take this just the way it happened coffee was brought in and he began to sip it it helped edna burns called me tuesday night just after i realized that vangie must have died before she was brought home miss burns was almost incoherent she rambled on about cinderella and prince charming said she had something for me and that she had a story for the police i thought she might know who vangie had been with i drove to her apartment complex some kid pointed out where she lived i rang the bell and knocked the television was on the light was on but she didnt answer i figured shed passed out and there was no use trying to talk to her i went home what time was that about nine thirty all right what did you do then more questions one after another he drank more coffee truth the simple truth it was so much easier than evasion he took a deep breath they were asking about dr salem richard sat at katies desk as he waited for the head of personnel of christ hospital in devon england to answer his phone only by emphasizing his need to talk to someone who had been in authority at the hospital for more than ten years had he been given the mans private number yes an angry sleepy voice had answered richard introduced himself and went directly to the point sir i apologize for calling you at this hour but the matter is vital this is a transatlantic call i must have information about dr edgar highley the mans voice became wary what do you want to know i have just spoken with queen mary clinic in liverpool and was surprised to learn that dr highley had been on staff there a relatively short time we had been led to believe otherwise however i was told that dr highley was a member of the christ hospital staff for at least nine years is that accurate edgar highley interned with us after his graduation from cambridge then became staff he is a brilliant doctor why did he leave after his wifes death he relocated in liverpool then we heard that he had emigrated to the united states sir i cant waste time being discreet i believe that dr highley may be experimenting with his pregnant patients is there any information you can offer to support that possibility the words that came next were slow and deliberate while he was with us dr highley was deeply involved in prenatal research he did quite brilliant experiments on embryos of frogs and mammals then a fellow doctor began to suspect that he was experimenting with aborted human fetuseswhich is of course illegal what was done about it he was watched very carefully then a tragedy occurred dr highleys wife died suddenly there was the suspicion that he had implanted her with an aborted fetus dr highley was asked to resign this is absolutely confidential there is no proof richard absorbed what he had heard his hunch had been right a question came into his minda long shot sir do you by any chance know a dr emmet salem the voice warmed of course a good friend dr salem was visiting staff here at the time of the highley scandal silently katie ran down the status to the main floor desperately she grasped the knob tried to open the door but it was locked upstairs the footsteps had paused he was trying the secondfloor knob making sure that she had not escaped him the footsteps started again he was coming down through these heavy doors no one would hear her if she screamed she felt dull pain in her pelvic area whatever he had given her had started the hemorrhaging she was dizzy but she had to get away wildly she began rushing down the staircase one more flight it probably led to the basement hed have to explain how and why shed gotten there the farther she got the more questions would be asked she stumbled on the last stair dont fall dont make it look like an accident but shed be trapped down here another door this one would be locked too she tried the knob he was coming dark as it was she could sense a presence rushing down at her the door opened the corridor was dimly lighted she was in the basement she saw rooms ahead the door snapped closed behind her could she hide somewhere help me help me there was a switch on the wall she turned it off the corridor disappeared into blackness then a few feet behind her the door from the stairwell burst open highley was suspected of causing his first wifes death winifred westlakes cousin believed he had caused winifreds death highley was a brilliant researcher highley may have been experimenting on some of his patients highley may have injected vangie lewis with the semen of an oriental male but why would he try to accuse fukhito or had vangie been involved with fukhito was highleys possible experimentation only incidental to vangies pregnancy richard could not find the answers he sat at katies desk twirling her pen he wished he knew where she was he wanted to talk to her there was a soft knock on the door and maureen looked in her eyes were emerald green large and oval beautiful eyes dr carroll maureen im sorry i asked you to stay i thought mrs horan would be here long ago she phoned shes on her way something came up at work and they needed her but there are two women here theyre friends of edna burns they wanted to see katie one of them mrs fitzgerald said she met you the other night at the burns apartment right tell them to come on in if its anything much well make them wait to talk to scott they entered the office together ganas eyes snapping with excitement gertrude was carrying the moccasin in a paper bag her gray hair was neatly in place she leaned forward shook the bag and the shabby moccasin fell onto katies desk primly she began to explain that shoe is the reason we are here she zigzagged down the corridor would he know where the light switch was he knew this hospital where would she go there had been a door at the end of the hall if she ran straight shed get to it maybe she could lock herself in there somehow maybe hed try the other doors first he was standing still he was listening for her her outstretched hand touched a cold wall then a doorframe her hand found a knob she turned it a heavy formaldehyde smell filled her nostrils from behind her she heard rushing feet she stepped inside and tried to push the door closed but she was so dizzy she stumbled and fell she reached out her hand touched a pant leg its all over katie dr highley said are you sure this is your wifes shoe scott demanded wearily chris nodded i am absolutely certain this is the one that was so loose on her the left one when edna burns phoned you did she tell you she had this no she said she had something to tell the police and that she wanted to talk to me all right your statement will be typed immediately read it carefully sign it if you find it accurate and then you can go home well want to talk with you again tomorrow morning for the first time chris felt as though the prosecutor had begun to believe him he got up to go where is joan shes completed a statement she can go with you oh one thing what impression do you have of dr highley i never met him did you read this article scott held up a copy of newsmaker magazine chris looked at the picture of dr highley i saw this yesterday on the plane into new york memory jogged thats it thats what i couldnt place hes the man who got off the elevator at the essex house last night when i was trying to reach dr salem he switched on a light and stood staring down at her his sandy hair falling untidily on his forehead she managed to stumble to her feet she was in a small area like a waiting room it was so cold a thick steel door was behind her she shrank back against it youve made it so easy for me mrs demaio now he was smiling at her everyone knows about your fear of hospitals when nurse renge and i make rounds in a few minutes well assume you left the hospital certainly no one will dream of looking for you in the morgue an old man died in the emergency room tonight hes in one of those vaults tomorrow when the undertaker comes for his body youll be found on the floor what happened will be obvious you were hemorrhaging you became disoriented tragically you wandered down here and bled to death no his face was blurring she was dizzy swaying he opened the steel door pushed her through it held her as she slid down she had fainted kneeling beside her he injected the last shot of heparin she probably wouldnt regain consciousness even if she did she couldnt get out from this side the door was locked he closed it and turned out the light at last he was finished with katie demaio cautiously he opened the door into the corridor and hurried out into the parking lot by the fire exit through which hed entered fifteen minutes before moments later he was drinking lukewarm cappuccino waving away the offer of the waitress to bring him a hot cup my calls took a bit longer than i expected he explained and now i must hurry back to the hospital theres a patient there about whom im quite concerned chapter nineteen good night dr fukhito i feel much better thank you the boy managed a smile im glad sleep well tonight tom jiro fukhito got up slowly from his desk at the valley pines psychiatric clinic where he did volunteer work this young man had been in deep depression for weeks nearly suicidal hed been doing eighty miles an hour in a car that crashed his younger brother had been killed fukhito knew he had helped the boy get through it the work he did here with disturbed children was so satisfying he reflected as he walked toward the elevator and now hed been asked to join the staff he wanted to accept that offer should he start the investigation that would destroy him edgar highley would instantly reveal the massachusetts case if he found that fukhito had taken his suspicions to the police he got into his car sat there thinking vangie lewis did not commit suicide she absolutely did not willingly drink cyanide she had gotten on the subject of the jones cult during one of their sessions those cults theyre all crazy remember all those people who killed themselves because they were told to did you hear the tape of them screaming after they drank that stuff i had nightmares about it and they looked so ugly pain ugliness vangie lewis never jiro fukhito sighed he knew that he had to tell the police about vangie she had run out of his office toward the parking lot but when he left fifteen minutes later her lincoln continental was still there there was no longer any doubt in fukhitos mind vangie had gone into edgar highleys office he drove out of the clinics parking lot and turned in the direction of the valley county prosecutors office scott held the moccasin richard charley and phil sat around his desk lets try to put this together scott said the last known place vangie lewis visited was dr fukhitos office she was wearing the moccasins somewhere in the hospital she lost one of them and edna burns found it whoever brought her home put other shoes on her to try to cover up for the missing one edna burns found the missing shoe and edna burns died emmet salem wanted to talk to richard about vangies death he fell or was pushed to his death and the file he was carrying on vangie lewis disappeared and chris lewis swears that he saw edgar highley in the essex house richard interjected which may or may not be true scott reminded him but dr salem knew about the scandal in christ hospital richard said highley wouldnt want that to come out thats no motive to kill scott said how about highley trying to get the shoe charley asked we dont know that the woman from his office claimed he was opening the drawer he didnt touch anything scott frowned were dealing with a prominent doctor we cant go off halfcocked the big problem is motive highley had no motive to kill vangie lewis the intercom buzzed scott switched it on mrs horan is here to see dr carroll maureen said all right bring her into my office scott directed and i want you to take down her statement richard leaned forward this was the woman who had filed the malpractice suit against edgar highley the door opened and a young japanese woman preceded maureen into the room her hair fell loosely on her shoulders her delicate graceful carriage gave a floating effect even to the inexpensive pantsuit she was wearing scott stood up wont you sit down mrs horan she nodded clearly nervous she deliberately folded her hands in her lap maureen sat behind her with her steno pad mrs horan you were dr highleys patient scott asked richard turned suddenly as he heard maureen gasp but the girl quickly recovered and bending forward resumed taking her notes anna horans face hardened yes i was that murderers patient that murderer scott said now her words came in a torrent i went to him five months ago i was pregnant my husband is a law student we live on my salary i didnt want to but i decided i had to have an abortion scott sighed and now youre blaming dr highley no he told me to come back the next day and i did he brought me to an operating room he left me and i knewi knewthat no matter how we managed i wanted my baby dr highley came back i was sitting up i told him id changed my mind he said lie down he pushed me down on the table was anyone else in the room the nurse no just the doctor and me and you allowed him to persuade you no no i dont know what happened he jabbed me with a needle while i was trying to get up when i woke up i was lying on a stretcher the nurse said it was all over you dont remember the procedure nothing the last i remember is trying to get away trying to save my baby dr highley took my baby from me a harsh cry echoed anna horans heartbroken sobs maureens voice was a wail thats exactly what he did to me richard stared at the weeping women the japanese girl maureen with her redgold hair and emeraldgreen eyes and with absolute certainty he knew where he had seen those eyes before when edgar highley reached the second floor of the hospital he instantly felt the tension in the air frightenedlooking nurses scurried in the hall a man and woman in evening dress were standing by the nurses desk quickly he walked over his voice was brittle nurse renge is there something wrong doctor its mrs demaio shes missing the woman in evening clothes must be katie demaios sister what had made her come to the hospital im dr highley he said to her what does this mean molly found it hard to talk katie her voice broke her husband interrupted im dr kennedy he said my wife is mrs demaios sister when did you see mrs demaio doctor and what was her condition this was not a man to be easily deceived i saw mrs demaio earlier this evening and her condition was not good as you probably know shes had two units of whole blood this week the laboratory is analyzing her blood now i expect the count to be low so i plan to perform surgery tonight i think mrs demaio has been concealing the extent of her hemorrhaging oh god then where is she molly cried he looked at her your sister has an almost pathological fear of hospitals is it possible that she would simply leave its possible bill said slowly doctor nurse renge spoke up that sleeping pill should have put her to sleep it was the strongest one ive ever seen he glowered at her i ordered it because i understood mrs demaios anxiety you were told to see that she took it i saw her put it in her mouth did you watch her swallow it no not really he turned his back on the nurse and spoke to molly and bill his voice reflective concerned i hardly think mrs demaio is wandering around the hospital do you agree that she might simply have walked out among the visitors yes yes i do molly prayed please let it be that way i want to see if her car is in the parking lot bill said the car he hadnt thought about her car if they started looking for her in the hospital now bill frowned oh hell shes still got that loan car molly what make is it i dont think ive even seen it i i dont know molly said edgar highley sighed i suggest that you phone her home if shes not there go and wait for her to come in shes scarcely been gone an hour now when you do find her please insist she return to the hospital mrs demaio is a very sick girl molly bit her lip i see thank you doctor bill lets just go to her house she could he there and not answering the telephone they believed him they would not suggest searching the hospital for several hours and that was all he needed he turned to the nurse i am sure that well be hearing from mrs demaio shortly call me immediately when you do ill be at my home he smiled i have some records to complete we must seize dr highleys records before he has a chance to destroy them does he keep all his records in his office jiro fukhito stared at richard he had gone to the prosecutors office to make a statement they had listened to him almost impatiently and then dr carroll had outlined his incredible theory was it possible fukhito reviewed the times when suspicions had formed in his mind yes it was possible records they had asked him about records highley frequently takes files to his home he said have search warrants sworn out immediately scott told charley ill take the squad to the house richard you come with me charley you and phil take the office pick up highley as a material witness if hes not there well nab him as soon as he gets home what worries me is that he may be experimenting on someone now richard said he wished katie were here shed be relieved to know that chris lewis had been eliminated as a suspect dr fukhito stood up do you need me any longer not right now doctor scott said well be in touch with you if by any chance you happen to hear from dr highley before we arrest him please do not discuss this investigation with him dr fukhito smiled wearily edgar highley and i are not friends he would have no reason to call me at home he hired me because he knew hed have a hold over me how right he was he left the room as he walked down the corridor he saw a nameplate on a door mrs k demaio katie demaio wasnt she supposed to have gone into the hospital tonight but of course she never would go through with her operation while edgar highley was under investigation jiro fukhito went home she was drifting down a dark corridor at the very end there was a light it would be warm when she got there warm and safe but something was holding her back before she died she had to make them know what dr highley was her finger was dripping blood she could feel it shed smear highleys name on the floor he was insane he had to be stopped slowly painfully katie moved her finger down across down again h he got home at quarter past nine having at last eliminated the final threat he was feeling buoyant he had finished eating less than an hour ago but somehow could not even remember the meal perhaps hilda had left something for a snack it was better than he had hoped fondue hilda made remarkably good fondue he lit the stemo can under the pot adjusted it to a low flame a crisp loaf of french bread was in a basket covered by a damask napkin hed make a salad while the fondue heated he would complete katie demaios file he was anxious to be finished with it he wanted to think about tomorrows two patients the donor and the recipient he was confident that he could duplicate his success he went into the library opened the desk drawer and withdrew katie demaios file from its compartment he made a final entry patient entered hospital at pm with blood pressure hemoglobin no more than grams this physician administered the final two coumadin pills at pm at this physician returned to mrs demaios room and administered ml heparin injection mrs demaio awakened briefly in a near comatose state she asked why did you kill vangie lewis this physician left to obtain more heparin when this physician returned patient had left room in attempt to escape patient was apprehended and another ml of heparin was administered patient will hemorrhage to death tonight in westlake hospital this file is now closed he put down his pen stretched walked over to the wall safe and opened it bathed in light from the crystal sconces the buffcolored files inside took on an almost golden sheen they were golden the records of his genius expansively he lifted them all out and laid them on his desk savoring his great successes berkeley and lewis then his face darkened at the sight of the failures appleton carey drake elliot over eighty of them but not really failures he had learned so much and they had all contributed those who had died those who had aborted from somewhere in the distance a sound was beginning to penetrate the library the wail of a siren he hurried to the window snatched back the drapery and glanced out a police car had pulled into the driveway had katie been found had she been able to talk running to the desk he stacked the files replaced them in the safe closed it and pushed back the panel calm he must be calm if katie had talked it was all over all the possibilities and consequences were exploding in his mind and then it came the icy calm the sense of power the godlike omniscience that never failed him during difficult surgery there was a sharp rap at the door slowly deliberately he smoothed his hair then tightened the knot in his tie he walked to the front door and opened it chapter twenty in highleys driveway the two detectives who were in the front seat of the squad car jumped out as he and scott followed richard noticed the movement of a drapery in a window at the far right of the house they had parked behind a black car with md plates scott touched the hood its still warm he hasnt been here long the younger detective rapped sharply on the front door they waited the door opened edgar highley was standing in the foyer scott spoke first dr highley yes the tone was cold and questioning dr highley im scott myerson the valley county prosecutor we have a search warrant for these premises and it is my duty to inform you that you have become a suspect in the deaths of vangie lewis edna burns and dr emmet salem you have the right to consult a lawyer you can refuse to answer questions anything you say may be used against you suspect they werent sure they hadnt found katie with controlled fury he said come in gentlemen i will answer any questions you have and you are welcome to search my home however when i consult a lawyer it will be to bring suit against valley county and against each one of you personally he led them into the library he knew he looked imposing sitting behind the massive jacobean desk it was vital that he unnerve them make them afraid to question too closely with a gesture of contempt he waved them to the leather couch and chairs scott myerson handed him the printed miranda warning scornfully he signed it myerson and dr carroll sat down the other two did not well proceed with the search the older detective said politely where do you keep your medical records dr highley at my office of course he snapped however please satisfy yourselves he stood up walked to the bar and poured scotch and water into a crystal tumbler then he sat down in the highbacked striped velvet chair near the fireplace sipped the scotch and eyed them coldly the questions began did mrs lewis enter your office after leaving dr fukhito last monday night as i told mrs demaio they had absolutely no proof where were you that night doctor home i came home directly after my office hours were you in edna burnss apartment on tuesday night his smile contemptuous hardly well want some hair samples from you hair samples had some been found in ednas apartment but hed been there with the police on wednesday night and vangie always wore that black coat to the office if strands of his hair had been found near the dead women they could be explained were you in the essex house last night after five oclock absolutely not we have a witness who is prepared to swear that he saw you get off the elevator there at approximately five thirty who had seen him he had glanced around the lobby as he got off the elevator he was certain that no one he knew was there maybe they were bluffing i was not in the essex house last night i was at the carlyle i dine there frequently in fact my medical bag was stolen while i was dining there hed make it seem that he was cooperating what was in your bag the question seemed perfunctory a basic emergency kit a few drugs hardly worth a thiefs effort should he mention that it contained files no the prosecutor beckoned to the younger investigator get that package out of the car what package highley gripped the glass they sat in silence waiting the detective returned and handed scott a small parcel he pulled off the wrapping paper do you recognize this moccasin doctor careful careful he leaned over examined it the left shoe the one from ednas apartment they had not found his bag certainly not should i recognize it your patient vangie lewis wore this shoe for weeks didnt you ever notice mrs lewis wore a pair of rather shabby shoes i certainly would not recognize one particular shoe did you ever hear of a dr emmet salem the name seems familiar id have to check my records wasnt he on staff with you at christ hospital in devon of course yes he was visiting staff indeed i do remember him how much did they know about christ hospital were you aware mrs lewis was carrying an oriental baby so that was it he said that explains why mrs lewis was becoming terrified of giving birth she knew that she could never make anyone believe her husband was the father now they were asking about anna horan and maureen crowley they were coming close too close those two young women are typical of many who demand abortions and then blame the physician when they experience emotional reactions richard listened bleakly highley was so composed so sure unless they could prove wrongful death in the maternity cases it would be impossible to charge him with anything and make it stick he felt certain theyd never find anything incriminating in highleys records he was far too clever for that scott was asking about the berkeley baby doctor you are aware that elizabeth berkeley gave birth to a baby who has green eyes isnt that a medical improbability when both parents and all four grandparents have brown eyes clearly mr berkeley is not the babys father highley said neither scott nor richard had expected the admission i dont know who the father is highley continued smoothly but it is hardly the obstetricians business to delve into such matters a shame he thought he would have to defer fame a little longer hed never be able to admit the success of the berkeley baby now scott looked at richard sighed and stood up dr highley when you go to your office you will learn that we have seized your records we are concerned at the number of maternity deaths at westlake and that matter is under intensive investigation he was on safe ground i invite minute scrutiny of my patients records i can assure you that the death ratio is remarkably low in consideration of the kinds of cases we handle the smell of the fondue was filling the house unless it was stirred it would surely burn just a few minutes more the phone rang undoubtedly it would be the hospital saying that mrs demaio had not yet returned home and her sister was frantic he picked up the phone dr highley here doctor this is lieutenant weingarden of the seventeenth precinct in new york weve just arrested a man who answers the description of the person who stole a bag from the trunk of your car last night the bag has it been recovered something in his voice was giving him away scott myerson stalked over to the desk and reached for the extension yes and several items in it may lead to far more serious charges than theft doctor will you describe the contents of your bag some medicinea few basic drugs an emergency kit what about a patients file from the office of a dr emmet salem a bloodstained paperweight and an old shoe highley closed his eyes when he spoke his voice was remarkably controlled are you joking i thought youd say that sir were cooperating with the valley county prosecutors office concerning the suspicious death of dr salem ill call the prosecutor now it looks as though the suspect might have killed dr salem during a theft thank you sir he heard scott myerson say on the extension dont hang up slowly highley replaced the receiver it was all over dr carroll was looking at him curiously somehow edgar highley was sure that richard carroll was the man who had become suspicious of him but he had his revenge katie demaios death was his revenge on richard carroll highley smiled i have just remembered that i do have some medical records that might interest you he said he walked over to the bookcase released the spring the panel swung out mechanically he opened the wall safe let them know his genius let them mourn it he lifted out the files stacked them on the desk the prosecutor had hung up the phone they were all staring at him now oh there is another case youll want to have he reached for his drink and sipped it casually as he walked over to the safe the vial was there right in the back hed put it away monday night for possible future use the future was now at the safe he quickly flipped the vial open and dumped the cyanide crystals into his glass as understanding swept over richards face highley held up the glass in a mocking toast richard leaped across the room as highley raised the glass to his lips and gulped down the contents richard knocked the glass away as highley fell but it was too late the four men watched helplessly as highleys screams and groans died into silence the younger detective bolted from the room his face green richard bent over the body highleys face was contorted the protruding gray eyes were open and staring whyd he do it the other detective asked he knew he couldnt murder his way out anymore scott said straightening up richard went over to the desk and scanned the names on the files berkeley lewis these are the records were looking for he opened the berkeley file the first page began elizabeth berkeley age became my patient today she will never conceive her own child i have decided that she will be the next extraordinary patient theres medical history here richard said quietly and thought he could have done so much good scott was standing over the body and when you think that this nut was katies doctor he muttered richard looked up what highley was treating katie she happened to mention it when the phone interrupted him scott picked it up yes he said then tm sorry this is not dr highley who is calling his expression changed molly this is scott myerson whats the matter he listened then covered the mouthpiece with his hand highley admitted katie to westlake tonight and shes missing richard yanked the phone from him molly what do you mean shes missing he listened come on molly katie would never walk out of a hospital you know that wait dropping the phone he frantically scattered the files on the desk near the bottom of the pile he found the one he dreaded demaio kathleen he raced through it his face paling as he read he came to the last paragraph he picked up the phone molly put bill on he ordered bill katie is hemorrhaging somewhere in westlake hospital call the lab well need to hang a bottle of o negative the minute we find her have them ready to analyze a blood sample and crossmatch for four units of whole blood tell them to have an operating room ready ill meet you there he broke the connection and turned to the detective at the desk call the hospital and have them start looking for katie tell them to look everywhereevery room every closet get all available hospital personnel to help every second counts come on richard scott snapped richard grabbed katies file we have to know what hes done to her theyd been seconds too late preventing edgar highleys death would they be too late for katie with scott he hunched in the back of the squad car as it raced through the night katie he thought why didnt you tell me if youd only trusted me told me you were seeing highley id never have let you go near him katie dont die let me find you katie hang on they were at the hospital squad cars were roaring into the parking lot scott and richard dashed up the stairs into the lobby phil his face drawn was commanding the search bill and molly came running in molly was sobbing bill was deadly calm theyve got a reasonable supply of whole blood on hand here have you found her not yet phil answered the door to the fire stairs partly ajar burst open a young policeman ran out shes on the floor in the morgue i think shes gone seconds later richard was cradling her in his arms her skin and lips were ashen he could not get a pulse katie katie bill gripped his shoulder lets get her upstairs well have to work fast if theres any chance at all she was in a tunnel at the end there was a light it was warm at the end of the tunnel it would be so easy to drift there but someone was keeping her from going someone was holding her a voice richards voice hang on katie hang on she wanted so not to turn back it was so hard so dark it would be so much easier to slip away hang on katie sighing she turned and began to make her way back on monday evening richard tiptoed into katies room a dozen roses in his hand shed been out of danger since sunday morning but hadnt stayed awake long enough to say anything her eyes were closed he decided to go out and ask the nurse for a vase just lay them across my chest he spun around katie how do you feel she grimaced at the transfusion apparatus i hear the vampires are picketing im putting them out of business youre better he pulled up a chair he hoped the sudden moisture in his eyes wasnt noticeable she had noticed she gently reached up and brushed a finger across his eyelids before i fall asleep again please tell me what happened why did dr highley kill vangie he was experimenting on his patients taking fetuses from women who had abortions and implanting them in the wombs of sterile women in these past eight years he learned how to immunize a host mother to prevent her from rejecting an alien fetus at least for a few months most cases eventually ended in spontaneous abortion but he did have one complete success after that one success he wanted to break more new ground an oriental woman named anna horan whos married to a caucasian claims he knocked her out and took her fetus when she was unconscious she was right he had vangie lewis in the next room waiting for the implant vangie thought she was simply having some treatment to help her become pregnant highley never expected vangie to retain the oriental fetus so long when her body did not reject the developing fetus he decided to bring it to term who would blame him if vangie had a partly oriental child he was able to suppress the immune system yes and without harm to the developing fetus but the danger to the mother was great hes killed sixteen women vangie was getting terribly sick unfortunately for her she ran into highley last monday evening just as she left fukhito she told him she was going to consult her former doctor in minneapolis that would have been a risk because her gynecologist would know that a natural pregnancy for vangie was a milliontoone shot and when she mentioned emmet salems name she was finished highley knew that dr salem would guess what had happened salem was in england when highleys first wife died he knew about the scandal and now richard said thats enough of that all the rest can wait your eyes are closing again no you said highley had one success yes and if you had stayed five minutes longer at mollys last thursday night and seen the berkeley baby you could guess who it is liz berkeley carried maureen crawleys baby to term maureens baby katie tried to pull herself up easy youll pull that needle out gently he touched her shoulder holding her until she leaned back does maureen know she asked it was only right to tell her and the berkeleys jim has been living with the belief that his wife lied to him about artificial insemination you know how maureen felt about that abortion its been destroying her she went to see her baby shes one happy girl katie she would have given it out for adoption if she had delivered it naturally now that she has seen maryanne sees how crazy the berkeleys are about her shes in seventh heaven what about the mother of vangies baby anna horan is heartbroken enough about the abortion we saw no point in telling her what highley did with her baby shell have other children katie bit her lip richard tell me the truth when they found me how far did they have to go to stop the bleeding youre okay you can still have a dozen kids if you want them his hand reached over to cover hers that hand had been there had pulled her back when she was so near to death that voice had made her want to come back for a long quite moment she looked up at richard oh how i love you she thought how very much i love you his troubled expression changed suddenly into a broad smile obviously he was satisfied at what he saw in her face katie grinned back at him pretty sure of yourself arent you doctor she asked him crisply
