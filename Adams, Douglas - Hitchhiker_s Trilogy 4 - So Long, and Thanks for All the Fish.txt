douglas adams so long and thanks for all the fish douglas adams the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy douglas adams the restaurant at the end of the universe douglas adams life the universe and everything douglas adams so long and thanks for all the fish douglas adams mostly harmless so long and thanks for all the fish for jane with thanks to rick and heidi for the loan of their stable event to mogens and andy and all at huntsham court for a number of unstable events and especially to sonny metha for being stable through all events far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninetytwo million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea this planet has or rather had a problem which was this most of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time many solutions were suggested for this problem but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper which is odd because on the whole it wasnt the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy and so the problem remained lots of the people were mean and most of them were miserable even the ones with digital watches many were increasingly of the opinion that theyd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place and some said that even the trees had been a bad move and that no one should ever have left the oceans and then one thursday nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place this time it was right it would work and no one would have to get nailed to anything sadly however before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred and the idea was lost forever this is her story chapter that evening it was dark early which was normal for the time of year it was cold and windy which was normal it started to rain which was particularly normal a spacecraft landed which was not there was nobody around to see it except some spectacularly stupid quadrupeds who hadnt the faintest idea what to make of it or whether they were meant to make anything of it or eat it or what so they did what they did to everything which was to run away from it and try to hide under each other which never worked it slipped down out of the clouds seemingly balanced on a single beam of light from a distance you would scarcely have noticed it through the lightning and the storm clouds but seen from close to it was strangely beautiful a grey craft of elegantly sculpted form quite small of course one never has the slightest notion what size or shape different species are going to turn out to be but if you were to take the findings of the latest midgalactic census report as any kind of accurate guide to statistical averages you would probably guess that the craft would hold about six people and you would be right youd probably guessed that anyway the census report like most such surveys had cost an awful lot of money and didnt tell anybody anything they didnt already know except that every single person in the galaxy had legs and owned a hyena since this was clearly not true the whole thing had eventually to be scrapped the craft slid quietly down through the rain its dim operating lights wrapping it in tasteful rainbows it hummed very quietly a hum which became gradually louder and deeper as it approached the ground and which at an altitude of six inches became a heavy throb at last it dropped and was quiet a hatchway opened a short flight of steps unfolded itself a light appeared in the opening a bright light streaming out into the wet night and shadows moved within a tall figure appeared in the light looked around flinched and hurried down the steps carrying a large shopping bag under its arm it turned and gave a single abrupt wave back at the ship already the rain was streaming through its hair thank you he called out thank you very he was interrupted by a sharp crack of thunder he glanced up apprehensively and in response to a sudden thought quickly started to rummage through the large plastic shopping bag which he now discovered had a hole in the bottom it had large characters printed on the side which read to anyone who could decipher the centaurian alphabet duty free mega market port brasta alpha centauri be like the twentysecond elephant with heated value in space bark hold on the figure called waving at the ship the steps which had started to fold themselves back through the hatchway stopped reunfolded and allowed him back in he emerged again a few seconds later carrying a battered and threadbare towel which he shoved into the bag he waved again hoisted the bag under his arm and started to run for the shelter of some trees as behind him the spacecraft had already begun its ascent lightning flitted through the sky and made the figure pause for a moment and then hurry onwards revising his path to give the trees a wide berth he moved swiftly across the ground slipping here and there hunching himself against the rain which was falling now with everincreasing concentration as if being pulled from the sky his feet sloshed through the mud thunder grumbled over the hills he pointlessly wiped the rain off his face and stumbled on more lights not lightning this time but more diffused and dimmer lights which played slowly over the horizon and faded the figure paused again on seeing them and then redoubled his steps making directly towards the point on the horizon at which they had appeared and now the ground was becoming steeper sloping upwards and after another two or three hundred yards it led at last to an obstacle the figure paused to examine the barrier and then dropped the bag he was carrying over it before climbing over himself hardly had the figure touched the ground on the other side when there came sweeping out of the rain towards him a machine lights streaming through the wall of water the figure pressed back as the machine streaked towards him it was a low bulbous shape like a small whale surfing sleek grey and rounded and moving at terrifying speed the figure instinctively threw up his hands to protect himself but was hit only by a sluice of water as the machine swept past and off into the night it was illuminated briefly by another flicker of lightning crossing the sky which allowed the soaked figure by the roadside a splitsecond to read a small sign at the back of the machine before it disappeared to the figures apparent incredulous astonishment the sign read my other car is also a porsche chapter rob mckeena was a miserable bastard and he knew it because hed had a lot of people point it out to him over the years and he saw no reason to disagree with them except the obvious one which was that he liked disagreeing with people particularly people he disliked which included at the last count everyone he heaved a sigh and shoved down a gear the hill was beginning to steepen and his lorry was heavy with danish thermostatic radiator controls it wasnt that he was naturally predisposed to be so surly at least he hoped not it was just the rain which got him down always the rain it was raining now just for a change it was a particular type of rain he particularly disliked particularly when he was driving he had a number for it it was rain type he had read somewhere that the eskimos had over two hundred different words for snow without which their conversation would probably have got very monotonous so they would distinguish between thin snow and thick snow light snow and heavy snow sludgy snow brittle snow snow that came in flurries snow that came in drifts snow that came in on the bottom of your neighbours boots all over your nice clean igloo floor the snows of winter the snows of spring the snows you remember from your childhood that were so much better than any of your modern snow fine snow feathery snow hill snow valley snow snow that falls in the morning snow that falls at night snow that falls all of a sudden just when you were going out fishing and snow that despite all your efforts to train them the huskies have pissed on rob mckeena had two hundred and thirtyone different types of rain entered in his little book and he didnt like any of them he shifted down another gear and the lorry heaved its revs up it grumbled in a comfortable sort of way about all the danish thermostatic radiator controls it was carrying since he had left denmark the previous afternoon he had been through types light pricking drizzle which made the roads slippery to vertical light drizzle through to sharply slanting light to moderate drizzle freshening and two finely distinguished varieties of vertical torrential downpour postdownpour squalling cold all the seastorm types between and at once mild and intermediate cold gusting regular and syncopated cabdrumming and now his least favourite of all rain type was a dirty blatter battering against his windscreen so hard that it didnt make much odds whether he had his wipers on or off he tested this theory by turning them off briefly but as it turned out the visibility did get quite a lot worse it just failed to get better again when he turned them back on in fact one of the wiper blades began to flap off swish swish swish flop swish flop swish swish flop swish flop swish flop flop flop scrape he pounded his steering wheel kicked the floor thumped his cassette player till it suddenly started playing barry manilow thumped it again till it stopped and swore and swore and swore and swore and swore it was at the very moment that his fury was peaking that there loomed swimmingly in his headlights hardly visible through the blatter a figure by the roadside a poor bedraggled figure strangely attired wetter than an otter in a washing machine and hitching poor miserable sod thought rob mckeena to himself realizing that here was somebody with a better right to feel hard done by than himself must be chilled to the bone stupid to be out hitching on a filthy night like this all you get is cold wet and lorries driving through puddles at you he shook his head grimly heaved another sigh gave the wheel a turn and hit a large sheet of water square on see what i mean he thought to himself as he ploughed swiftly through it you get some right bastards on the road splattered in his rear mirror a couple of seconds later was the reflection of the hitchhiker drenched by the roadside for a moment he felt good about this a moment or two later he felt bad about feeling good about it then he felt good about feeling bad about feeling good about it and satisfied drove on into the night at least it made up for having been finally overtaken by that porsche he had been diligently blocking for the last twenty miles and as he drove on the rainclouds dragged down the sky after him for though he did not know it rob mckeena was a rain god all he knew was that his working days were miserable and he had a succession of lousy holidays all the clouds knew was that they loved him and wanted to be near him to cherish him and to water him chapter the next two lorries were not driven by rain gods but they did exactly the same thing the figure trudged or rather sloshed onwards till the hill resumed and the treacherous sheet of water was left behind after a while the rain began to ease and the moon put in a brief appearance from behind the clouds a renault drove by and its driver made frantic and complex signals to the trudging figure to indicate that he would have been delighted to give the figure a lift only he couldnt this time because he wasnt going in the direction that the figure wanted to go whatever direction that might be and he was sure the figure would understand he concluded the signalling with a cheery thumbsup sign as if to say that he hoped the figure felt really fine about being cold and almost terminally wet and he would catch him the next time around the figure trudged on a fiat passed and did exactly the same as the renault a maxi passed on the other side of the road and flashed its lights at the slowly plodding figure though whether this was meant to convey a hello or a sorry were going the other way or a hey look theres someone in the rain what a jerk was entirely unclear a green strip across the top of the windscreen indicated that whatever the message was it came from steve and carola the storm had now definitely abated and what thunder there was now grumbled over more distant hills like a man saying and another thing twenty minutes after admitting hes lost the argument the air was clearer now the night cold sound travelled rather well the lost figure shivering desperately presently reached a junction where a side road turned off to the left opposite the turning stood a signpost which the figure suddenly hurried to and studied with feverish curiosity only twisting away from it as another car passed suddenly and another the first whisked by with complete disregard the second flashed meaninglessly a ford cortina passed and put on its brakes lurching with surprise the figure bundled his bag to his chest and hurried forward towards the car but at the last moment the cortina span its wheels in the wet and carreered off up the road rather amusingly the figure slowed to a stop and stood there lost and dejected as it chanced the following day the driver of the cortina went into hospital to have his appendix out only due to a rather amusing mix up the surgeon removed his leg in error and before the appendectomy could be rescheduled the appendicitis complicated into an entertainingly serious case of peritonitis and justice in its way was served the figure trudged on a saab drew to a halt beside him its window wound down and a friendly voice said have you come far the figure turned toward it he stopped and grasped the handle of the door the figure the car and its door handle were all on a planet called the earth a world whose entire entry in the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy comprised the two words mostly harmless the man who wrote this entry was called ford prefect and he was at this precise moment on a far from harmless world sitting in a far from harmless bar recklessly causing trouble chapter whether it was because he was drunk ill or suicidally insane would not have been apparent to a casual observer and indeed there were no casual observers in the old pink dog bar on the lower south side of han dold city because it wasnt the sort of place you could afford to do things casually in if you wanted to stay alive any observers in the place would have been mean hawklike observers heavily armed with painful throbbings in their heads which caused them to do crazy things when they observed things they didnt like one of those nasty hushes had descended on the place a sort of missile crisis sort of hush even the evillooking bird perched on a rod in the bar had stopped screeching out the names and addresses of local contract killers which was a service it provided for free all eyes were on ford prefect some of them were on stalks the particular way in which he was choosing to dice recklessly with death today was by trying to pay for a drinks bill the size of a small defence budget with an american express card which was not acceptable anywhere in the known universe what are you worried about he asked in a cheery kind of voice the expiration date have you guys never heard of neorelativity out here theres whole new areas of physics which can take care of this sort of thing time dilation effects temporal relastatics we are not worried about the expiration date said the man to whom he addressed these remarks who was a dangerous barman in a dangerous city his voice was a low soft purr like the low soft purr made by the opening of an icbm silo a hand like a side of meat tapped on the bar top lightly denting it well thats good then said ford packing his satchel and preparing to leave the tapping finger reached out and rested lightly on the shoulder of ford prefect it prevented him from leaving although the finger was attached to a slablike hand and the hand was attached to a clublike forearm the forearm wasnt attached to anything at all except in the metaphorical sense that it was attached by a fierce doglike loyalty to the bar which was its home it had previously been more conventionally attached to the original owner of the bar who on his deathbed had unexpectedly bequeathed it to medical science medical science had decided they didnt like the look of it and had bequeathed it right back to the old pink dog bar the new barman didnt believe in the supernatural or poltergeists or anything kooky like that he just knew an useful ally when he saw one the hand sat on the bar it took orders it served drinks it dealt murderously with people who behaved as if they wanted to be murdered ford prefect sat still we are not worried about the expiration date repeated the barman satisfied that he now had ford prefects full attention we are worried about the entire piece of plastic what said ford he seemed a little taken aback this said the barman holding out the card as if it was a small fish whose soul had three weeks earlier winged its way to the land where fish are eternally blessed we dont accept it ford wondered briefly whether to raise the fact that he didnt have any other means of payment on him but decided for the moment to soldier on the disembodied hand was now grasping his shoulder lightly but firmly between its finger and thumb but you dont understand said ford his expression slowly ripening from a little taken abackness into rank incredulity this is the american express card it is the finest way of settling bills known to man havent you read their junk mail the cheery quality of fords voice was beginning to grate on the barmans ears it sounded like someone relentlessly playing the kazoo during one of the more sombre passages of a war requiem one of the bones in fords shoulder began to grate against another one of the bones in his shoulder in a way which suggested that the hand had learnt the principles of pain from a highly skilled chiropracter he hoped he could get this business settled before the hand started to grate one of the bones in his shoulder against any of the bones in different parts of his body luckily the shoulder it was holding was not the one he had his satchel slung over the barman slid the card back across the bar at ford we have never he said with muted savagery heard of this thing this was hardly surprising ford had only acquired it through a serious computer error towards the end of the fifteen years sojourn he had spent on the planet earth exactly how serious the american express company had got to know very rapidly and the increasingly strident and panicstricken demands of its debt collection department were only silenced by the unexpected demolition of the entire planet by the vogons to make way for a new hyperspace bypass he had kept it ever since because he found it useful to carry a form of currency that no one would accept credit he said aaaargggh these two words were usually coupled together in the old pink dog bar i thought gasped ford that this was meant to be a class establishment he glanced around at the motley collection of thugs pimps and record company executives that skulked on the edges of the dim pools of light with which the dark shadows of the bars inner recesses were pitted they were all very deliberately looking in any direction but his now carefully picking up the threads of their former conversations about murders drug rings and music publishing deals they knew what would happen now and didnt want to watch in case it put them off their drinks you gonna die boy the barman murmured quietly at ford prefect and the evidence was on his side the bar used to have one of those signs hanging up which said please dont ask for credit as a punch in the mouth often offends but in the interest of strict accuracy this was altered to please dont ask for credit because having your throat torn out by a savage bird while a disembodied hand smashes your head against the bar often offends however this made an unreadable mess of the notice and anyway didnt have the same ring to it so it was taken down again it was felt that the story would get about of its own accord and it had lemme look at the bill again said ford he picked it up and studied it thoughtfully under the malevolent gaze of the barman and the equally malevolent gaze of the bird which was currently gouging great furrows in the bar top with its talons it was a rather lengthy piece of paper at the bottom of it was a number which looked like one of those serial numbers you find on the underside of stereo sets which always takes so long to copy on to the registration form he had after all been in the bar all day he had been drinking a lot of stuff with bubbles in it and he had bought an awful lot of rounds for all the pimps thugs and record executives who suddenly couldnt remember who he was he cleared his throat rather quietly and patted his pockets there was as he knew nothing in them he rested his left hand lightly but firmly on the halfopened flap of his satchel the disembodied hand renewed its pressure on his right shoulder you see said the barman and his face seemed to wobble evilly in front of fords i have a reputation to think of you see that dont you this is it thought ford there was nothing else for it he had obeyed the rules he had made a bona fide attempt to pay his bill it had been rejected he was now in danger of his life well he said quietly if its your reputation with a sudden flash of speed he opened his satchel and slapped down on the bar top his copy of the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy and the official card which said that he was a field researcher for the guide and absolutely not allowed to do what he was now doing want a writeup the barmans face stopped in midwobble the birds talons stopped in midfurrow the hand slowly released its grip that said the barman in a barely audible whisper from between dry lips will do nicely sir chapter the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy is a powerful organ indeed its influence is so prodigious that strict rules have had to be drawn up by its editorial staff to prevent its misuse so none of its field researchers are allowed to accept any kind of services discounts or preferential treatment of any kind in return for editorial favours unless a they have made a bona fide attempt to pay for a service in the normal way b their lives would be otherwise in danger c they really want to since invoking the third rule always involved giving the editor a cut ford always preferred to much about with the first two he stepped out along the street walking briskly the air was stifling but he liked it because it was stifling city air full of excitingly unpleasant smells dangerous music and the sound of warring police tribes he carried his satchel with an easy swaying motion so that he could get a good swing at anybody who tried to take it from him without asking it contained everything he owned which at the moment wasnt much a limousine careered down the street dodging between the piles of burning garbage and frightening an old pack animal which lurched screeching out of its way stumbled against the window of a herbal remedies shop set off a wailing alarm blundered off down the street and then pretended to fall down the steps of a small pasta restaurant where it knew it would get photographed and fed ford was walking north he thought he was probably on his way to the spaceport but he had thought that before he knew he was going through that part of the city where peoples plans often changed quite abruptly do you want to have a good time said a voice from a doorway as far as i can tell said ford im having one thanks are you rich said another this made ford laugh he turned and opened his arms in a wide gesture do i look rich he said dont know said the girl maybe maybe not maybe youll get rich i have a very special service for rich people oh yes said ford intrigued but careful and whats that i tell them its ok to be rich gunfire erupted from a window high above them but it was only a bass player getting shot for playing the wrong riff three times in a row and bass players are two a penny in han dold city ford stopped and peered into the dark doorway you what he said the girl laughed and stepped forward a little out of the shadow she was tall and had that kind of selfpossessed shyness which is a great trick if you can do it its my big number she said i have a masters degree in social economics and can be very convincing people love it especially in this city goosnargh said ford prefect which was a special betelgeusian word he used when he knew he should say something but didnt know what it should be he sat on a step took from his satchel a bottle of that ol janx spirit and a towel he opened the bottle and wiped the top of it with the towel which had the opposite effect to the one intended in that the ol janx spirit instantly killed off millions of the germs which had been slowly building up quite a complex and enlightened civilization on the smellier patches of the towel want some he said after hed had a swig himself she shrugged and took the proffered bottle they sat for a while peacefully listening to the clamour of burglar alarms in the next block as it happens im owed a lot of money said ford so if i ever get hold of it can i come and see you then maybe sure ill be here said the girl so how much is a lot fifteen years back pay for writing two words zarquon said the girl which one took the time the first one once id got that the second one just came one afternoon after lunch a huge electronic drum kit hurtled through the window high above them and smashed itself to bits in the street in front of them it soon became apparent that some of the burglar alarms on the next block had been deliberately set off by one police tribe in order to lay an ambush for the other cars with screaming sirens converged on the area only to find themselves being picked off by copters which came thudding through the air between the citys mountainous tower blocks in fact said ford having to shout now above the din it wasnt quite like that i wrote an awful lot but they just cut it down he took his copy of the guide back out of his satchel then the planet got demolished he shouted really worthwhile job eh theyve still got to pay me though you work for that thing the girl yelled back yeah good number you want to see the stuff i wrote he shouted before it gets erased the new revisions are due to be released tonight over the net someone must have found out that the planet i spent fifteen years on has been demolished by now they missed it on the last few revisions but it cant escape their notice for ever its getting impossible to talk isnt it what she shrugged and pointed upwards there was a copter above them now which seemed to be involved in a side skirmish with the band upstairs smoke was billowing from the building the sound engineer was hanging out of the window by his fingertips and a maddened guitarist was beating on his fingers with a burning guitar the helicopter was firing at all of them can we move they wandered down the street away from the noise they ran into a street theatre group which tried to do a short play for them about the problems of the inner city but then gave up and disappeared into the small restaurant most recently patronized by the pack animal all the time ford was poking at the interface panel of the guide they ducked into an alleyway ford squatted on a garbage can while information began to flood over the screen of the guide he located his entry earth mostly harmless almost immediately the screen became a mass of system messages here it comes he said please wait said the messages entries are being updated over the subetha net this entry is being revised the system will be down for ten seconds at the end of the alley a steel grey limousine crawled past hey look said the girl if you get paid look me up im a working girl and there are people over there who need me i gotta go she brushed aside fords halfarticulated protests and left him sitting dejectedly on his garbage can preparing to watch a large swathe of his working life being swept away electronically into the ether out in the street things had calmed down a little the police battle had moved off to other sectors of the city the few surviving members of the rock band had agreed to recognize their musical differences and pursue solo careers the street theatre group were reemerging from the pasta restaurant with the pack animal telling it they would take it to a bar they knew where it would be treated with a little respect and a little way further on the steel grey limousine was parked silently by the kerbside the girl hurried towards it behind her in the darkness of the alley a green flickering glow was bathing ford prefects face and his eyes were slowly widening in astonishment for where he had expected to find nothing an erased closedoff entry there was instead a continuous stream of data text diagrams figures and images moving descriptions of surf on australian beaches yoghurt on greek islands restaurants to avoid in los angeles currency deals to avoid in istanbul weather to avoid in london bars to go everywhere pages and pages of it it was all there everything he had written with a deepening frown of blank incomprehension he went backwards and forwards through it stopping here and there at various entries tips for aliens in new york land anywhere central park anywhere no one will care or indeed even notice surviving get a job as cab driver immediately a cab drivers job is to drive people anywhere they want to go in big yellow machines called taxis dont worry if you dont know how the machine works and you cant speak the language dont understand the geography or indeed the basic physics of the area and have large green antennae growing out of your head believe me this is the best way of staying inconspicuous if your body is really weird try showing it to people in the streets for money amphibious life forms from any of the worlds in the swulling noxios or nausalia systems will particularly enjoy the east river which is said to be richer in those lovely lifegiving nutrients then the finest and most virulent laboratory slime yet achieved having fun this is the big section it is impossible to have more fun without electrocuting your pleasure centres ford flipped the switch which he saw was now marked mode execute ready instead of the now oldfashioned access standby which had so long ago replaced the appallingly stoneaged off this was a planet he had seen completely destroyed seen with his own two eyes or rather blinded as he had been by the hellish disruption of air and light felt with his own two feet as the ground had started to pound at him like a hammer bucking roaring gripped by tidal waves of energy pouring out of the loathsome yellow vogon ships and then at last five seconds after the moment he had determined as being the last possible moment had already passed the gently swinging nausea of dematerialization as he and arthur dent had been beamed up through the atmosphere like a sports broadcast there was no mistake there couldnt have been the earth had definitely been destroyed definitely definitely boiled away into space and yet here he activated the guide again was his own entry on how you would set about having a good time in bournemouth dorset england which he had always prided himself on as being one of the most baroque pieces of invention he had ever delivered he read it again and shook his head in sheer wonder suddenly he realized what the answer to the problem was and it was this that something very weird was happening and if something very weird was happening he thought he wanted it to be happening to him he stashed the guide back in his satchel and hurried out on to the street again walking north he again passed a steel grey limousine parked by the kerbside and from a nearby doorway he heard a soft voice saying its ok honey its really ok you got to learn to feel good about it look at the way the whole economy is structured ford grinned detoured round the next block which was now in flames found a police helicopter which was standing unattended in the street broke into it strapped himself in crossed his fingers and sent it hurtling inexpertly into the sky he weaved terrifyingly up through the canyoned walls of the city and once clear of them hurtled through the black and red pall of smoke which hung permanently above it ten minutes later with all the copters sirens blaring and its rapidfire cannon blasting at random into the clouds ford prefect brought it careering down among the gantries and landing lights at han dold spaceport where it settled like a gigantic startled and very noisy gnat since he hadnt damaged it too much he was able to trade it in for a first class ticket on the next ship leaving the system and settled into one of its huge voluptuous bodyhugging seats this was going to be fun he thought to himself as the ship blinked silently across the insane distances of deep space and the cabin service got into its full extravagant swing yes please he said to the cabin attendants whenever they glided up to offer him anything at all he smiled with a curious kind of manic joy as he flipped again through the mysteriously reinstated entry on the planet earth he had a major piece of unfinished business that he would now be able to attend to and was terribly pleased that life had suddenly furnished him with a serious goal to achieve it suddenly occurred to him to wonder where arthur dent was and if he knew arthur dent was one thousand four hundred and thirtyseven light years away in a saab and anxious behind him in the backseat was a girl who had made him crack his head on the door as he climbed in he didnt know if it was just because she was the first female of his own species that he had laid eyes on in years or what it was but he felt stupefied with with this is absurd he told himself calm down he told himself you are not he continued to himself in the firmest internal voice he could muster in a fit and rational state you have just hitchhiked over a hundred thousand light years across the galaxy you are very tired a little confused and extremely vulnerable relax dont panic concentrate on breathing deeply he twisted round in his seat are you sure shes all right he said again beyond the fact that she was to him heartthumpingly beautiful he could make out very little how tall she was how old she was the exact shading of her hair and nor could he ask her anything about herself because sadly she was completely unconscious shes just drugged said her brother shrugging not moving his eyes from the road ahead and thats all right is it said arthur in alarm suits me he said ah said arthur er he added after a moments thought the conversation so far had been going astoundingly badly after an initial flurry of opening hellos he and russell the wonderful girls brothers name was russell a name which to arthurs mind always suggested burly men with blond moustaches and blowdried hair who would at the slightest provocation start wearing velvet tuxedos and frilly shirtfronts and would then have to be forcibly restrained from commentating on snooker matches had quickly discovered they didnt like each other at all russell was a burly man he had a blond moustache his hair was fine and blow dried to be fair to him though arthur didnt see any necessity for this beyond the sheer mental exercise of it he arthur was looking pretty grim himself a man cant cross a hundred thousand light years mostly in other peoples baggage compartments without beginning to fray a little and arthur had frayed a lot shes not a junkie said russell suddenly as if he clearly thought that someone else in the car might be shes under sedation but thats terrible said arthur twisting round to look at her again she seemed to stir slightly and her head slipped sideways on her shoulder her dark hair fell across her face obscuring it whats the matter with her is she ill no said russell merely barking mad what said arthur horrified loopy completely bananas im taking her back to the hospital and telling them to have another go they let her out while she still thought she was a hedgehog a hedgehog russell hooted his horn fiercely at the car that came round the corner towards them halfway on to their side of the road making them swerve the anger seemed to make him feel better well maybe not a hedgehog he said after hed settled down again though it would probably be simpler to deal with if she did if somebody thinks theyre a hedgehog presumably you just give em a mirror and a few pictures of hedgehogs and tell them to sort it out for themselves come down again when they feel better at least medical science could deal with it thats the point seems thats no good enough for fenny though fenny you know what i got her for christmas well no blacks medical dictionary nice present i thought so thousands of diseases in it all in alphabetical order you say her name is fenny yeah take your pick i said anything in here can be dealt with the proper drugs can be prescribed but no she has to have something different just to make life difficult she was like that at school you know was she she was fell over playing hockey and broke a bone nobody had ever heard of i can see how that would be irritating said arthur doubtfully he was rather disappointed to discover her name was fenny it was a rather silly dispiriting name such as an unlovely maiden aunt might vote herself if she couldnt sustain the name fenella properly not that i wasnt sympathetic continued russell but it did get a bit irritating she was limping for months he slowed down this is your turning isnt it ah no said arthur five miles further on if thats all right ok said russell after a very tiny pause to indicate that it wasnt and speeded up again it was in fact arthurs turning but he couldnt leave without finding out something more about this girl who seemed to have taken such a grip on his mind without even waking up he could take either of the next two turnings they led back to the village that had been his home though what he would find there he hesitated to imagine familiar landmarks had been flitting by ghostlike in the dark giving rise to the shudders that only very very normal things can create when seen where the mind is unprepared for them and in an unfamiliar light by his own personal time scale so far as he could estimate it living as he had been under the alien rotations of distant suns it was eight years since he had left but what time had passed here he could hardly guess indeed what events had passed were beyond his exhausted comprehension because this planet his home should not be here eight years ago at lunchtime this planet had been demolished utterly destroyed by the huge yellow vogon ships which had hung in the lunchtime sky as if the law of gravity was no more than a local regulation and breaking it no more than a parking offence delusions said russell what said arthur started out of his train of thought she says she suffers from strange delusions that shes living in the real world its no good telling her that she is living in the real world because she just says thats why the delusions are so strange dont know about you but i find that kind of conversation pretty exhausting give her the tablets and piss off for a beer is my answer i mean you can only muck about so much cant you arthur frowned not for the first time well and all this dreams and nightmare stuff and the doctors going on about strange jumps in her brainwave patterns jumps this said fenny arthur whirled round in his seat and stared into her suddenly open but utterly vacant eyes whatever she was looking at wasnt in the car her eyes fluttered her head jerked once and then she was sleeping peacefully what did she say he asked anxiously she said this this what this what how the heck should i know this hedgehog that chimney pot the other pair of don alfonsos tweezers shes barking mad i thought id mentioned that you dont seem to care very much arthur tried to say it as matteroffactly as possible but it didnt seem to work look buster ok im sorry its none of my business i didnt mean it to sound like that said arthur i know you care a lot obviously he added lying i know that you have to deal with it somehow youll have to excuse me i just hitched from the other side of the horsehead nebula he stared furiously out of the window he was astonished that of all the sensations fighting for room in his head on this night as he returned to the home that he had thought had vanished into oblivion for ever the one that was compelling him was an obsession with this bizarre girl of whom he knew nothing other than that she had said this to him and that he wouldnt wish her brother on a vogon so er what were the jumps these jumps you mentioned he went on to say as quickly as he could look this is my sister i dont even know why im talking to you about ok im sorry perhaps youd better let me out this is at the moment he said it it became impossible because the storm which had passed them by suddenly erupted again lightning belted through the sky and someone seemed to be pouring something which closely resembled the atlantic ocean over them through a sieve russell swore and steered intently for a few seconds as the sky blattered at them he worked out his anger by rashly accelerating to pass a lorry marked mckeenas allweather haulage the tension eased as the rain subsided it started with all that business of the cia agent they found in the reservoir when everybody had all the hallucinations and everything you remember arthur wondered for a moment whether to mention again that he had just hitchhiked back from the other side of the horsehead nebula and was for this and various other related and astounding reasons a little out of touch with recent events but he decided it would only confuse matters further no he said that was the moment she cracked up she was in a cafe somewhere rickmansworth dont know what she was doing there but that was where she cracked up apparently she stood up calmly announced that she had undergone some extraordinary revelation or something wobbled a bit looked confused and finally collapsed screaming into an egg sandwich arthur winced im very sorry to hear that he said a little stiffly russell made a sort of grumping noise so what said arthur in an attempt to piece things together was the cia agent doing in the reservoir bobbing up and down of course he was dead but what come on you remember all that stuff the hallucinations everyone said it was a cock up the cia trying experiments into drug warfare or something some crackpot theory that instead of invading a country it would be much cheaper and more effective to make everyone think theyd been invaded what hallucinations were those exactly said arthur in a rather quiet voice what do you mean what hallucinations im talking about all that stuff with the big yellow ships everyone going crazy and saying were going to die and then pop they vanished as the effect wore off the cia denied it which meant it must be true arthurs head went a little swimmy his hand grabbed at something to steady himself and gripped it tightly his mouth made little opening and closing movements as if it was on his mind to say something but nothing emerged anyway continued russell whatever drug it was it didnt seem to wear off so fast with fenny i was all for suing the cia but a lawyer friend of mine said it would be like trying to attack a lunatic asylum with a banana so he shrugged the vogon squeaked arthur the yellow ships vanished well of course they did they were hallucinations said russell and looked at arthur oddly you trying to say you dont remember any of this where have you been for heavens sake this was to arthur such an astonishingly good question that he halfleapt out of his seat with shock christ yelled russell fighting to control the car which was suddenly trying to skid he pulled it out of the path of an oncoming lorry and swerved up on to a grass bank as the car lurched to a halt the girl in the back was thrown against russells seat and collapsed awkwardly arthur twisted round in horror is she all right he blurted out russell swept his hands angrily back through his blowdried hair he tugged at his blond moustache he turned to arthur would you please he said let go of the handbrake chapter from here it was a fourmile walk to his village a further mile to the turning to which the abominable russell had now fiercely declined to take him and from there a further three miles of winding country lane the saab seethed off into the night arthur watched it go as stunned as a man might be who having believed himself to be totally blind for five years suddenly discovers that he had merely been wearing too large a hat he shook his head sharply in the hope that it might dislodge some salient fact which would fall into place and make sense of an otherwise utterly bewildering universe but since the salient fact if there was one entirely failed to do this he set off up the road again hoping that a good vigorous walk and maybe even some good painful blisters would help to reassure him of his own existence at least if not his sanity it was when he arrived a fact he discovered from the steamed and greasy window of the horse and groom pub in which there had hung for many years a battered old guiness clock which featured a picture of an emu with a pint glass jammed rather amusingly down its throat this was the pub at which he had passed the fateful lunchtime during which first his house and then the entire planet earth had been demolished or rather had seemed to be demolished no damn it had been demolished because if it hadnt then where the bloody heck had he been for the last eight years and how he had got there if not in one of the big yellow vogon ships which the appalling russell had just been telling him were merely drug induced hallucinations and yet if it had been demolished what was he currently standing on he jammed the brake on this line of thought because it wasnt going to get him any further than it had the last twenty times hed been over it he started again this was the pub at which he had passed the fateful lunchtime during which whatever it was had happened that he was going to sort out later had happened and it still didnt make sense he started again this was the pub in which this was a pub pubs served drinks and he couldnt half do with one satisfied that his jumbled thought processes had at last arrived at a conclusion and a conclusion he was happy with even if it wasnt the one he had set out to achieve he strode towards the door and stopped a small black wirehaired terrier ran out from behind a low wall and then catching sight of arthur began to snarl now arthur knew this dog and he knew it well it belonged to an advertising friend of his and was called knownothingbozo because the way its hair stood up on its head it reminded people of the president of the united states and the dog knew arthur or at least should do it was a stupid dog could not even read an autocue which way why some people had protested about its name but it should at least have been able to recognize arthur instead of standing there hackles raised as if arthur was the most fearful apparition ever to intrude upon its feeblewitted life this prompted arthur to go and peer at the window again this time with an eye not for the asphyxiating emu but for himself seeing himself for the first time suddenly in a familiar context he had to admit that the dog had a point he looked a lot like something a farmer would use to scare birds with and there was no doubt but that to go into the pub in his present condition would excite comments of a raucous kind and worse still there would doubtless be several people in there at the moment whom he knew all of whom would be bound to bombard him with questions which at the moment he felt illequipped to deal with will smithers for instance the owner of knownothingbozo the nonwonder dog an animal so stupid that it had been sacked from one of wills own commercials for being incapable of knowing which dog food it was supposed to prefer despite the fact that the meat in all the other bowls had had engine oil poured over it will would definitely be in there here was his dog here was his car a grey porsche s with a sign in the back window which read my other car is also a porsche damn him he stared at it and realized that he had just learned something he hadnt known before will smithers like most of the overpaid and underscrupulous bastards arthur knew in advertising made a point of changing his car every august so that he could tell people his accountant made him do it though the truth was that his accountant was trying like hell to stop him what with all the alimony he had to pay and so on and this was the same car arthur remembered him having before the number plate proclaimed its year given that it was now winter and that the event which had caused arthur so much trouble eight of his personal years ago had occurred at the beginning of september less than six or seven months could have passed here he stood terribly still for a moment and let knownothingbozo jump up and down yapping at him he was suddenly stunned by a realization he could no longer avoid which was this he was now an alien on his own world try as he might no one was even to be able to believe his story not only did it sound perfectly potty but it was flatly contradicted by the simplest observable facts was this really the earth was there the slightest possibility that he had made some extraordinary mistake the pub in front of him was unbearably familiar to him in every detail every brick every piece of peeling paint and inside he could sense its familiar stuffy noisy warmth its exposed beams its unauthentic castiron light fittings its bar sticky with beer that people he knew had put their elbows in overlooked by cardboard cutouts of girls with packets of peanuts stapled all over their breasts it was all the stuff of his home his world he even knew this blasted dog hey knownothing the sound of will smithers voice meant he had to decide what do to quickly if he stood his ground he would be discovered and the whole circus would begin to hide would only postpone the moment and it was bitterly cold now the fact that it was will made the choice easier it wasnt that arthur disliked him as such will was quite fun it was just that he was fun in such an exhausting way because being in advertising he always wanted you to know how much fun he was having and where he had got his jacket from mindful of this arthur hid behind a van hey knownothing whats up the door opened and will came out wearing a leather flying jacket that hed got a mate of his at the road research laboratory to crash a car into specially in order to get that battered look knownothing yelped with delight and having got the attention it wanted was happy to forget arthur will was with some friends and they had a game they played with the dog commies they all shouted at the dog in chorus commies commies commies the dog went berserk with barking prancing up and down yapping its little heart out beside itself in transports of ecstatic rage they all laughed and cheered it on then gradually dispersed to their various cars and disappeared into the night well that clears one thing up thought arthur from behind the van this is quite definitely the planet i remember chapter his house was still there how or why he had no idea he had decided to go and have a look while he was waiting for the pub to empty so that he could go and ask the landlord for a bed for the night when everyone else had gone and there it was he hurriedly let himself in with the key he kept under a stone frog in the garden because astoundingly the phone was ringing he had heard it faintly all the way up the lane and had started to run as soon as he realized where the sound was coming from the door had to be forced open because of the astonishing accumulation of junk mail on the doormat it jammed itself stuck on what he would later discover were fourteen identical personally addressed invitations to apply for a credit card he already had seventeen identical threatening letters for non payment of bills on a credit card he didnt have thirtythree identical letters saying that he personally had been specially selected as a man of taste and discrimination who knew what he wanted and where he was going in todays sophisticated jet setting world and would he therefore like to buy some grotty wallet and also a dead tabby kitten he rammed himself through the relatively narrow opening afforded by all this stumbled through a pile of wine offers that no discriminating connoisseur would want to miss slithered over a heap of beach villa holidays blundered up the dark stairs to his bedroom and got to the phone just as it stopped ringing he collapsed panting on to his cold mustysmelling bed and for a few minutes stopped trying to prevent the world from spinning round his head in the way it obviously wanted to when it had enjoyed its little spin and had calmed down a bit arthur reached out for the bedside light not expecting it to come on to his surprise it did this appealed to arthurs sense of logic since the electricity board cut him off without fail every time he paid his bill it seemed only reasonable that they should leave him connected when he didnt sending them money obviously only drew attention to yourself the room was much as he had left it ie festeringly untidy though the effect was muted a little by a thick layer of dust halfread books and magazines nestled amongst piles of halfused towels half pairs of socks reclined in halfdrunk cups of coffee what was once a halfeaten sandwich had now halfturned into something that arthur entirely didnt want to know about bung a fork of lightning through this lot he thought to himself and youd start the evolution of life all over again there was only one thing in the room that was different for a moment or so he couldnt see what the one thing that was different was because it too was covered in a film of disgusting dust then his eyes caught it and stopped it was next to a battered old television on which it was only possible to watch open university study courses because if it tried to show anything more exciting it would break down it was a box arthur pushed himself up on his elbows and peered at it it was a grey box with a kind of dull lustre to it it was a cubic grey box just over a foot on a side it was tied with a single grey ribbon knotted into a neat bow on the top he got up walked over and touched it in surprise whatever it was was clearly giftwrapped neatly and beautifully and was waiting for him to open it cautiously he picked it up and carried it back to the bed he brushed the dust off the top and loosened the ribbon the top of the box was a lid with a flap tucked into the body of the box he untucked it and looked into the box in it was a glass globe nestling in fine grey tissue paper he drew it out carefully it wasnt a proper globe because it was open at the bottom or as arthur realized turning it over at the top with a thick rim it was a bowl a fish bowl it was made of the most wonderful glass perfectly transparent yet with an extraordinary silvergrey quality as if crystal and slate had gone into its making arthur slowly turned it over and over in his hands it was one of the most beautiful objects he had ever seen but he was entirely perplexed by it he looked into the box but other than the tissue paper there was nothing on the outside of the box there was nothing he turned the bowl round again it was wonderful it was exquisite but it was a fish bowl he tapped it with his thumbnail and it rang with a deep and glorious chime which was sustained for longer than seemed possible and when at last it faded seemed not to die away but to drift off into other worlds as into a deep sea dream entranced arthur turned it round yet again and this time the light from the dusty little bedside lamp caught it at a different angle and glittered on some fine abrasions on the fish bowls surface he held it up adjusting the angle to the light and suddenly saw clearly the finely engraved shapes of words shadowed on the glass so long they said and thanks and that was all he blinked and understood nothing for fully five more minutes he turned the object round and around held it to the light at different angles tapped it for its mesmerizing chime and pondered on the meaning of the shadowy letters but could find none finally he stood up filled the bowl with water from the tap and put it back on the table next to the television he shook the little babel fish from his ear and dropped it wriggling into the bowl he wouldnt be needing it any more except for watching foreign movies he returned to lie on his bed and turned out the light he lay still and quiet he absorbed the enveloping darkness slowly relaxed his limbs from end to end eased and regulated his breathing gradually cleared his mind of all thought closed his eyes and was completely incapable of getting to sleep the night was uneasy with rain the rain clouds themselves had now moved on and were currently concentrating their attention on a small transport cafe just outside bournemouth but the sky through which they had passed had been disturbed by them and now wore a damply ruffled air as if it didnt know what else it might not do it further provoked the moon was out in a watery way it looked like a ball of paper from the back pocket of jeans that have just come out of the washing machine and which only time and ironing would tell if it was an old shopping list or a five pound note the wind flicked about a little like the tail of a horse thats trying to decide what sort of mood its in tonight and a bell somewhere chimed midnight a skylight creaked open it was stiff and had to be jiggled and persuaded a little because the frame was slightly rotten and the hinges had at some time in its life been rather sensibly painted over but eventually it was open a strut was found to prop it and a figure struggled out into the narrow gully between the opposing pitches of the roof it stood and watched the sky in silence the figure was completely unrecognizable as the wildlooking creature who had burst crazily into the cottage a little over an hour ago gone was the ragged threadbare dressing gown smeared with the mud of a hundred worlds stained with junk food condiment from a hundred grimy spaceports gone was the tangled mane of hair gone the long and knotted beard flourishing ecosystem and all instead there was arthur dent the smooth and casual in corduroys and a chunky sweater his hair was cropped and washed his chin clean shaven only the eyes still said that whatever it was the universe thought it was doing to him he would still like it please to stop they were not the same eyes with which he had last looked out at this particular scene and the brain which interpreted the images the eyes resolved was not the same brain there had been no surgery involved just the continual wrenching of experience the night seemed like an alive thing to him at this moment the dark earth around him a being in which he was rooted he could feel like a tingle on distant nerve ends the flood of a far river the roll of invisible hills the knot of heavy rainclouds parked somewhere away to the south he could sense too the thrill of being a tree which was something he hadnt expected he knew that it felt good to curl your toes in the earth but hed never realized it could feel quite as good as that he could sense an almost unseemly wave of pleasure reaching out to him all the way from the new forest he must try this summer he thought and see what having leaves felt like from another direction he felt the sensation of being a sheep startled by a flying saucer but it was virtually indistinguishable from the feeling of being a sheep startled by anything else it ever encountered for they were creatures who learned very little on their journey through life and would be startled to see the sun rising in the morning and astonished by all the green stuff in the fields he was surprised to find he could feel the sheep being startled by the sun that morning and the morning before and being startled by a clump of trees the day before that he could go further and further back but it got dull because all it consisted of was sheep being startled by things theyd been startled by the day before he left the sheep and let his mind drift outwards sleepily in developing ripples it felt the presence of other minds hundreds of them thousands in a web some sleepy some sleeping some terribly excited one fractured one fractured he passed it fleetingly and tried to feel for it again but it eluded him like the other card with an apple on it in pelmanism he felt a spasm of excitement because he knew instinctively who it was or at least knew who it was he wanted it to be and once you know what it is you want to be true instinct is a very useful device for enabling you to know that it is he instinctively knew that it was fenny and that he wanted to find her but he could not by straining too much for it he could feel he was losing this strange new faculty so he relaxed the search and let his mind wander more easily once more and again he felt the fracture again he couldnt find it this time whatever his instinct was busy telling him it was all right to believe he wasnt certain that it was fenny or perhaps it was a different fracture this time it had the same disjointed quality but it seemed a more general feeling of fracture deeper not a single mind maybe not a mind at all it was different he let his mind sink slowly and widely into the earth rippling seeping sinking he was following the earth through its days drifting with the rhythms of its myriad pulses seeping through the webs of its life swelling with its tides turning with its weight always the fracture kept returning a dull disjointed distant ache and now he was flying through a land of light the light was time the tides of it were days receding the fracture he had sensed the second fracture lay in the distance before him across the land the thickness of a single hair across the dreaming landscape of the days of earth and suddenly he was upon it he danced dizzily over the edge as the dreamland dropped sheer away beneath him a stupefying precipice into nothing him wildly twisting clawing at nothing flailing in horrifying space spinning falling across the jagged chasm had been another land another time an older world not fractured from but hardly joined two earths he woke a cold breeze brushed the feverish sweat standing on his forehead the nightmare was spent and so he felt was he his shoulders dropped he gently rubbed his eyes with the tips of his fingers at last he was sleepy as well as very tired as to what it meant if it meant anything at all he would think about it in the morning for now he would go to bed and sleep his own bed his own sleep he could see his house in the distance and wondered why this was it was silhouetted against the moonlight and he recognized its rather dull blockish shape he looked about him and noticed that he was about eighteen inches above the rose bushes of one of his neighbours john ainsworth his rose bushes were carefully tended pruned back for the winter strapped to canes and labelled and arthur wondered what he was doing above them he wondered what was holding him there and when he discovered that nothing was holding him there he crashed awkwardly to the ground he picked himself up brushed himself down and hobbled back to his house on a sprained ankle he undressed and toppled into bed while he was asleep the phone rang again it rang for fully fifteen minutes and caused him to turn over twice it never however stood a chance of waking him up chapter arthur awoke feeling wonderful absolutely fabulous refreshed overjoyed to be home bouncing with energy hardly disappointed at all to discover it was the middle of february he almost danced to the fridge found the three least hairy things in it put them on a plate and watched them intently for two minutes since they made no attempt to move within that time he called them breakfast and ate them between them they killed a virulent space disease hes picked up without knowing it in the flargathon gas swamps a few days earlier which otherwise would have killed off half the population of the western hemisphere blinded the other half and driven everyone else psychotic and sterile so the earth was lucky there he felt strong he felt healthy he vigorously cleared away the junk mail with a spade and then buried the cat just as he was finishing that the phone went but he let it ring while he maintained a moments respectful silence whoever it was would ring back if it was important he kicked the mud off his shoes and went back inside there had been a small number of significant letters in the piles of junk some documents from the council dated three years earlier relating to the proposed demolition of his house and some other letters about the setting up of a public inquiry into the whole bypass scheme in the area there was also an old letter from greenpeace the ecological pressure group to which he occasionally made contributions asking for help with their scheme to release dolphins and orcas from captivity and some postcards from friends vaguely complaining that he never got in touch these days he collected these together and put them in a cardboard file which he marked things to do since he was feeling so vigorous and dynamic that morning he even added the word urgent he unpacked his towel and another few odd bits and pieces from the plastic bag he had acquired at the port brasta megamarket the slogan on the side was a clever and elaborate pun in lingua centauri which was completely incomprehensible in any other language and therefore entirely pointless for a duty free shop at a spaceport the bag also had a hole in it so he threw it away he realized with a sudden twinge that something else must have dropped out in the small spacecraft that had brought him to earth kindly going out of its way to drop him right beside the a he had lost his battered and spaceworn copy of the thing which had helped him find his way across the unbelievable wastes of space he had traversed he had lost the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy well he told himself this time i really wont be needing it again he had some calls to make he had decided how to deal with the mass of contradictions his return journey precipitated which was that he would simply brazen it out he phoned the bbc and asked to be put through to his department head oh hello arthur dent here look sorry i havent been in for six months but ive gone mad oh not to worry thought it was probably something like that happens here all the time how soon can we expect you when do hedgehogs stop hibernating sometime in spring i think ill be in shortly after that rightyho he flipped through the yellow pages and made a short list of numbers to try oh hello is that the old elms hospital yes i was just phoning to see if i could have a word with fenella er fenella good lord silly me ill forget my own name next er fenella isnt this ridiculous patient of yours dark haired girl came in last night im afraid we dont have any patients called fenella oh dont you i mean fiona of course we just call her fen im sorry goodbye click six conversations along these lines began to take their toll on his mood of vigorous dynamic optimism and he decided that before it deserted him entirely he would take it down to the pub and parade it a little he had had the perfect idea for explaining away every inexplicable weirdness about himself at a stroke and he whistled to himself as he pushed open the door which had so daunted him last night arthur he grinned cheerfully at the boggling eyes that stared at him from all corners of the pub and told them all what a wonderful time hed had in southern california chapter he accepted another pint and took a pull at it of course i had my own personal alchemist too you what he was getting silly and he knew it exuberance and hall and woodhouse best bitter was a mixture to be wary of but one of the first effects it had is to stop you being wary of things and the point at which arthur should have stopped and explained no more was the point at which he started instead to get inventive oh yes he insisted with a happy glazed smile its why ive lost so much weight what said his audience oh yes he said again the californians have rediscovered alchemy oh yes he smiled again only he said its in a much more useful form than that which in he paused thoughtfully to let a little grammar assemble in his head in which the ancients used to practise it or at least he added failed to practise it they couldnt get it to work you know nostradamus and that lot couldnt cut it nostradamus said one of his audience i didnt think he was an alchemist said another i thought said a third he was a seer he became a seer said arthur to his audience the component parts of which were beginning to bob and blur a little because he was such a lousy alchemist you should know that he took another pull at his beer it was something he had not tasted for eight years he tasted it and tasted it what has alchemy got to do asked a bit of the audience with losing weight im glad you asked that said arthur very glad and i will now tell you what the connection is between he paused between those two things the things you mentioned ill tell you he paused and manoeuvred his thoughts it was like watching oil tankers doing threepoint turns in the english channel theyve discovered how to turn excess body fat into gold he said in a sudden blur of coherence youre kidding oh yes he said no he corrected himself they have he rounded on the doubting part of his audience which was all of it and so it took a little while to round on it completely have you been to california he demanded do you know the sort of stuff they do there three members of his audience said they had and that he was talking nonsense you havent seen anything insisted arthur oh yes he added because someone was offering to buy another round the evidence he said pointing at himself and not missing by more than a couple of inches is before your eyes fourteen hours in a trance he said in a tank in a trance i was in a tank i think he added after a thoughtful pause i already said that he waited patiently while the next round was duly distributed he composed the next bit of his story in his mind which was going to be something about the tank needing to be orientated along a line dropped perpendicularly from the pole star to a baseline drawn between mars and venus and was about to start trying to say it when he decided to give it a miss long time he said instead in a tank in a trance he looked round severely at his audience to make sure it was all following attentively he resumed where was i he said in a trance said one in a tank said another oh yes said arthur thank you and slowly he said pressing onwards slowly slowly slowly all your excess body fat turns to he paused for effect subcoo subyoo subtoocay he paused for breath subcutaneous gold which you can have surgically removed getting out of the tank is hell what did you say i was just clearing my throat i think you doubt me i was clearing my throat she was clearing her throat confirmed a significant part of the audience in a low rumble oh yes said arthur all right and you then split the proceeds he paused again for a maths break fiftyfifty with the alchemist make a lot of money he looked swayingly around at his audience and could not help but be aware of an air of scepticism about their jumbled faces he felt very affronted by this how else he demanded could i afford to have my face dropped friendly arms began to help him home listen he protested as the cold february breeze brushed his face looking livedin is all the rage in california at the moment youve got to look as if youve seen the galaxy life i mean youve got to look as if youve seen life thats what i got a face drop give me eight years i said i hope being thirty doesnt come back into fashion or ive wasted a lot of money he lapsed into silence for a while as the friendly arms continued to help him along the lane to his house got in yesterday he mumbled im very happy to be home or somewhere very like it jet lag muttered one of his friends long trip from california really mucks you up for a couple of days i dont think hes been there at all muttered another i wonder where he has been and whats happened to him after a little sleep arthur got up and pottered round the house a bit he felt woozy and a little low still disoriented by the journey he wondered how he was going to find fenny he sat and looked at the fish bowl he tapped it again and despite being full of water and a small yellow babel fish which was gulping its way around rather dejectedly it still chimed its deep and resonant chime as clearly and mesmerically as before someone is trying to thank me he thought to himself he wondered who and for what chapter at the third stroke it will be one thirtytwo and twenty seconds beep beep beep ford prefect suppressed a little giggle of evil satisfaction realized that he had no reason to suppress it and laughed out loud a wicked laugh he switched the incoming signal through from the subetha net to the ships hifi system and the odd rather stilted singsong voice spoke out with remarkable clarity round the cabin at the third stroke it will be one thirtytwo and thirty seconds beep beep beep he tweaked the volume up just a little while keeping a careful eye on a rapidly changing table of figures on the ships computer display for the length of time he had in mind the question of power consumption became significant he didnt want a murder on his conscience at the third stroke it will be one thirtytwo and forty seconds beep beep beep he checked around the small ship he walked down the short corridor at the third stroke he stuck his head into the small functional gleaming steel bathroom it will be it sounded fine in there he looked into the tiny sleeping quarters one thirtytwo it sounded a bit muffled there was a towel hanging over one of the speakers he took down the towel and fifty seconds fine he checked out the packed cargo hold and wasnt at all satisfied with the sound there was altogether too much crated junk in the way he stepped back out and waited for the door to seal he broke open a closed control panel and pushed the jettison button he didnt know why he hadnt thought of that before a whooshing rumbling noise died away quickly into silence after a pause a slight hiss could be heard again it stopped he waited for the green light to show and then opened the door again on the now empty cargo hold one thirtythree and fifty seconds very nice beep beep beep he then went and had a last thorough examination of the emergency suspended animation chamber which was where he particularly wanted it to be heard at the third stroke it will be one thirty four precisely he shivered as he peered down through the heavily frosted covering at the dim bulk of the form within one day who knew when it would wake and when it did it would know what time it was not exactly local time true but what the heck he doublechecked the computer display above the freezer bed dimmed the lights and checked it again at the third stroke it will be he tiptoed out and returned to the control cabin one thirtyfour and twenty seconds the voice sounded as clear as if he was hearing it over a phone in london which he wasnt not by a long way he gazed out into the inky night the star the size of a brilliant biscuit crumb he could see in the distance was zondostina or as it was known on the world from which the rather stilted singsong voice was being received pleiades zeta the bright orange curve that filled over half the visible area was the giant gas planet sesefras magna where the xaxisian battleships docked and just rising over its horizon was a small cool blue moon epun at the third stroke it will be for twenty minutes he sat and watched as the gap between the ship and epun closed as the ships computer teased and kneaded the numbers that would bring it into a loop around the little moon close the loop and keep it there orbiting in perpetual obscurity one fiftynine his original plan had been to close down all external signalling and radiation from the ship to render it as nearly invisible as possible unless you were actually looking at it but then hed had an idea he preferred it would now emit one single continuous beam pencilthin broadcasting the incoming time signal to the planet of the signals origin which it would not reach for four hundred years travelling at light speed but where it would probably cause something of a stir when it did beep beep beep he sniggered he didnt like to think of himself as the sort of person who giggled or sniggered but he had to admit that he had been giggling and sniggering almost continuously for well over half an hour now at the third stroke the ship was now locked almost perfectly into its perpetual orbit round a little known and never visited moon almost perfect one thing only remained he ran again the computer simulation of the launching of the ships little escapeobuggy balancing actions reactions tangential forces all the mathematical poetry of motion and saw that it was good before he left he turned out the lights as his tiny little cigar tube of an escape craft zipped out on the beginning of its threeday journey to the orbiting space station port sesefron it rode for a few seconds a long pencil thin beam of radiation that was starting out on a longer journey still at the third stroke it will be two thirteen and fifty seconds he giggled and sniggered he would have laughed out loud but he didnt have the room beep beep beep chapter april showers i hate especially however noncommittally arthur grunted the man seemed determined to talk to him he wondered if he should get up and move to another table but there didnt seem to be one free in the whole cafeteria he stirred his coffee fiercely bloody april showers hate hate hate arthur stared frowning out of the window a light sunny spray of rain hung over the motorway two months hed been back now slipping back into his old life had in fact been laughably easy people had such extraordinarily short memories including him eight years of crazed wanderings round the galaxy now seemed to him not so much like a bad dream as like a film he had videotaped from the tv and now kept in the back of a cupboard without bothering to watch one effect that still lingered though was his joy at being back now that the earths atmosphere had closed over his head for good he thought wrongly everything within it gave him extraordinary pleasure looking at the silvery sparkle of the raindrops he felt he had to protest well i like them he said suddenly and for all the obvious reasons theyre light and refreshing they sparkle and make you feel good the man snorted derisively thats what they all say he said and glowered darkly from his corner seat he was a lorry driver arthur knew this because his opening unprovoked remark had been im a lorry driver i hate driving in the rain ironic isnt it bloody ironic if there was a sequitur hidden in this remark arthur had not been able to divine it and had merely given a little grunt affable but not encouraging but the man had not been deterred then and was not deterred now they all say that about bloody april showers he said so bloody nice so bloody refreshing such charming bloody weather he leaned forward screwing his face up as if he was going to say something about the government what i want to know is this he said if its going to be nice weather why he almost spat cant it be nice without bloody raining arthur gave up he decided to leave his coffee which was too hot to drink quickly and too nasty to drink cold well there you go he said and instead got up himself bye he stopped off at the service station shop then walked back through the car park making a point of enjoying the fine play of rain on his face there was even he noticed a faint rainbow glistening over the devon hills he enjoyed that too he climbed into his battered but adored old black golf gti squealed the tyres and headed out past the islands of petrol pumps and on to the slip road back towards the motorway he was wrong in thinking that the atmosphere of the earth had closed finally and for ever above his head he was wrong to think that it would ever be possible to put behind him the tangled web of irresolutions into which his galactic travels had dragged him he was wrong to think he could now forget that the big hard oily dirty rainbowhung earth on which he lived was a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot lost in the unimaginable infinity of the universe he drove on humming being wrong about all these things the reason he was wrong was standing by the slip road under a small umbrella his jaw sagged he sprained his ankle against the brake pedal and skidded so hard he very nearly turned the car over fenny he shouted having narrowly avoided hitting her with the actual car he hit her instead with the car door as he leant across and flung it open at her it caught her hand and knocked away her umbrella which then bowled wildly away across the road shit yelled arthur as helpfully as he cold leapt out of his own door narrowly avoided being run down by mckeenas all weather haulage and watched in horror as it ran down fennys umbrella instead the lorry swept along the motorway and away the umbrella lay like a recently swatted daddylonglegs expiring sadly on the ground tiny gusts of wind made it twitch a little he picked it up er he said there didnt seem to be a lot of point in offering the thing back to her how did you know my name she said er well he said look ill get you another one he looked at her and tailed off she was tallish with dark hair which fell in waves around a pale and serious face standing still alone she seemed almost sombre like a statue to some important but unpopular virtue in a formal garden she seemed to be looking at something other than what she looked as if she was looking at but when she smiled as she did now it was as if she suddenly arrived from somewhere warmth and life flooded into her face and impossibly graceful movement into her body the effect was very disconcerting and it disconcerted arthur like hell she grinned tossed her bag into the back and swivelled herself into the front seat dont worry about the umbrella she said to him as she climbed in it was my brothers and he cant have liked it or he wouldnt have given it to me she laughed and pulled on her seatbelt youre not a friend of my brothers are you no her voice was the only part of her which didnt say good her physical presence there in the car his car was quite extraordinary to arthur he felt as he let the car pull slowly away that he could hardly think or breathe and hoped that neither of these functions were vital to his driving or they were in trouble so what he had experienced in the other car her brothers car the night he had returned exhausted and bewildered from his nightmare years in the stars had not been the unbalance of the moment or if it had been he was at least twice as unbalanced now and quite liable to fall off whatever it is that well balanced people are supposed to be balancing on so he said hoping to kick the conversation off to an exciting start he was meant to pick me up my brother but phoned to say he couldnt make it i asked about buses but the man started to look at the calendar rather than a timetable so i decided to hitch so so so here i am and what i would like to know is how you know my name perhaps we ought to first sort out said arthur looking back over his shoulder as he eased his car into the motorway traffic where im taking you very close he hoped or long away close would mean she lived near him a long way would mean he could drive her there id like to go to taunton she said please if thats all right its not far you can drop me at you live in taunton he said hoping that hed managed to sound merely curious rather than ecstatic taunton was wonderfully close to him he could no london she said theres a train in just under an hour it was the worst thing possible taunton was only minutes away up the motorway he wondered what to do and while he was wondering with horror heard himself saying oh i can take you to london let me take you to london bungling idiot why on earth had he said let in that stupid way he was behaving like a twelveyearold are you going to london she asked i wasnt he said but bungling idiot its very kind of you she said but really no i like to go by train and suddenly she was gone or rather that part of her which brought her to life was gone she looked rather distantly out of the window and hummed lightly to herself he couldnt believe it thirty seconds into the conversation and already hed blown it grown men he told himself in flat contradiction of centuries of accumulated evidence about the way grown men behave do not behave like this taunton miles said the signpost he gripped the steering wheel so tightly the car wobbled he was going to have to do something dramatic fenny he said she glanced round sharply at him you still havent told me how listen said arthur i will tell you though the story is rather strange very strange she was still looking at him but said nothing listen you said that did i oh there are things i must talk to you about and things i must tell you a story i must tell you which would he was thrashing about he wanted something along the lines of thy knotted and combined locks to part and each particular quill to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porpentine but didnt think he could carry it off and didnt like the hedgehog reference which would take more than five miles he settled for in the end rather lamely he was afraid well just supposing he said just supposing he didnt know what was coming next so he thought hed just sit back and listen that there was some extraordinary way in which you were very important to me and that though you didnt know it i was very important to you but it all went for nothing because we only had five miles and i was a stupid idiot at knowing how to say something very important to someone ive only just met and not crash into lorries at the same time what would you say he paused helplessly and looked at her i should do watch the road she yelped shit he narrowly avoided careering into the side of a hundred italian washing machines in a german lorry i think she said with a momentary sigh of relief you should buy me a drink before my train goes chapter there is for some reason something especially grim about pubs near stations a very particular kind of grubbiness a special kind of pallor to the pork pies worse than the pork pies though are the sandwiches there is a feeling which persists in england that making a sandwich interesting attractive or in any way pleasant to eat is something sinful that only foreigners do make em dry is the instruction buried somewhere in the collective national consciousness make em rubbery if you have to keep the buggers fresh do it by washing em once a week it is by eating sandwiches in pubs on saturday lunchtimes that the british seek to atone for whatever their national sins have been theyre not altogether clear what those sins are and dont want to know either sins are not the sort of things one wants to know about but whatever their sins are they are amply atoned for by the sandwiches they make themselves eat if there is anything worse than the sandwiches it is the sausages which sit next to them joyless tubes full of gristle floating in a sea of something hot and sad stuck with a plastic pin in the shape of a chefs hat a memorial one feels for some chef who hated the world and died forgotten and alone among his cats on a back stair in stepney the sausages are for the ones who know what their sins are and wish to atone for something specific there must be somewhere better said arthur no time said fenny glancing at her watch my train leaves in half an hour they sat at a small wobbly table on it were some dirty glasses and some soggy beermats with jokes printed on them arthur got fenny a tomato juice and himself a pint of yellow water with gas in it and a couple of sausages he didnt know why he bought them for something to do while the gas settled in his glass the barman dunked arthurs change in a pool of beer on the bar for which arthur thanked him all right said fenny glancing at her watch tell me what it is you have to tell me she sounded as well she might extremely sceptical and arthurs heart sank hardly he felt the most conductive setting to try to explain to her as she sat there suddenly cool and defensive that in a sort of outofbody dream he had had a telepathic sense that the mental breakdown she had suffered had been connected with the fact that appearances to the contrary nonwithstanding the earth had been demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass something which he alone on earth knew anything about having virtually witnessed it from a vogon spaceship and that furthermore both his body and soul ached for her unbearably and he needed to got to bed with her as soon as was humanly possible fenny he started i wonder if youd like to buy some tickets for our raffle its just a little one he glanced up sharply to raise money for anjie whos retiring what and needs a kidney machine he was being leant over by a rather stiffly slim middleaged woman with a prim knitted suit and a prim little perm and a prim little smile that probably got licked by prim little dogs a lot she was holding out a small book of cloakroom tickets and a collecting tin only ten pence each she said so you could probably even buy two without breaking the bank she gave a tinkly little laugh and then a curiously long sigh saying without breaking the bank had obviously given her more pleasure than anything since some gis had been billeted on her in the war er yes all right said arthur hurriedly digging in his pocket and producing a couple of coins with infuriating slowness and prim theatricality if there was such a thing the woman tore off two tickets and handed them to arthur i do hope you win she said with a smile that suddenly snapped together like a piece of advanced origami the prizes are so nice yes thank you said arthur pocketing the tickets rather brusquely and glancing at his watch he turned towards fenny so did the woman with the raffle tickets and what about you young lady she said its for anjies kidney machine shes retiring you see yes she hoisted the little smile even further up her face she would have to stop and let it go soon or the skin would surely split er look here you are said arthur and pushed a fifty pence piece at her in the hope that that would see her off oh we are in the money arent we said the woman with a long smiling sigh down from london are we no thats all right really he said with a wave of his hand and she started with an awful deliberation to peel off five tickets one by one oh but you must have your tickets insisted the woman or you wont be able to claim your prize theyre very nice prizes you know very suitable arthur snatched the tickets and said thank you as sharply as he could the woman turned to fenny once again and now what about no arthur nearly yelled these are for her he explained brandishing the five new tickets oh i see how nice she smiled sickeningly at both of them well i do hope you yes snapped arthur thank you the woman finally departed to the table next to theirs arthur turned desperately to fenny and was relieved to see that she was rocking with silent laughter he sighed and smiled where were we you were calling me fenny and i was about to ask you not to what do you mean she twirled the little wooden cocktail stick in her tomato juice its why i asked if you were a friend of my brothers or half brother really hes the only one who calls me fenny and im not fond of him for it so whats fenchurch what fenchurch fenchurch she looked at him sternly yes she said and im watching you like a lynx to see if youre going to ask the same silly question that everybody asks me until i want to scream i shall be cross and disappointed if you do plus i shall scream so watch it she smiled shook her hair a little forward over her face and peered at him from behind it oh he said thats a little unfair isnt it yes fine all right she said with a laugh you can ask me might as well get it over with better than have you call me fenny all the time presumably said arthur weve only got two tickets left you see and since you were so generous when i spoke to you before what snapped arthur the woman with the perm and the smile and the now nearly empty book of cloakroom tickets was now waving the two last ones under his nose i thought id give the opportunity to you because the prizes are so nice she wrinkled up he nose a little confidentially very tasteful i know youll like them and it is for anjies retirement present you see we want to give her a kidney machine yes said arthur here he held out two more ten pence pieces to her and took the tickets a thought seemed to strike the woman it struck her very slowly you could watch it coming in like a long wave on a sandy beach oh dear she said im not interrupting anything am i she peered anxiously at both of them no its fine said arthur everything that could possibly be fine he insisted is fine thank you he added i say she said in a delightful ecstacy of worry youre not in love are you its very hard to say said arthur we havent had a chance to talk yet he glanced at fenchurch she was grinning the woman nodded with knowing confidentiality ill let you see the prizes in a minute she said and left arthur turned with a sigh back to the girl that he found it hard to say whether he was in love with you were about to ask me she said a question yes said arthur we can do it together if you like said fenchurch was i found in a handbag joined in arthur in the left luggage office they said together at fenchurch street station they finished and the answer said fenchurch is no fine said arthur i was conceived there what i was con in the left luggage office hooted arthur no of course not dont be silly what would my parents be doing in the left luggage office she said rather taken aback by the suggestion well i dont know spluttered arthur or rather it was in the ticket queue the the ticket queue or so they claim they refuse to elaborate they only say you wouldnt believe how bored it is possible to get in the ticket queue at fenchurch street station she sipped demurely at her tomato juice and looked at her watch arthur continued to gurgle for a moment or two im going to have to go in a minute or two said fenchurch and you havent begun to tell me whatever this terrifically extraordinary thing is that you were so keen to get off your chest why dont you let me drive you to london said arthur its saturday ive got nothing particular to do id no said fenchurch thank you its sweet of you but no i need to be by myself for a couple of days she smiled and shrugged but you can tell me another time ill give you my number arthurs heart went boom boom churn churn as she scribbled seven figures in pencil on a scrap of paper and handed it to him now we can relax she said with a slow smile which filled arthur till he thought he would burst fenchurch he said enjoying the name as he said it i a box said a trailing voice of cherry liqueurs and also and i know youll like this a gramophone record of scottish bagpipe music yes thank you very nice insisted arthur i just thought id let you have a look at them said the permed woman as youre down from london she was holding them out proudly for arthur too see he could see that they were indeed a box of cherry brandy liqueurs and a record of bagpipe music that was what they were ill let you have your drink in peace now she said patting arthur lightly on his seething shoulder but i knew youd like to see arthur reengaged his eyes with fenchurchs once again and suddenly was at a loss for something to say a moment had come and gone between the two of them but the whole rhythm of it had been wrecked by that stupid blasted woman dont worry said fenchurch looking at him steadily from over the top of her glass we will talk again she took a sip perhaps she added it wouldnt have gone so well if it wasnt for her she gave a wry little smile and dropped her hair forward over her face again it was perfectly true he had to admit it was perfectly true chapter that night at home as he was prancing round the house pretending to be tripping through cornfields in slow motion and continually exploding with sudden laughter arthur thought he could even bear to listen to the album of bagpipe music he had won it was eight oclock and he decided he would make himself force himself to listen to the whole record before he phoned her maybe he should even leave it till tomorrow that would be the cool thing to do or next week sometime no no games he wanted her and didnt care who knew it he definitely and absolutely wanted her adored her longed for her wanted to do more things than there were names for with her he actually caught himself saying thinks like yippee as he prances ridiculously round the house her eyes her hair her voice everything he stopped he would put on the record of bagpipe music then he would call her would he perhaps call her first no what he would do was this he would put on the record of bagpipe music he would listen to it every last banshee wail of it then he would call her that was the correct order that was what he would do he was worried about touching things in case they blew up when he did so he picked up the record it failed to blow up he slipped it out of its cover he opened the record player he turned on the amp they both survived he giggled foolishly as he lowered the stylus on to the disc he sat and listened solemnly to a scottish soldier he listened to amazing grace he listened to something about some glen or other he thought about his miraculous lunchtime they had just been on the point of leaving when they were distracted by an awful outbreak of yoohooing the appallingly permed woman was waving to them across the room like some stupid bird with a broken wing everyone in the pub turned to them and seemed to be expecting some sort of response they hadnt listened to the bit about how pleased and happy anjie was going to be about the p everyone had helped to raise towards the cost of her kidney machine had been vaguely aware that someone from the next table had won a box of cherry brandy liqueurs and took a moment or two to cotton on to the fact that the yoohooing lady was trying to ask them if they had ticket number arthur discovered that he had he glanced angrily at his watch fenchurch gave him a push go on she said go and get it dont be bad tempered give them a nice speech about how pleased you are and you can give me a call and tell me how it went ill want to hear the record go on she flicked his arm and left the regulars thought his acceptance speech a little over effusive it was after all merely an album of bagpipe music arthur thought about it and listened to the music and kept on breaking into laughter chapter ring ring ring ring ring ring hello yes yes thats right yes youll ave to speak up theres an awful lot of noise in ere what no i only do the bar in the evenings its yvonne who does lunch and jim hes the landlord no i wasnt on what youll have to speak up what no dont know anything about no raffle what no dont know nothing about it old on ill call jim the barmaid put her hand over the receiver and called over

keeps effing and blinding at me says theres a number on the ticket course there was a number on the ticket it was a bloody raffle ticket wasnt it e says e means its a telephone number on the ticket put the phone down and serve the bloody customers will you chapter eight hours west sat a man alone on a beach mourning an inexplicable loss he could only think of his loss in little packets of grief at a time because the whole thing was too great to be borne he watched the long slow pacific waves come in along the sand and waited and waited for the nothing that he knew was about to happen as the time came for it not to happen it duly didnt happen and so the afternoon wore itself away and the sun dropped beneath the long line of sea and the day was gone the beach was a beach we shall not name because his private house was there but it was a small sandy stretch somewhere along the hundreds of miles of coastline that first runs west from los angeles which is described in the new edition of the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy in one entry as junky wunky lunky stunky and whats that other word and all kinds of bad stuff woo and in another written only hours later as being like several thousand square miles of american express junk mail but without the same sense of moral depth plus the air is for some reason yellow the coastline runs west and then turns north up to the misty bay of san francisco which the guide describes as a good place to go its very easy to believe that everyone you meet there is also a space traveller starting a new religion for you is just their way of saying hi until youve settled in and got the hang of the place it is best to say no to three questions out of any given four that anyone may ask you because there are some very strange things going on there some of which an unsuspecting alien could die of the hundreds of curling miles of cliffs and sand palm trees breakers and sunsets are described in the guide as boffo a good one and somewhere on this good boffo stretch of coastline lay the house of this inconsolable man a man whom many regarded as being insane but this was only as he would tell people because he was one of the many many reasons why people thought him insane was because of the peculiarity of his house which even in a land where most peoples houses were peculiar in one way or another was quite extreme in his peculiarness his house was called the outside of the asylum his name was simply john watson though he preferred to be called and some of his friends had now reluctantly agreed to this wonko the sane in his house were a number of strange things including a grey glass bowl with eight words engraved upon it we can talk of him much later on this is just an interlude to watch the sun go down and to say that he was there watching it he had lost everything he cared for and was now simply waiting for the end of the world little realizing that it had already been and gone chapter after a disgusting sunday spent emptying rubbish bins behind a pub in taunton and finding nothing no raffle ticket no telephone number arthur tried everything he could to find fenchurch and the more things he tried the more weeks passed he raged and railed against himself against fate against the world and its weather he even in his sorrow and his fury went and sat in the motorway service station cafeteria where hed been just before he met her its the drizzle that makes me particularly morose please shut up about the drizzle snapped arthur i would shut up if it would shut up drizzling look but ill tell you what it will do when it shuts up drizzling shall i no blatter what it will blatter arthur stared over the rim of his coffee cup at the grisly outside world it was a completely pointless place to be he realized and he had been driven there by superstition rather than logic however as if to bait him with the knowledge that such coincidences could in fact happen fate had chosen to reunite him with the lorry driver he had encountered there last time the more he tried to ignore him the more he found himself being dragged back into the gravitic whirlpool of the mans exasperating conversation i think said arthur vaguely cursing himself for even bothering to say this that its easing off ha arthur just shrugged he should go thats what he should do he should just go it never stops raining ranted the lorry driver he thumped the table spilt his tea and actually for a moment appeared to be steaming you cant just walk off without responding to a remark like that of course it stops raining said arthur it was hardly an elegant refutation but it had to be said it rains all the time raved the man thumping the table again in time to the words arthur shook his head stupid to say it rains all the time he said the mans eyebrows shot up affronted stupid whys it stupid whys it stupid to say it rains all the time if it rains the whole time didnt rain yesterday did in darlington arthur paused warily you going to ask me where i was yesterday asked the man eh no said arthur but i expect you can guess do you begins with a d does it and it was pissing down there i can tell you you dont want to sit there mate said a passing stranger in overalls to arthur cheerily thats thundercloud corner that is reserved special for old raindrops keep falling on my head here theres one reserved in every motorway caff between here and sunny denmark steer clear is my advice swhat we all do hows it going rob keeping busy got your wetweather tyres on har har he breezed by and went to tell a joke about britt ekland to someone at a nearby table see none of them bastards take me seriously said rob mckeena but he added darkly leaning forward and screwing up his eyes they all know its true arthur frowned like my wife hissed the sole owner and driver of mckeenas allweather haulage she says its nonsense and i make a fuss and complain about nothing but he paused dramatically and darted out dangerous looks from his eyes she always brings the washing in when i phone to say im on me way home he brandished his coffee spoon what do you make of that well i have a book he went on i have a book a diary kept it for fifteen years shows every single place ive ever been every day and also what the weather was like and it was uniformly he snarled orrible all over england scotland wales i been all round the continent italy germany back and forth to denmark been to yugoslavia its all marked in and charted even when i went to visit my brother he added in seattle well said arthur getting up to leave at last perhaps youd better show it to someone i will said rob mckeena and he did chapter misery dejection more misery and more dejection he needed a project and he gave himself one he would find where his cave had been on prehistoric earth he had lived in a cave not a nice cave a lousy cave but there was no but it had been a totally lousy cave and he had hated it but he had lived in it for five years which made it home of some kind and a person likes to keep track of his homes arthur dent was such a person and so he went to exeter to buy a computer that was what he really wanted of course a computer but he felt he ought to have some serious purpose in mind before he simply went and lashed out a lot of readies on what people might otherwise mistake as being just a thing to play with so that was his serious purpose to pinpoint the exact location of a cave on prehistoric earth he explained this to the man in the shop why said the man in the shop this was a tricky one ok skip that said the man in the shop how well i was hoping you could help me with that the man sighed and his shoulders dropped have you much experience of computers arthur wondered whether to mention eddie the shipboard computer on the heart of gold who could have done the job in a second or deep thought or but decided he wouldnt no he said looks like a fun afternoon said the man in the shop but he said it only to himself arthur bought the apple anyway over a few days he also acquired some astronomical software plotted the movements of stars drew rough little diagrams of how he seemed to remember the stars to have been in the sky when he looked up out of his cave at night and worked away busily at it for weeks cheerfully putting off the conclusion he knew he would inevitably have to come to which was that the whole project was completely ludicrous rough drawings from memory were futile he didnt even know how long it had been beyond ford prefects rough guess at the time that it was a couple of million years and he simply didnt have the maths still in the end he worked out a method which would at least produce a result he decided not to mind the fact that with the extraordinary jumble of rules of thumb wild approximations and arcane guesswork he was using he would be lucky to hit the right galaxy he just went ahead and got a result he would call it the right result who would know as it happened through the myriad and unfathomable chances of fate he got it exactly right though he of course would never know that he just went up to london and knocked on the appropriate door oh i thought you were going to phone me first arthur gaped in astonishment you can only come in for a few minutes said fenchurch im just going out chapter a summers day in islington full of the mournful wail of antiquerestoring machinery fenchurch was unavoidably busy for the afternoon so arthur wandered in a blissedout haze and looked at all the shops which in islington are quite an useful bunch as anyone who regularly needs old woodworking tools boer war helmets drag office furniture or fish will readily confirm the sun beat down over the roofgardens it beat on architects and plumbers it beat on barristers and burglars it beat on pizzas it beat on estate agents particulars it beat on arthur as he went into a restored furniture shop its an interesting building said the proprietor cheerfully theres a cellar with a secret passage which connects with a nearby pub it was built for the prince regent apparently so he could make his escape when he needed to you mean in case anybody might catch him buying stripped pine furniture said arthur no said the proprietor not for that reason youll have to excuse me said arthur im terribly happy i see he wandered hazily on and found himself outside the offices of greenpeace he remembered the contents of his file marked things to do urgent which he hadnt opened again in the meantime he marched in with a cheery smile and said hed come to give them some money to help free the dolphins very funny they told him go away this wasnt quite the response he had expected so he tried again this time they got quite angry with him so he just left some money anyway and went back out into the sunshine just after six he returned to fenchurchs house in the alleyway clutching a bottle of champagne hold this she said shoved a stout rope in his hand and disappeared inside through the large white wooden doors from which dangled a fat padlock off a black iron bar the house was a small converted stable in a light industrial alleyway behind the derelict royal agricultural hall of islington as well as its large stable doors it also had a normallooking front door of smartly glazed panelled wood with a black dolphin door knocker the one odd thing about this door was its doorstep which was nine feet high since the door was set into the upper of the two floors and presumably had been originally used to haul in hay for hungry horses an old pulley jutted out of the brickwork above the doorway and it was over this that the rope arthur was holding was slung the other end of the rope held a suspended cello the door opened above his head ok said fenchurch pull on the rope steady the cello pass it up to me he pulled on the rope he steadied the cello i cant pull on the rope again he said without letting go of the cello fenchurch leant down im steadying the cello she said you pull on the rope the cello eased up level with the doorway swinging slightly and fenchurch manoeuvred it inside come on up yourself she called down arthur picked up his bag of goodies and went in through the stable doors tingling the bottom room which he had seen briefly before was pretty rough and full of junk a large old castiron mangle stood there a surprising number of kitchen sinks were piled in a corner there was also arthur was momentarily alarmed to see a pram but it was very old and uncomplicatedly full of books the floor was old stained concrete excitingly cracked and this was the measure of arthurs mood as he stared up the rickety wooden steps in the far corner even a cracked concrete floor seemed to him an almost unbearably sensual thing an architect friend of mine keeps on telling me how he can do wonderful things with this place said fenchurch chattily as arthur emerged through the floor he keeps on coming round standing in stunned amazement muttering about space and objects and events and marvellous qualities of light then says he needs a pencil and disappears for weeks wonderful things have therefore so far failed to happen to it in fact thought arthur as he looked about the upper room was at least reasonably wonderful anyway it was simply decorated furnished with things made out of cushions and also a stereo set with speakers which would have impressed the guys who put up stonehenge there were flowers which were pale and pictures which were interesting there was a sort of gallery structure in the roof space which held a bed and also a bathroom which fenchurch explained you could actually swing a cat in but she added only if it was a reasonably patient cat and didnt mind a few nasty cracks about the head so here you are yes they looked at each other for a moment the moment became a longer moment and suddenly it was a very long moment so long one could hardly tell where all the time was coming from for arthur who could usually contrive to feel selfconscious if left alone for long enough with a swiss cheese plant the moment was one of sustained revelation he felt on the sudden like a cramped and zooborn animal who awakes one morning to find the door to his cage hanging quietly open and the savannah stretching grey and pink to the distant rising sun while all around new sounds are waking he wondered what the new sounds were as he gazed at her openly wondering face and her eyes that smiled with a shared surprise he hadnt realized that life speaks with a voice to you a voice that brings you answers to the questions you continually ask of it had never consciously detected it or recognized its tones till it now said something it had never said to him before which was yes fenchurch dropped her eyes away at last with a tiny shake of her head i know she said i shall have to remember she added that you are the sort of person who cannot hold on to a simple piece of paper for two minutes without winning a raffle with it she turned away lets go for a walk she said quickly hyde park ill change into something less suitable she was dressed in a rather severe dark dress not a particularly shapely one and it didnt really suit her i wear it specially for my cello teacher she said hes a nice boy but i sometimes think all that bowing gets him a bit excited ill be down in a moment she ran lightly up the steps to the gallery above and called down put the bottle in the fridge for later he noticed as he slipped the champagne bottle into the door that it had an identical twin to sit next to he walked over to the window and looked out he turned and started to look at her records from above he heard the rustle of her dress fall to the ground he talked to himself about the sort of person he was he told himself very firmly that for this moment at least he would keep his eyes very firmly and steadfastly locked on to the spines of her records read the titles nod appreciatively count the blasted things if he had to he would keep his head down this he completely utterly and abjectly failed to do she was staring down at him with such intensity that she seemed hardly to notice that he was looking up at her then suddenly she shook her head dropped the light sundress over herself and disappeared quickly into the bathroom she emerged a moment later all smiles and with a sunhat and came tripping down the steps with extraordinary lightness it was a strange kind of dancing motion she had she saw that he noticed it and put her head slightly on one side like it she said you look gorgeous he said simply because she did hmmmm she said as if he hadnt really answered her question she closed the upstairs front door which had stood open all this time and looked around the little room to see that it was all in a fit state to be left on its own for a while arthurs eyes followed hers around and while he was looking in the other direction she slipped something out of a drawer and into the canvas bag she was carrying arthur looked back at her ready did you know she said with a slightly puzzled smile that theres something wrong with me her directness caught arthur unprepared well he said id heard some vague sort of i wonder how much you do know about me she said i you heard it from where i think you heard then thats not it russell just sort of makes stuff up because he cant deal with what it really is a pang of worry went through arthur then what is it he said can you tell me dont worry she said its nothing bad at all just unusual very very unusual she touched his hand and then leant forward and kissed him briefly i shall be very interested to know she said if you manage to work out what it is this evening arthur felt that if someone tapped him at that point he would have chimed like the deep sustained rolling chime his grey fishbowl made when he flicked it with his thumbnail chapter ford prefect was irritated to be continually wakened by the sound of gunfire he slid himself out of the maintenance hatchway which he had fashioned into a bunk for himself by disabling some of the noisier machinery in his vicinity and padding it with towels he slung himself down the access ladder and prowled the corridors moodily they were claustrophobic and illlit and what light there was was continually flickering and dimming as power surged this way and that through the ship causing heavy vibrations and rasping humming noises that wasnt it though he paused and leaned back against the wall as something that looked like a small silver power drill flew past him down the dim corridor with a nasty searing screech that wasnt it either he clambered listlessly through a bulkhead door and found himself in a larger corridor though still illlit the ship lurched it had been doing this a fair bit but this was heavier a small platoon of robots weent by making a terrible clattering still not it though acrid smoke was drifting up from one end of the corridor so he walked along it in the other direction he passed a series of observation monitors let into the walls behind plates of toughened but still badly scratched perspex one of them showed some horrible green scaly reptilian figure ranting and raving about the single transferable vote system it was hard to tell whether he was for or against it but he clearly felt very strongly about it ford turned the sound down that wasnt it though he passed another monitor it was showing a commercial for some brand of toothpaste that would apparently make you feel free if you used it there was nasty blaring music with it too but that wasnt it he came upon another much larger threedimensional screen that was monitoring the outside of the vast silver xaxisian ship as he watched a thousand horribly beweaponed zirzla robot starcruisers came searing round the dark shadow of a moon silhouetted against the blinding disc of the star xaxis and the ship simultaneously unleashed a vicious blaze of hideously incomprehensible forces from all its orifices against them that was it ford shook his head irritably and rubbed his eyes he slumped on the wrecked body of a dull silver robot which clearly had been burning earlier on but had now cooled down enough to sit on he yawned and dug his copy of the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy out of his satchel he activated the screen and flicked idly through some level three entries and some level four entries he was looking for some good insomnia cures he found rest which was what he reckoned he needed he found rest and recuperation and was about to pass on when he suddenly had a better idea he looked up at the monitor screen the battle was raging more fiercely every second and the noise was appalling the ship juddered screamed and lurched as each new bolt of stunning energy was delivered or received he looked back down at the guide again and flipped through a few likely locations he suddenly laughed and then rummaged in his satchel again he pulled out a small memory dump module wiped off the fluff and biscuit crumbs and plugged it into an interface on the back of the guide when all the information that he could think was relevant had been dumped into the module he unplugged it again tossed it lightly in the palm of his hand put the guide away in his satchel smirked and went in search of the ships computer data banks chapter the purpose of having the sun go low in the evenings in the summer especially in parks said the voice earnestly is to make girls breasts bob up and down more clearly to the eye i am convinced that this is the case arthur and fenchurch giggled about this to each other as they passed she hugged him more tightly for a moment and i am certain said the frizzy gingerhaired youth with the long thin nose who was epostulating from his deckchair by the side of the serpentine that if one worked the argument through one would find that it flowed with perfect naturalness and logic from everything he insisted to his thin darkhaired companion who was slumped in the next door deckchair feeling dejected about his spots that darwin was going on about this is certain this is indisputable and he added i love it he turned sharply and squinted through his spectacles at fenchurch arthur steered her away and could feel her silently quaking next guess she said when she had stopped giggling come on all right he said your elbow your left elbow theres something wrong with your left elbow wrong again she said completely wrong youre on completely the wrong track the summer sun was sinking through the tress in the park looking as if lets not mince words hyde park is stunning everything about it is stunning except for the rubbish on monday mornings even the ducks are stunning anyone who can go through hyde park on a summers evening and not feel moved by it is probably going through in an ambulance with the sheet pulled over their face it is a park in which people do more extraordinary things than they do elsewhere arthur and fenchurch found a man in shorts practising the bagpipes to himself under a tree the piper paused to chase off an american couple who had tried timidly to put some coins on the box his bagpipes came in no he shouted at them go away im only practising he started resolutely to reinflate his bag but even the noise this made could not disfigure their mood arthur put his arms around her and moved them slowly downwards i dont think it can be your bottom he said after a while there doesnt seem to be anything wrong with that at all yes she agreed theres absolutely nothing wrong with my bottom they kissed for so long that eventually the piper went and practised on the other side of the tree ill tell you a story said arthur good they found a patch of grass which was relatively free of couples actually lying on top of each other and sat and watched the stunning ducks and the low sunlight rippling on the water which ran beneath the stunning ducks a story said fenchurch cuddling his arm to her which will tell you something of the sort of things that happen to me its absolutely true you know sometimes people tell you stories that are supposed to be something that happened to their wifes cousins best friend but actually probably got made up somewhere along the line well its like one of those stories except that it actually happened and i know it actually happened because the person it actually happened to was me like the raffle ticket arthur laughed yes i had a train to catch he went on i arrived at the station did i ever tell you interrupted fenchurch what happened to my parents in a station yes said arthur you did just checking arthur glanced at his watch i suppose we could think of getting back he said tell me the story said fenchurch firmly you arrived at the station i was about twenty minutes early id got the time of the train wrong i suppose it is at least equally possible he added after a moments reflection that british rail had got the time of the train wrong hadnt occurred to me before get on with it fenchurch laughed so i bought a newspaper to do the crossword and went to the buffet to get a cup of coffee you do the crossword yes which one the guardian usually i think it tries to be too cute i prefer the times did you solve it what the crossword in the guardian i havent had a chance to look at it yet said arthur im still trying to buy the coffee all right then buy the coffee im buying it i am also said arthur buying some biscuits what sort rich tea good choice i like them laden with all these new possessions i go and sit at a table and dont ask me what the table was like because this was some time ago and i cant remember it was probably round all right so let me give you the layout me sitting at the table on my left the newspaper on my right the cup of coffee in the middle of the table the packet of biscuits i see it perfectly what you dont see said arthur because i havent mentioned him yet is the guy sitting at the table already he is sitting there opposite me whats he like perfectly ordinary briefcase business suit he didnt look said arthur as if he was about to do anything weird ah i know the type what did he do he did this he leaned across the table picked up the packet of biscuits tore it open took one out and what ate it what he ate it fenchurch looked at him in astonishment what on earth did you do well in the circumstances i did what any redblooded englishman would do i was compelled said arthur to ignore it what why well its not the sort of thing youre trained for is it i searched my soul and discovered that there was nothing anywhere in my upbringing experience or even primal instincts to tell me how to react to someone who has quite simply calmly sitting right there in front of me stolen one of my biscuits well you could fenchurch thought about it i must say im not sure what i would have done either so what happened i stared furiously at the crossword said arthur couldnt do a single clue took a sip of coffee it was too hot to drink so there was nothing for it i braced myself i took a biscuit trying very hard not to notice he added that the packet was already mysteriously open but youre fighting back taking a tough line after my fashion yes i ate the biscuit i ate it very deliberately and visibly so that he would have no doubt as to what it was i was doing when i eat a biscuit arthur said it stays eaten so what did he do took another one honestly insisted arthur this is exactly what happened he took another biscuit he ate it clear as daylight certain as we are sitting on the ground fenchurch stirred uncomfortably and the problem was said arthur that having not said anything the first time it was somehow even more difficult to broach the subject the second time around what do you say excuse me i couldnt help noticing er doesnt work no i ignored it with if anything even more vigour than previously my man stared at the crossword again still couldnt budge a bit of it so showing some of the spirit that henry v did on st crispins day what i went into the breach again i took said arthur another biscuit and for an instant our eyes met like this yes well no not quite like that but they met just for an instant and we both looked away but i am here to tell you said arthur that there was a little electricity in the air there was a little tension building up over the table at about this time i can imagine we went through the whole packet like this him me him me the whole packet well it was only eight biscuits but it seemed like a lifetime of biscuits we were getting through at this point gladiators could hardly have had a tougher time gladiators said fenchurch would have had to do it in the sun more physically gruelling there is that so when the empty packet was lying dead between us the man at last got up having done his worst and left i heaved a sigh of relief of course as it happened my train was announced a moment or two later so i finished my coffee stood up picked up the newspaper and underneath the newspaper yes were my biscuits what said fenchurch what true no she gasped and tossed herself back on the grass laughing she sat up again you completely nitwit she hooted you almost completely and utterly foolish person she pushed him backwards rolled over him kissed him and rolled off again he was surprised at how light she was now you tell me a story i thought she said putting on a low husky voice that you were very keen to get back no hurry he said airily i want you to tell me a story she looked out over the kale and pondered all right she said its only a short one and not funny like yours but anyway she looked down arthur could feel that it was one of those sorts of moments the air seemed to stand still around them waiting arthur wished that the air would go away and mind its own business when i was a kid she said these sort of stories always start like this dont they when i was a kid anyway this is the bit where the girl suddenly says when i was a kid and starts to unburden herself we have got to that bit when i was a kid i had this picture hanging over the foot of my bed what do you think of it so far i like it i think its moving well youre getting the bedroom interest in nice and early we could probably do with some development with the picture it was one of those pictures that children are supposed to like she said but dont full of endearing little animals doing endearing things you know i know i was plagued with them too rabbits in waistcoats exactly these rabbits were in fact on a raft as were assorted rats and owls there may even have been a reindeer on the raft on the raft and a boy was sitting on the raft among the rabbits in waistcoats and the owls and the reindeer precisely there a boy of the cheery gypsy ragamuffin variety ugh the picture worried me i must say there was an otter swimming in front of the raft and i used to lie awake at night worrying about this otter having to pull the raft with all these wretched animals on it who shouldnt even be on a raft and the otter had such a thin tail to pull it with i thought it must hurt pulling it all the time worried me not badly but just vaguely all the time then one day and remember id been looking at this picture every night for years i suddenly noticed that the raft had a sail never seen it before the otter was fine he was just swimming along she shrugged good story she said ends weakly said arthur leaves the audience crying yes but what of it fine up till there but needs a final sting before the credits fenchurch laughed and hugged her legs it was just such a sudden revelation years of almost unnoticed worry just dropping away like taking off heavy weights like black and white becoming colour like a dry stick suddenly being watered the sudden shift of perspective that says put away your worries the world is a good and perfect place it is in fact very easy you probably thing im saying that because im going to say that i felt like that this afternoon or something dont you well i said arthur his composure suddenly shattered well its all right she said i did thats exactly what i felt but you see ive felt that before even stronger incredibly strongly im afraid im a bit of a one she said gazing off into the distance for sudden startling revelations arthur was at sea could hardly speak and felt it wiser therefore for the moment not to try it was very odd she said much as one of the pursuing egyptians might have said that the behaviour of the red sea when moses waved his rod at it was a little on the strange side very odd she repeated for days before the strangest feeling had been building in me as if i was going to give birth no it wasnt like that in fact it was more as if i was being connected into something bit by bit no not even that it was as if the whole of the earth through me was going to does the number said arthur gently fortytwo mean anything to you at all what no what are you talking about exclaimed fenchurch just a thought murmured arthur arthur i mean this this is very real to me this is serious i was being perfectly serious said arthur its just the universe im never quite sure about what do you mean by that tell me the rest of it he said dont worry if it sounds odd believe me you are talking to someone who has seen a lot of stuff he added that is odd and i dont mean biscuits she nodded and seemed to believe him suddenly she gripped his arm it was so simple she said so wonderfully and extraordinarily simple when it came what was it said arthur quietly arthur you see she said thats what i no longer know and the loss is unbearable if i try to think back to it it all goes flickery and jumpy and if i try too hard i get as far as the teacup and i just black out what well like your story she said the best bit happened in a cafe i was sitting there having a cup of tea this was after days of this build up the feeling of becoming connected up i think i was buzzing gently and there was some work going on at a building site opposite the cafe and i was watching it through the window over the rim of my teacup which i always find is the nicest way of watching other people working and suddenly there it was in my mind this message from somewhere and it was so simple it made such sense of everything i just sat up and thought oh oh well thats all right then i was so startled i almost dropped my teacup in fact i think i did drop it yes she added thoughtfully im sure i did how much sense am i making it was fine up to the bit about the teacup she shook her head and shook it again as if trying to clear it which is what she was trying to do well thats it she said fine up to the bit about the teacup that was the point at which it seemed to me quite literally as if the world exploded what i know it sounds crazy and everybody says it was hallucinations but if that was hallucinations then i have hallucinations in big screen d with track dolby stereo and should probably hire myself out to people who are bored with shark movies it was as if the ground was literally ripped from under my feet and and she patted the grass lightly as if for reassurance and then seemed to change her mind about what she was going to say and i woke up in hospital i suppose ive been in and out ever since and thats why i have an instinctive nervousness she said of sudden startling revelations thats everythings going to be all right she looked up at him arthur had simply ceased to worry himself about the strange anomalies surrounding his return to his home world or rather had consigned them to that part of his mind marked things to think about urgent here is the world he had told himself here for whatever reason is the world and here it stays with me on it but now it seemed to go swimmy around him as it had that night in the car when fenchurchs brother had told him the silly stories about the cia agent in the reservoir the trees went swimmy the lake went swimmy but this was perfectly natural and nothing to be alarmed by because a grey goose had just landed on it the geese were having a great relaxed time and had no major answers they wished to know the questions to anyway said fenchurch suddenly and brightly and with a wide eyed smile there is something wrong with part of me and youve got to find out what it is well go home arthur shook his head whats the matter she said arthur had shaken his head not to disagree with her suggestion which he thought was a truly excellent one one of the worlds great suggestions but because he was just for a moment trying to free himself of the recurring impression he had that just when he was least expecting it the universe would suddenly leap out from behind a door and go boo at him im just trying to get this entirely clear in my mind said arthur you say you felt as if the earth actually exploded yes more than felt which is what everybody else says he said hesitantly is hallucinations yes but arthur thats ridiculous people think that if you just say hallucinations it explains anything you want it to explain and eventually whatever it is you cant understand will just go away its just a word it doesnt explain anything it doesnt explain why the dolphins disappeared no said arthur no he added thoughtfully no he added again even more thoughtfully what he said at last doesnt explain the dolphins disappearing no said arthur i see that which dolphins do you mean what do you mean which dolphins im talking about when all the dolphins disappeared she put her hand on his knee which made him realize that the tingling going up and down his spine was not her gently stroking his back and must instead be one of the nasty creepy feelings he so often got when people were trying to explain things to him the dolphins yes all the dolphins said arthur disappeared yes the dolphins youre saying the dolphins all disappeared is this said arthur trying to be absolutely clear on this point what youre saying arthur where have you been for heavens sake the dolphins all disappeared on the same day i she stared him intently in his startled eyes what no dolphins all gone vanished she searched his face did you really not know that it was clear from his startled expression that he did not where did they go he asked no one knows thats what vanished means she paused well there is one man who says he knows about it but everyone says he lives in california she said and is mad i was thinking of going to see him because it seems the only lead ive got on what happened to me she shrugged and then looked at him long and quietly she lay her hand on the side of his face i really would like to know where youve been she said i think something terrible happened to you then as well and thats why we recognized each other she glanced around the park which was now being gathered into the clutches of dusk well she said now youve got someone you can tell arthur slowly let out a long year of a sigh it is he said a very long story fenchurch leaned across him and drew over her canvas bag is it anything to do with this she said the thing she took out of her bag was battered and travelworn as it had been hurled into prehistoric rivers baked under the sun that shines so redly on the deserts of kakrafoon halfburied in the marbled sands that fringe the heady vapoured oceans of santraginus v frozen on the glaciers of the moon of jaglan beta sat on kicked around spaceships scuffed and generally abused and since its makers had thought that these were exactly the sorts of things that might happen to it they had thoughtfully encased it in a sturdy plastic cover and written on it in large friendly letters the words dont panic where did you get this said arthur startled taking it from her ah she said i thought it was yours in russells car that night you dropped it have you been to many of these places arthur drew the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy from its cover it was like a small thin flexible lap computer he tapped some buttons till the screen flared with text a few he said can we go to them what no said arthur abruptly then relented but relented warily do you want to he said hoping for the answer no it was an act of great generosity on his part not to say you dont want to do you which expects it yes she said i want to know what the message was that i lost and where it came from because i dont think she added standing up and looking round the increasing gloom of the park that it came from here im not even sure she further added slipping her arm around arthurs waist that i know where here is chapter the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy is as has been remarked before often and accurately a pretty startling kind of a thing it is essentially as the title implies a guide book the problem is or rather one of the problems for there are many a sizeable portion of which are continually clogging up the civil commercial and criminal courts in all areas of the galaxy and especially where possible the more corrupt ones this the previous sentence makes sense that is not the problem this is change read it through again and youll get it the galaxy is a rapidly changing place there is frankly so much of it every bit of which is continually on the move continually changing a bit of a nightmare you might think for a scrupulous and conscientious editor diligently striving to keep this massively detailed and complex electronic tome abreast of all the changing circumstances and conditions that the galaxy throws up every minute of every hour of every day and you would be wrong where you would be wrong would be in failing to realize that the editor like all the editors of the guide has ever had has no real grasp of the meanings of the words scrupulous conscientious or diligent and tends to get his nightmares through a straw entries tend to get updated or not across the subetha net according to if they read good take for example the case of brequinda on the foth of avalars famed in myth legend and stultifyingly dull trid miniserieses as home of the magnificent and magical fuolornis fire dragon in ancient days when fragilis sang and saxaquine of the quenelux held sway when the air was sweet and the nights fragrant but everyone somehow managed to be or so they claimed though how on earth they could have thought that anyone was even remotely likely to believe such a preposterous claim what with all the sweet air and fragrant nights and whatnot is anyones guess virgins it was not possible to heave a brick on brequinda in the foth of avalars without hitting at least half a dozen fuolornis fire dragons whether you would want to do that is another matter not that fire dragons werent an essentially peaceloving species because they were they adored it to bits and this wholesale adoring of things to bits was often in itself the problem one so often hurts the one one loves especially if one is a fuolornis fire dragon with breath like a rocket booster and teeth like a park fence another problem was that once they were in the mood they often went on to hurt quite a lot of the ones that other people loved as well add to all that the relatively small number of madmen who actually went around the place heaving bricks and you end up with a lot of people on brequinda in the foth of avalars getting seriously hurt by dragons but did they mind they did not were they heard to bemoan their fate no the fuolornis fire dragons were revered throughout the lands of brequinda in the foth of valors for their savage beauty their noble ways and their habit of biting people who didnt revere them why was this the answer was simple sex there is for some unfathomed reason something almost unbearably sexy about having huge firebreathing magical dragons flying low about the sky on moonlit nights which were already dangerously on the sweet and fragrant side why this should be so the romancebesotted people of brequinda in the foth of avalars could not have told you and would not have stopped to discuss the matter once the effect was up and going for no sooner would a flock of half a dozen silkwinged leatherbodied fuolornis fire dragons heave into sight across the evening horizon than half the people of brequinda are scurrying off into the woods with the other half there to spend a busy breathless night together and emerge with the first rays of dawn all smiling and happy and still claiming rather endearingly to be virgins if rather flushed and sticky virgins pheromones some researchers said something sonic others claimed the place was always stiff with researchers trying to get to the bottom of it all and taking a very long time about it not surprisingly the guides graphically enticing description of the general state of affairs on this planet has proved to be astonishingly popular amongst hitchhikers who allow themselves to be guided by it and so it has simply never been taken out and it is therefore left to latterday travellers to find out for themselves that todays modern brequinda in the city state of avalars is now little more than concrete strip joints and dragon burger bars chapter the night in islington was sweet and fragrant there were of course no fuolornis fire dragons about in the alley but if any had chanced by they might just as well have sloped off across the road for a pizza for they were not going to be needed had an emergency cropped up while they were still in the middle of their american hots with extra anchovy they could always have sent across a message to put dire straits on the stereo which is now known to have much the same effect no said fenchurch not yet arthur put dire straits on the stereo fenchurch pushed ajar the upstairs front door to let in a little more of the sweet fragrant night air they both sat on some of the furniture made out of cushions very close to the open bottle of champagne no said fenchurch not till youve found out whats wrong with me which bit but i suppose she added very very very quietly that we may as well start with where your hand is now arthur said so which way do i go down said fenchurch on this occasion he moved his hand down she said is in fact the other way oh yes mark knopfler has an extraordinary ability to make a schecter custom stratocaster hoot and sing like angels on a saturday night exhausted from being good all week and needing a stiff beer which is not strictly relevant at this point since the record hadnt yet got to that bit but there will be too much else going on when it does and furthermore the chronicler does not intend to sit here with a track list and a stopwatch so it seems best to mention it now while things are still moving slowly and so we come said arthur to your knee there is something terribly and tragically wrong with your left knee my left knee said fenchurch is absolutely fine do it is did you know that what ahm its all right i can tell you do no keep going so it has to be something to do with your feet she smiled in the dim light and wriggled her shoulders noncommittally against the cushions since there are cushions in the universe on squornshellous beta to be exact two worlds in from the swampland of the mattresses that actively enjoy being wriggled against particularly if its noncommittally because of the syncopated way in which the shoulders move its a pity they werent there they werent but such is life arthur held her left foot in his lap and looked it over carefully all kinds of stuff about the way her dress fell away from her legs was making it difficult for him to think particularly clearly at this point i have to admit he said that i really dont know what im looking for youll know when you find it she said really you will there was a slight catch in her voice its not that one feeling increasingly puzzled arthur let her left foot down on the floor and moved himself around so that he could take her right foot she moved forward put her arms round and kissed him because the record had got to that bit which if you knew the record you would know made it impossible not to do this then she gave him her right foot he stroked it ran his fingers round her ankle under her toes along her instep could find nothing wrong with it she watched him with great amusement laughed and shook her head no dont stop she said but its not that one now arthur stopped and frowned at her left foot on the floor dont stop he stroked her right foot ran his fingers around her ankle under her toes along her instep and said you mean its something to do with which leg im holding she did another of the shrugs which would have brought such joy into the life of a simple cushion from squornshellous beta he frowned pick me up she said quietly he let her right foot down to the floor and stood up so did she he picked her up in his arms and they kissed again this went on for a while then she said now put me down again still puzzled he did so well she looked at him almost challengingly so whats wrong with my feet she said arthur still did not understand he sat on the floor then got down on his hands and knees to look at her feet in situ as it were in their normal habitat and as he looked closely something odd struck him he pit his head right down to the ground and peered there was a long pause he sat back heavily yes he said i see whats wrong with your feet they dont touch the ground so so what do you think arthur looked up at her quickly and saw the deep apprehension making her eyes suddenly dark she bit her lip and was trembling what do she stammered are you she shook the hair forwards over her eyes that were filling with dark fearful tears he stood up quickly put his arms around her and gave her a single kiss perhaps you can do what i can do he said and walked straight out of her upstairs front door the record got to the good bit chapter the battle raged on about the star of xaxis hundreds of the fierce and horribly beweaponed zirzla ships had now been smashed and wrenched to atoms by the withering forces the huge silver xaxisian ship was able to deploy part of the moon had gone too blasted away by those same blazing forceguns that ripped the very fabric of space as they passed through it the zirzla ships that remained horribly beweaponed though they were were now hopelessly outclassed by the devastating power of the xaxisian ship and were fleeing for cover behind the rapidly disintegrating moon when the xaxisian ship in hurtling pursuit behind them suddenly announced that it needed a holiday and left the field of battle all was redoubled fear and consternation for a moment but the ship was gone with the stupendous powers at its command it flitted across vast tracts of irrationally shaped space quickly effortlessly and above all quietly deep in his greasy smelly bunk fashioned out of a maintenance hatchway ford prefect slept among his towels dreaming of old haunts he dreamed at one point in his slumbers of new york in his dream he was walking late at night along the east side beside the river which had become so extravagantly polluted that new lifeforms were now emerging from it spontaneously demanding welfare and voting rights one of those now floated past waving ford waved back the thing thrashed to the shore and struggled up the bank hi it said ive just been created im completely new to the universe in all respects is there anything you can tell me phew said ford a little nonplussed i can tell you where some bars are i guess what about love and happiness i sense deep needs for things like that it said waving its tentacles got any leads there you can get some like what you require said ford on seventh avenue i instinctively feel said the creature urgently that i need to be beautiful am i youre pretty direct arent you no point in mucking about am i to me said ford no but listen he added after a moment most people make out you know are there and like you down there search me buster said the creature as i said im new here life is entirely strange to me whats it like here was something that ford felt he could speak about with authority life he said is like a grapefruit er how so well its sort of orangeyyellow and dimpled on the outside wet and squidgy in the middle its got pips inside too oh and some people have half a one for breakfast is there anyone else out there i can talk to i expect so said ford ask a policeman deep in his bunk ford prefect wriggled and turned on to his other side it wasnt his favourite type of dream because it didnt have eccentrica gallumbits the triplebreasted whore of eroticon vi in it whom many of his dreams did feature but at least it was a dream at least he was asleep chapter luckily there was a strong updraft in the alley because arthur hadnt done this sort of thing for a while at least not deliberately and deliberately is exactly the way you are not meant to do it he swung down sharply nearly catching himself a nasty crack on the jaw with the doorstep and tumbled through the air so suddenly stunned with what a profoundly stupid thing he had just done that he completely forgot the bit about hitting the ground and didnt a nice trick he thought to himself if you can do it the ground was hanging menacingly above his head he tried not to think about the ground what an extraordinarily big thing it was and how much it would hurt him if it decided to stop hanging there and suddenly fell on him he tried to think nice thoughts about lemurs instead which was exactly the right thing to do because he couldnt at that moment remember precisely what a lemur was if it was one of those things that sweep in great majestic herds across the plains of wherever it was or if that was wildebeests so it was a tricky kind of thing to think nice thoughts about without simply resorting to an icky sort of general welldisposedness towards things and all this kept his mind well occupied while his body tried to adjust to the fact that it wasnt touching anything a mars bar wrapper fluttered down the alleyway after a seeming moment of doubt and indecision it eventually allowed the wind to ease it fluttering between him and the ground arthur the ground was still hanging menacingly above his head and he thought it was probably time to do something about that such as fall away from it which is what he did slowly very very slowly as he fell slowly very very slowly he closed his eyes carefully so as not to jolt anything the feel of his eyes closing ran down his whole body once it had reached his feet and the whole of his body was alerted to the fact that his eyes were now closed and was not panicked by it he slowly very very slowly revolved his body one way and his mind the other that should sort the ground out he could feel the air clear about him now breezing around him quite cheerfully untroubled by his being there and slowly very very slowly as from a deep and distant sleep he opened his eyes he had flown before of course flown many times on krikkit until all the birdtalk had driven him scatty but this was different here he was on his own world quietly and without fuss beyond a slight trembling which could have been attributable to a number of things being in the air ten or fifteen feet below him was the hard tarmac and a few yards off to the right the yellow street lights of upper street luckily the alleyway was dark since the light which was supposed to see it through the night was on an ingenious timeswitch which meant it came on just before lunchtime and went off again as the evening was beginning to draw in he was therefore safely shrouded in a blanket of dark obscurity he slowly very very slowly lifted his head to fenchurch who was standing in silent breathless amazement silhouetted in her upstairs doorway her face was inches from his i was about to ask you she said in a low trembly voice what you were doing but then i realized that i could see what you were doing you were flying so it seemed she went on after a slight wondering pause like a bit of a silly question arthur said can you do it no would you like to try she bit her lip and shook her head not so much to say no but just in sheer bewilderment she was shaking like a leaf its quite easy urged arthur if you dont know how thats the important bit be not at all sure how youre doing it just to demonstrate how easy it was he floated away down the alley fell upwards quite dramatically and bobbed back down to her like a banknote on a breath of wind ask me how i did that how did you do that no idea not a clue she shrugged in bewilderment so how can i arthur bobbed down a little lower and held out his hand i want you to try he said to step on my hand just one foot what try it nervously hesitantly almost she told herself as if she was trying to step on the hand of someone who was floating in front of her in midair she stepped on to his hand now the other what take the weight off your back foot i cant try it like this like that nervously hesitantly almost she told herself as if she stopped telling herself what what she was doing was like because she had a feeling she didnt altogether want to know she fixed her eyes very very firmly on the guttering of the roof of the decrepit warehouse opposite which had been annoying her for weeks because it was clearly going to fall off and she wondered if anyone was going to do anything about it or whether she ought to say something to somebody and didnt think for a moment about the fact that she was standing on the hands of someone who wasnt standing on anything at all now said arthur take your weight off your left foot she thought that the warehouse belonged to the carpet company who had their offices round the corner and took the weight off her left foot so she should probably go and see them about the gutter now said arthur take the weight off your right foot i cant try she hadnt seen the guttering from quite this angle before and it looked to her now as if as well as the mud and gunge up there there might also be a birds nest if she leaned forward just a little and took her weight off her right foot she could probably see it more clearly arthur was alarmed to see that someone down in the alley was trying to steal her bicycle he particularly didnt want to get involved in an argument at the moment and hoped that the guy would do it quietly and not look up he had the quiet shifty look of someone who habitually stole bicycles in alleys and habitually didnt expect to find their owners hovering several feet above them he was relaxed by both these habits and went about his job with purpose and concentration and when he found that the bike was unarguably bound by hoops of tungsten carbide to an iron bar embedded in concrete he peacefully bent both its wheels and went on his way arthur let out a longheld breath see what a piece of eggshell i have found you said fenchurch in his ear chapter those who are regular followers of the doings of arthur dent may have received an impression of his character and habits which while it includes the truth and of course nothing but the truth falls somewhat short in its composition of the whole truth in all its glorious aspects and the reasons for this are obvious editing selection the need to balance that which is interesting with that which is relevant and cut out all the tedious happenstance like this for instance arthur dent went to bed he went up the stairs all fifteen of them opened the door went into his room took off his shoes and socks and then all the rest of his clothes one by one and left them in a neatly crumpled heap on the floor he put on his pyjamas the blue ones with the stripe he washed his face and hands cleaned his teeth went to the lavatory realized that he had once again got this all in the wrong order had to wash his hands again and went to bed he read for fifteen minutes spending the first ten minutes of that trying to work out where in the book he had got to the previous night then he turned out the light and within a minute or so more was asleep it was dark he lay on his left side for a good hour after that he moved restlessly in his sleep for a moment and then turned over to sleep on his right side another hour after this his eyes flickered briefly and he slightly scratched his nose though there was still a good twenty minutes to go before he turned back on to his left side and so he whiled the night away sleeping at four he got up and went to the lavatory again he opened the door to the lavatory and so on its guff it doesnt advance the action it makes for nice fat books such as the american market thrives on but it doesnt actually get you anywhere you dont in short want to know but there are other omissions as well beside the teethcleaning and trying to find fresh socks variety and in some of these people have often seemed inordinately interested what they want to know about all that stuff off in the wings with arthur and trillian did that ever get anywhere to which the answer is of course mind your own business and what they say was he up to all those nights on the planet krikkit just because the planet didnt have fuolornis fire dragons or dire straits doesnt mean that everyone just sat up every night reading or to take a more specific example what about the night after the committee meeting party on prehistoric earth when arthur found himself sitting on a hillside watching the moon rise over the softly burning trees in company with a beautiful young girl called mella recently escaped from a lifetime of staring every morning at a hundred nearly identical photographs of moodily lit tubes of toothpaste in the art department of an advertising agency on the planet golgafrincham what then what happened next and the answer is of course that the book ended the next one didnt resume the story till five years later and you can claim some take discretion too far this arthur dent comes the cry from the furthest reaches of the galaxy and has even now been found inscribed on a mysterious deep space probe thought to originate from an alien galaxy at a distance too hideous to contemplate what is he man or mouse is he interested in nothing more than tea and the wider issues of life has he no spirit has he no passion does he not to put it in a nutshell fuck those who wish to know should read on others may wish to skip on to the last chapter which is a good bit and has marvin in it chapter arthur dent allowed himself for an unworthy moment to think as they drifted up that he very much hoped that his friends who had always found him pleasant but dull or more latterly odd but dull were having a good time in the pub but that was the last time for a while that he thought of them they drifted up spiralling slowly around each other like sycamore seeds falling from sycamore trees in the autumn except going the other way and as they drifted up their minds sang with the ecstatic knowledge that either what they were doing was completely and utterly and totally impossible or that physics had a lot of catching up to do physics shook its head and looking the other way concentrated on keeping the cars going along the euston road and out towards the westway flyover on keeping the streetlights lit and on making sure that when somebody on baker street dropped a cheeseburger it went splat upon the ground dwindling headily beneath them the beaded strings of light of london london arthur had to keep reminding himself not the strangely coloured fields of krikkit on the remote fringes of the galaxy lighted freckles of which faintly spanned the opening sky above them but london swayed swaying and turning turned try a swoop he called to fenchurch what her voice seemed strangely clear but distant in all the vast empty air it was breathy and faint with disbelief all those things clear faint distant breathy all at the same time were flying she said a trifle called arthur think nothing of it try a swoop a sw her hand caught his and in a second her weight caught it too and stunningly she was gone tumbling beneath him clawing wildly at nothing physics glanced at arthur and clotted with horror he was gone too sick with giddy dropping every part of him screaming but his voice they plummeted because this was london and you really couldnt do this sort of thing here he couldnt catch her because this was london and not a million miles from here seven hundred and fiftysix to be exact in pisa galileo had clearly demonstrated that two falling bodies fell at exactly the same rate of acceleration irrespective of their relative weights they fell arthur realized as he fell giddily and sickeningly that if he was going to hang around in the sky believing everything that the italians had to say about physics when they couldnt even keep a simple tower straight that they were in dead trouble and damn well did fall faster than fenchurch he grappled her from above and fumbled for a tight grip on her shoulders he got it fine they were now falling together which was all very sweet and romantic but didnt solve the basic problem which was that they were falling and the ground wasnt waiting around to see if he had any more clever tricks up his sleeve but was coming up to meet them like an express train he couldnt support her weight he hadnt anything he could support it with or against the only thing he could think was that they were obviously going to die and if he wanted anything other than the obvious to happen he was going to have to do something other than the obvious here he felt he was on familiar territory he let go of her pushed her away and when she turned her face to him in a gasp of stunned horror caught her little finger with his little finger and swung her back upwards tumbling clumsily up after her shit she said as she sat panting and breathless on absolutely nothing at all and when she had recovered herself they fled on up into the night just below cloud level they paused and scanned where they had impossibly come the ground was something not to regard with any too firm or steady an eye but merely to glance at as it were in passing fenchurch tried some little swoops daringly and found that if she judged herself just right against a body of wind she could pull off some really quite dazzling ones with a little pirouette at the end followed by a little drop which made her dress billow around her and this is where readers who are keen to know what marvin and ford prefect have been up to all this while should look ahead to later chapters because arthur now could wait no longer and helped her take it off it drifted down and away whipped by the wind until it was a speck which finally vanished and for various complicated reasons revolutionized the life of a family on hounslow over whose washing line it was discovered draped in the morning in a mute embrace they drifted up till they were swimming amongst the misty wraiths of moisture that you can see feathering around the wings of an aeroplane but never feel because you are sitting warm inside the stuffy aeroplane and looking through the little scratchy perspex window while somebody elses son tries patiently to pour warm milk into your shirt arthur and fenchurch could feel them wispy cold and thin wreathing round their bodies very cold very thin they felt even fenchurch now protected from the elements by only a couple of fragments from marks and spencer that if they were not going to let the force of gravity bother them then mere cold or paucity of atmosphere could go and whistle the two fragments from marks and spencer which as fenchurch rose now into the misty body of the clouds arthur removed very very slowly which is the only way its possible to do it when youre flying and also not using your hands went on to create considerable havoc in the morning in respectively counting from top to bottom isleworth and richmond they were in the cloud for a long time because it was stacked very high and when finally they emerged wetly above it fenchurch slowly spinning like a starfish lapped by a rising tidepool they found that above the clouds is where the night get seriously moonlit the light is darkly brilliant there are different mountains up there but they are mountains with their own white arctic snows they had emerged at the top of the highstacked cumulonimbus and now began lazily to drift down its contours as fenchurch eased arthur in turn from his clothes prised him free of them till all were gone winding their surprised way down into the enveloping whiteness she kissed him kissed his neck his chest and soon they were drifting on turning slowly in a kind of speechless tshape which might have caused even a fuolornis fire dragon had one flown past replete with pizza to flap its wings and cough a little there were however no fuolornis fire dragons in the clouds nor could there be for like the dinosaurs the dodos and the greater drubbered wintwock of stegbartle major in the constellation fraz and unlike the boeing which is in plentiful supply they are sadly extinct and the universe shall never know their like again the reason that a boeing crops up rather unexpectedly in the above list is not unconnected with the fact that something very similar happened in the lives of arthur and fenchurch a moment or two later they are big things terrifyingly big you know when one is in the air with you there is a thunderous attack of air a moving wall of screaming wind and you get tossed aside if you are foolish enough to be doing anything remotely like what arthur and fenchurch were doing in its close vicinity like butterflies in the blitz this time however there was a heartsickening fall or loss of nerve a regrouping moments later and a wonderful new idea enthusiastically signalled through the buffeting noise mrs e kapelsen of boston massachusetts was an elderly lady indeed she felt her life was nearly at an end she had seen a lot of it been puzzled by some but she was a little uneasy to feel at this late stage bored by too much it had all been very pleasant but perhaps a little too explicable a little too routine with a sigh she flipped up the little plastic window shutter and looked out over the wing at first she thought she ought to call the stewardess but then she thought no damn it definitely not this was for her and her alone by the time her two inexplicable people finally slipped back off the wing and tumbled into the slipstream she had cheered up an awful lot she was mostly immensely relieved to think that virtually everything that anybody had ever told her was wrong the following morning arthur and fenchurch slept very late in the alley despite the continual wail of furniture being restored the following night they did it all over again only this time with sony walkmen chapter this is all very wonderful said fenchurch a few days later but i do need to know what has happened to me you see theres this difference between us that you lost something and found it again and i found something and lost it i need to find it again she had to go out for the day so arthur settled down for a day of telephoning murray bost henson was a journalist on one of the papers with small pages and big print it would be pleasant to be able to say that he was none the worse for it but sadly this was not the case he happened to be the only journalist that arthur knew so arthur phoned him anyway arthur my old soup spoon my old silver turreen how particularly stunning to hear from you someone told me youd gone off into space or something murray had his own special kind of conversation language which he had invented for his own use and which no one else was able to speak or even to follow hardly any of it meant anything at all the bits which did mean anything were often so wonderfully buried that no one could ever spot them slipping past in the avalance of nonsense the time when you did find out later which bits he did mean was often a bad time for all concerned what said arthur just a rumour my old elephant tusk my little green baize card table just a rumour probably means nothing at all but i may need a quote from you nothing to say just pub talk we thrive on it my old prosthetic limb we thrive on it plus it would fit like a whatsit in one of those other things with the other stories of the week so it could be just to have you denying it excuse me something has just fallen out of my ear there was a slight pause at the end of which murray bost henson came back on the line sounding genuinely shaken just remembered he said what an odd evening i had last night anyway my old i wont say what how do you feel about having ridden on halleys comet i havent said arthur with a suppressed sigh ridden on halleys comet ok how do you feel about not having ridden on halleys comet pretty relaxed murray there was a pause while murray wrote this down good enough for me arthur good enough for ethel and me and the chickens fits in with the general weirdness of the week week of the weirdos were thinking of calling it good eh very good got a ring to it first we have this man it always rains on what its the absolute stocking top truth all documented in his little black book it all checks out at every single funloving level the met office is going ice cold thick banana whips and funny little men in white coats are flying in from all over the world with their little rulers and boxes and drip feeds this man is the bees knees arthur he is the wasps nipples he is i would go so far as to say the entire set of erogenous zones of every major flying insect of the western world were calling him the rain god nice eh i think ive met him good ring to it what did you say i may have met him complains all the time yes incredible you met the rain god if its the same guy i told him to stop complaining and show someone his book there was an impressed pause from murray bost hensons end of the phone well you did a bundle an absolute bundle has absolutely been done by you listen do you know how much a tour operator is paying that guy not to go to malaga this year i mean forget irrigating the sahara and boring stuff like that this guy has a whole new career ahead of him just avoiding places for money the mans turning into a monster arthur we might even have to make him win the bingo listen we may want to do a feature on you arthur the man who made the rain god rain got a ring to it eh a nice one but we may need to photograph you under a garden shower but thatll be ok where are you er im in islington listen murray islington yes well what about the real weirdness of the week the real seriously loopy stuff you know anything about these flying people no you must have this is the real seethingly crazy one this is the real meatballs in the batter locals are phoning in all the time to say theres this couple who go flying nights weve got guys down in our photo labs working through the night to put together a genuine photograph you must have heard no arthur where have you been oh space right i got your quote but that was months ago listen its night after night this week my old cheesegrater right on your patch this couple just fly around the sky and start doing all kinds of stuff and i dont mean looking through walls or pretending to be box girder bridges you dont know anything no arthur its been almost inexpressibly delicious conversing with you chumbum but i have to go ill send the guy with the camera and the hose give me the address im ready and writing listen murray i called to ask you something i have a lot to do i just wanted to find out something about the dolphins no story last years news forget em theyre gone its important listen no one will touch it you cant sustain a story you know when the only news is the continuing absence of whatever the storys about not our territory anyway try the sundays maybe theyll run a little whatever happened to whatever happened to the dolphins story in a couple of years around august but whats anybody going to do now dolphins still gone continuing dolphin absence dolphins further days without them the story dies arthur it lies down and kicks its little feet in the air and presently goes to the great golden spike in the sky my old fruitbat murray im not interested in whether its a story i just want to find out how i can get in touch with that guy in california who claims to know something about it i thought you might know chapter people are beginning to talk said fenchurch that evening after they had hauled her cello in not only talk said arthur but print in big bold letters under the bingo prizes which is why i thought id better get these he showed her the long narrow booklets of airline tickets arthur she said hugging him does that mean you managed to talk to him i have had a day said arthur of extreme telephonic exhaustion i have spoken to virtually every department of virtually every paper in fleet street and i finally tracked his number down youve obviously been working hard youre drenched with sweat poor darling not with sweat said arthur wearily a photographers just been i tried to argue but never mind the point is yes you spoke to him i spoke to his wife she said he was too weird to come to the phone right now and could i call back he sat down heavily realized he was missing something and went to the fridge to find it want a drink would commit murder to get one i always know im in for a tough time when my cello teacher looks me up and down and says ah yes my dear i think a little tchaikovsky today i called again said arthur and she said that he was light years from the phone and i should call back ah i called again she said the situation had improved he was now a mere light years from the phone but it was still a long way to shout you dont suppose said fenchurch doubtfully that theres anyone else we can talk to it gets worse said arthur i spoke to someone on a science magazine who actually knows him and he said that john watson will not only believe but will actually have absolute proof often dictated to him by angels with golden beards and green wings and doctor scholl footwear that the months most fashionable silly theory is true for people who question the validity of these visions he will triumphantly produce the clogs in question and thats as far as you get i didnt realize it was that bad said fenchurch quietly she fiddled listlessly with the tickets i phoned mrs watson again said arthur her name by the way and you may wish to know this is arcane jill i see im glad you see i thought you mightnt believe any of this so when i called her this time i used the telephone answering machine to record the call he went across to the telephone machine and fiddled and fumed with all its buttons for a while because it was the one which was particularly recommended by which magazine and is almost impossible to use without going mad here it is he said at last wiping the sweat from his brow the voice was thin and crackly with its journey to a geostationary satellite and back but it was also hauntingly calm perhaps i should explain arcane jill watsons voice said that the phone is in fact in a room that he never comes into its in the asylum you see wonko the sane does not like to enter the asylum and so he does not i feel you should know this because it may save you phoning if you would like to meet him this is very easily arranged all you have to do is walk in he will only meet people outside the asylum arthurs voice at its most mystified im sorry i dont understand where is the asylum where is the asylum arcane jill watson again have you ever read the instructions on a packet of toothpicks on the tape arthurs voice had to admit that he had not you may want to do that you may find that it clarifies things for you a little you may find that it indicates to you where the asylum is thank you the sound of the phone line went dead arthur turned the machine off well i suppose we can regard that as an invitation he said with a shrug i actually managed to get the address from the guy on the science magazine fenchurch looked up at him again with a thoughtful frown and looked at the tickets again do you think its worth it she said well said arthur the one thing that everyone i spoke to agrees on apart from the fact that they all thought he was barking mad is that he does know more than any man living about dolphins chapter this is an important announcement this is flight to los angeles if your travel plans today do not include los angeles now would be the perfect time to disembark chapter they rented a car in los angeles from one of the places that rents out cars that other people have thrown away getting it to go round corners is a bit of a problem said the guy behind the sunglasses as he handed them the keys sometimes its simpler just to get out and find a car thats going in that direction they stayed for one night in a hotel on sunset boulevard which someone had told them they would enjoy being puzzled by everyone there is either english or odd or both theyve got a swimming pool where you can go and watch english rock stars reading language truth and logic for the photographers it was true there was one and that was exactly what he was doing the garage attendant didnt think much of their car but that was fine because they didnt either late in the evening they drove through the hollywood hills along mulholland drive and stopped to look out first over the dazzling sea of floating light that is los angeles and later stopped to look across the dazzling sea of floating light that is the san fernando valley they agreed that the sense of dazzle stopped immediately at the back of their eyes and didnt touch any other part of them and came away strangely unsatisfied by the spectacle as dramatic seas of light went it was fine but light is meant to illuminate something and having driven through what this particularly dramatic sea of light was illuminating they didnt think much of it they slept late and restlessly and awoke at lunchtime when it was stupidly hot they drove out along the freeway to santa monica for their first look at the pacific ocean the ocean which wonko the sane spent all his days and a good deal of his nights looking at someone told me said fenchurch that they once overheard two old ladies on this beach doing what were doing looking at the pacific ocean for the first time in their lives and apparently after a long pause one of them said to the other you know its not as big as i expected their mood lifted further as the sun began to move down the western half of the sky and by the time they were back in their rattling car and driving towards a sunset that no one of any sensibility would dream of building a city like los angeles on front of they were suddenly feeling astonishingly and irrationally happy and didnt even mind that the terrible old car radio would only play two stations and those simultaneously so what they were both playing good rock and roll i know he will be able to help us said fenchurch determinedly i know he will whats his name again that he likes to be called wonko the sane i know that he will be able to help us arthur wondered if he would and hoped that he would and hoped that what fenchurch had lost could be found here on this earth whatever this earth might prove to be he hoped as he had hoped continually and fervently since the time they had talked together on the banks of the serpentine that he would not be called upon to try to remember something that he had very firmly and deliberately buried in the furthest recesses of his memory where he hoped it would cease to nag at him in santa barbara they stopped at a fish restaurant in what seemed to be a converted warehouse fenchurch had red mullet and said it was delicious arthur had a swordfish steak and said it made him angry he grabbed a passing waitress by the arm and berated her whys this fish so bloody good he demanded angrily please excuse my friend said fenchurch to the startled waitress i think hes having a nice day at last chapter if you took a couple of david bowies and stuck one of the david bowies on the top of the other david bowie then attached another david bowie to the end of each of the arms of the upper of the first two david bowies and wrapped the whole business up in a dirty beach robe you would then have something which didnt exactly look like john watson but which those who knew him would find hauntingly familiar he was tall and he gangled when he sat in his deckchair gazing at the pacific not so much with any kind of wild surmise any longer as with a peaceful deep dejection it was a little difficult to tell exactly where the deckchair ended and he began and you would hesitate to put your hand on say his forearm in case the whole structure suddenly collapsed with a snap and took your thumb off but his smile when he turned it on you was quite remarkable it seemed to be composed of all the worst things that life can do to you but which when he briefly reassembled them in that particular order on his face made you suddenly fee oh well thats all right then when he spoke you were glad that he used the smile that made you feel like that pretty often oh yes he said they come and see me they sit right here they sit right where youre sitting he was talking of the angels with the golden beards and green wings and dr scholl sandals they eat nachos which they say they cant get where they come from they do a lot of coke and are very wonderful about a whole range of things do they said arthur are they so er when is this then when do they come he gazed out at the pacific as well there were little sandpipers running along the margin of the shore which seemed to have this problem they needed to find their food in the sand which a wave had just washed over but they couldnt bear to get their feet wet to deal with this problem they ran with an odd kind of movement as if theyd been constructed by somebody very clever in switzerland fenchurch was sitting on the sand idly drawing patterns in it with her fingers weekends mostly said wonko the sane on little scooters they are great machines he smiled i see said arthur i see a tiny cough from fenchurch attracted his attention and he looked round at her she had scratched a little stick figure drawing in the sand of the two of them in the clouds for a moment he thought she was trying to get him excited then he realized that she was rebuking him who are we she was saying to say hes mad his house was certainly peculiar and since this was the first thing that fenchurch and arthur had encountered it would help to know what it was like what it was like was this it was inside out actually inside out to the extent that they had to park on the carpet all along what one would normally call the outer wall which was decorated in a tasteful interiordesigned pink were bookshelves also a couple of those odd threelegged tables with semicircular tops which stand in such a way as to suggest that someone just dropped the wall straight through them and pictures which were clearly designed to soothe where it got really odd was the roof it folded back on itself like something that maurits c escher had he been given to hard nights on the town which is no part of this narratives purpose to suggest was the case though it is sometimes hard looking at his pictures particularly the one with the awkward steps not to wonder might have dreamed up after having been on one for the little chandeliers which should have been hanging inside were on the outside pointing up confusing the sign above the front door said come outside and so nervously they had inside of course was where the outside was rough brickwork nicely done painting guttering in good repair a garden path a couple of small trees some rooms leading off and the inner walls stretched down folded curiously and opened at the end as if by an optical illusion which would have had maurits c escher frowning and wondering how it was done to enclose the pacific ocean itself hello said john watson wonko the sane good they thought to themselves hello is something we can cope with hello they said and all surprisingly was smiles for quite a while he seemed curiously reluctant to talk about the dolphins looking oddly distracted and saying i forget whenever they were mentioned and had shown them quite proudly round the eccentricities of his house it gives me pleasure he said in a curious kind of way and does nobody any harm he continued that a competent optician couldnt correct they liked him he had an open engaging quality and seemed able to mock himself before anybody else did your wife said arthur looking around mentioned some toothpicks he said it with a hunted look as if he was worried that she might suddenly leap out from behind the door and mention them again wonko the sane laughed it was a light easy laugh and sounded like one he had used a lot before and was happy with ah yes he said thats to so with the day i finally realized that the world had gone totally mad and built the asylum to put it in poor thing and hoped it would get better this was the point at which arthur began to feel a little nervous again here said wonko the sane we are outside the asylum he pointed again at the rough brickwork the pointing and the guttering go through that door he pointed at the first door through which they had originally entered and you go into the asylum ive tried to decorate it nicely to keep the inmates happy but theres very little one can do i never go in there now myself if ever i am tempted which these days i rarely am i simply look at the sign written over the door and shy away that one said fenchurch pointing rather puzzled at a blue plaque with some instructions written on it yes they are the words that finally turned me into the hermit i have now become it was quite sudden i saw them and i knew what i had to do the sign said hold stick near centre of its length moisten pointed end in mouth insert in tooth space blunt end next to gum use gentle inout motion it seemed to me said wonko the sane that any civilization that had so far lost its head as to need to include a set of detailed instructions for use in a packet of toothpicks was no longer a civilization in which i could live and stay sane he gazed out at the pacific again as if daring it to rave and gibber at him but it lay there calmly and played with the sandpipers and in case it crossed your mind to wonder as i can see how it possibly might i am completely sane which is why i call myself wonko the sane just to reassure people on this point wonko is what my mother called me when i was a kid and clumsy and knocked things over and sane is what i am and how he added with one of his smiles that made you feel oh well thats all right then i intend to remain shall we go on to the beach and see what we have to talk about they went out on to the beach which was where he started talking about angels with golden beards and green wings and dr scholl sandals about the dolphins said fenchurch gently hopefully i can show you the sandals said wonko the sane i wonder do you know would you like me to show you said wonko the sane the sandals i have them ill get them they are made by the dr scholl company and the angels say that they particularly suit the terrain they have to work in they say they run a concession stand by the message when i say i dont know what that means they say no you dont and laugh well ill get them anyway as he walked back towards the inside or the outside depending on how you looked at it arthur and fenchurch looked at each other in a wondering and slightly desperate sort of way then each shrugged and idly drew figures in the sand how are the feet today said arthur quietly ok it doesnt feel so odd in the sand or in the water the water touches them perfectly i just think this isnt our world she shrugged what do you think he meant she said by the message i dont know said arthur though the memory of a man called prak who laughed at him continuously kept nagging at him when wonko returned he was carrying something that stunned arthur not the sandals they were perfectly ordinary wooden bottomed sandals i just thought youd like to see he said what angels wear on their feet just out of curiousity im not trying to prove anything by the way im a scientist and i know what constitutes proof but the reason i call myself by my childhood name is to remind myself that a scientist must also be absolutely like a child if he sees a thing he must say that he sees it whether it was what he thought he was going to see or not see first think later then test but always see first otherwise you will only see what you were expecting most scientists forget that ill show you something to demonstrate that later so the other reason i call myself wonko the sane is so that people will think i am a fool that allows me to say what i see when i see it you cant possibly be a scientist if you mind people thinking that youre a fool anyway i also thought you might like to see this this was the thing that arthur had been stunned to see him carrying for it was a wonderful silvergrey glass fish bowl seemingly identical to the one in arthurs bedroom arthur had been trying for some thirty seconds now without success to say where did you get that sharply and with a gasp in his voice finally his time had come but he missed it by a millisecond where did you get that said fenchurch sharply and with a gasp in her voice arthur glanced at fenchurch sharply and with a gasp in his voice said what have you seen one of these before yes she said ive got one or at least i did have russell nicked it to put his golfballs in i dont know where it came from just that i was angry with russell for nicking it why have you got one yes it was they both became aware that wonko the sane was glancing sharply backwards and forwards between them and trying to get a gasp in edgeways you have one of those too he said to both of them yes they both said it he looked long and calmly at each of them then he held up the bowl to catch the light of the californian sun the bowl seemed almost to sing with the sun to chime with the intensity of its light and cast darkly brilliant rainbows around the sand and upon them he turned it and turned it they could see quite clearly in the fine tracery of its etchwork the words so long and thanks for all the fish do you know asked wonko quietly what it is they each shook their heads slowly and with wonder almost hypnotized by the flashing of the lightning shadows in the grey glass it is a farewell gift from the dolphins said wonko in a low quiet voice the dolphins whom i loved and studied and swam with and fed with fish and even tried to learn their language a task which they seemed to make impossibly difficult considering the fact that i now realize they were perfectly capable of communicating in ours if they decided they wanted to he shook his head with a slow slow smile and then looked again at fenchurch and then at arthur have you he said to arthur what have you done with yours may i ask you that er i keep a fish in it said arthur slightly embarrassed i happened to have this fish i was wondering what to do with and er there was this bowl he tailed off youve done nothing else no he said if you had you would know he shook his head again my wife kept wheatgerm in ours resumed wonko with some new tone in his voice until last night what said arthur slowly and hushedly happened last night we ran out of wheatgerm said wonko evenly my wife he added has gone to get some more he seemed lost with his own thoughts for a moment and what happened then said fenchurch in the same breathless tone i washed it said wonko i washed it very carefully very very carefully removing every last speck of wheatgerm then i dried it slowly with a lintfree cloth slowly carefully turning it over and over then i held it to my ear have you have you held one to your ear they both shook their heads again slowly again dumbly perhaps he said you should chapter the deep roar of the ocean the break of waves on further shores than thought can find the silent thunders of the deep and from among it voices calling and yet not voices humming trillings wordlings the halfarticulated songs of thought greetings waves of greetings sliding back down into the inarticulate words breaking together a crash of sorrow on the shores of earth waves of joy on where a world indescribably found indescribably arrived at indescribably wet a song of water a fugue of voices now clamouring explanations of a disaster unavertable a world to be destroyed a surge of helplessness a spasm of despair a dying fall again the break of words and then the fling of hope the finding of a shadow earth in the implications of enfolded time submerged dimensions the pull of parallels the deep pull the spin of will the hurl and split of it the flight a new earth pulled into replacement the dolphins gone then stunningly a single voice quite clear this bowl was brought to you by the campaign to save the humans we bid you farewell and then the sound of long heavy perfectly grey bodies rolling away into an unknown fathomless deep quietly giggling chapter that night they stayed outside the asylum and watched tv from inside it this is what i wanted you to see said wonko the sane when the news came around again an old colleague of mine hes over in your country running an investigation just watch it was a press conference im afraid i cant comment on the name rain god at this present time and we are calling him an example of a spontaneous para causal meteorological phenomenon can you tell us what that means im not altogether sure lets be straight here if we find something we cant understand we like to call it something you cant understand or indeed pronounce i mean if we just let you go around calling him a rain god then that suggests that you know something we dont and im afraid we couldnt have that no first we have to call it something which says its ours not yours then we set about finding some way of proving its not what you said it is but something we say it is and if it turns out that youre right youll still be wrong because we will simply call him a er supernormal not paranormal or supernatural because you think you know what those mean now no a supernormal incremental precipitation inducer well probably want to shove a quasi in there somewhere to protect ourselves rain god huh never heard such nonsense in my life admittedly you wouldnt catch me going on holiday with him thanks thatll be all for now other than to say hi to wonko if hes watching chapter on the way home there was a woman sitting next to them on the plane who was looking at them rather oddly they talked quietly to themselves i still have to know said fenchurch and i strongly feel that you know something that youre not telling me arthur sighed and took out a piece of paper do you have a pencil he said she dug around and found one what are you doing sweetheart she said after he had spent twenty minutes frowning chewing the pencil scribbling on the paper crossing things out scribbling again chewing the pencil again and grunting irritably to himself trying to remember an address someone once gave me your life would be an awful lot simpler she said if you bought yourself an address book finally he passed the paper to her you look after it he said she looked at it among all the scratchings and crossings out were the words quentulus quazgar mountains sevorbeupstry planet of preliumtarn sunzarss galactic sector qq active j gamma and whats there apparently said arthur its gods final message to his creation that sounds a bit more like it said fenchurch how do we get there you really yes said fenchurch firmly i really want to know arthur looked out of the scratchy little perspex window at the open sky outside excuse me said the woman who had been looking at them rather oddly suddenly i hope you dont think im rude i get so bored on these long flights its nice to talk to somebody my names enid kapelsen im from boston tell me do you fly a lot chapter they went to arthurs house in the west country shoved a couple of towels and stuff in a bag and then sat down to do what every galactic hitch hiker ends up spending most of his time doing they waited for a flying saucer to come by friend of mine did this for fifteen years said arthur one night as they sat forlornly watching the sky who was that called ford prefect he caught himself doing something he had never really expected to do again he wondered where ford prefect was by an extraordinary coincidence the following day there were two reports in the paper one concerning the most astonishing incidents with a flying saucer and the other about a series of unseemly riots in pubs ford prefect turned up the day after that looking hung over and complaining that arthur never answered the phone in fact he looked extremely ill not merely as if hed been pulled through a hedge backwards but as if the hedge was being simultaneously pulled backwards through a combine harvester he staggered into arthurs sitting room waving aside all offers of support which was an error because the effort caused him to lose his balance altogether and arthur had eventually to drag him to the sofa thank you said ford thank you very much have you he said and fell asleep for three hours the faintest idea he continued suddenly when he revived how hard it is to tap into the british phone system from the pleiades i can see that you havent so ill tell you he said over the very large mug of black coffee that you are about to make me he followed arthur wobbily into the kitchen stupid operators keep asking you where youre calling from and you try and tell them letchworth and they say you couldnt be if youre coming in on that circuit what are you doing making you some black coffee oh ford seemed oddly disappointed he looked about the place forlornly whats this he said rice crispies and this paprika i see said ford solemnly and put the two items back down one on top of the other but that didnt seem to balance properly so he put the other on top of the one and that seemed to work a little spacelagged he said what was i saying about not phoning from letchworth i wasnt i explained this to the lady bugger letchworth i said if thats your attitude i am in fact calling from a sales scoutship of the sirius cybernetics corporation currently on the sublightspeed leg of a journey between the stars known on your world though not necessarily to you dear lady i said dear lady explained ford prefect because i didnt want her to be offended by my implication that she was an ignorant cretin tactful said arthur dent exactly said ford tactful he frowned spacelag he said is very bad for subclauses youll have to assist me again he continued by reminding me what i was talking about between the stars said arthur known on your world though not necessarily to you dear lady as pleiades epsilon and pleiades zeta concluded ford triumphantly this conversation lark is quite gas isnt it have some coffee thank you no and the reason i said why i am bothering you with it rather than just dialling direct as i could because we have some pretty sophisticated telecommunications equipment out here in the pleiades i can tell you is that the penny pinching son of a starbeast piloting this son of a starbeast spaceship insists that i call collect can you believe that and could she i dont know she had hung up said ford by this time so what do you suppose he asked fiercely i did next ive no idea ford said arthur pity said ford i was hoping you could remind me i really hate those guys you know they really are the creeps of the cosmos buzzing around the celestial infinite with their junky little machines that never work properly or when they do perform functions that no sane man would require of them and he added savagely go beep to tell you when theyve done it this was perfectly true and a very respectable view widely held by right thinking people who are largely recognizable as being right thinking people by the mere fact that they hold this view the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy in a moment of reasoned lucidity which is almost unique among its current tally of five million nine hundred and seventyfive thousand five hundred and nine pages says of the sirius cybernetics corporation product that it is very easy to be blinded to the essential uselessness of them by the sense of achievement you get from getting them to work at all in other words and this is the rock solid principle on which the whole of the corporations galaxywide success is founded their fundamental design flaws are completely hidden by their superficial design flaws and this guy ranted ford was on a drive to sell more of them his fiveyear mission to seek out and explore strange new worlds and sell advanced music substitute systems to their restaurants elevators and wine bars or if they didnt have restaurants elevators and wine bars yet to artificially accelerate their civilization growth until they bloody well did have wheres that coffee i threw it away make some more i have now remembered what i did next i saved civilization as we know it i knew it was something like that he stumbled determinedly back into the sitting room where he seemed to carry on talking to himself tripping over the furniture and making beep beep noises a couple of minutes later wearing his very placid face arthur followed him ford looked stunned where have you been he demanded making some coffee said arthur still wearing his very placid face he had long ago realized that the only way of being in fords company successfully was to keep a large stock of very placid faces and wear them at all times you missed the best bit raged ford you missed the bit where i jumped the guy now he said i shall have to jump him all over him he hurled himself recklessly at a chair and broke it it was better he said sullenly last time and waved vaguely in the direction of another broken chair which he had already got trussed up on the dining table i see said arthur casting a placid eye over the trussed up wreckage and er what are all the ice cubes for what screamed ford what you missed that bit too thats the suspended animation facility i put the guy in the suspended animation facility well i had to didnt i so it would seem said arthur in his placid voice dont touch that yelled ford arthur who was about to replace the phone which was for some mysterious reason lying on the table off the hook paused placidly ok said ford calming down listen to it arthur put the phone to his ear its the speaking clock he said beep beep beep said ford is exactly what is being heard all over that guys ship while he sleeps in the ice going slowly round a littleknown moon of sesefras magna the london speaking clock i see said arthur again and decided that now was the time to ask the big one why he said placidly with a bit of luck said ford the phone bill will bankrupt the buggers he threw himself sweating on to the sofa anyway he said dramatic arrival dont you think chapter the flying saucer in which ford prefect had stowed away had stunned the world finally there was no doubt no possibility of mistake no hallucinations no mysterious cia agents found floating in reservoirs this time it was real it was definite it was quite definitely definite it had come down with a wonderful disregard for anything beneath it and crushed a large area of some of the most expensive real estate in the world including much of harrods the thing was massive nearly a mile across some said dull silver in colour pitted scorched and disfigured with the scars of unnumbered vicious space battles fought with savage forces by the light of suns unknown to man a hatchway opened crashed down through the harrods food halls demolished harvey nicholls and with a final grinding scream of tortured architecture toppled the sheraton park tower after a long heartstopping moment of internal crashes and grumbles of rending machinery there marched from it down the ramp an immense silver robot a hundred feet tall it held up a hand i come in peace it said adding after a long moment of further grinding take me to your lizard ford prefect of course had an explanation for this as he sat with arthur and watched the nonstop frenetic news reports on the television none of which had anything to say other than to record that the thing had done this amount of damage which was valued at that amount of billions of pounds and had killed this totally other number of people and then say it again because the robot was doing nothing more than standing there swaying very slightly and emitting short incomprehensible error messages it comes from a very ancient democracy you see you mean it comes from a world of lizards no said ford who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been having finally had the coffee forced down him nothing so simple nothing anything like so straightforward on its world the people are people the leaders are lizards the people hate the lizards and the lizards role the people odd said arthur i thought you said it was a democracy i did said ford it is so said arthur hoping he wasnt sounding ridiculously obtuse why dont people get rid of the lizards it honestly doesnt occur to them said ford theyve all got the vote so they all pretty much assume that the government theyve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want you mean they actually vote for the lizards oh yes said ford with a shrug of course but said arthur going for the big one again why because if they didnt vote for a lizard said ford the wrong lizard might get in got any gin what i said said ford with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice have you got any gin ill look tell me about the lizards ford shrugged again some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them he said theyre completely wrong of course completely and utterly wrong but someones got to say it but thats terrible said arthur listen bud said ford if i had one altairan dollar for every time i heard one bit of the universe look at another bit of the universe and say thats terrible i wouldnt be sitting here like a lemon looking for a gin but i havent and i am anyway what are you looking so placid and mooneyed for are you in love arthur said yes he was and said it placidly with someone who knows where the gin bottle is do i get to meet her he did because fenchurch came in at that moment with a pile of newspapers shed been into the village to buy she stopped in astonishment at the wreckage on the table and the wreckage from betelgeuse on the sofa wheres the gin said ford to fenchurch and to arthur what happened to trillian by the way er this is fenchurch said arthur awkwardly there was nothing with trillian you must have seen her last oh yeah said ford she went off with zaphod somewhere they had some kids or something at least he added i think thats what they were zaphods calmed down a lot you know really said arthur clustering hurriedly round fenchurch to relieve her of the shopping yeah said ford at least one of his heads is now saner than an emu on acid arthur who is this said fenchurch ford prefect said arthur i may have mentioned him in passing chapter for a total of three days and nights the giant silver robot stood in stunned amazement straddling the remains of knightsbridge swaying slightly and trying to work out a number of things government deputations came to see it ranting journalists by the truckload asked each other questions on the air about what they thought of it flights of fighter bombers tried pathetically to attack it but no lizards appeared it scanned the horizon slowly at night it was at its most spectacular floodlit by the teams of television crews who covered it continuously as it continuously did nothing it thought and thought and eventually reached a conclusion it would have to send out its service robots it should have thought of that before but it was having a number of problems the tiny flying robots came screeching out of the hatchway one afternoon in a terrifying cloud of metal they roamed the surrounding terrain frantically attacking some things and defending others one of them at last found a pet shop with some lizards but it instantly defended the pet shop for democracy so savagely that little in the area survived a turning point came when a crack team of flying screechers discovered the zoo in regents park and most particularly the reptile house learning a little caution from their previous mistakes in the petshop the flying drills and fretsaws brought some of the larger and fatter iguanas to the giant silver robot who tried to conduct highlevel talks with them eventually the robot announced to the world that despite the full frank and wideranging exchange of views the high level talks had broken down the lizards had been retired and that it the robot would take a short holiday somewhere and for some reason selected bournemouth ford prefect watching it on tv nodded laughed and had another beer immediate preparations were made for its departure the flying toolkits screeched and sawed and drilled and fried things with light throughout that day and all through the night time and in the morning stunningly a giant mobile gantry started to roll westwards on several roads simultaneously with the robot standing on it supported within the gantry westward it crawled like a strange carnival buzzed around by its servants and helicopters and news coaches scything through the land until at last it came to bournemouth where the robot slowly freed itself from it transport systems embraces and went and lay for ten days on the beach it was of course by far the most exciting thing that had ever happened to bournemouth crowds gathered daily along the perimeter which was staked out and guarded as the robots recreation area and tried to see what it was doing it was doing nothing it was lying on the beach it was lying a little awkwardly on its face it was a journalist from a local paper who late one night managed to do what no one else in the world had so far managed which was to strike up a brief intelligible conversation with one of the service robots guarding the perimeter it was an extraordinary breakthrough i think theres a story in it confided the journalist over a cigarette shared through the steel link fence but it needs a good local angle ive got a little list of questions here he went on rummaging awkwardly in an inner pocket perhaps you could get him it whatever you call him to run through them quickly the little flying ratchet screwdriver said it would see what it cold do and screeched off a reply was never forthcoming curiously however the questions on the piece of paper more or less exactly matched the questions that were going through the massive battlescarred industrial quality circuits of the robots mind they were these how do you feel about being a robot how does it feel to be from outer space and how do you like bournemouth early the following day things started to be packed up and within a few days it became apparent that the robot was preparing to leave for good the point is said fenchurch to ford can you get us on board ford looked wildly at his watch i have some serious unfinished business to attend to he exclaimed chapter crowds thronged as close as they could to the giant silver craft which wasnt very the immediate perimeter was fenced off and patrolled by the tiny flying service robots staked out around that was the army who had been completely unable to breach that inner perimeter but were damned if anybody was going to breach them they in turn were surrounded by a cordon of police though whether they were there to protect the public from the army or the army from the public or to guarantee the giant ships diplomatic immunity and prevent it getting parking tickets was entirely unclear and the subject of much debate the inner perimeter fence was now being dismantled the army stirred uncomfortably uncertain of how to react to the fact that the reason for their being there seemed as if it was simply going to get up and go the giant robot had lurched back aboard the ship at lunchtime and now it was five oclock in the afternoon and no further sign had been seen of it much had been heard more grindings and rumblings from deep within the craft the music of a million hideous malfunctions but the sense of tense expectation among the crowd was born of the fact that they tensely expected to be disappointed this wonderful extraordinary thing had come into their lives an now it was simply going to go without them two people were particularly aware of this sensation arthur and fenchurch scanned the crowd anxiously unable to find ford prefect in it anywhere or any sign that he had the slightest intention of being there how reliable is he asked fenchurch in a sinking voice how reliable said arthur he gave a hollow laugh how shallow is the ocean he said how cold is the sun the last parts of the robots gantry transport were being carried on board and the few remaining sections of the perimeter fence were now stacked at the bottom of the ramp waiting to follow them the soldiers on guard round the ramp bristled meaningfully orders were barked back and forth hurried conferences were held but nothing of course could be done about any of it hopelessly and with no clear plan now arthur and fenchurch pushed forward through the crowd but since the whole crowd was also trying to push forward through the crowd this got them nowhere and within a few minutes more nothing remained outside the ship every last link of the fence was aboard a couple of flying fret saws and a spirit level seemed to do one last check around the site and then screamed in through the giant hatchway themselves a few seconds passed the sounds of mechanical disarray from within changed in intensity and slowly heavily the huge steel ramp began to lift itself back out of the harrods food halls the sound that accompanied it was the sound of thousands of tense excited people being completely ignored hold it a megaphone barked from a taxi which screeched to a halt on the edge of the milling crowd there has been barked the megaphone a major scientific breakin through breakthrough it corrected itself the door flew open and a small man from somewhere in the vicinity of betelgeuse leapt out wearing a white coat hold it he shouted again and this time brandished a short squad black rod with lights on it the lights winked briefly the ramp paused in its ascent and then in obedience to the signals from the thumb which half the electronic engineers in the galaxy are constantly trying to find fresh ways of jamming while the other half are constantly trying to find fresh ways of jamming the jamming signals slowly ground its way downwards again ford prefect grabbed his megaphone from out of the taxi and started bawling at the crowd through it make way he shouted make way please this is a major scientific breakthrough you and you get the equipment from the taxi completely at random he pointed at arthur and fenchurch who wrestled their way back out of the crowd and clustered urgently round the taxi all right i want you to clear a passage please for some important pieces of scientific equipment boomed ford just everybody keep calm its all under control theres nothing to see it is merely a major scientific breakthrough keep calm now important scientific equipment clear the way hungry for new excitement delighted at this sudden reprieve from disappointment the crowd enthusiastically fell back and started to open up arthur was a little surprised to see what was printed on the boxes of important scientific equipment in the back of the taxi hang your coat over them he muttered to fenchurch as he heaved them out to her hurriedly he manoeuvred out the large supermarket trolley that was also jammed against the back seat it clattered to the ground and together they loaded the boxes into it clear a path please shouted ford again everythings under proper scientific control he said youd pay said the taxidriver to arthur who dug out some notes and paid him there was the distant sound of police sirens move along there shouted ford and no one will get hurt the crowd surged and closed behind them again as frantically they pushed and hauled the rattling supermarket trolley through the rubble towards the ramp its all right ford continued to bellow theres nothing to see its all over none of this is actually happening clear the way please boomed a police megaphone from the back of the crowd theres been a breakin clear the way breakthrough yelled ford in competition a scientific breakthrough this is the police clear the way scientific equipment clear the way police let us through walkmen yelled ford and pulled half a dozen miniature tape players from his pockets and tossed them into the crowd the resulting seconds of utter confusion allowed them to get the supermarket trolley to the edge of the ramp and to haul it up on to the lip of it hold tight muttered ford and released a button on his electronic thumb beneath them the huge ramp juddered and began slowly to heave its way upwards ok kids he said as the milling crowd dropped away beneath them and they started to lurch their way along the tilting ramp into the bowels of the ship looks like were on our way chapter arthur dent was irritated to be continually wakened by the sound of gunfire being careful not to wake fenchurch who was still managing to sleep fitfully he slid his way out of the maintenance hatchway which they had fashioned into a kind of bunk for themselves slung himself down the access ladder and prowled the corridors moodily they were claustrophobic and illlit the lighting circuits buzzed annoyingly this wasnt it though he paused and leaned backwards as a flying power drill flew past him down the dim corridor with a nasty screech occasionally clanging against the walls like a confused bee as it did so that wasnt it either he clambered through a bulkhead door and found himself in a larger corridor acrid smoke was drifting up from one end so he walked towards the other he came to an observation monitor let into the wall behind a plate of toughened but still badly scratched perspex would you turn it down please he said to ford prefect who was crouching in front of it in the middle of a pile of bits of video equipment hed taken from a shop window in tottenham court road having first hurled a small brick through it and also a nasty heap of empty beer cans shhhh hissed ford and peered with manic concentration at the screen he was watching the magnificent seven just a bit said arthur no shouted ford were just getting to the good bit listen i finally got it all sorted out voltage levels line conversion everything and this is the good bit with a sigh and a headache arthur sat down beside him and watched the good bit he listened to fords whoops and yells and yeehays as placidly as he could ford he said eventually when it was all over and ford was hunting through a stack of cassettes for the tape of casablanca how come if this is the big one said ford this is the one i came back for do you realize i never saw it all through always i missed the end i saw half of it again the night before the vogons came when they blew the place up i thought id never get to see it hey what happened with all that anyway just life said arthur and plucked a beer from a sixpack oh that again said ford i thought it might be something like that i prefer this stuff he said as ricks bar flickered on to the screen how come if what what you started to say how come if how come if youre so rude about the earth that you oh never mind lets just watch the movie exactly said ford chapter there remains little still to tell beyond what used to be known as the limitless lightfields of flanux until the grey binding fiefdoms of saxaquine were discovered lying behind them lie the grey binding fiefdoms of saxaquine within the grey binding fiefdoms of saxaquine lies the star named zarss around which orbits the planet preliumtarn in which is the land of sevorbeupstry and it was to the land of sevorbeupstry that arthur and fenchurch came at last a little tired by the journey and in the land of sevorbeupstry they came to the great red plain of rars which was bounded on the south side by the quentulus quazgar mountains on the further side of which according to the dying words of prak they would find in thirty foothigh letters of fire gods final message to his creation according to prak if arthurs memory saved him right the place was guarded by the lajestic vantrashell of lob and so after a manner it proved to be he was a little man in a strange hat and he sold them a ticket keep to the left please he said keep to the left and hurried on past them on a little scooter they realized they were not the first to pass that way for the path that led around the left of the great plain was wellworn and dotted with booths at one they bought a box of fudge which had been baked in an oven in a cave in the mountain which was heated by the fire of the letters that formed gods final message to his creation at another they bought some postcards the letters had been blurred with an airbrush so as not to spoil the big surprise it said on the reverse do you know what the message is they asked the wizened little lady in the booth oh yes she piped cheerily oh yes she waved them on every twenty miles or so there was a little stone hut with showers and sanitary facilities but the going was tough and the high sun baked down on the great red plain and the great red plain rippled in the heat is it possible asked arthur at one of the larger booths to rent one of those little scooters like the one lajestic ventrawhatsit had the scooters said the little lady who was serving at an ice cream bar are not for the devout oh well thats easy then said fenchurch were not particularly devout were just interested then you must turn back now said the little lady severely and when they demurred sold them a couple of final message sunhats and a photograph of themselves with their arms tight around each other on the great red plain of rars they drank a couple of sodas in the shade of the booth and then trudged out into the sun again were running out of border cream said fenchurch after a few more miles we can go to the next booth or we can return to the previous one which is nearer but means we have to retrace our steps again they stared ahead at the distant black speck winking in the heat haze they looked behind themselves they elected to go on they then discovered that they were not only not the first ones to make this journey but that they were not the only ones making it now some way ahead of them an awkward low shape was heaving itself wretchedly along the ground stumbling painfully slowly half limping halfcrawling it was moving so slowly that before too long they caught the creature up and could see that it was made of worn scarred and twisted metal it groaned at them as they approached it collapsing in the hot dry dust so much time it groaned oh so much time and pain as well so much of that and so much time to suffer it in too one or the other on its own i could probably manage its the two together that really get me down oh hello you again marvin said arthur sharply crouching down beside it is that you you were always one groaned the aged husk of the robot for the superintelligent question werent you what is it whispered fenchurch in alarm crouching behind arthur and grasping on to his arm hes sort of an old friend said arthur i friend croaked the robot pathetically the word died away in a kind of crackle and flakes of rust fell out of its mouth youll have to excuse me while i try and remember what the word means my memory banks are not what they were you know and any word which falls into disuse for a few zillion years has to get shifted down into auxiliary memory backup ah here it comes the robots battered head snapped up a bit as if in thought hmm he said what a curious concept he thought a little longer no he said at last dont think i ever came across one of those sorry cant help you there he scraped a knee along pathetically in the dust an then tried to twist himself up on his misshapen elbows is there any last service you would like me to perform for you perhaps he asked in a kind of hollow rattle a piece of paper that perhaps you would like me to pick up for you or maybe you would like me he continued to open a door his head scratched round in its rusty neck bearings and seemed to scan the distant horizon dont seem to be any doors around at present he said but im sure that if we waited long enough someone would build one and then he said slowly twisting his head around to see arthur again i could open it for you im quite used to waiting you know arthur hissed fenchurch in his ear sharply you never told me of this what have you done to this poor creature nothing insisted arthur sadly hes always like this ha snapped marvin ha he repeated what do you know of always you say always to me who because of the silly little errands your organic lifeforms keep on sending me through time on am now thirtyseven times older than the universe itself pick your words with a little more care he coughed and tact he rasped his way through a coughing fit and resumed leave me he said go on ahead leave me to struggle painfully on my way my time at last has nearly come my race is nearly run i fully expect he said feebly waving them on with a broken finger to come in last it would be fitting here i am brain the size between them they picked him up despite his feeble protests and insults the metal was so hot it nearly blistered their fingers but he weighed surprisingly little and hung limply between their arms they carried him with them along the path that ran along the left of the great red plain of rars toward the encircling mountains of quentulus quazgar arthur attempted to explain to fenchurch but was too often interrupted by marvins dolorous cybernetic ravings they tried to see if they could get him some spare parts at one of the booths but marvin would have none of it im all spare parts he droned let me be he groaned every part of me he moaned has been replaced at least fifty times except he seemed almost imperceptibly to brighten for a moment his head bobbed between them with the effort of memory do you remember the first time you ever met me he said at last to arthur i had been given the intellect stretching task of taking you up to the bridge i mentioned to you that i had this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side that i had asked for them to be replaced but they never were he left a longish pause before he continued they carried him on between them under the baking sun that hardly ever seemed to move let alone set see if you can guess said marvin when he judged that the pause had become embarrassing enough which parts of me were never replaced go on see if you can guess ouch he added ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch at last they reached the last of the little booths set down marvin between them and rested in the shade fenchurch bought some cufflinks for russell cufflinks that had set in them little polished pebbles which had been picked up from the quentulus quazgar mountains directly underneath the letters of fire in which was written gods final message to his creation arthur flipped through a little rack of devotional tracts on the counter little meditations on the meaning of the message ready he said to fenchurch who nodded they heaved up marvin between them they rounded the foot of the quentulus quazgar mountains and there was the message written in blazing letters along the crest of the mountain there was a little observation vantage point with a rail built along the top of a large rock facing it from which you could get a good view it had a little paytelescope for looking at the letters in detail but no one would ever use it because the letters burned with the divine brilliance of the heavens and would if seen through a telescope have severely damaged the retina and optic nerve they gazed at gods final message in wonderment and were slowly and ineffably filled with a great sense of peace and of final and complete understanding fenchurch sighed yes she said that was it they had been staring at it for fully ten minutes before they became aware that marvin hanging between their shoulders was in difficulties the robot could no longer lift his head had not read the message they lifted his head but he complained that his vision circuits had almost gone they found a coin and helped him to the telescope he complained and insulted them but they helped him look at each individual letter in turn the first letter was a w the second an e then there was a gap an a followed then a p an o and an l marvin paused for a rest after a few moments they resumed and let him see the o the g the i the s and the e the next two words were for and the the last one was a long one and marvin needed another rest before he could tackle it it started with an i then n then a c next came an o and an n followed by a v an e another n and an i after a final pause marvin gathered his strength for the last stretch he read the e the n the c and at last the final e and staggered back into their arms i think he murmured at last from deep within his corroding rattling thorax i feel good about it the lights went out in his eyes for absolutely the very last time ever luckily there was a stall nearby where you could rent scooters from guys with green wings epilogue one of the greatest benefactors of all lifekind was a man who couldnt keep his mind on the job in hand brilliant certainly one of the foremost genetic
