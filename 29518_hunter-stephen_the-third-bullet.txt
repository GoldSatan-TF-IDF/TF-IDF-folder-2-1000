stephen hunter the third bullet i think its time we stop children whats that sound everybody look whats going down for what its worth buffalo springfield part i usa theres something happening here chapter baltimore the sidewalk before him bucked and heaved blown askew by high winds howling through the night oh wait no lets edit that there was no bucking and heaving ditto with the blown askew and the high winds howling through the night it just seemed so to aptapton because the winds that toyed with the stability of the sidewalk blewhowledonly through his own mind they were zephyrs of vodka and theyd substantially loosened his grip on the solidity of the little chunk of earth that lay between the bar hed just exited and the house where he lived a few hundred yards ahead aptapton alcoholic writer success melancholiac and gun guy was in a zone that might be called greater than a buzz but less than a full staggering drunk he was one sheet to the wind you might say happyhappyhappyhappy as three vodka martinis will do to a fellow with only moderate capacity for drink and what lay ahead although slightly challenging didnt really seem insurmountable after all he had to walk only another few feet cross the street and then digression pause for autobiographical interlude its allowed when under the influence one thing suggests another and in this case the suggestion is appropriate the street was called light and that suggested a kind of hopeful conclusion to the evening light as in light of heart light of spirit light at end of tunnel light as in amusing fey witty light as symbol of hope and life but also light as in light for all as a famous newspaper located a mile or so up the very same light street had proclaimed on a daily basis for years or so twentysix of which hed spent in its employ and where his wife to this day toiled yes he was that james aptapton minor local journo celeb whod gone on to minor fame as a writer for money of hardcover books about gunfights and the stoic heroes who won them and now he found himself at sixtyfive improbably successful in a small way and awkwardly pleased to be himself he had it all beautiful wife a couple of mil a nice house in a fabulous part of town a minor reputation enough to take some pleasure in a grand future a munificent multibook contract a really cool project ahead and a lot of guns the reason for the three vodka martinis was liberation not celebration his wife was absent ha ha ha too bad for her she was at some newsroom woman thing birthday party maybewhy did women take birthdays so seriously by the way and so hed wandered on his own to the nearby bistro had a burger with a bud and then v which weakened his resolve to resist v which shattered his resolve to resist v fortunately thered been no v or hed be asleep in the mens room now where was i before digression what place is this where am i now ha ha ha ha oh yes home is the hunter he was walking home the street slanted then rolled ahead it humped up then dipped down to permit a view of the valley it rocked it rolled it shook it rattled it coiled it doublebubbled boiled and troubled he laughed do you find yourself amusing his wife always asked and the truth was yes he did find himself amusing the mood like the geography chemically amplified by red potato crushed by kulak descendants was quite good that james aptapton had been recognized it happened rare but not without precedent for your minorleague nonquallit celeb mr aptapton halfway through v hed looked up to see an earnest young fellow possibly the assistant manager i just wanted to say ive read all your books my dad turned me on to them i really really love them well said aptapton say thanks so much the young man sat and gushed aptapton love for a bit and aptapton tried to give him a meaningful aptapton experience the transaction worked out well for both of them in fact and at the bottom of v a pause in the praise gave aptapton the time to gracefully excuse himself bid tom maybe jack possibly sam goodbye and make his exit so his mood was mellow and radiant hed cross light street here and only the narrow alley called churchill lay between himself and horizontality in bed his destination the russian watched from the stolen black camaro parked on light this looked to be the night hed been stalking for three days now in his patient professional way and part of his talent lay in understanding exactly when the arrangements favored him and when they did not thus a police scanner played out its truncated copspeak tencode and laconic locality identifiers and it suggested no police presence here in the immediate federal hill area thus it was late enough that the action in this nighttown district had played itself out and the streets though glistening with dew were largely empty and only periodic parties of drunken twentysomethings rolled this way and that thus finally the target had emerged functionally reduced by alcohol intake and selflove and bobbed his way along the street the russian saw a man in jeans and a tweed coat with a pair of writerlike glasses trotsky out of orwell by way of armani or some such you saw glasses like that in new york the man had a round pleased face bearded after hemingway and to disguise jowls narcissism blasting out of him more powerfully than any other human attribute expensive shoes nice shoes a wellturnedout fellow barring the unforeseen arrival of some whimsical force that favors thriller writers above all others in the world it was probably going to happen tonight the russian did not believe in whimsical forces he believed only in the power of a fast car to break the spine of a poor unsuspecting fool like this one a hundred times out of a hundred times he had seen it he had done it he had the nerve and the cool and the coldness of heart to do such damage without a lot of emotional involvement he was a professional and well paid the target for tonight joints loosened by the alcohol managed to get himself across light street without falling he navigated with that overcontrol typical of the drunk great forward movement momentum building but without the capacity of adaptation he arrived at where he tended not at where he aimed and at the last lurching moment he bumbled through a sideways correction a sort of exaggerated funnywalk bit all of this meant nothing to the russian who found nothing funny he noted distances angles and surfaces as a way of computing acceleration rates into speed on impact the russian prosaically jacked two wires together in the tornout key unit of the dashboard and the beast of a car stirred to life he was not showy or stylized so there was no gunning of the engine to allow the horses under the hood to roar and the exhaust pipes to bellow steamy toxins he eased into first nudged his way into the empty street and waited just a bit because he needed at least three seconds of acceleration time in the alley to get to fifty miles per hour which was the killing impact on either side there was nothing but baltimore at the mouth of churchill a church to one side and a typical baltimore row house meant for the miniature people of the s to the other aptapton reaimed himself and pressed onward down the concourse it was listed as a street in city records but had been constructed as an alley many years ago its tiny brick dwellings serving as servants quarters or backyard administrative units for the larger houses that faced outward to prouder wider streets for a hundred years this back way had probably been the province of pig and horse shit commingled with blood and negro or immigrant sweat where the invisible servers lived to sustain the opulent ease of those in the big houses then it became the inevitable slum but that condition never quite went terminal as the dwellings were too cute for demolition now of course gentrification had come in the form of museumquaint cobblestones which gleamed moistly as if at an art directors bidding little mockgaslight streetlamps lots of gardening and painting and each tiny building essentially remanufactured from the inside out so that they had become nesting sites for the young urban hip aptapton that aptapton began to amuse himself by inventing sexual perversions he imagined were ongoing on either side of churchill then he heard the sound of a car engine agh this meant hed have to readjust his somewhat sloppily functioning internal gyro and get himself off the cobblestones and onto the little shelf of sidewalk he heard basso profundo deepchest utters and turned he made out the streamlined form of the camaro one hundred feet away and felt himself seized in its illumination a friendly type always he raised a hand and smiled and indicated that he yielded to superior power and would manfully attempt to arrive upon the threshold of the curb at the same time the whole thing reminded him of something and it froze him in place as his mind examined its files finally it came to him an image from one of his own books didnt he do one where the bad guy some kind of car genius used camaros and chargers and transams to take people out hed thought he ought to get away from guns for a bit and so hed moved on to the highpro muscle car as weapon of choice nobody seemed to like it very much however hed also tried swords in one to much chagrin he was a gun guy so he did best when he stuck to his guns anyway this was setting up sort of like a scene in thunders evening as the one had been called and he had to laugh are you amused by yourself at the thing at the end of the alley hazy in the glare of its headlights but sleek and black and damp the odd refraction of street and houselights playing magically off its shiny skin film noir to the very end its from my id he thought in the next second it accelerated it came at a speed hed never imagined possible as if it had gone into warp drive blurring the stars and well before this information could be processed he was airborne he was airborne there was no pain though the blow hed been delivered must have been a mighty thud again when he rejoined earth in a heap of breakage and ruin there was no pain he lay askew on the cobblestones thinking oh shes going to be so mad at me because he knew he was in big trouble with his wife chapter idaho in cascade everybody goes to ricks even swagger he showed up every once in a while maybe three four times a month preceded by myth isolated by reputation and cloaked in diffidence he sat alone if he came at the counter and had a couple of cups of coffee black jeans old boots some kind of jacket and a faded red razorbacks ball cap he could have been a drifter or a trucker or a rancher or a gunfighter the body was rangy without fat slightly tense also radiating signals of damage he always arrived if he was to arrive at all at am with the ranchers it was said he had trouble sleepingsaid that is by swagger watchers since the man himself spoke hardly a wordand if he was still awake when the sun cracked the edge of the world hed drive from his place out on to ricks not so much to join in the community but to reassure himself that community was there that was pretty much ricks purpose in the general scheme of things the food wasnt muchit was primarily a breakfast place whose shortorder cook knew every way to wreck an egg and had the gift for the right fusion of crunch grease and chew to panfried potatoesand the early riserswho drove the cascade economy paid the taxes hired the mexicans guided hunters for a week or so in the fall and plowed the roadsalways stopped there to fuel up for whatever the long day of honest labor held in store swagger though no gladhander seemed to like the company to enjoy the ranch badinage and the talk of boise state football and the weather complaints because he knew no fool would come up to him with questions or requests or offers and that these sinewy gentlemen themselves joshers but not speech givers always played by the rules as for them they knew only what theyd heard though they werent sure where they heard it war hero retired marine lots of deepgrass stuff in a war that we lost supposedly the best shot in the west or at any rate a hell of a shot gun guy got a lot of stuff from midway usa and brownells a latearriving daughter japanese by birth who was the twelveandunder girls roping champ and seemed born to horseback beautiful wife kept to self running the barns the family owned in three or was it four states business success knew of the big world and chose to live in this one out of a movie someone said and someone else said except they dont make them kinds of movies no more and everybody laughed and agreed that was the easy truce that reigned at ricks and even rick and his two gals shelly and sam seemed okay with it that is until the chinese woman showed up well possibly she wasnt chinese she was asian of an indefinite age somewhere between young and not young with a strong nose and dark smart eyes that could pierce steel if she so desired though she seldom showed it she had a smile that could break hearts and change minds she was short rather busty and looked pretty damned tough for someone who was probably soft in all the right places she showed at took a seat at the counter ordered coffee and read something on her kindle for two hours at she left nice tipper pleasant distant not an outreacher but at the same time completely unfazed by the masculine brio of the am ranch crowd at ricks she came every day for two weeks never missing never reaching out maintaining her silence and her secrecy it didnt take the fellows long to figure out that none of them was of interest to a crafty contained beauty so she had to be there for swagger she was stalking him a reporter a book writer a hollywood agent somebody who saw a way to make some bucks from whatever secrets swaggers war mask of a face concealed without murmur or tremor yet when he came in she made no move toward him nor hehe noticed her instantly as he noticed everything instantlytoward her they sat with an empty stool between them at the counter each drinking black coffee while she read and he ruminated or remembered or whatever it was he did when he came in this ritual continued for another week or two and it consumed the cascade gossip circuits such as they were finally almost as if to satisfy the town gabbers instead of any genuine impulse of his own he walked over to her maam yes she said looking up in the light he saw that she was quite beautiful maam it seems the fellows here believe youre in town to have a chat with a man named swagger im swagger hello mr swagger i wanted to spare you any more trouble because i imagine youve got better places than ricks in cascade idaho to spend your time i have essentially retired from the world and if youre here to see me i have to disappoint you i dont see anyone my wife my daughters and my son thats about it i just sit on a rocking chair and watch the sun move across the sky i dont do a thing no more my wife does the work so whatever it is you want im sparing you the time by telling you its probably not going to happen and this is more than ive said in a year so i better stop while im ahead thats fine mr swagger she said time isnt the issue ill stay years if i have to im in this for the long haul he didnt know what to say in response he just knew he had no need whatsoever to go back to what he called in the argot of that war so many years ago the world each time he went it seemed to cost him the last time it had cost him a woman hed allowed himself to care about and he did not relish a revisit to that grief at least during waking hours he had enough to worry about with two daughters and a son and at sixtysix with a steel ball for a hip enough scar tissue across his raggedy old body to show up on satellites and so many memories of men dying he needed no more adventures no more losses no more grief he was afraid of them then she said i know about you and what you did in the war it seems to be a profession that prizes patience you sit you wait you wait you wait you wait isnt that right waiting is a part of it yes maam well i can do nothing to impress you i cant shoot ride climb or fight no book ive read would amaze you no accomplishment ive achieved would register on your radar screen but i will show you patience i will wait you out this week the next this month the next on and on i will wait you out mr swagger i will impress you with my patience it was a terrific answer one hed never counted on he let no emotion cross the iron age shield that was his face possibly he blinked those lizard eyes or ran tongue over dried lips as he was a dry old coot wary and contained who made noise when he moved because one adventure or another had left him with a limp and even if the wind and the sun had turned his face the color of navajo pottery his eyes had somehow bled themselves of color and were reptilian irises untainted by empathy yes maam he said so well wait each other out it took over three weeks each time he showed he thought shed be gone but there she was tucked away in the corner not looking up her face illuminated by the glow of the reading machine or whatever it was he skipped for ten days straight and assumed that would surely drive her away it did not finally halfway into the fourth week she went to her rented car in the general cloud of pickups pulling out for the days first duty station and found his truck a black ford f next to hers he lounged against its fender ropy and lean in his baseball cap a highplains drifter a shane a truck driver off the interstate all right he said if you were in this for money youd be long gone if youre crazy the jabbering of those old men in this joint would have sent you off to the nut bin what im getting is some kind of stubborn in you that usually equals high purpose you win ill give you what you want as much as i can and stay my own man its not much she said no no money no contracts no angles im not from a big flashy city just a bluecollar rust bucket called baltimore i want your judgment thats all you know things i dont i want to put something before you and then i want you to tell me if its anything or if its craziness coincidence whatever thats all except i forgot the best part its very dull and boring all right he said you have earned the right to bore me i can be bored its not a problem can you meet me at the tgifs off the interstate in iron springs tomorrow at two its a craphole but its crowded and loud and nobodyll notice a thing well drink coffee and talk i chose that place because i dont want the old goats in this place all giddy over seeing us fair enough mr swagger ill see you there she was punctual and found him sitting in a booth in the rear of the gaudy place whose cheesy cheerfulness seemed in counterpoint to his grave countenance and all the hollows and planes of his tight old face with its deltas of fissure extending from each eye like the broken cataracts of an ancient river of kings or maybe sans the warrior romance he was just a beattohell old guy meanwhile the kind of citizen who defines the interstate as freedom and paradise swirled and bobbed through the busy place raising clamor eating ice cream yelling at children and exhibiting all the discontents of motorized civilization that one can manage maam say i dont even have a name for you she sat across from him my name is jean marquez im filipino by heritage born and raised here i am a journalist by profession though this is not about a story and im not working for my newspaper im the daughter of two doctors fiftyfive years old and a widow im sorry to hear of your loss ms marquez ive lost some very close people and understand the hurting i thought you might anyhow you should call me jean everybody does my husband was named james aptapton does that name mean anything hmm he said and somehow yes it did his mind and face fogged in search and finally he said im coming up with some kind of writer wrote about snipers knew guns is that right dont believe i ever met the fellow or read his books but id run into the name here and there id get asked now that i remember if i was some hero he wrote about billy don trueheart something like that something like that yes jim was a gun guy he was one of those men who loved guns and if you lived with him for twenty years as i did you got used to guns everywhere he eventually got wealthy enough to spend seventeen thousand dollars on a thompson machine gun if you want to rent a thompson machine gun let me know i can let you have one at an affordable daily rate ill bear that in mind but i hope my thompson days are long over anyhow the guns everywhere the gun magazines the biographies of people like elmer keith and john m browning the dead animal heads all that that was who he was and i knew that going in and accepted it his politics never but the gun thing it was okay because he was also funny about it as he was funny about everything he was also kind and even when he became successful he never turned into an asshole and stayed true and decent to his kids and my family and his mother and the people he knew it was never about getting to the table where the cool kids sat it was about buying guns drinking vodka and making people laugh everyone who knew him is missing him and will for a long time is this about his death yes the idiot went to a bar one night and had three instead of the allowed one martini he walked home reflexes all messed up and managed to get himself killed by a hitandrun driver it was merciful they say he went fast im sorry did they catch the driver no thats part of the issue it seems that over two thousand people a year are killed by hitandruns and about ninetyeight percent of those cases are solved there are those that arent and it is remotely possible that he was murdered i know i know it was probably some kid high on meth in a hoppedup car who saw an old guy staggering down the street and stomped on the pedal for kicks for laughs for the warm and fuzzy memories i dont know but maybe not i have had experience with a man who killed by car its more than possible driven by a professional it can be a lethal instrument i suppose youre going to tell me why this could be a murder i am we are at the boring part maybe youd better pour yourself a cup of coffee i like your husband i like you its fine go on try to bore me as i say its a story in which almost nothing happens it has no vivid characters no sudden turns of fate no dramatic reversals no humor no drama its about something that happened in a workplace a long time ago so far so good it cant be verified its hazy in parts it might be a hoax though its so dreary i cant imagine how anyone could gain anything off it i dont have the exact dates it was first told in a letter then years later in another letter then years after that in a third letter ive read none of the letters and the passage of time between each installment suggests the erosion of failing memory on top of that my only experience with it was as told to me by my husband and i must confess i didnt pay much attention so my own memory is questionable as well all in all as evidence of a crime its a pretty pathetic deal it must linger it does indeed linger people cant quite put it aside they think they have and go about their lives and then it comes back in the middle of the night and pokes them awake it did that to the three letter writers and to my late husband it did it to me enough times that i found out about a mr bob lee swagger and tracked him to a flyspeck diner in a dying widespot in the road called cascade idaho and invested close to two months in earning an audience with him the lingering part is very interesting so far youve got me hooked we start with a young man a recent graduate of an engineering school in dallas texas the time is unknown but im guessing midseventies hes smart ambitious hardworking decent he wants to join a construction firm and engineer giant buildings the first job he gets is entrylevel for an elevator contractor elevators right not exactly the glamour trade but elevators which we all take for granted are heavily engineered that is they are overdesigned overmaintained overregulated and no one involved with them takes them for granted his firm installs them and maintains them on contract so they can pass their yearly examinations and dont drop ten people fifty stories sounds reasonable its hard crummy work the shafts and engine rooms as they call the motor and pulley devices that make them run are dark poorly ventilated and not airconditioned even more so back then the space is cramped and it involves a lot of twisting and bending to get access the work is intensive and highly pressurized because the building managers hate it when they have to shut down the elevators and the tenants hate it and everybody hates it are you getting a picture i am this young man and his crew are in the engine room on the roof of a particular building and theyve set up lights and theyre measuring cable wear gear wear electrical motor wear lubricating trying to work fast so they can get the box as they call it back in service its hot crowded and except for the light beams dark not pleasant not happy and suddenlykaboom kaboom one of the workers maybe resting maybe backing away to make room for someone else maybe doing whatever you do in an elevator engine room bumps into something on the wall and theres a loud crash and the sound of stuff falling to the ground a big cloud of acrid dust everybodys coughing and wheezing all the flashlights go onto it and they discover that hes bumped into a shelf on the wall and for whatever reasonthe screws rusted or came out the brick or stucco or whatever gave way the metal itself shearedwhen he jostled it it collapsed dumping its pile of whatever was stored there to the ground thats the action scene by the way the shelf falling thats as exciting as it gets my hearts beating so fast i can hardly stand it heres the really boring part they figure out whats wrong with the shelf and somehow get it remounted and start restacking the stuff on it the stuff is carpet remnants that is the lobby of the building has a big carpet and they ended up with remnants that they had to keep around for patching or whatever so they had a shelf in the engine room and someone decided that would be a good outoftheway place to store the remnants sounds pretty topsecret to me and someone says hey look at this be cool if it was a rifle huh or a box of ammo a telescopic sight a spy radio something really james bond that would be very interesting sorry its just a coat i told you it was a boring story it aint without interest please go on it turns out to be a mans overcoat xl tan gabardine fairly highquality in extremely good condition maybe almost new it had been methodically folded and slid into the pile of carpet remnants in the engine room sometime in the past again no dates no specifics nothing ive got it said swagger they unfold it and immediately make a discovery it stinks unfolding it puts out some kind of chemical stench very unpleasant flashlights go onto it it seems that the left breast wears a rather gaudy petro or chemical stain and even now who knows how many years later the odor of that stain is powerful it hasnt gone away instead of finding a free coat theyve found a fixerupper which would involve dry cleaning which might or might not get the stain and the smell out and no one is interested and so it goes into the trash it is thrown out it disappears it is gone forever end of story not much of a story is it no but i give you its got some moments bob said somewhere in his ratpointed tactical brain he was beginning to play with them something had been subtly provoked dallas abandoned overcoat strange smell and stain okay she said the engineer is promoted and he leaves the firm and goes to that big construction outfit again he is promoted because hes very intelligent and hardworking hes the type that built america he becomes a partner he marries his high school girlfriend they have three beautiful daughters and move to the suburb where partners live he joins a country club he becomes venerable his daughters marry wonderful men im actually making up the details but you get the picture one of the daughters becomes engaged to the son of a rancher another prosperous fellow the rancher and his wife invite the engineer and the wife out for a gettoknowyou weekend and barbecue theyre sitting there in the big paneled living room looking out the picture window to the swimming pool and the white horse fences and the green meadows and the engineer notices something dead animals all over the place turns out the rancher is a hunter hes been all over the world lions and tigers and bears ibexes and sables and kudus theyre all drinking highballs and having a good old time and the rancher says say don care to see the shop don nods and off they go they walk into a big gun place guns heads safes benches targets photos of men with dead animals maybe an old marilyn calendar tools all that the sort of thing my husband had although im guessing this rancher kept his a lot neater than my husband did and whammo the engineer is hit by an odor its an old old odor i dont know if you know it but psychologists consider olfactory cues the strongest reminders a smell can take you back to a time and place and recreate cues to all the other senses so suddenly youre back where you were when you first hit that smell and of course don is back in the engine room of the elevator in that building in dallas thirtyodd years ago gi or hoppes bob asked hoppes she said yes barrel solvent chemical cleaning fluid especially for guns been around since the twenties thats what don smells in his new pals shop and he realizes thats what he smelled all those years ago in the building that i of course didnt name youre going to tell me it was the texas book depository if only no its the building across houston street from the texas book depository its called the daltex building it was there in too daltex doesnt mean dallas texas but dallas textiles as it was the headquarters of the dallas wholesale garment industry actually abraham zapruders office was there along with a hundred other offices nothing particularly special except that it did offer close to the same angle and elevation down elm street next to dealey plaza that our friend lee harvey oswald used you can see why it lingers i can said bob trying to conjure the structure from a rush of image memories of dealey plaza that triangle of grass at the heart of american darkness he got nothing no vision no sense of place its figured in a few of the thousand conspiracy theories i checked into them none of them are that interesting or convincing someone claims that a photo shows a rifle on a tripod on the fireplace but its just shadows there were some arrests after the building was closed down a few minutes after the shooting but nothing came of them some people claim without evidence that it was one of the nine or is it twelve shooting sites that the cia sears roebuck the canadian air force and proctor and gamble used in their conspiracy all in all its not much bob nodded but it lingers she continued for the engineer particularly he cant get it out of his mind you see why dont you the hoppes suggests that someone had need to clean a rifle which suggests the presence of a rifle and you can assume the juice was somehow spilled or leaked onto the coat during the cleaning process but the coat was carefully hidden as if whoever had spilled the hoppes with its chemical smell didnt want it exposed to the public eye or nose lots of folks in texas would recognize it right away including most policemen it was the universal gun cleaner then all this could have happened on or around november theres your lingering it puts a rifle where there aint been one but it is thin its real thin it gets thinner a few more years pass the engineer doesnt know what to do about it hes no dummy he gets how thin it is too way too thin to take to law enforcement then he reads a book the book is called shootout on pennsylvania it was written by my husband and a friend its the story of an assassination attempt on harry truman in that ended up in a gunfight in the middle of the street in the middle of the day in the middle of downtown washington right across from the white house two men dead three wounded almost totally forgotten anyhow the engineer reads the book he reads in particular about a secret service agent named floyd barring who was in command of the watch at blair house where the fight happened and was considered the hero he shot one of the bad guys in the head and took him down and maybe saved harry trumans life the engineer finds from the book that floyd is still alive and that thirteen years after being a hero in washington he was the agent in charge of the secret service advance party for the dallas trip and was in dallas for the assassination and testified before the warren commission and all that the engineer takes a shine to floyd who seems upright decent hardworking committed since floyd is retired yet invested in the assassination he seems like a candidate to hear the engineers tale so heres the first letter the engineer writes to floyd and details everything i have laid out to you you never read the letter however not even close im telling you more or less what i later heard from jim when i wasnt listening hard swagger nodded seeing the old agent getting the thick packet from an unknown person in dallas and slowly considering its contents what did this secret service guy do for whatever reason nothing in fact he probably threw it out crazy kennedy bullshit you know the drill he was sick of it as hed figured in some theories too and he didnt like it he was also in ill health living in a geriatric apartment in silver spring mourning the death of his wife and knew he didnt have much time i see yet it lingered he couldnt put it out of his mind a few years after that he writes a letterhalf a letterto my husband he never finishes it he never sends it maybe he thinks better of it who knows anyway he dies and that would seem to be that no more lingering the lingering is over but then his daughter finds the letter a few years later so she sends it on to jim so years after the coat was found years after the identity of the smell was discovered years after it was communicated to a retired secret service agent years after he died courtesy of his daughter it was sent to my husband and he sees the possibilities more than most hes looking for a project he has a contract that calls for a book a year hes just finished one but theres no rest for the wicked and when he gets the halfwritten letter that floyd almost sent him concerning the lost letter the engineer sent to floyd he sees something he spends a few days researching looking at maps reading books or at least examining them and then he has some kind of eureka moment he claims hes solved the jfk assassination i suspect vodka played a part it turns out he means he has an idea no one else has had and he has to go to dallas and so he goes to dallas was he successful he talked to a bunch of people i think he got into daltex he came back very excited he started working like a madman one day a week later he goes off to a bar for a drink and ends up with a broken back and pelvis in an alley you think he was killed because he was looking into a certain idea about jfks death i havent said that ive spoken only in facts and the fact is that now im the worlds sole possessor of the story and it lingers i cant get it out of my head and the connection between it and jims immediate death by possible homicide wont let me sleep at night i have to do every last thing to make sure that the story is properly processed someone has to deal with it judge it assess it contextualize it someone who knows this stuff and has worked in this world i have nominated you for that high honor so now i ask the question i came all this way for is it anything he let out a large breath what does that signify she asked you think im an idiot the whole thing is nonsense what a colossal waste of time no i can see how it provokes i aint denying that and im not saying im a hundred percent warren commission lonegunman guy i havent looked at it hard enough but i do think like you that a lot of the theories are stuff people dreamed up to make a buck i also think that the thing has been looked at so much by so many people for so long that its highly unlikely theres anything left unfound fair enough let me put it before you in a different way all right i think youre missing something and i think your husband missed it and floyd missed it all the way back to the engineer that thing you all missed is texas texas is gun country you may have to explain why you have a gun in baltimore but you sure dont in texas everyone has a gun in texas they have em to wear to barbecues or the opera or the swim meet nobody blinks an eye and that was especially true down there then before jfk nobody thought a thing about a gun it just was thats all the presence of a gun in that building isnt remarkable in fact its nothing i can think of a hundred reasons for a gun in that building other than killing a president maybe some boys were heading out for deer season straight from work save time get there openingday morning they brought their rifles in and one of them knew his needed cleaning so he does the job nobody says a thing because it aint remarkable he leans the gun in a corner and it rubs up against somebodys coat when that guy gets his coat he sees its ruined it goes into the wastebasket and later that night the janitor finds it and decides to scavenge it he hangs it up to dry out but hoppes being powerful the stink never does go away so he stuffs it somewhere meaning to check it out later and forgets about it years later the elevator people discover it that could have happened not just for deer season but in pheasant season too as they kill a lot of them birds down there and doves and pigeons and anything that flies so you have found the suggestion of a gun in a building in texas and it surprises you only because you dont know guns or texas i see she said maamjean if i mayyouve got what the marine corps would call intelligence that doesnt rise to the actionable level it doesnt carry enough meaning to be acted on there are too many other possibilities here for anyone to do anything about it my best advice is to congratulate yourself for following up on your duty to your husband and then go back to your life i think your husband would have found that out in time too maybe he could do something with his discovery if it were a fiction book but i dont see it as having any real meaning in the world and it sure didnt have anything to do with his death sorry to be so blunt but you didnt come all this way and invest all this time for sugarcoating no i didnt mr swagger i believe youve set me straight i hope i helped maam and im very sorry about your husband maybe by the time you get back they will have caught the boy maybe so let me walk you to your car and well get you out of this godforsaken place thank you they both rose as he peeled off a few bills for the waitress and headed out to her fusion i guess well never know she said as she got to her car who ran over the mystery man with a bicycle he was only half listening at this time trying to sneak a look at his watch to see what time it was and how soon he could get back because hed promised to help miko on her lowroping skills and im sorry he said what did you say oh the back of the coat it had a smear on it that appeared to represent a tread the engineer thought it could have been from an english bike you know thinwheeled it was an impression about an inch long where it looked like a tread mark had been printed thats all a minor point i forgot to do you have a list of the people your husband visited i have his notebook its hard to read but it does have some names and addresses there why what is i have to set some things up itll take me a week i want you to go home and find that notebook and fedex it to me if he had computer files on the dallas trip or notepapers get me that stuff too ill get down there as soon as im set up do you want to borrow the tommy gun no not yet youre not joking are you no maam do you want me to help defray the expenses i mean i seem to be wealthy now and i no maam said swagger this ones on me chapter a man sat on a park bench at the corner of houston and elm under a spread of aged oak trees before some kind of odd rectangular white cement ceremonial pool that appeared to be full of scope around him la vie touristique occurred a subspecies of human behavior mandating that small knots of oddly dressed people congregated here and there with cameras inadequate to the scale of the urban space called dealey which they commanded it was all very strange sometimes a particularly brave one would dash onto elm street to stand during a brief traffic interruptus at one of two xs that marked the spots on which a man had been shot to death meanwhile homeless men roamed some to beg some to sell for five bucks a rag called the conspiracy chronicles that promised the latest dish on directly across elm from the man stood a box of bricks seven stories tall undistinguished but famous called the texas book depository despite its banality it had one of the most recognizable facades in the world especially a corner of the sixth floor where the ambusher had lurked fifty years ago the sky was bold texas blue and a slight wind blew east to west across the territory which was surrounded by the churn of cars and trucks as they cascaded down houston and made the tricky turn to the left down elm for the access to the stemmons freeway just beyond the triple underpass people had things to do places to go and for most dallasites the tragedy of dealey plaza had long since faded swagger sat alone but in his mind it was he looked this way and that up and down around down streets at his shoes at his fingertips and he tried to remember it had been a day like this one cloudless after a threat of early rain the sky as blue as a movie stars eyes at least thats what the papers said he himself had been asleep at the time half a world away on an island called okinawa where as a seventeenyearold lance corporal hed just made the battalion rifle team and would spend the next three weeks cradling a ton of garand on a flat dry firing range trying to put holes in black circles six hundred yards or so off he didnt know a goddamn thing about anything and wouldnt for years but at pm back in dallas the presidents motorcade turned right off of main street and proceeded one block up houston at the northern boundary of the triangular open park that was dealey plaza now he saw it lincoln limo long black boat of a car two up front driver and agent two lower governor connally and his wife then the regal couple the blessed the charismatic john f kennedy in his suit and his wife jackie in pink both waving at the closeby crowds the car reached elm and cranked left it had to access the stemmons freeway which could only be entered from elm it was a degree turn not a degree turn so the driver a secret service agent named greer had to slow down considerably as he maneuvered the heavy vehicle around the corner speeding up he passed by some trees and continued on a slight downward angle along elm street immediately to his right was the sevenstory building known as the texas book depository the undistinguished pile of plain brickwork that now loomed over swagger he ran his eyes up its edge and halted them at the corner of the sixth floor and saw only a window on that day at pm as the car passed by the trees a sound that virtually everyone agreed was a gunshot was heard it appeared to have struck nobody directly but at least one witness a man named tague reported being stung by what can reasonably be assumed was a fragment as the bullet broke apart when it hit the curbstone behind the car or a branch in the trees bullets do this it is not strange or remarkable within six or so seconds a second bullet was fired and most people there assumed it came from the looming depository that bullet hit the president in the back near the neck tumbled through his body emerged from his throat nicking his tie and flew on to hit john connally horizontally it penetrated his body entirely too hit and broke his wrist and thudded into but did not penetrate his thigh it was found later that afternoon on a gurney at the hospital this was the magic bullet that many claimed could not have done what this one did the third bullet was the head shot a few seconds later how many would be legendarily unclear delivered at a distance of feet from the sixth floor of the texas book depository it hit the president high in the back of the head on a downward angle it appears to have disintegrated or detonated as the few traces of its existence are controversial at best it blew a large chunk of brain out of the skull exiting in a burst of vaporized material that jetted or exploded from the right side of the head chaos ensued the limousine raced off to the hospital with its cargo of two gravely wounded men and their women police moved perhaps not quickly enough to cordon off the building from which the shots seemed to have been fired in time after a roll was taken police learned that an employee named lee harvey oswald was missing though he had been seen there that day and was even confronted by a police officer in the lunchroom right after the shooting a description of oswald was broadcast and some miles away in dallass oak cliff section an officer named j d tippit spotted a man who matched that description tippit stopped and called him over he got out of his car and was shot four times by the suspect and died on the spot the suspect walked away but concerned citizens followed him others noted his odd behavior and knew that suspicions were flying around dallas about the kennedy assassin they noted that he sneaked into a movie theater and the police were called thus was lee harvey oswald arrested meanwhile at the book depository officers found a snipers nest of book cartons arranged at the site of the sixthfloor ne corner window three ejected mm mannlichercarcano casings and a hundred feet away at the site of the sole stairway off the floor a surplus mannlichercarcano model carbine with a cheap and poorly attached japanesemade scope the rifle had been cocked and carried a live cartridge in its chamber it soon proved that oswalds fingerprints were on the rifle and on the boxes in the snipers nest that he had carried a suspicious bag of curtain rods into the depository that morning that he had ordered under pseudonyms both the carcano rifle and the special s amp w revolver used in the tippit slaying moreover he was a notorious malcontent with revolutionary tendencies a selfproclaimed communist a former defector a mediocre marine accounting for his shooting skill a wife beater and an allaround creep he never stood trial because he was murdered by jack ruby on the morning of november as he was being led to an armored car for transfer to a more secure holding area those seemed to be the facts which after much haggling all had come to believe and accept swagger believed them and accepted themthat is until his chat with jean marquez her words touched one of his own memories not a public memory at all but a private longburied one he had been stalked once by a certain team of men in his long and turbulent past and the smudge she had reported on the back of a coat had a meaning for him that it would have for no other man on earth amazing that it had in some form and after all these years reached him i cant believe im here said someone and swagger was pulled from his time travels to see a friend younger better dressed a kind of dallas upandcoming executive type in a worsted hickey freeman suit approaching on a beeline to sit next to him we put the dumbest intern on the jfk squad the man said as he shook swaggers hand and dispensed with the howareyou bullshit he fields the ten or twenty calls we get each day from people whove solved the case and now know for sure the gypsies were involved with the vatican and japanese imperial intelligence nick memphis was now the special agent in charge of the dallas field office of the fbi in most instances it would have been a plum assignment but for him it was a last stop on the way out his career had topped out when a new director took over the bureau heard he was intimately involved with the tragic incident at a huge mall in minnesota and wanted him far from headquarters an assistant some acidblooded corpse named mr renfro had handled the delicate task of prying nick from his deputy directorship and reassigning him to fieldwork in an office that was big and produced more than its share of cases closed but didnt need radical shaking up or bold new leadership just a dozing caretaker to sign the requisitions approve the budget and make sure the squads were adequately staffed until he retired swagger didnt say a thing he knew hed shaken up his pal with a strange request a few days ago and that nick had to vent he let the younger man flail away unburden himself get it all out it was typical swagger laconic and detached and seemingly camouflaged even if he wore a suit an offtherack khaki rag that resembled a grocery bag on a scarecrow he had one leg cranked awkwardly over the knee of the other showing a beattohell nocona and looked younger sitting than walking because when he walked the vibrations of several competing wounddeficient parts of him turned his progress into a slow and uncertain shuffle you winced for the pain that hip had to cause him and wondered why the old coot was too stubborn to take painkillers at least he wasnt wearing that goddamn faded razorbacks cap i cant believe i wasted a justice department witness protection identity on you nick fumed who do you think you are mark lane its over oswald did it nobody else thats what all the sensible research shows thats what the latest computer recreations show thats what all the house panels concluded only fruitcakes and vegetarians believe in a conspiracy man if it gets out that i bought in to this kind of scheme renfro will have my ass on a clothesline by wednesday i appreciate your kindness swagger finally said and no i aint gone insane i think my mind is working normally slow as usual but normal nick made a sound that expressed frustration man he said i should never try to outguess you jfk never in a million years would i guess youd tumble into that slime pit if it helps and you have to justify itthe secret identity didnt require formal computer paperwork and headquarters approval which could be penetrated by hackers only the okay of the senior bureau field officer that is nick himselfyou can tell them you took a flier on a murder investigation fellow came to dallas your neck of the woods went home to baltimore and got himself killed under circumstances that look very much like a professional hit murder isnt in our jurisdiction nick said grumpily thats a local issue true but the wheelman traveled from somewhere to baltimore to do the job maybe from dallas we know that because there cant be but two or three professional car killers in the world at any one time and they aint known to hang out in baltimore you dont even know it was a pro it could have been a kid on meth i saw the baltimore report there was a witness a girl walking a dog she was observant he accelerated clean through the hit and kept on a line afterward without a waver or a wobble then took a hard left at speed and was out of the neighborhood in about three seconds flat without one squeal of brakes one skid mark one spinout or dent thats professional driving even if nobody in baltimore figured it out if he went from anywhere to baltimore hes your baby and when youre done with him on interstate violations crossing state lines to commit a crime five to eight you hand him to the baltimore prosecutor and he goes down for the long one and rots out in their pen it was hardly enough nick knew murders were a dime a dozen he tried to spin it enough to make friends with it he came up with contract killings were rare and a good bust on some flashy mechanic from the dark side might be a good career feather even if mr renfro had knocked the cap off his head nice to go out taking down some pro kill jockey with a flashy resume maybe if the guy was hardcore enough and the evidence was strong enoughswagger was good at digging up evidencethey might get an hrt team to go in hard and cap his ass and save everybody the hassle of a trial the press loved it when hrt whacked genuine bad guys it was so commandochic if you have any interaction with local or fed le dont you mention the jfk angle not a word its straight interstate to commit a crime i didnt want a local player so i got an undercover whod worked with the bureau before and that i knew and trusted thats the game who are you this time by the way i seem to be one john jack brophy a retired mining engineer from boise i did some counterchecking against myself and those boys did this one real good you dont find good work like that just anywhere these days the program was designed to keep mafia snitches alive long enough to testify then incentivize the possibility of a new life away from the mob although they usually revert putting one together is expensive and timeconsuming work and it requires a big payoff to make it worth the time and effort thats why i hate to waste it on somebody who isnt named vito well if it makes you happy call me vito give me your plan vito i have the victims notebook it aint much because his handwriting is so awful that i cant read most of it its got his schedule and his appointments i know exactly where he went and who he talked to and the issues he raised ill follow that same path maybe someone will try to smoke me then well know we have something jesus thats it you sixtysix years old with a hip that hasnt worked in ten years are going to play the tethered goat what on earth makes you think you can match it up with a pro forty years younger and walk away if it comes to guns ill put ninetynine out of a hundred in a hole in the ground to this day are you packing not yet if i pick up cues that im in someones crosshairs i have a super and three mags of straight hardball stashed in my room at the adolphus i figure if im shooting im shooting through windshield glass or door panels so i need speed and strength not expansion that stuff ricochets like crazy i know ill be careful all right this is how it has to work you call the number i give you every morning and report your sked and plans for that day if i can ill put a backup team on you to make certain no one else is on your tail if someone is ill call you on the cell im going to give you and well set up our own ambush i dont have to tell you this as a friend but as the federal officer whos running you i am obligated to do so no cowboy shit shoot only when shot at or your life is in danger i would so much prefer if there was no shooting not because i think youll miss but because one of them might and with my luck hell hit the orphaned violin prodigy on his way to accept the nobel peace prize you keep me informed brother brophy or ill have to pull you in i always play by the rules no you never play by the rules and my career has benefited from it to no end if you say this ultimately might have to do with something we nearly unraveled twenty years ago but which slipped through our hands thats fine ill buy in to that cautiously like the pensionscared bureaucrat ive become but i remember everything i got since then i got because of that wild ride we went on out of new orleans that made me a bureau star back in and i dont forget you saved my life on that ride i will always owe you and i will stand by you on this last wild ride even if it goes straight into craziness just be careful thanks nick stick with me and well get you back to washington yeah said nick maybe in a casket or a pair of handcuffs so whats the first stop up there bob said suggesting by shoulder twitch the sixthfloor corner window the snipers nest he paid his and received some kind of tape recorder to wear around his neck the instructions were to push a certain button when the elevator dumped him off at floor six and thereby launch the recorded narrative that would guide him across the floor at a certain pace and direction he saw that the point of the tape recorder wasnt to inform people most of whom if they selfselected themselves for the trip knew where they were going and what they would see but to isolate them to keep them moving at a steady pace and to cut down on the chatter as if it were a reliquary and it was holding not the bones of a saint but the bones of the past now the empty boxfilled space of nothingness that had been the sixth floor fifty years ago had been turned into a generic jfk museum a polite narrative of the themes of that day expressed neutrally without outrage or snark in the old journalism tradition of the five ws swagger knew the five ws of this one already and didnt need a refresher so he left the tape recorder silent and slid through the thin crowd of tourists who clustered in smallish groups at each of the signboards and photo displays that followed the strands it all led to one spot swagger looked at it the good fathers of dallas had decided to cut down on the vicarious teenage thrill of being lee harvey and lining up the head shot from exactly his place and posture they had erected a cubicle of plexiglas to seal off the corner but also as if to preserve it in amber a frozen ghost of a lost bad time swagger stared at the array of scott foresman boxes arranged just as the screwball from new orleans had done building a childish little fort that would block him from the view of anyone else on the sixth floor and also give him a solid supported position for the shot the guy had been a marine after all the importance of the sound position had been drilled into him and on his day of days he had not forgotten it swagger looked unsure what he was supposed to feel too many people were drifting by or resting on benches for it to have any ceremonial dignity it was just a crummy corner of a crummy building looking through a crummy window he went to the windownot oswalds which was unreachable behind the plexiglas but the next one over and saw how close the two crosses in the street were the longest was feet away if he remembered correctly the head shot under a hundred yards the range wasnt as important as the angle he was here for the angles this one was an outgoer about three or four degrees to the left diminishing slightly as the distance increased moving laterally right to left but just as slowly with any modern hunting rig and a hundred bucks worth of walmart optics from lowend chinese glassworks like bsa or tasco it would be an easy enough shot given the angle and the speed it was hardly a mover at all given the stability offered by the carefully arranged boxes it was like shooting bullseye at the bench there were other things that leaped out at him the first was that when the big limo had pivoted around that degree turn it must have been almost still or at least moving so slowly that the movement would have no play in the shooting moreover it was so close it was seventyfive feet away almost straight down and jfks chest and head were in total exposure and the windshield between the passenger compartment and the drivers compartment was overcome by the vertical angle of the downward trajectory that was the shot he tried to figure out why lee harvey hadnt taken it maybe he would have had to lean out too far maybe if hed had a better shot they also wouldve had a better shot and even a good pistol guy with a fourinch smith or a colt acp as both feds and dallas cops carried in those days could draw fire and hit in a seconds worth of move maybe harvey would be the one with the brain shot from some secret servicers smith four hed be the one with cerebellum shredded and blown raggedly everywhere or maybe hed fogged the scope maybe hed had a qualm a regret a bolt of fear and lost his killers determination a brief crisis of confidence all of those could explain it but which one did swagger looked to the right lee harvey doesnt take that shot instead he lets the car crank around the corner and disappear behind the line of oak trees at the side of the road and shoots through them duh how stupid is that why would he do something so stupid was he an idiot in the grip of panic a hopeless loser and of course he missed swagger then looked at the first x on elm street which would have been lee harveys second shot fired after the miss that was probably his best opportunity after passing on the turner below him and after recovering too quickly and missing the first shot but hed blown that one too at least in the sense of missing the head shot and landing a few inches low in the back under the neck yes he was coming off a swift bolt throw but the target was under two hundred feet away and from the target angle always the angles it did not present an image moving harshly or radically by his standards he missed and given the presidents lack of visible reaction oswald might have counted it as a clean miss youd think still if he were going to hit a head shot that was the one he would have hit not the third even farther out the target even smaller coming off another fast bolt throw it was the third hed hit and he had hit it no doubt no regret no pain no nothing no force on earth could change the fact that a mm bullet had hit jack kennedy in the head at pm november and shocked the world with the visceral reality of the shattered skull the vaporized brain tissue the animal vibration of catastrophic trauma could oswald have made that shot bob considered the question wasnt abstract he might have had the skill but that skill had to be expressed through the system he used and it had to be forced through the prism of the actual he was a punk nobody shooting at the president of the united states in a hurry working a bolt that had to be at some level unfamiliar to himhed trained on the old semiauto m garand as had bobso the adrenaline must have been coursing through his veins like lighter fluid all the buckfever things must have been happening eyes wide to f auditory exclusion loss of fine motor control vision impingement the sensation of oxygen debt yet he made the shot it was an easy shot bob probably could have made it offhand as any of the dozens of snipers hed known could have so what the issue was could this little monkey from all our dark furious dreams with his hatred and bitterness and political crackpottiness his incompetence and long history of failure could he have made that shot on that day at that time it was stupid to ask even if thousands had done so publicly thats because to answer you had to be familiar with the capacities of the rifle at its maximum and at its minimum he turned and as if by magic there it was a fullsize silhouette of c the mannlichercarcano model carbine made in terni italy in and scoped by an anonymous mechanicgunsmith was far too grand a wordwith a cheesy x tube out of a japan that hadnt yet discovered its postwar optical engineering genius and was attached to the receiver by a machined piece of pot metal in the form of a scope mount all of it held together by two screws when there should have been four the image floated at bob off a signboard a few feet away he walked over and confronted the thing as reproduced in the fullsize photo the fbi forensic ballisticians had done a number on the weapon as soon as they received it but bob had looked through the testimony and found it somewhat spotty frazier the agent was revered in the bureau as a gun expert but bob noted that he was a highpower shooter by choice and a champion at that which meant he specialized in the discipline of shooting large stable targets at long range out to six hundred yards with service rifles through open sights his skill set would have included stamina sophisticated wind doping trigger control and longterm nervous system control by experience he was not particularly knowledgeable about or comfortable with the telescopic sight or precision shooting the one shotone kill mantra of the sniper would have been lost on him though his testimony in certain areas seemed problematic swagger knew hed have to look more carefully at it on another day here in d glory the rifle looked like something an eightyearold tin soldier in a red papiermache tunic might carry in a junior high version of the nutcracker hed been dragged to a production when nikki was in her ballet phase and remembered the stifflegged little boys with the red circles painted on their cheeks under the tall cardboard fauxhussar hats that was how miniaturized and quaint it seemed it was small hardly a weapon of war like many of the rifles of the mediterranean it seemed somehow to lack seriousness of purpose it wasnt a heavily machined vault that could shoot a bullet a mile with accuracy or provide a platform to drive a bayonet into a mans guts like a mauser a springfield a leeenfield you might use it to pot rabbits as it was of light caliber roughly in an age before highvelocity powders not a with its tons of muzzle energy the ballistics were unimpressive he looked at the stamped potmetal scope mount well resolved in the photo blowup and noted that it boasted enough detail to depict the two empty screw holes on the plate that held rifle to scope what influence would that have had on events how long would the two screws hold the scope tight if theyd been tightened at all through one shot or two or most important three what would the consequences be of a loose scope which would reset itself whimsically after each shot screwing up accuracy all good shooters tightened their scope screws before they fired had oswald would he have known that he wasnt trained on scopes in the corps just the knurlindex click system of the m peep sight a brilliant mechanical device in its day did oswald understand the concept of zeroing a scope was this scope zeroed was it altered after recovery all these questions would have to be answered in re this particular rifle not any other before one could issue a comment on its capabilities if that was the thing that did it hed have to know more about it he resolved to acquire and study such a piecethey were available dirt cheap usually under three hundred or so could he learn the bolt throw could he find a target fast through that little fourpower not particularly clean scope could the rifle sustain its accuracy over a string of shots could that improvised sling improve the accuracy if indeed oswald who knew of slings from the marine corps applied it during his shooting all yet to be discovered swagger tired of the place no big deal no emotional reaction to the foreign visitors the running kids the goofball ohio tourists it was just enough and was time to go now the grassy knoll it was a kind of absurd conceit a mock greek temple etched into a grass hillside along a busy commercial road in the heart of the city someones longago idea of class when the greek model was beloved and appreciated in america but it looked like something out of an ancient rome movie and you half expected to see people lounging around in togas swagger stood to the side of the circle of columns at the height of the crest and tried not to think of togas he considered the angles below him maybe fifty feet cars rushed down elm toward the triple underpass the slope of grass ran down to the curbside the road itself fed the commuters onto the stemmons freeway and beyond that stretched the field also pooltable green of dealey plaza here the shooting was so close some kind of professional hardcore hit team without access to the tbd which loomed to the left through some thin trees almost certainly would have chosen this spot they could yank subgunsgrease guns thompsons schmeissers all the common war bringbacks plentiful in the america of and lay down a fusillade that no man could survive then they could race off and try to gunfight their way to freedom but theyd fail enough police would arrive eventually and theyd die of extreme ventilation of the twelvegauge variety at some roadblock a few miles away but one shooter knowing he had to hit coldbore on his first shot to syncopate with the patsy oswalds sure misses he couldnt make any sense of it i came here for answers swagger thought all i am getting is more questions still like all the other rubes he moseyed down the hill and stood at the curb not seven feet from the x that marked the position of the car when the third bullet hit head hed seen it enough to view it with dispassion but unbidden a sound cue came to him he had been near men hit in the head and he knew that it was a sound like no other on the planet he didnt want to but from some forgotten atrocity in his long and violent past that noise abruptly reproduced itself it sounded like a baseball bat hitting a grapefruit as it held both the thud of power and the squirt of liquefaction vapor was left in the air a cloud of atomized brain particles thick enough to register on zapruders film before it dissipated in the rush of the car accelerating away swagger shook his head he hadnt expected that moment of horror he tried to clear his brain he turned looked up elm to the cube of the depository with its front of mismatched windows arc and square and arc and square now lacking the gaudy hertz sign that had commanded the heights in and he saw lee harveys window feet away and feet off the ground but he saw another thing he waited until a traffic light at the corner halted the stream so he was able to walk the seven feet to the x and turn and look back the other thing he saw was a building it was also a brick box and it was just across houston from the depository from this angle its seventhstory window was but a few feet to the right of oswalds nest any fair computerized trajectory cone imprecise to begin with would have included it too it was the daltex building because the writer had spent an afternoon there swagger next found himself in the local history room of the dallas public library on young street a few blocks from his hotel on commerce the library itself which seemed to match city hall across the street appeared to resemble a spaceship crashed into the earth it was a kind of inverted or upsidedown pyramid thing and each floor addressed the world through a line of wide deep windows it was so oldfashioned modern the room on the fifth floor was any other library room in fact nicer than most and the young woman behind the counter couldnt have been nicer herself swagger was following james aptaptons notebook and explained that hed like to see the dallas yellow pages from and in seconds literally under a minute he was sitting at a table with a copy of the dallas yellow pages not merely from but from november as serious research it was probably pointless but he saw that the writer would use it as a source by which to recreate the city of it probably helped him if he knew what the cab companies called themselves where you took your dry cleaning or went to meet your refrigeration or photography needs where youd go to get a nice tan overcoat what the phone number of the texas book depository was ri or that there were eight pages of churches but only one strip clubjack rubys carousel across from the adolphus he learned that you could eat mex at el fenix or buy liquor from a mr sigel who had stores everywhere or stay at the statler hilton or the mayfair or the cabana as well as the adolphus buy a straightup drink at the tabu room or the star bar or the lazy horse lounge buy ammo for your gun at ketchum and killum on kleist in oak cliff or walds buy a book at the north dallas book center hear a song on kbox or kjet or knok yes a storyteller might find all this interesting but it quickly drained swagger of interest and his eyes glazed over in a bit he hung around on sheer willpower so that he traced exactly the writers footsteps leaving he hailed a cab african cabdriver with a little magic box for getting directions so the fellow had him on his way to north beckley in oak cliff in seconds that destination was noted in aptaptons little book and swagger knew it to be the location of oswalds roominghouse in the six weeks before the assassination a writer would have to see such a thing and know for sure as swagger soon learned that it was a wooden box under trees with a scruffy yard off the main drag of zang boulevard that it had a mansard roof concealing what had to be a small upper story that it was deep probably much bigger than it seemed from north beckley street containing many small rooms one of which had housed the creepy young killer nothing marked its place in history it sat among other decaying wooden houses on a block that seemed to be slipping into disrepair and possibly into something he had never heard of until he started readingthat is existential despair it held no mysteries for swagger he directed mr ruranga to drive farther down beckley to tenth for that was the route of oswalds last walk as a free man oswald had thundered down beckley with seemingly no direction in mind then turned on a street called crowley which led him to another turn down tenth swagger had forgotten crowley and settled for tenth when they reached it it turned out not to go through so the driver had to mull around until he found a way around the church parking lot that now barricaded it that route led to the bleak street where oswald had been confronted by the police officer right before the corner of tenth and patton and oswald had hit three of his four shots all fatal no plaque marked j d tippits falling place among the rotting bungalows and uncut lawns just a whisper as dry leaves caught in the persistent texas wind rushing over the earth it seemed so wrong then it was a brief shot up oak cliffs main drag called jefferson to the low strip of commercial buildings that held the texas theatre the theater was still there and still called texas and recognizable from a million reproductions of photos taken at pm november when the surly young man with the snubnosed special was taken down by dallas homicide getting a shiner in the process in retrospect he was damned lucky he didnt get a in the thoracic cavity as the dallas cops in those days werent particularly merciful to cop killers again the theater held no fascination for swagger it was just an old building and its deco stylings spoke thirties not sixties and its marquee in spanish suggested that a new wave of inheritors had moved in swagger ordered the cab back to the adolphus because it was happily nap time the nap never arrived not even with lights out and shades down would sleep approach too much danced in his brain conspiracy theory second shooter third shooter triangulation of fire all that oliver stone stuff how could you think about this thing at all with all the crap around it you couldnt see the target there was so much camouflage some of it deceitful some of it well meant some of it earnest some of it crazy cia castro from deep within the government the trilateral commission he told himself think hard think straight concentrate could there have been a second gunman elsewhere in dealey how do you attack that proposition there was no reason why there couldnt have been one from a gunman with a rifle in his umbrella to a guy on top of the tbd to someone on one of the other buildings that ringed the square daltex or the records building or even the criminal courts building but what am i missing what am i missing he had nothing then he had something most if not all of the multiple shootergrassy knoll theorists proceeded from a fundamental lack of rigor under false assumptions most assumed sloppily that what became known on november was known before that it was not you have to discipline yourself when thinking about this shit to limit your thoughts to what was known on november and not after most of them had not been able to do that there was one unassailable fact only one bullet was found that could be associated with the murder of john f kennedy that is what is called an anomaly swagger knew from too much experience that many shootings feature anomalies things that could not be predicted that could not be expected that were seemingly impossible yet they happened because reality does not care what people think or expect no sane planner could have assumed that only one bullet would be found wc the latertobefamous magic bullet any planner utilizing multiple shooters ie personnel on the grassy knoll would have to assume that bullets from their firearms would be recovered as well the odds certainly favored that outcome if that was the fact why bother to use lee harvey oswald as a patsy why not do the job straight out like a mob hit and make a break for it after the last shot why not use an automatic or a semiautomatic weapon and put a burst on target instead of three shots separated by several seconds each a good man with a thompson at the grassy knoll could have killed everyone in that car in two seconds the only reason to have a single shot fired from the knoll was the falseflag operation to set up a chump why would you do that if your own assumedtoberecovered bullet would give that away quickly the deceit that oswald was the only shooter would last it had to be assumed until an autopsy surgeon removed a bullet from jfks brain or mrs kennedys left shoulder or john connallys lung or the upholstery of the limo any othershooter scenario without some kind of ballistic deceit meant to link whatever really happened with oswalds mannlichercarcano was utterly dismissible on its face it was even surprising that such craziness wasnt laughed off the face of the earth when it was first theorized though nobody in the press knew enough about rifle ballistics to catch on he sat back that seemed solid he looked at it a thousand ways and couldnt see through it or around it it was okay progress maybe a little and tomorrow to make sure it was there he picked up the aptapton notebook and noted what the writer had inscribed in a careful hand national institute of assassination research n crenshaw chapter as is true of many grandly named enterprises the national institute of assassination research was located in somebodys basement the house was shabby with shedding shingles in another decaying dallas prewar bungalow neighborhood a onestory wreck that hadnt seen paint or putty in too many years the glassandsteel spires of new dallas seemed a long way away from this brokendown zone as swagger walked through the gate in the cyclone fence on a sidewalk smeared with wet leaves he noted a sign that said bookstore in back he followed that around and found a stairway down to another sign that instructed him to ring bell which he did come on in its open came a shout he walked into a room jammed to bulging with bookshelves all of them ominously creaky and distended from loadbearing responsibility as their fibers struggled with the tonnage of pages they were asked to contain the whole thing musty and basementsmelling the shelves were indexed by handwrittenontape topic labels cia russia rifle lho early lho late warren commission pro warren commission con documents witness accounts fbi jack ruby and so on and so forth bob looked for one called daltex but didnt see it he moseyed unmonitored for a good deal of time pulling this or that tattered paperback from a shelf tracking the conspiracy theories from mafia to kgb to castro to micomplex to big oil to far right none of them particularly motivating the stuff felt like an undertow it could suck you in and in minutes you were annealed into the gel of conspiracy your clarity gone your logicgyro hopelessly out of whack your ability to distinguish this from that eroded into nothingness too much information which of it was trustworthy which dubious too many claims and assertions too much speculation some outandout lies for profit in all as if some madhouse virus of paranoia had been set loose infecting all who breathed it hi there a voice said sorry i was trying to catch up on shipping can i help you the man was tall and gangly a kind of seedy academic with a matting of thick blondish hair and glasses held to his head by an elastic strap now pushed back into his hair he wore a tatty green crewneck sweater under a tweed jacket that had some mothholes flagrantly displayed on the lapel midforties no commando type his hollow pale cheeks bristly with dayold beard he smiled introducing the fact that he hadnt discovered toothwhitening strips and extended a longfingered hand bob shook it discovering as hed anticipated that it was slightly squishy and moist and smiled back well bob said i seem to have a bug in my head thats saying daltex over and over again if there was a second rifle it had to be there given a bunch of other factors i thought you might have books on it i thought you might have a file ah said the proprietor of niar very interesting i stood at the elm street x and i couldnt help but notice how close its trajectory is to the snipers nest agreed many many folks have found that fascinating im sort of late to this game so forgive me for my ignorance im guessing that a lot has been thrashed over gone through shaken out and i dont want to waste my time doing what someone already did in i dont blame you friend said the man settling easily into a conversational posture by resting his rear on the counter and crossing his arms especially now you know with the fiftieth coming up were anticipating a big surge in interest and attention it seems like stephen king isnt the only guy working on an assassination book im aware of a great deal of activity im no writer said bob lord knows i couldnt string two words together if my life depended on it its the puzzle aspect of the thing the pure solution that is so damned fascinating i hear you said the man im richard monk and i guess im ceo and janitor of niar also shipping clerk accountant and lightbulb replacer its pretty damn glamorous bob got out his wallet and pulled a card handing it over john p brophy phd nspe jack mining engineer ret boise idaho spent my life digging holes all over the globe he said its pretty boring in a tent in ecuador so i started reading when i wasnt digging or sleeping or drinking or whoring im still reading about three years ago i noticed i had five or six million bucks ticking away and declared myself retired i got hooked on jfk and have been digging into that it seems to have taken over my life i read your website for news every week anyhow i finally worked out some stuff of my own and thought id come to town to check it out see if it stands up to reality so youre a daltex guy i could put you in touch with a couple of other big daltexers well said bob yes but i am cautious i get it youve got a theory its your intellectual property you dont want it getting out all of us are like that halfway between hungering to share and fearing being ripped off ill go easy no problem you know everybody and everything i am the kennedy assassination richard said laughing i live and breathe this stuff jack and i have the unfortunate problem of a photographic memory if i read something its there forever or at least so far maybe itll reach a point where one more fact makes my head explode swagger laughed richard monk was engaging if weird and didnt have that suspicious feral quality that so many in the assassination community seemed to have offhand whats the state of the art on daltex well for a time the people who owned it were generous in letting researchers tour it if they made an appointment their policy has changed lately i suspect because of the fiftieth and the attention is ginning up and theyre trying to rent out a lot of office space i know the building manager i might be able to get you in that would be great said bob to be honest you shouldnt expect much the whole thing has been gutted and rehabbed twice over since now its modern you know kind of lofty very chic urban greenwich village vibe happening they even built an atrium into the lobby that goes up all the way through the center of the building so it looks like the bradbury building in la very oldmovie cool but completely disconnected from the windows are still where they were absolutely richard said and of course youll confirm that certain windows line up almost perfectly with the angle and the trajectory of the head shot allegedly taken by lho that day good see i get into it through the guns im a shooter i actually did a lot more hunting than whoring and drinking and feeling sorry for myself and ive seen a lot of animals and even some men die when hit by a highpowered bullet or even believe it or not a lowpowered sixpointfive my work has been on guns and ballistics and now the problem is to make it fit the possibilities of the day got it see i think its good that you dont come into it with the preset conviction that the cia did it or dallas rightwing oil bastards did it because that skews your thinking exactly you know what jack im way behind in my shipping i more or less survive by mail order man without the internet id be trying to get by on a majors pension from big green army intel twenty years mostly germany anyhow im thinking maybe we ought to meet for dinner and talk there is that something youd be up for only if its on me great better than i hoped for where you staying i can at least come to you the adolphus oh then the french room richard said airily and swagger knew it was a joke for the french room was the swanky hotels glamorously decadent restaurant seriously go down one block to main go up main theres a great mex place called sol irlandes got it said swagger see you at eight its an easy walk okay said richard after a long grateful swallow of tecate i didnt bring the file because i am the file but when you come back i can pull all the pictures and references for you or i can attach it to an email and ship it to you whichever great said swagger meanwhile ill call dave arons who manages the building for its owners galaxy capital limited daves okay he gets it ill tell him youre an old friend very trustworthy he just doesnt want loonies parading through there in tinfoil hats i left mine in boise around them the dark restaurant hummed with commerce it seemed to be a popular place maybe because the salsa was so good swagger sipped his diet coke by the way theyre playing down the connect to the assassination even if theyve got an assassination museum souvenir shop right there on their corner at houston and elm i noticed it said bob i didnt go in they now call it elm not daltex makes sense good marketing move i think okay right now daltex is featured in at least thirtyeight of the two hundred sixtyfive formally recognized conspiracy theories its got the angles and as youll find access and egress on that day was more or less easy it wasnt closed down till twelvethirtynine or so so a team could have gotten out pretty easy but you probably know neither bugliosi nor posner the two great warren commission acolytes whove studied all the theories give it much time of day they dont even bother to rebut it when you think about it maybe thats sensible i mean man it would have taken some balls go into a public building crack an office pop the president and walk out whistling dixie ten seconds before the cops arrive balls and luck over two hundred people worked in that building werent most of them at dealey like mr zapruder theres always some guy hanging around maybe they were disguised possible i suppose but disguised as what a giant charm bracelet no way strangers can disguise themselves as friends giant charm bracelet sorry woody allen line not funny if you dont love woody i must have missed it swagger said anyhow on the disguise thing maybe it was longterm the group rented an office before and after the shooting stayed there for six months when the lease was up no wait dammit the route wasnt known till the twentieth that would free you up to the big deepconspiracy thing where some sinister force buried in government uses its tentacles to manipulate things into place far in advance im an engineer i have a distrust of big plans because ive made my money troubleshooting when big plans go wrong and believe me they go wrong all the time its better to have a plan than not have a plan but at the same time no plan survives contact with reality you sound military jack i was in for twenty i saw it happen all the time i was in the marines for a the limp vietnam interrupted richard nah ecuador a piece of drill bit going a thousand feet a second that was my real education the engineering teaches you that a plan is a set of assumptions or diagrams that are wrong or impossible everything affects everything everything changes and you end up in a place you never thought youd be i agree still dammit the angle of any of six windows to that x on elm street gives us exactly the brain shot that killed the president its attractive to a conspiracy theorist it is you say your thing is ballistics yeah i think ive figured out some things as to how there could have been another gun but no forensic evidence of it fascinating but dont tell me because youll be angry at yourself in the morning i wasnt going to intellectual property as you say for a mining engineer the whole world is secured by mineral rights thats what i bring to the table and it makes me kind of paranoid thats fine also as it turns out im not much of a gun guy and id have no way to evaluate it thats a common failing in this assassination research world said bob taking another sip of diet too many gun opinions by people who dont know a damned thing about guns a lot of time has been wasted ill tell you why because its so big in order to make sense of it and make fair assumptions youve got to have expertise in too many areas the medical people know nothing about guns and the gun people know nothing about the mafia and the mafia people know nothing about the cia and the cia people know nothing about the cubans and so sooner or later youre making judgments on something you know nothing about and the result is always nonsense let me ask you richard said bob do you have a theory my problem is that i know too much about it i cant judge anymore i see the flaws in everything the contradictions the micro findings i could do twenty minutes on the metallurgical analysis of the bullet fragments found on the floor of the limousine and whether it disproves a secondgun theory or buttresses it and its arguable either way but i have no real opinion as to which side of the issue is correct how can i judge i wish i could forget some of the stuff i know but i cant make it go away its my curse on the other hand it made me a good intel analyst and it helps me in my chosen line of work got it but since youre payingdo you mind if i order another beer go ahead i will share with you the one theory ive heard that explains everything i may have made it up i may have heard it somewhere i dont know it was just in my mind one day perhaps god put it there it accounts for every nuance and inconsistency and witness confusion and everything the only problem is after i tell you ill have to kill you where is this guy going swagger thought im not going to live much longer anyhow so you may as well fire away let me ask you one favor dont interrupt when i say something that doesnt accord with the thing we laughingly call history itll all become clear in the end im listening said bob on november richard began a screwball marxist loser named lee harvey oswald for reasons too banal to be believed fired three shots at the president of the united states who by utter coincidence showed up outside his workplace window one day the first shot missed because oswald was an idiot the second shot hit kennedy under the neck in the high back it drove through his body deflecting because of the presidents heavy neck musculature hit governor connally in the back passed through him and hit him in the wrist and finally the thigh oswalds third shot missed because he was an idiot oswald is not important but lets stay with him for a second he panicked raced downstairs and there met a police officer named marion baker who commanded him to halt oswald instead bolted by the officer and headed out the door of the texas book depository and officer baker drew and fired end of oswald what happened to kennedy is the gist of our story his secret service driver raced to parkland hospital less than five minutes away and a very good team of emergency physicians got to work it was touch and go nip and tuck all through the day and night in the morning kennedy finally stabilized though feeble from the devastating wound he hung on sustained by his incredible will to live and the good wishes and hopes of millions around the world the recovery was slow and painful lyndon johnson became acting president in his absence and ruled judiciously as guided by kennedys advisers and made no tragic boneheaded decisions no vietnam obviously meanwhile kennedy grew stronger and stronger each day it was feared that his spine was damaged and that he would be paralyzed but by the narrowest of margins that proved not to be the case during this time his wife jackie hovered like an angel at his bedside and perhaps the power of her love was another force for the good in helping the man regain his capacities as he healed slowly over the months he sat up in march he took his first tentative steps in may and by august he returned to the white house lbj of course had never moved in and began to take up light duties by the convention in midaugust he was able to give a rousing speech and was renominated by unanimous acclaim he barely had to campaign and barely did campaign and his opponent barry goldwater was wiped out at the polls in november less than a year after the tragedy in dallas he was reinaugurated as president and began his second term but he had changed at first only his closest associates noticed it but as his policy tendencies uncontested because of the sheer charisma of his near martyrdom became evident the press and then the public noticed it seems that he had seen the light as it were the neardeath experience altered him profoundly the long months of solitude with nothing except his medical team and the enduring love of his wife had cemented that alteration gone was the anticommunist cold warrior gone was the savvy political pro not above a dirty trick or two gone too were the philandering the drug excesses the games of carrotandstick with the press for maximum advantage the partying the glamour the whole sense of the glory of camelot instead he became an ascetic a what said swagger guy with great selfdiscipline clear moral beliefs true believer got it having come so close to death he hated it and would have made it illegal if possible in policy that feeling of the fragility of life the rapidness with which it may be taken away and the permanence that even a tiny act of violence leaves in its wake turned him into a pacifist he saw that war was wrong in the abstract and in the particular that strength was a pitiful disguise for fear that more was gained by reaching out with love than shunning while locking and loading he immediately recalled the ten thousand american troops in the republic of vietnam he canceled a hundred million in defense spending he began to open avenues to rapprochement with castro in cuba and ordered the cia to stop all its anticastro activities he also forbade the agency from playing in the internal politics of numerous latin american and african countries all of which promptly went communist as did the republic of south vietnam absorbed without struggle by the north vietnamese it didnt matter to him that we lost those countries we won by avoiding battle and the loss of our precious young men his grandest ambition was to end our nuclear arms race with the russians the idea of millions cowering in fear across the globe because some mad general could push a button and end the world in nuclear holocaust essentially on a whim horrified and sickened him that would be his crowning glory in the years and his most ardent initiatives addressed the arms race the escalating accumulation of atomic devices and delivery systems their presence made the possibility of accidental annihilation all the more feasible he offered the russians everything he could think of on bended knee so to speak anything to move away from the madness of mutually assured destruction that held the world in its iron grip as the atlases and the poseidons and the sss and s seethed and steamed in their silos all across the american west and the siberian plain and the bs and the tupolev badgers held in their failsafe orbits just outside of each others airspace twentyfourseven their high feathery contrails against the blue blurry reminders of how close we were to the brink and how fragile were the mechanisms that seemed to guard our safety as for the russians they wouldnt budge sure some liberals in the politburo appreciated the opening for a softening of attitudes and lobbied to play along but the hardliners astounded by how readily the president was acquiescing and how much he was giving up without recompense counseled sternness to see how much more could be gotten out of a fellow they thought was clinically insane even if neither they nor anyone in the united states could say as much finally as his second term was running out and egged on by liberal eastern newspapers and new media that celebrated his willingness to defuse the bombs threatening the world and replace bellicosity with understanding the president ordered the unthinkable he ordered unilateral nuclear standdown to prove his sincerity he would prostrate himself and his country to the russians he ordered the bs of sac grounded he ordered the computers at norad unplugged as well as the overhorizon radars of the dew line he ordered the minutemen in their silos defueled and began a program of warhead neutralization removal and destruction he ordered the mx experimental program halted at a certain date he had done what he set out to do he had removed the united states from its position as a nuclear power he had achieved peace at twelve minutes after midnight on tuesday november the russians launched wow said swagger richard this is getting a little weird isnt it jack you promised not to interrupt its a good thing im not a drinking man anymore or youd have me all bourboned up by now id be fighting sailors talking to young women and calling my kids my whistle is dry i need another beer after destroying the world ill bet waiter he hailed the kid get my father here another tecate and refill my diet will you sure you guys want to see the dessert menu hey ice cream and nuclear firestorms turning me to ash thats a great idea bob said richard laughed oh it gets better the beer came and richard rewarded himself for destroying the western hemisphere with a swallow while swagger drained his own half a diet coke in tribute to the burning cities and civilians slaughtered in their beds by the millions okay richard he said i guess im manned up enough to get on through this you only think you cant handle the truth said richard he took a breath and began again who can blame them it probably wasnt even a decision made in the kremlin im sure it was some junior lieutenant general in some command bunker outside of vladivostok by the iron logic of his national philosophy and the doctrine of mutually assured destruction he did the right thing once the mutually is taken out of the equation the sane thing to do is fire in thirty minutes of sustained ss warfighting over a hundred million americans perished all command and control bunkers were hit sacnorad was turned to radioactive glass but there was no point in wasting megatonnage on the silos because theyd been disconnected from the computer grid and the local commanders the first lieutenants in the holes with the two keys didnt have the flexibility to launch without command authority failsafe you know those weapons were redirected at smaller cities so even the dubuques and the cedar rapids and the lawtons were fried on the thermonuclear griddle so the russians won world war iii quite handily unfortunately they didnt do so well in world war iv which started the next day assuming the brits would sit it out they assumed wrong and the raf went in low and hard and turned eastern europe into a funeral pyre for its efforts the rafs airfields were awarded secondary strikes from intermediaterange sss and since the airfields were attached to the island of great britain another twenty or so million went up in flames the russians also thought they had the american carriers zeroed but it turned out their subs were the ones on the zero the american destroyers hunted and killed them like fish in barrels and the carrier planes took out the russian surface fleet with firstgeneration airtoship missiles allowing the carrier medium bombers and attack planes to get close enough to roar up the soft underbelly of redland at low level and deliver tactical nukes on all red army groups tank concentrations and any unfortunate cities in the neighborhood finally one boomerclass nuke missile sub that had been at sea and missed the fire that time got itself back into the game and launched without command sixteen poseidons a hundred and sixty megatons cod returns not accepted by the end of the first day of world war iv the russians had lost close to two hundred million people and their military structure had been utterly cremated then it looked like the chinese the africans and the south americans would inherit the earth ha ha jokes on them a little thing called nuclear winter set in one of those unintended consequences people are always talking about i hate it when that happens a blanket of radioactive debris filled the skyi mean everywhereand robbed of sun agriculture wilted and died where it grew the temperature dropped forty degrees mean the seas became oceans of poison marine life went the way of the dodo mutations new plagues new parasites actual vampire attacks all these microscopic nasties that had heretofore yielded to the killing power of soap and water flourished and multiplied and grew killing yet more millions the flu black plague cholera you name it ancient diseases not seen in eons came trotting out for their pound of flesh ovaries shriveled and among the few million survivors the birth rate fell precipitously we were going down we were dying faster than we were replacing and nothing could change that demographic trend by there was almost nothing left there was only one solution the remaining highiqs agreed on it with fewer than a hundred thousand people left on the planet there was only one choice in one of the most moving spectacles in human history the worlds remaining top scientists engineers physicians soldiers and thinkers gathered it was like the manhattan project a colossal undertaking underwritten by all surviving power structures backed by all humanity a concentrated species effort the likes of which hadnt been seen since australopithecus crushed his first gazelle with a femur on the african savannah with one goal to find a way to use the power of science to save humanity they had to send a man back in time i think i saw that movie said bob i think it was called terminator hmm never heard of it said richard taking a finishing draft on his tecate then raising his hand for another one now that you mention it i might have seen it a time or fifteen i think i was with you until the timetravel jazz came up i dig holes in the ground long straight holes in other words i live in and fight dirt dirt is about as elemental as you can get richard especially when six miles of it are between you and what youre trying to dig up so for me time travel is a nonstarter i just cant wrap my mind around it i have to get off the boat right here jack trust me on thistime travel by the laws of physics is theoretically justifiable ill spare you the math but the secret is the position of the body in space you see if you sent a man back a hundred years from here from this nice restaurant and among all these attractive young people and he stepped into the here of a century ago he would instantly die because hed be in outer space hello no air degrees below zero and pieces of shit flying along at light speed because theres nothing to slow them down thats because the earth the solar system the whole shebang nothing is where it was its all moving and moving fast you have to first devise the mother of all computers to calculate exactly where here was a hundred years ago and by particle beam transmission thats where you send him so when he gets there there is a there to be gotten to im getting a headache said bob were almost done promised richard he took another long draft and resumed he wasnt a special man but he had to be a hundred percent certain after rigorous psychological testing he was found winnowed from the thousands whod sworn they could do the deed but in everyone knew the temptation to stay in the past would have been overwhelming the past was so much better than the everdiminishing present they had to have a man with the integrity to destroy himself on faith for a world hed never see for children hed never know whod not only die but more tragically perish from memory a man who not only wouldnt exist but never would have existed they found him maybe he was someone like you jack tough and smart salty been around walked with a limp always with the watchful eyes always slightly tense as if hes ready to dodge a flying drill bit that would be the guy a hero like jack with a limp from a wound he never talks about they sent him back he entered the past at twelvetwentynine pm cst on november they sent him to the southwest corner of the texas book depository just beyond the hertz sign he had a minute or so to set up and hed been trained well he didnt flinch he didnt hesitate doubt fear regret very capable a jack brophy if ever there was one good with tools even or especially guns he had a rifle nothing special nothing complicated and a nice midrange scope and several rounds of ammunition all of these were chance survivors of the nuclear wars located at great cost and effort by our descendants in the year the hero on the roof put his wellzeroed scope on the head of the vital attractive young man known as john f kennedy and saw the president take lee harvey oswalds second round and flinch but not fall watched his hands involuntarily rise to his throat in the nerve behavior known as the thorburn position counted to five and squeezed the trigger he drove a bullet into jfks skull in that moment he disappeared the rifle disappeared all traces of the bullet disappeared as it performed its killing duty it ceased to exist all evidence of the second rifle ceased to exist and thats why nobody will ever solve the case a confused but still idiotic lee harvey oswald was left to go huh panic and begin his crazed last run who cares what happened to him whats important is that in the moment of jfks death the next hundred years ceased to exist or ceased to have existed jfk was dead he wasnt wounded he didnt recover his brain had been turned to vapor he didnt pull the troops out of vietnam he didnt beg the russians for mutual concessions he didnt unilaterally stand down from the brink thus pushing us over the brink there was no nuclear holocaust no deaths in the billions no nuclear winter no collapsing ecosystem no vanished agriculture no poison seas no demographic suicide no second manhattan project we got as a planet and a species something unknowna second chance thats where we are now jack fifty years into the second postnovember reality vietnam watergate jimmy carter ronald reagan bush one clinton bush two the war on terror iraq afghanistan its been one mess after another jack but we havent blown ourselves up and billions of us still drink the water and breath the air so maybe that lone gunman did us some good after all well said bob you promised me a theory and thats a hell of a theory see most theories assume that had jfk survived the consequences would have been positive theres no way to make that argument just as likely by that goddamned law of unexpected consequences they could have been negative tragic even catastrophic we can never know richard you are either brilliant or insane i dont know which ill bet youre not surprised to learn ive heard that line a few times before now chew on that one overnight and tomorrow at eleven show up at the lobby of daltex and dave arons will take you through the building swagger got back to the hotel with a headache as if hed been drinking in a sense he had been richards science fiction story with time travel and all that goofy bullshit what the hell was that about it had a meaning somehow but he couldnt see it he almost wished he had a drink and as usual the temptation to go to the bar to have the one that would become two and then three and so on was still there like a pilot light something that never went out he had to think of something else he had to put something between himself and his appetites and the craziness that swirled in his head he pulled on clothes and boots took the elevator down and walked the twelve blocks in darkness and coolness and emptiness to dealey in a haste that belied the pain in his hip and the gracelessness of his walk he wanted to look at it again see it in the dark as form without detail as shape that nightmare site of so many crazies the grassy knoll without features the small hill to the west of the plaza seemed utterly nondescript he walked to it climbed it and watched the cars peel down elm he imagined himself as that legendary french gangster the favorite candidate from one of the first theories who somehow had lingered a corsican the story went like someone out of an old hollywood movie so degraded that he could kill the worlds most beautiful and dazzling man there he was with his m carbine leaning forward at pm that day putting the front sight blade on the presidents head and squeezing the trigger but no it was wrong the french killer couldnt have aimed at the president the president was moving at an uncertain speed his killer would have to aim ahead of him hed have to hold what six inches to the front to make that brain shot it was called shooting on the deflection and it took talent and practice some people never got it most people assume that the frenchman on the knoll had the easier shot because he was closer in their minds close equals easy far equals difficult oswald was feet away the frenchman clearly these people hadnt done any wing shooting or taken any shots at running game or men swagger estimated that the theoretical frenchman would have been on a ninetydegree angle to the vehicle which itself was beginning to accelerate at an uneven speed in order to place one shotand he would be limited to one shot in order to preserve the falseflag operationhe would have had to shoot on the deflection in skeet and trap and sporting clays this is the hardest shot called a crosser because it demands the biggest lead it is mastered by shooting it over and over again to develop a feel for the necessary lead given the speed of the target the frenchman would have had to find the target keep the rifle moving pull ahead of the target a certain unknown distance and then pull the trigger without disturbing the sight picture as he kept the rifle moving swagger knew that was hard enough with a shotgun which blasts a pattern of shot covering a fairly wide area but almost impossible except for the top professionals with a rifle an instrument that puts a single bullet into a single spot the odds on making that shot the first time out are extremely remote no they are not impossible but it seemed unwise for a professional team to base its plan on one man hitting a nearimpossible shot first time cold bore unless it had at its disposal some sort of shooting genius and such men are rare and difficult to find as for oswald or whoever was back there in the building whichever one it was his situation was completely different his shot in wingshooting terminology was an outgoer its pretty easy the target presents very little angle the limo wasnt exactly at zero degrees angle to him but as it moved down elm street and as he oriented himself in the window to track it it was under five degrees from his point of view even through that poorquality scope it was trending right to left slowly possibly even undetectably to him its main quality was that it was diminishing in size as it traveled farther in distance neither of these conditions required that he shoot on the deflection demanding that skillful computation of lead he could hold pointblank on the target concentrate on his squeeze and get his shot off if the rifle was accurate and the sight aimed dead zero then the shot was technically no harder than a benchrest shot at a rifle range the difference in distances feet versus feetwas hardly meaningful to bobs snipers brain the shot from behind and above was far easier than a shot from degrees at a vehicle accelerating at an unknown rate swagger thought hmm thats kind of interesting the shot had to come from behind chapter shower dress coffee paper the same khaki suit still baggy the same red tie he noticed neither tie nor suit and headed out daltex was eight blocks or so away the same walk as last nights jaunt to dealey and he thought it would do his hip some good to walk it he made them easily enough two of them one on foot one trailing in a car which looked to be an chevy the car hopscotched and the man on foot would change duties with the driver one guy was black in a black suit with no necktie a porkpie hat and shades the other was dour and plump in plaid sport coat and slacks no tie no hat no glasses sun or otherwise they were not amateurs bob walked down main swallowed by the glassandsteel canyons that had not been there fifty years ago as last night he followed kennedys route pungently aware that the style of modern airconditioning climate control largely banished the open window from large building construction no open windows in the sheets of tinted glass that rose forty stories it was all different for kennedy the buildings then were squatter stouter things constructed mostly in the twenties and thirties lots of ornamentation and showy work arches and cupolas and the other flourishes that cheap skilled labor could routinely produce in brick or stone and windows the closein canyons of main must have pushed jfk past fifty thousand open windows and a shooter could have lurked in any of them it was outside the limits then kennedy himself joked about it and drew smiles because it was such a fantastic possibility he was just about out of windows too beyond the depository it was wideopen space all the way to the trade mart and the speech he never gave the fiftythousandandfirst window had a gunman behind it end of story as had kennedy swagger reached mains jog at dealey and instead of turning left to follow main he turned right down houston a block brought him to the corner where hed met nick where houston crossed elm and the two brick piles stood side by side the book depository and daltex almost twins square girder and mortar palaces he looked hard at daltex a biggish office building seven stories tall redbrick flat roof fairly elaborate with arches built into the brick recessing the windows thick stone slabs edging the roof big windows that opened from the bottom up he could see where new oranger brick had replaced a couple of chunks at the joinery of the elmmain corner to sustain a new brand for the unit that corner also sported the buildings sole retail unit the sixthfloor museum souvenir shop and coffee gallery though it was unclear if it was officially connected with the museum in tbd across the street or if they had claimed the name as a marketing ploy he noted that a fire escape which in ran the height of the building on houston street was gone swaggers vision drifted leftward across the gulf of houston street and settled again on lhos snipers nest at the sixthfloor corner window from where swagger stood at the corner of the two streets the window seemed immense it couldnt have been seventyfive feet away and the downward angle wouldnt affect the trajectory because the range was so close you point at the white shirt through that junky scope and pull the trigger and cannot miss no bad trigger pull could jerk the gun far enough to make a difference no wind deflection could push the bullet from its destiny nothing could interfere with its flight into flesh he stood on the corner again imagining the slow pivot of the big car as the driver wheeled it through the degrees of the turn it would have been all but stationary except for the slow pivot and up there behind window was the gunman again why didnt he shoot then wideopen target straight angle into the high chest connally too far forward to interfere jackie to the right and out of the way the shot so easy a boy scout could have made it what was going on with lho up there in his nest another mystery unknowable unsolvable that had died with jack rubys special into lee harvey swagger waited for the light to change crossed the street turned right and then left up the four steps and entered daltex the first thing he felt was the openness looking up he saw space as an atrium scooped from the guts of the building exposed several floors of balconies and the wood trusses of the roof moving ahead to the security kiosk he was greeted by a man in his forties well dressed and pleasant mr arons my name is jack brophy i think my friend richard monk called you on my behalf they shook hands and arons said yes he did dr brophy jack please jack then he did and i like richard so ill be happy to take you through and try to answer any of your questions swagger peppered the man with inquiries the first concerned the atrium which no wasnt there in it was the creation of a nineties refurb the whole building swagger saw had the kind of urbanhip tone of so many gentrified older units and the new designer had stressed raw brick where possible lots of plain white structural wood simplicity and unforced elegance everywhere the ceilings had been cleverly peeled of stucco exposing the stout girders that were the frame of the building nested in the stillsound wood beams that also sustained the buildings pressures im guessing these three elevators were here before he asked as they rode up since the beginning said arons theyve been rehabbed of coursethe elevator was sleek stainless and teak with mirrors for the vainbut the shaft was always here central rear got it were there ever any elevator operators particularly in not then not ever what about security never not until recently that is swagger felt that the building was smaller on the inside than on the outside even with the opened atriums and ceilings also it was squarer somehow you sensed the perfection of its symmetries inside whereas from outside it seemed longer one way more rectangular they started on the seventh floor and arons took him to an unrented office suite that fronted on houston street looking south to the book depository its roof could be seen twentyfive feet away but more evident was the angle down elm exposing totally the street up to and beyond the x that marked the brain shot it didnt take a genius to see how easy that shot or the back shot that preceded it would have been from here moreover the wide sill made for superb almost benchquality stability and since the window was recessed in an encompassing arch the muzzle wouldnt have been visible from the street nor given the height from the tbd across houston the only building on the horizon the angle into the car and bodies would have been almost identical to oswalds depending on the subtleties of twist and turn of the president and the governor and the windows theyve always been the kind that slid up and down like these not the kind that hinged outward always up and down and the floors all wood like now ever covered with carpet just as you see it except in those days plasterboard covered the brick then as now it was used for office space and storage it was a much busier building with a lot of garment wholesalers they used it as a distribution center so it was in one sense more a warehouse particularly on the lower floors the office suites were on the upper four floors swagger wanted to see the angle from the front that is from the elm street windows that was easily arranged and he soon found himself facing down elm from a more severe angle yet if he stood to the left of the window and oriented himself to the street he had an equally easy shot moreover the shooter would have to be by the mandate of the angles concealed as hed be standing or sitting to the left and shooting out the window at roughly a fortyfivedegree angle he also noted one of his watchers sitting on the park bench at elm and houston right at the top of dealey where bob had sat with nick earlier it was the black one and he sat pretending to read a paper but in reality keeping his eyes nailed on the daltex entrance between the lid of his hat and the top of the newspaper bad craft a smarter move would have been to amble down the street and set up against the dallas records building across elm where he wouldnt have been so visible the roof was next it was accessed through a narrow stairway at the top of the stairwell then a horizontal door stepping onto it you were invisible to any building extant then for none had been higher than it in the vicinity the roof supported but one structure the elevator room which was a freestanding brick pillbox centered in the rear of the building it had clearly been rebuilt in one of the refurbs and unlocked it yielded a surprisingly minimalist interior with three big units for hoisting each attached to an electronic board all of it evidently computercontrolled and run by robot program it would have been much smaller in and jean marquezs evocation of a room jammed with gears and pulleys with the naked winding and unwinding of the cables and the stench of lubrication all of it dark and dangerous and crowded rang true even if the twentyfirstcentury iteration had become something a lot more hightech and that really was that no puzzles solved but no possibilities rendered inoperative by reality he thanked dave arons shook hands in the lobby and went on his way awaiting the phone call on nicks cell it came when he was halfway back to the hotel have you picked them up yeah black guy porkpie suit no tie white guy chubby no hat plaid coat working out of a red chevy should i be worried no theyre local bozos exdallas dicks they work for jacksonbarnes the big detective agency their usual deal is following husbands to the love nest and getting some nice dirty ones the dirtier the shot the bigger the settlement a blow job can cost mr big a cool two million unbelievable these guys are pretty good at following software millionaires and newoil people around theyre overmatched by you who hired em richard yeah one of our agents has a source in their office i wouldnt have thought richard had the dough see thats interesting he lives poor he dresses poor hes the complete assassination monomaniac but hes worth over five mil and takes two vacations a year to wouldnt you know it bangkok is he legit otherwise everything checks out fiftytwo years old brown university grad went army intel for twenty very good rep some good undercover ops mostly in germany the photographicmemory deal is apparently real and he was valued for that faster than a computer married to a german gal divorced retired a major in showed up here in set up the institute got to know all the players got them to trust and like him and view him as a harmless fuzzywuzzy nutcase but adorable his vice appears to be porn not kiddie stuff hes too tame for that he buys a lot of dvds from japan and is a member of several japorn chat rooms where he holds forth with great authority everybody has his little kink who pays for the institute its run on a yearly grant from the thompson foundation a lefty outfit out of dc that also gives to big gun control big green big lib and other similar entities we cant trace it beyond that so i dont know if the dough originates with them or not should i start packing no these two dallas flatfeet as i say are nonvi types both were in vice never did swat action they wouldnt be involved in a hit too scary for them theyre strictly ninetofivers and want to go home at the end of the day and play with their kids okay i wont even ditch em yet jacksonbarnes is almost certainly doing some deep data mining on jack brophy but the justice department work should withstand that easily youll check out richard will believe youre who you are then what tonight when dumb and dumber are home ill check out and disappear ill let richard wonder if ive left or what in a couple of days ill catch him offbalance and start throwing some hardball at him his next job if hes something other than a paranoid will be to get a pic or a print on me ill make sure he doesnt then well see what happens i dont like that swagger youre trying to goad the violence and we may not be able to stop them in time no ill stay in touch and well set up a nice sting op when the time is right and see what we net no guns not unless i know im being hunted then ill hunt back swagger spent another normal day dropped by richards bookstore and bought three used books at the friends rate percent discountbugliosi posner and the abridged copy of the warren commission report he owned them all but hadnt brought themthen went back to dealey sat hung out read yardage with a small leica rangefinder walked this way and that then he went back to the adolphus had an early meal and went to bed he was tailed the whole way at am he woke showered shaved packed and checked out of the hotel he checked his suitcase at the hotel desk and carried an overnighter with the books and some fresh clothes toiletries and his super mags and speed scabbard then slipped out a side door he walked about nine blocks through a dark devoid of human activity dodging the occasional police car whose attention he might merit and got to dallass west end a nightclub and entertainment zone a few blocks northwest of dealey where cabs were plentiful he arrived in twenty minutes at his destination a randomly selected econo lodge on a road that led to the airport and checked in paying cash for a week so no one could trace him via credit card he didnt think richard had that capacity but the big detective agency might he called nicks number and left his new address then went back to bed nick called at three the next afternoon my news is that the boys are going crazy trying to find you let em sweat whats your plan now im going to chill here for a few days and hunker up and reread all this crap as he said its so goddamn big and no matter how you enter it you get lost in the maze im going to try out a more concentrated less scattershot approach i thought you had it nailed good by sticking with the rifle stuff the rifle stuff is great as far as it goes but i cant get beyond the timing issue howd they do it so fast if it couldnt be done that fast then the whole thing goes away lee harveys the bad boy robert aptapton got smacked by a punk on meth and bob lee goes back to his rocker wiser but poorer you could go nuts with all this stuff many a poor man has i know im one said nick in a couple of days ill pop in unexpectedly on richard and we get to the new game of nowheseesmenowhedont okay let me know what i can do that was that bob spent the three days poring over the three books crosschecking trying to find a pattern looking for something that might tie everything together in a nice little package a million others had done so before him and like them he failed nothing no holes oswald did it that was all had to be nothing else worked shot from daltex on the wildest frontier of the physically possible but unsupported by any evidence whatsoever except the generalized conceit that the third bullet came from behind and above and certain windows at daltex were within the cone of trajectory that the computer age had imposed upon the reality of the event no known photo existed that showed the upper floors of the building at around that day which would document whether or not a window had been open the one new fact was that someone had killed james aptapton if so then maybe it was over something mundane not the assassination of john f kennedy maybe aptapton had divulged his theory and that guy had recognized it as something new and special wished it were his and decided it was his so he killed him in baltimore for it murders have happened for lesser reasons by far for pennies for toys and gym shoes for pride and prejudice for honor and glory for blow jobs and rim shots maybe it was richard himself though it was hard to feature someone so rumpled and disheveled as a badass killer but maybe if jack brophy came clean with richard richard might have some suggestions about who in the assassination community was capable of such a thing it was hard to know what to do next on the third day swagger could tolerate the inactivity no more and took a cab to an address in the suburbs that hed found on the internet it was a huge sporting goods place called outdoor warehouse and it lived up to its claim of holding nearly everything indoors that could be used outdoors that included the hunting department where among the beautifully crafted new rifles and the black plastic assaulters and the endless variations of mm s ands in the gleaming showcases he found a wideranging aisle of ammunition offerings and between the creedmore and the swede some boxes of mannlichercarcano it was czech or something from an outfit called prvi partizan but in the requisite grain load it was surprisingly cheap at around fifteen dollars and the thirteenyearold behind the cash register up front displayed no sense of irony at the sight of a man buying a box of sixfive carc in dallas texas back in the room in the econo lodge bob opened the box took out the twenty cartridges and brought one close to his eye it looked like a small bluntnosed missile all gleaming and reflective in the fluorescent light the bullet was abnormally long given the length of the case and spoke of the nineteenth century with its blunt tip which was the latest thing in the s he looked at it from a dozen angles trying to uncover its secrets it was a lynchpin of sorts close enough to the original to stand in for the bullet that lho had nominally used though it was the magic bullet today it didnt look magic just comically oldfashioned with that rounded meplat the technical term for bullet point he recalled the number of wounds it had inflicted hitting the president high in the back passing through him hitting governor connally passing through him passing through his wrist and smacking his leg all without doing much damage to itself from a certain angle that bulletwarren commission exhibit no did look as pristine as the one three inches from swaggers eyes but bob recalled that from other angles it became clear that the base of the bullet was severely mangled crushed out of round by some impact with core lead extruded from the interior by the impact it was far from pristine but at the same time suspiciously intact swagger had a melancholy fund of knowledge on what bullets did to bodies his own and others to him it was not nearly so mysterious when he considered that the bullet did not strike bone until it left the governors body when it struck his wrist fracturing it by which time it had slowed considerably from its initial muzzle velocity of two thousand feet per second and lost most of its power to crumple or break when colliding with hard structures swagger couldnt get away from the oldfashionedness of it it was oldfashioned by the standards of it was eightytwo years old in theory and design when it struck the president lots of folks missed that it was just another bullet to them another way to look at the bullet was to consider its origin and purpose too many fools had written about the event without reference to those two issues too many fools thought a bullet was just a heavy piece of lead screwed into a cartridge and sent arbitrarily on its way in fact even in bullets and their design and performance were among the most overengineered items in the human inventory thought about hard and mathematically long before men had indoor plumbing or hot running water they had substantive mathematical treatises on ballistic performance principles and laws ballistics were always the first thing the states mind turned to not the last that bullet like the one in its brass casing in his hand now weighed grains and consisted of copper gilding of unusual thickness over a lead core inches in length with a round nose it was designed after great research and experimentation to perform a certain military job which the italian general staff believed would be of importance in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries there was nothing arbitrary about it it wasnt designed just to kill but to kill a particular enemy in a particular environment it occurred to swagger that to understand wc he had to understand the military realities of the italian army in when the round was adopted as the standard infantry cartridge during the general european upgrade of that era from singleshot muskets to magazinefed bolt actions such as the mauser k the french lebel the british enfield and eventually the american springfield who was the italian general staff planning to fight and in what environment the italians have never been expansionist and mussolini was thirty years down the pike they were not great colonizers with an overseas empire to safeguard like the british or the germans despite two pathetic forays into africa they did not see their troops fighting indigenous forces in asia india or the pacific what they imagined was protecting the good life that was lived in their beautiful country with its abundance of resources its grapes its pasta all roasted by a warm sun the italians of understood that the important battles to come would be defensive in nature they would not invade they would be invaded their task was to stop invasion in its tracks where would such a battle take place the amphibious landing had not yet been attempted much less perfected so it seemed likely a foegerman or austrian most likelywould come overland if you look at the map that tells you much the invasion would have to come through the alps it would be a mountain war in such a battle who would an italian soldier be trying to kill and at what range well swagger reasoned the nature of mountain war is that the ranges would tend to be long just look at afghanistan and its fivehundredyard firefights mountain war would involve shooting uphill downhill across valleys except in rare instances thered be little handtohand combat targets could be expected in the twotofourhundredmeter range that would dictate a bullet noted for its accuracy which in turn would result in a long thin bullet so that the rifling could be counted upon to give efficient spin with an unusual density so as to resist the unpredictable spurts of wind found up high it occurred to him that was an excellent description of the mc in the ideal although italian manufacturing practices may have meant that the ideal was seldom achieved who would the italian soldier in the mountains be shooting at the enemy would be a german or an austrian mountain soldier skilled in climbing hearty with a higher pain threshold a more athletic demeanor superb physical conditioning an elite soldier one more thing the key thing he would be heavily dressed he would be wearing underwear long underwear heavy woolen pants a heavy woolen shirt or battle tunic probably a sweater or some kind of tight leatherandfleece vest a parka heavily matted no goretex in those days all bundled tight by belts and pack straps to kill him what do you have to do you have to penetrate him you have to drive a bullet into him with such force that it will not deviate if it strikes a button or a strap or a canteen that will not disintegrate if it strikes a bone but continues on its quest for heart or lungs or guts that lay deep inside the insulation that is what the mannlichercarcano was designed to do and that is exactly what wc did on november it was not an anomaly it performed totally within its design characteristics swagger saw immediately where his thought process had taken him it was enough to drive a man to drink if the second bullet performed to design specification that meant that the third bullet did not it disintegrated when it should not have and that was the key question of the whole goddamned thing the true magic bullet of the jfk assassination was bullet number three it was a heavily encapsulated round designed to penetrate not fly apart it killed by penetrating not by detonating moreover at a range of feet it had lost a great deal of its momentumfrom a high of feet per second it had probably dropped off to feet per second it hit the skull fully flush swagger had no difficulty understanding why the presidents head yielded a massive explosive wound upon impact as the bullet would have pushed an energy wave through any material it encountered and if that material were enclosed the results inevitably would be explosive but he couldnt see why the bullet itself would have detonated there was no ballistic principle for such a thing happening why did the third bullet explode chapter richard monk allowed himself a steak once a week and on friday he went to the palm in the west end he had a nice martini straight up slightly dirty olives ordered the small filet medium rare with mashed potatoes nursed his tini while the steak was seared and then looked up in astonishment when jack brophy slid in across from him richard i do declare mind if i join you jack god i thought youd left i tried to call you and they said youd left i changed locations thats all where are you now see thats it richard ill be honest with you i think im being followed followed said richard with a little too much dramatic emotion driving the word from his lips two guys im sure black guy white guy a team working out of one car you wouldnt know anything about that would you you were in intel you know how these things can be arranged if i was in intel id be a trained liar right so if i tell you no you wont believe it i dont know what to say except that if you look at it why on earth would i have you followed which after all would cost some money and i dont have enough of the stuff to throw around like that the piece of meat i ordered is my one weekly luxury okay okay bob said sorry didnt mean it as an accusation but let me ask you this do you know anybody in the wide body of buffs fanatics researchers whatever who might follow me im thinking i may have a valuable piece of intellectual property maybe you mentioned it to someone who mentioned it to someone who thought it sounded interesting and decided to look into me jack i dont even know what it is something about guns thats all thats right said bob maybe it has to do with something else altogether something back in boise child support if my children cant support themselves by now theres nothing i can do for em i think the money manager sends my exwives their checks so i believe im okay on that no my lifes too dull for intrigue jack no ones approached me asked me any questions about you anything like that richard im just going to disappear for a bit you okay with that sure jack ill see you in three days at that mex place on main twelvethirty youve got it friend of course swagger didnt show at the mexican place but two fbi agents did and they confirmed that the operatives from the jacksonbarnes detective agency were in place down the street with a nikon and a heavy telephoto lens swagger called richard while he sat there apologized for being unavoidably detained and promised to make it up to him and that theyd meet soon but he couldnt set a time because his schedule was so fluid he let three days pass and ambushed richard in the parking lot outside the yo restaurant another famous joint just across from the palm in the west end richard was a little buzzed from the martini and his belly was loaded with protein and carbohydrates man you show up at the oddest times he said perturbed bob guessed because his photo team wasnt with him and there was no way he could call it in to them in time im secretagent man all over the place i think i dumped my followers lets get a cab and drive around for a while jack maybe youre overdoing it a bit i should tell you again in the past three days nobody asked me anything about you and nobodys keeping an eye on me or anything i do have something for you yeah i have a friend who has a gun as close as you can get to the oswald rifle its a mannlichercarcano model carbine serial number cv just eleven shy of oswalds from terni its got the japanese scope and mount and it was ordered from kleins just a week or so before oswald ordered his in march im guessing the same technician attached the scope to the rifle you couldnt come closer a wealthy collector i know paid over three grand for it i think youd find it interesting to shoot weve even got some whitebox from western you know how hard that stuff is to come by nah said swagger see it doesnt matter how shoots it only matters how shoots for a dozen reasons a hundred reasons they could shoot different by far and you know what richard in my theory it doesnt matter a lick how even oswalds rifle shot that day okay i get it second gunman second rifle another mannlicher close but no let me tell you this i dont know why i dont know who but goddammit i know how come on lets get that cab and go for a ride on me he herded richard toward the street in a friendlybear manner and the younger man couldnt resist if working for somebody he had to maintain the contact if the assassination nut he claimed to be he had to find out whether the new info was cool they got in and swagger instructed the driver to drive around for a while on the meter that hed pay whatever it was a great gig for the fellow who rarely got a big ride this late at night off they went richard swagger said i want your judgment maybe im nuts and all ive got is bullshit or maybe its part of the answer anyhow i had a whatyoucallit epiphany today which makes me even more sure im on to something it came out of something you said let me run this by you jack i dont know anything about guns i cant make a judgment youll get this richard then tell me if its worth hiding worth looking for an author to partner up with if it has any value book or moviewise i dont know about that stuff you do okay jack ill give it my best shot heres the key question why did the third bullet explode in my opinion nobody has answered that correctly the best answer you get is it exploded because it exploded bullets occasionally explode you cant predict it but you cant deny it get something moving that fast anything can happen whats your answer why did the third bullet explode you said as it performed its killing duty it ceased to exist isnt that right the bullet from the future which in doing its duty obliterated itself its rifle its shooter and a hundred years of tragedy i said that yes thats the crux of the conceit its kind of cool i think richard do you know what lingering means of course i do i mean something that hangs around wont leave your mind seems always there that kind of lingering yes i know what that kind of lingering is what you said it ceased to exist that lingered for me it lingered and lingered and finally i realized something the third bullet the one that hit kennedy it ceased to exist so it did to the eternal annoyance of the warren commission and the delight of conspiracy animals the world over no no it wasnt an accident heres the point it had to do that it was engineered to do that and because the engineering was sound thats what made the conspiracy possible explosive bullet huh just like the day of the jackal with the mercury inside or i suppose no no no explosive no mercury no glycerin nothing like that all those leave chemical traces easily detectable by the forensics of i believe the warren commission asked the fbi forensics guy about such a possibility now that you mention it yeah frazier his name was and as usual he was both wrong and stupid im talking about something else what i mean is that the bullet itself without changing its composition its metallurgy its anything was engineered in such a way that it had to explodeit had to that was the brilliance of it allso that it left no record of its existence it was the real magic bullet only everybody was too stupid to figure that out so what are you talking about how do you make a bullet explode swagger said im talking about velocity he continued to explain to richard who sat rapt as if he did know something about guns after all where are you nicks voice came over the cell it was a few days later in the meantime hed stood up richard at a planned meet sent him a few emails asking whether hed come across anything similar to his velocity theory which richard was presumably checking and generally making an annoyance of himself without showing up anywhere to be photographed ive switched motels swagger said giving him the new address im closer in now and i can get cabs easier man am i wearing out the atm all the cash ive been using okay listen to me nick said new tone to his voice official gman deadzero serious i want you to stay there under no circumstances are you to leave and expose yourself dont make me send a car to bring you in and put you under protective just comply okay its for your own good whats happened this may mean nothing i have no evidence its anything other than what it seems to be but still its provocative a black dodge charger brandnew the big musclecar variant with that supercharged hemi under the hood was stolen out of a garage in fort worth yesterday its exactly the kind of muscle car that was used in baltimore swagger said hes here hes hunting me either richard told him or someone is on richard and knows what richard knows and whoever it is he doesnt like the velocity theory see nick this proves it has to do with jfk it doesnt prove anything like it it proves a muscle car was stolen maybe its in parts in some chop shop or on the way to a soldier of the zeta cartels garage in nogales or being driven around by a couple of meth heads with chicken feed for brains those are all possibilities and they may be more probable than this slightly improbable car killer whoever he is if he even exists ask james aptapton if he exists so heres what i require you stay put i mean put roomservice pizza and chinese food lots of daytime cable get to know your housekeeping staff that sort of thing meanwhile i am going to put together a task force i want to bring dallas metro in and since it involves cars maybe the texas highway patrol well figure out some kind of sting find a way to expose you under controlled circumstances and when he thinks hes taking youassuming he existswell take him bet he has some interesting beans to spill everything says hes a pro he spills no beans he shuts up takes whatever ride he gets without ratting because he believes his outfit will bust him somewhere along the line maybe not this year but the next those guys have made friends with that kind of math its the price they pay for the chicks and the coke and the respect for being a hard guy nick he wont tell you shit by being here hes already told you everything hes going to tell you ten years in huntsville followed by life in hagerstown that might budge him bob sighed youre thinking like a lawman everythings leverage sometimes you have to send a message thats the best leverage bob im going to have you picked up if you pull any shit you will go down you have to play by our rules on this one it could be a big bust it all goes away if you go cowboy bob saw that nick was bluffing it wasnt so dead the pro would be just as much a trophy as alive particularly if an fbi undercover put him under through nicks supervision and whoever he was his identity would be his true testimony and point to a next step do i have your word please tell me youll set this up fast it takes time coordination between agencies if hes after you hes not going to go away we havent even spotted him yet well put a net around richard and see if he shows if we nail him well move on to the next step i need time from you and sniper patience hell pick up on that in two seconds for gods sake you itll happen late no traffic no pedestrians tomorrow night near dealey in some alley he likes alleys have a rolling team set up get there fast and its your crime scene itll be your kill or your death this guy ran down a decent man who never did a thing except pay his taxes and educate his kids broke his spine in an alley now lets see him try that trick against some real competition i wont lie to you nick im not going to sit here in this goddamn room eating chinese and rereading books for the tenth time its not my nature my nature is the hunt nick said i cant authorize this im your undercover you get all the credit im hanging up i cannot authorize this but you will not pick me up right agh said nick in frustration he hung up swagger went to the closet and removed his small overnight bag from behind the spare blanket feeling the heaviness inside he opened it picking up the stainlesssteel kimber super taking reassurance from the familiar lines of the platform as designed by john m browning over a century ago with its twentythreedegree grip angle its flatness its ergonomic genius of safety and sliderelease placement created in a world where the word ergonomics hadnt been invented it was already cocked and locked for what was the point of having a pistol if you couldnt shoot it fast he knew that nine hardball p winchester grainers were in the mag and a tenth in the chamber bullets that had their own velocity attributes moving out at with enough juice to puncture glass or metal and keep on the straightaway for a killing shot the gun had a familiarity its ancient frame was of the perfect width and boasted the perfect relation of grip to bore so that when it came to hand it went on point naturally bob slipped a speed scabbard a minimalist concealment holster that yielded pistol to draw in a flash on his belt along with a mag pouch that already concealed two mags he cinched his belt then slid the pistol into the holster so that it rested three inches behind the point of his hip but flat against his body he put on his khaki coat to conceal it then he put his lucky dollar in his pocket his lucky dollar was four quarters scotchtaped together in the pocket the four coins supplied steadying weight but if he had to draw hed give it a swat and the heaviness of the coins would pull the coat back and clear and straight presenting the pistol to the same hand that came back to snatch and deploy it then he called richard and told him he had to see him tonight at eleven at the bench outside the book depository chapter the russian saw them two men sitting on the bench by the reflecting pool the book depository was well lit at night from the front so the two were bold and clear in the refracted glow on top of that the russians eyesight was absurdly superior so the details leaped at him no problem telling target from bait target was tall angular he looked like hed been around some been hammered here and there even if his posture was relaxed the russian suspected hed do better than the last one that dish of pudding in the alley the russian was parked out of the lights on houston across from the book depository near the tracks on pacific he had a good angle and he was invisible to them he hunted for signs of wariness but picked up nothing the older man never looked around his body language was not tense he never swallowed or licked his lips all tells of high anxiety he wore a khaki coat a red baseball hat jeans and a pair of boots he was talking earnestly and listening earnestly soon the chat would be over target would get up and in whatever direction he went the russian would follow at a decent interval the trick of the hit was the timing no traffic downtown this late and the police scanning radio indicated no presence of official vehicles in the vicinity the plan was wait for him to cross a street and head down a block then circle that block at speed with good angle control at the corners to beat him to the next intersection get there before him park with lights out when he approached the intersection hed look both ways probably wait until he had the green even though it was an empty weeknight then start across the street find the angle of interception accelerate through him the dodge did zero to sixty in seconds and smash him hard speed should be up to sixtyfive by then at the last second as he turned to the noise hit him with the lights which would visually disorient him and freeze him in place the kill was certain there would be no time to react he waited he waited he waited occasionally a cab pulled by headed to the passengerrich zone of the west end not far away music and light issued from that neighborhood but it meant nothing to the russian he sat in the dark corridor on the dark pavement in the dark car on either side of him two square brick buildings dark as well loomed he had no idea what they were donahue seems to come the closest richard said they sat as if stagelit on the bench near the reflecting pool filled with scope under the shagginess of the overhanging oaks a cool breeze stirred the leaves above to low whispers in the night perfect for talking conspiracy he goes nutty at the end richard continued but its a logical nuttiness hes tried to answer your question why did the third bullet explode his answer is that a secret service man in the follow car with something called an ar brandnew in i dont know what it is rose and accidentally fired after the second shot that was the bullet that hit kennedy and being a thinjacketed highvelocity millimeter round impacting at close range it behaved differently than the much heavier carcano from six times farther out and that it was indeed engineered to explode is that it yes swagger grunted you dont like its hard to believe that a the agent could fire a bullet from an unusuallooking spaceage rifle in front of what two thousand people and that nobody would see it or hear it or b on top of that by the randomness of the universe his muzzle would line up pointed directly at kennedys head its a theory with many difficulties yes as i say discredited youre telling me i guess the point is he has good analysis of the carcano and he was stuck as to a way to explain the behavior of the third bullet that ar what would later be called an m seemed to answer all the questions and it sure as hell was there but he didnt realize it raised more than it answered there is testimony that some people smelled burnt powder in dealey and it would explain the government coverup and why they would never admit that friendly fire killed jfk i cant buy it i acknowledge that gun accidents frequently turn on great anomalies like a thats never before doubled suddenly doubling or a ricochet pattern that you couldnt duplicate in a million years that does happen but here youve got two one at either end of the shot appearing in front of two thousand witnesses and no one saw it as i say many problems still you should read the book and see what you make of the first hundred pages i think it accords with your idea to the degree that i understand it and am capable of making such a judgment great richard richard comes through again you wanted to see me what was it you didnt just want my report i had the idea it was an emergency i get these ideas and get excited heres my new one it has to do with the angles what about the angles its very odd everybody who knows nothing thinks its all about distance close shot easy far shot hard well that aint true and it especially aint true when youre shooting on the deflection deflection no comprendo deflection shooting at a moving target youve got to solve the angle that is find a way to produce not a hit but an interception you have to put the bullet where the thing is going to be its like nobody who wrote about the kennedy assassination ever shot a duck on the wing so its all made up assumptions guesses hunches hmmm said richard interesting all right ill bite tell me what youre getting at bob explained it to richard so does it hold water does it make sense to you i think this is the best one yet how would i check it does it connect with anything else has anyone else thought of this approach jack i love the way you get all into this and how it becomes so important to you that you have to discuss it athe looked at his watchten after midnight offhand it seems new to me i thought you had a photographic memory i thought i did too you are testing the limits of it however so let me think about it overnight maybe do some checking i do have a business to run you know anyhow its late and im no longer a monomaniac like you im just a human so i need sleep ill check you call in the next few days and well get together soon right sorry richard okay swell drop you somewhere no ill get a cab i appreciate the way you humor me without really seeming to humor me your mother raised an honorable man thank you jack okay i know well enough to know that i cant persuade you to accept a ride ill await your call they rose shook hands and separated each heading off in his own darkness the russian watched the tall one crossed houston and headed up elm into the high buildings of downtown it seemed he had a limp as if someone had taken a hard shot at his hip there had to be a story behind that it slowed the old man considerably and the russian winced at the clear discomfort the man felt while on the go the russian waited for him to drag his wretched bent old body along until it disappeared behind the corner of the building to his left waited twenty seconds then turned on his lights drove slowly and under control to elm and turned left he could see the tall man half a block ahead sending out vibrations of painful imprecision but at the same time holding not a care for security in his mind lost in whatever internal drama consumed him limping along the russian timed it perfectly made certain not to look at the man since some people have a weird gift for feeling the presence of anothers eyes upon them reached him just as he was at the corner and turned left he drove at under thirty to the next block turned right at the corner and hammered it aware only marginally that he was on the railroad tracks of pacific avenue shooting up to sixtyfive in three seconds to reach the next corner found the ideal angle and hardly lost a mile an hour on his controlled righthand burn around the corner then pulled up in the block with the intersection a hundred feet or so ahead of him and halted downshifting to neutral putting his lights out all was fine it was no problem at all he waited he waited he waited time sometimes goes slow on the hunt but at last his quarry arrived ambling into view at the same distracted old mans pace disfigured by the limp so that he had an odd comic bearing the russian cracked a rare smile at the old mans funny walk the russian also had a gift for instantly computing interception angles he knew not to go to the pedal at the mans first step into the street or even the second he had time to check for beams from oncoming traffic out of sight and he noted there wasnt any traffic at the targets third step he got the gocode from his deep brain and rammed the car into first controlling the clutch with a virtuosos touch and a split second later a really fast throw into second as the cars horses roared into high gallop and got there as fast as anything on earth except a straight custom drag the sound of the engine eating gas with a basso profundo growl and alchemizing it instantly into speed filled the air the car lurched ahead so powerfully it turned the hard edges of reality into a blur swagger had the gun in his hand along his right leg hidden behind his comically exaggerated limp and at the roar losing no time on surprise none on regret nada on indecision and in his purekiller move beautiful and stoic and allamerican gunman he pivoted and because smooth is fast slid the gun up so smooth it moved at a rate that has no place in time and his subconscious acquired the front sight exactly as it came to center driversside windshield and the pistols double tap lasted but a tenth of a second recoil not fast enough to catch up to fully firing fasttwitch muscles of the trigger pull even as one muzzle flash became another and two pieces of hot brass spewed from the ramjet breech eight inches apart the windshield yielded instantly into a haze of microfracture the car careened right ate up the curb hit a building with the sound of metal crunching flipped and roared on its beautiful glossy black flank along the sidewalk chewing up pavement spraying sparks and stone debris ripping sheets of window out of storefronts its hood bending and twisting like a burning piece of paper at last halting in a heap of twisted steel with the stench of gasoline tendrils of steam and smoke arising from several wounds in the body and engine well in the quiet that followed swagger slipped the gun into his holster and grabbed his cell memphis came the quick answer im at elm and north market hes piled up to the right on the sidewalk no citizen collateral all of it clean get your team here fast and get me the fuck out of town what happened to him nick said bring a body bag said swagger and a mop part ii mockba what it is aint exactly clear chapter moscow it was a perfect twilight in utopia as couples strolled children frolicked lovers squeezed dogs yipped and intellectuals theorized in the park off ukrainski boulevard they glided with the radiant happiness of those who were happy to be who they were where they were when they were life its good seemed to be the prevailing ethos lights winked in the soft darkness more show than anything else for in this urban playing field there was no crime or very little nearly full employment and low taxes the dark for once concealed the construction frenzy of backhoes bulldozers and cranes as daytime moscow reconstructed itself for about the thirtieth time in its long and convoluted history this time giving capitalism a good shot even as the citizens ebbed and flowed through and around all the projects dashing nimbly to avoid being crushed either by the errant construction machine or that jetblack gleaming ferrari whistling down the cobblestones at ninety per meanwhile observing without comment stone or steel men in greatcoats with those clamshell world war ii helmets and the old red tommy guns with their signature ventilated barrels and gangsterstyle seventyoneround drums stood fifteen feet tall every block or two as if unsure whether this was what all their fighting and dying had protected and made possible flanked by the ninestory banks of the kutuzovsky apartment complex and nestled under trees the restaurant khachapuri was operating at full meat ahead it was a place that specialized in animal parts on sticks they arrived glistening yet crisp with the fat broiled out of them by raw flame chunks of pure protein whose odor filled the air and made one think of cossack camps along the don after a good day massacring tsarist infantry in about the restaurant itself had a cossack quality as it was an openair tent affiliated with the kitchen of a bar in the building across the sidewalk and a gathering place for those of the new generation seeking sustenance vodka and comradeship at which it excelled in providing swagger of course couldnt try the vodka knowing hed end up in siberia with a new uzbek wife and nine children plus some really cool tattoos he wasnt hungry though the meat smells touched some primal thing in him and the comradeship he sought was of a particular kind he leaned alone at the bar drinking koka as cocacola was called here in the capital city and watching the proceedings with a wary eye not quite willing to buy in to it something held him back history perhaps his own as well as his countrys and his cultures it was hard to believe hed been nurtured to hate all these people and theyd turned out to be so beautiful energetic and happy gee folks he thought glad we didnt blow you to nuclear shreds in about that would have been a big mistake it was his second day in moscow the first hed spent wandering from his room at the metropol onto red square and around the area and being stunned for the first time by the sheer joy of the city a dusty ramshackle stillmakeshiftafteryears place the ranks of stalinist apartment buildings with their dour exteriors and their ancient memories of tears and slaughter all had been invaded by retail at the ground level and boasted gaudy signals of various frivolous goods every luxury car and perfume and fashion designer known to man in at least seven points on the horizon brandnew dallases of steel and chrome pierced the sky lording over the fivestory flatness of the nowdead communist reality at their feet it was a true goldrush city even if over a millennium old and the site of a massacre hall of fame he couldnt get over how the place throbbed he saw her then she had the smart tough look of a journalist nothing to her of show or pretense just a kind of irony playing through her eyes under her american hairstyle she wore pants and a black tshirt as fitted the warm weather and looked comfortable among the natives ms reilly im swagger oh she said the great swagger nice to meet a hero handshakes tight smiles a little awkwardness im just a beatup goat trying to stay on the wagon around all this potato juice he said the russians do squish a nice potato here ill get us seated he followed her to the maitre ds station and the maitre d in turn led them through the tent past family and office parties of swilling laughers and carnivores to a smallish table at the margins of the place which looked out on the recreations of the vast parkland crosscut with walkers on both two and four legs and other sorts of relaxed civilians you werent followed he asked this is exciting she said no ones ever asked me that before no i dont think so the russians dont follow american reporters anymore theyre much more interested in making money so ive heard anythings for sale in moscow anything she said what about rent he said see i want to rent the lubyanka for a night she laughed good luck with that you must know oligarchs since i dont know what an oligarch is i dont know if i know any what are they by the way i saw that word in the englishlanguage paper rich guys tycoons billionaires conspicuous consumers mostly exkgb goons they were buddies with yeltsin in and when he dismantled the state economic apparatus they butted their way to the head of the line and got all the pie in short order they became megarich pie pie pie all day long now they drive around in goldplated limos marry flight attendants buy american sports teams try to get on page and generally run the place abramovich krulov alekperov vekselberg ixovich one of em is married to yeltsins daughter as a matter of fact will and i did a story on them petonin tarkio a couple more i cant think of the names would be lost on me anyhow but it sounds typical thats how headquarters towns always work anyhow nice of you to meet me how couldnt i i did some checking and if half the rumors are true its like meeting john wayne and ted williams and audie murphy in one man plus your daughter says youre a teddy bear it was through his daughter nikki a tv news reporter in washington that swagger had effected a meetup with kathy reilly the washington posts correspondent in moscow the waitress came and the reporter consulted the menu which essentially consisted of meat with more meat some other kinds of meat some usual meat some unusual meat and of course meat kathy reilly ordered some meat so youre working for the fbi is that right she said more or less thats what nikki believes thats what the russians believe but they also believe my name is jerry homan and that im a special agent i have all the credentials and diplomatic okays to back it up i did meet with the state departmentfbi liaison guy at our embassy and he thinks im who i say i am wow undercover stuff this is turning into something glamorous whats it all about short version i was asked to look into the death of a man in baltimore by hitandrun hed just returned from dallas where hed been asking pointed questions i went to dallas and asked the same pointed questions sure enough someone tried to kill me hitandrun it didnt work out for him i take it not exactly fortunately id contacted an fbi agent in dallas a fine man with whom ive worked before and he agreed to run me as a contract undercover even though i was the one who brought it to him it was a thin fiction but it held up then it turned out that the fellow who tried to kill me was what you might call a trophy russian mafioso associated with something called the izmaylovskaya gang here okay now im impressed that bad huh very bad this character was wanted by interpol all over europe he was wanted by the moscow police and he had relocated to a coney island outpost of the izmaywhatsit empire and was doing jobs for them and freelancing technically im here to try to find out from this end who he was working for not which family but who contracted with that family either here or in new york to hire him and for what reason ive got an appointment with a top russian gang cop in a few days to try to get some dope we may talk to some snitches and so forth you dont want to get too close to the izmaylovskaya boys take it from me she said im just going to ask some polite questions and go on my way no need to mix it up with the locals sound policy i will tell you and you didnt hear it from me that the oligarch krulov is said to be most intimately associated with the izmaylovskayas his enemies had a way of disappearing or getting hit by vagrant untraceable cars krulov said swagger marking it down internally the dinner arrived it appeared to be meat there were also suspicious vegetables which swagger avoided and some soups equally menacing he did enjoy the animal he ate whatever species it might have been however it died its very good he said she said you needed a favor it happens that this is a perfect time my husband is in siberiano i didnt send him hes covering an oil conferenceand im sort of at loose ends with only thumbsuckers due so i can take you around introduce you to people if you want im not sure you should be seen with me these people are serious thats why i asked to meet after dark close to home at a loud public place do you think i just dont know i do know if you look into russian mafia you can get dead all of a sudden i might have some skills that would help me get out of a tight dangerous situation but unless youve had a lot of seal training i doubt that you do not unless its slipped my mind nikki says you speak russian well but that you read it very well i can get by on the streets i read it like a native im trying to get hold of some records copies wont work i have to see the actual files and try to determine to what if any degree theyve been tampered with im hoping youll read them for me or at least scan them i hope to arrange it discreetly so youll be in no danger of exposure is that a possibility i suppose it is what are you looking for the russian james bond he said circa i can feel him i can recognize his talent his imagination his will his decisiveness his creativity he was their top agent and in its possible he pulled off the operation of the century ive come to moscow for him it was another box of a building this one much bigger no bricks some sort of yellow stucco maybe ten stories tall with all the early twentieth or late nineteenthcentury gewgaws like pillars and arches and stone window frames its flat roof festooned with radio communications antennas and it was gigantic about a block wide a huge chunk of real estate eating up land on an empty moscow circle a mile from red square thats it huh swagger asked in the flesh or in yellow stucco source of evil source of cunning source of murder violence conspiracy treachery torture its a very bad place you did not want to make people in that building angry with you i get it nothing military in there said mikhail stronski its all secretagent spy shit games in games in games always fucking people up it was the lubyanka former home of the cheka gpu ogpu mgb nkvd and kgb and now fsb during the purges many were hauled here from swaggers polished luxury hotel the metropole which in the thirties housed the wreckers and oppositionists of comintern and in lubyankas cellars they were shot behind the ear no one knew what became of the bodies maybe they were still there its hard to hate a building said swagger this one no problem stronksi was a heavyset man with a glowering face that seemed like a map of easternbloc misfortune he had wintry gray eyes under wintry gray hair and heavy bones and looked as if he could crush a diamond between his fingers or at least fracture it a little bit he had a bears body yet at fiftyseven he moved with surprising grace he had been in the same business as swagger but his outfit was called spetsnaz and he practiced the trade in afghanistanfiftysix kills an american gun writer whod come to russia to do a feature on the new russian sniper rifle the mm ksvk had found him and interviewed him swagger saw the story contacted the gun writer got the email address and a recommendation and reached out across the ocean to another highgrass crawler another brother of the oneshot kill another infiltrator and exfiltrator who knew too much about certain things but would never speak of them stronski had heard of swaggerit was a small world after allso the two men were a natural fit having killed for a king whom they later doubted having lost too many good friends for a cause that now seemed to mean nothing in the world yet sought for certain recondite skills that never go out of fashion this woman shes okay stronski asked shes not of our world which i like no games to her i havent told her everything thats tonight but she reads your language as well as a native i love her already and shes supersmart and tough itll be fine if i can get her to feel secure like all americans shell fear the building the two sat in an elegant restaurant called spy for the irony irony was as new to moscow as capitalism that fronted dzerzhinsky square and lurked three hundred yards across the circle from the lubyanka they were on the balcony of the third floor eating blintzes and caviar and cold slices of salmon stronski throwing down vodka swagger trying to keep up with oldfashioned water we fear that building too a good young fellow named tibolotsky good operator brave as hell spotted for me in the mountains he voiced doubts about the war he was fighting it his right no someone informs kgb and young fellow is disappeared wrong for him to fight so hard and end up in cell or worse that is why i hate bastards so goddamn much the politicals were always assholes bob said i lost a spotter and politicals were involved any apparatus in the world the politicals are assholes its true said stronski youve made the arrangements i have you have the cash smuggled in in my shoe you trust this fellow i do not because hes brave but because in moscow corruption is like any commodity he has to deliver or it gets out and new business goes to the competition so the market guarantees this lieutenantcolonel will shoot straight and deliver not his own honesty of which of course he has none if stronski says yes i say yes i trust stronski i am as crooked as all of them i extend certain courtesies to brother sniper thats all fair enough now put your hand under table and receive receive what you will see swagger received it felt like a glock loaded from the weight three or fourinch barrel no but nevertheless substantial in feel and lethal in purpose the slide was steel though ceramically finished for dullness and durability the frame some sort of superpolymer he held it out of sight under the table and looked down and saw that it was a nearglock dark and blunt no safety nothing to catch or pull on fast removal it was a generation more streamlined than glocks stolid teutonic brick and its ergonomics were better it slid into rather than fought his hand he turned it and saw the marking in cyrillic and under that in english on the slide ixgroup mm he slid it into his belt behind the point of his hip under the coat i have enemies maybe they get on to you from me moscow is full of bad people you can never tell that gun freshly stolen from factory no serial number if you get in trouble use and ditch it cant be traced its not a glock gsh better than glock eighteen in magazine double action from the instrument design bureau kpb in tula manufactured by ixgroup meaning rich guy named ixovich one of our new big oligarchs just learned the word they made their plans you couldnt help but love the metropole the famous old hotel where swagger had booked himself rich in history it was alsoat least in the new moscowrich in appointments possibly restored to something like prerevolutionary glory everywhere glitter glass shiny brass marble full of beautiful people even the whores sitting in the bar were highclass yet swagger tried to see it as it had been in when it housed for a few troubling weeks the melancholy lee harvey oswald as the russians tried to figure out what to do with him in those days before the fall of the reds and the infusion of finnish capital the hotel must have been a dump smelling of cabbage vodka and sewage dour and dank and grim it fit the selfexiled american perfectly a man with a dismal past and not much future whod as yet impressed nobody in his short life when he got to his room swagger found that oswald wouldnt go away the little hangdog mutt radiating anger and selfpity tracked him at every stop in the classy room that in dumpier days could have housed the wouldbe defector the whole thing turned on him didnt it you couldnt ask why there was no point in asking why the only question had to be how dont think of him as a man swagger instructed himself think of him as an agent a servomechanism some anonymous hinge in history that did what he did and you have to figure out how he did it it wasnt as simple as waking up one day and deciding to kill the president there were too many factors involved and too many questions to answer swagger wished he had vodka he wished he had a cigarette many a man had gotten through a bad night in the metropole on vodka and cigarettes maybe oswald himself as the bosses figured out his immediate fate little fucker who would have guessed dont think about that swagger ordered himself again think only of the how dont waste your time on his feckless difficult personality his pitiful upbringing his learning problems his attitude problems his bullying problems his endless string of smalltime failures his temperament his vanity and narcissism as all are on record anyone can look up lee harvey oswald and conclude that he was exactly the type of lazy loser who might abandon the ongoing parade of nothingness that would be his life in exchange for eternal notoriety instead lets stick to the how of the act not did he do it but could he do it swagger tried to make contact with him through the only vessel that connected them the one he loved and oswald hated the united states marine corps after all oswald was a trained rifleman as his scores attested particularly in the sitting position similar to the position he fired from in the book depository similar but not exact different stresses different angles different muscles involved and while some skills are transferable position to position some are not his trainingwhich after all had been five full years previouswas entirely restricted to the ironsighted m garand rifle swagger remembered his own m even to the serial number built by harrington amp richardson oswalds had to be about the same a nineandahalfpound semiauto with wellcalibrated aperture sights heavy recoil and no necessary manipulation between shots both men had to master the fundamentals as universally the marine corps does a good job of building them in swagger presumed oswald had mastered the most basic of basics solid position boneonbone support sling management focus on sights trigger squeeze breath control would that be enough for one shot possibly but he missed his first not his last shot baffling you would think it the opposite because after the first shot its all new again hes got to manipulate the bolt which takes him out of position hes got to refind the position on the fly hes got to reassert his concentration his breath control his trigger squeeze rather than fighting him the carcano with its cheapjack japanese sights is overresponsive to his commands because it is so much lighter than the garand at under six pounds then he has to reacquire the target through the lens of the scope and since garands arent scoped hes used to seeing the target in his peripheral vision as he brings the recoiling rifle back toward it on the shooting range with the carcano after the first shot he is looking at blur so he has to do two things quickly first of all he has to refind the proper eye position so hes able to see through it clearly and then he has to reacquire the target which being transported by vehicle at unknown speed is in a different place still swagger had to admit much of this is instinctive and a relatively competent marinetrained shooter such as oswald especially with a little practice time ought to be able to bring it off it was not likely he made the shot but it was at least possible you couldnt deny that reality still the scope presented a whole host of problems for example the fbi gun expert robert frazier testified that when the rifle and scope arrived in fbi hq on tuesday november the plate holding the scope to the rifle was extremely loose moreover it was secured to the receiver by only two screws although the metal of both the scope and the rifle receiver had been machined to accept four why was the scope loose was that the condition under which oswald fired the rifle frazier testified that he assumed it had been loosened in dallas for fingerprinting that is disassembled fingerprinted then reassembled somewhat haphazardly yet no inquiry to lieutenant carl day the dallas fingerprint expert was ever made so it is unknown in what condition day received the rifle it seemed odd that day would have disassembled the rifle because he was a salty old pro and would have known it was highly unlikely to find prints on the few centimeters of metal that the scope rings covered and that the integrity of the piece as a whole was more important it was also unlikely that had he disassembled the rifle he would have reassembled it haphazardly it wasnt his nature swagger knew that the screwtightness issue was important because the looser the scope the more it deviates from the point of impact at each shot it resets itself even a slightly loose scope equates to misses in the field so a remarkably loose scope would make accurate shooting almost impossible however at a certain point the fbi was required to make accuracy tests with the rifle according to everything swagger had read the rifle could not be zeroedthat is its point of aim indexed to its point of impactunder any circumstances as it was presented to the fbi shooters a machinist had to grind out two spacerscalled shimsthat were inserted at some point between the mount and the receiver or between the ring and the scope to provide extra metal that would align the scope at an angle otherwise unattainable then the whole thing was tightened up for shooting if that was so it was highly improbable that oswald lacking those adjustments could have hit the head shot bugliosi suggested that it was a moot point since oswald would have diverted to the iron sights he was used to from his garand experience highly unlikely the nonadjustable battle sights on the model were set to the anticipated distance of engagement which was three hundred meters to hit the small and diminishing target in the back of the limo with iron sights oswald would have had to know the distance would have needed much experience discovering the relationship of the point of impact to the point of aim would have had to display unusually sound to say nothing of quick math skills in estimating how much below the target he would have to hold to hit at feet with sights regulated to feet known where that spot was on the blank of the limo trunk behind the presidentit would have been a low hold a very low holdand squeezed off the shot precisely very few people could make that shot on the first try sitting there in his room vodkaless and cigaretteless swagger came to a conclusion it was not impossible but was highly unlikely that the shot could have been made by oswald and that led him to another key question why did oswalds shooting over the course of the engagement as his own desperation increased and the distances expanded improve radically same meat different restaurant this one was a sort of porch to a classic oldmoscow property on a busy downtown street openair and the patrons sat on cushions instead of chairs lounging like pashas as the skewers loaded with animal were brought along with spices and other vivid treats hookahs were available and the russians not having received the cancer memo yet greedily sucked on them or on cigarettes meanwhile just outside a backhoe struggled with the hard earth to get into the restaurant you had to walk on a wooden board over the shattered concrete if the backhoe happened to squash you it wasnt your day it was like a panzer out there hard to ignore sorry im late said swagger showing up at five after the hour its not a problem said kathy reilly putting away her blackberry were you followed she laughed i wish my days are so routine a little excitement like that couldnt hurt it could he said and i hope to spare you that you were followedby me thats why im late i tailed you back to your building a few nights ago then picked you up tonight as you left and was with you on the subway and everything ii never saw you she said a little nonplused i followed you to see if anyone else was following you the answer both the first time and tonight was no so were clean i think we can continue if youll still play oh sure she said its so cold war i love it have you arranged for the files absolutely i know theyll be there great and where is there the ninth floor they centralized their archives a few years ago with the idea of moving them all to digitalization but the budget never caught up so its still old paper some of it a century or two old very delicate fortunately we dont have to do a lot of digging were just going to look at one month one year you said september maybe october maybe november of thats right and where is this archive ninth floor of lubyanka he waited her eyes stayed calm maybe fell out of focus for a fraction of a second then returned to the fullon gaze i take it youre not joking no please it takes some getting used to youll have to explain were not parachuting onto the roof or shooting our way in were not blowing a vault or tunneling up from underground were traveling by that glamorous transportation means called the elevator i dont money ive bribed through my friend stronski an svr lieutenant colonel to show you how serious i am about this im giving him forty thousand american cash mine not the fbis mine hardearned swagger you spent forty thousand dollars of your own money on this i did id do it again i gave a woman my word id look into the death of her husband i aint near where i have to be on that one theres other issues too anyhow to me the money dont mean a thing ill spend it all if i have to i gave my word i got myself engaged and maybe theres some other memories yelling at me ill do what i have to do crazy with honor is the phrase that comes to mind did you step out of a thirties movie ms reilly i dont know enough to know what a thirties movie would be i only know what ive got to do you are so insane its kind of impressive maybe so anyhow enough on me lets get back to tomorrow let me tell you if stronski says its guaranteed its guaranteed its safe he explained the details the lieutenant colonel himself will give us id badges and escort us to the ninth floor he will show us where we need to be we have six hours no photos no notes all by memory what were looking for isnt that big a deal as i say the russian james bond we have to find out if he visited or worked in the mexico city embassy in september through november of see she said thats the other thing i know it is you see what this is about i know lee harvey oswald went to the mexico city russian embassy sometime in trying to get a visa or something he failed i guess i think its all been looked at it has over and over again a man named norman mailer even managed to interview all the kgb people and examine the records theres nothing there case closed history reclaimed end of story thats what i believed too until a few weeks ago and now you believe a russian james bond killed jfk no i dont know enough to believe anything i will tell you however why i think that ifi do say ifthere was some kind of game being played it had to be played through the russians maybe in a big way maybe in a small way the waiter cleared the plates she ordered a vodka tonic i think ill need this he stuck with koka a few weeks ago a piece of information came to me it was too mundane for anyone to have made up there was no profit in it and it was transferred over the years through completely normal workaday people none of them troublesome in any way all of them sane productive middleclass it was about a treadprint on the back of a coat stupid huh briefly it suggested that a rifle may have been present in something called the daltex building in november daltex is right across the street from the book depository and its windows give virtually the same angle on the limo on elm street as the sixthfloor snipers nest of the book depository the treadprint suggested the presence of someone i know about who was a superb rifleman he would be the second gunman possibly just barely possibly but the coat could have also been owned by an oldboy texas pheasant hunter and it was his daughters bicycle that put the treadprint there still worth investigating so that was what the man went to dallas to investigate then he got killed then you went to dallas and a russian tried to kill you is that how the russians come into this possibly its another indicator that somehow in this thing all lines of possibility run through russia but the fact that the guy who tried to kill me was russian wasnt the thing i zeroed on what ive done is ive tried to isolate hard data points from the warren commission report that is the things that we know happened times dates places all multiply verified and ive tried to triangulate from that a possible scenario by which someone besides oswald could have been involved i have worked hard trying to find the intersection of certain streams of information that were necessary for anyone trying to kill kennedy if i can find a place and a time where all the lines come together that would be the place to start my only technique is trial and error try this try that try something else believe me i aint no genius but ive come to something and that something has to be at the soviet embassy in mexico city in the late fall of tell me wait the vodka hasnt arrived if im going to spend ten years sunbathing in the gulag archipelago ill want to know why he waited composing his thoughts the vodka and the new koka came she took a swig very good the world is nicely blurred please proceed if anything of a conspiratorial nature happened bob said it had to have sprung from the intersection by chance of five elements i say elements they tell me its a lousy word because it means stuff thats because the five things are different in nature and no word other than stuff collects them all im listening the first four are pieces of information three are related but separated in time one is completely unrelated from left field and it arrives real late the fifth isnt information at all its a personality okay i can follow that and i get lost in agatha christie much less le carre first bit of information someone had to know that a man named lee harvey oswald existed and that he was kind of a pathetic screwball with dreams of glory that his sad little life couldnt possibly support who would know that his mom his poor wife the second thing they had to know was that he had homicidal tendencies he was violent it went with his loser personality they must have known that he had a rifle with a telescopic sight and that on april he had taken a shot at and missed major general edwin a walker i think i remember that walker was a rightwing general who had just resigned in scandal when it was learned he was indoctrinating his troopsthe twentyfourth infantry division in germanywith john birch propaganda he was briefly notorious as a civilian he was even more annoying to many people he gave speeches he made accusations he showed up at various civil rights demonstrations and was violently segregationist he called kennedy pink the whole nine yards okay oswald took a shot someone mysterious and conspiratorial knows that the third thing they had to know was that he worked in a building on elm street in dallas texas called the texas book depository but since he didnt start working until october they couldnt have known until then who is they thats where were going who would care enough about this little schnook to record those pieces of information the fbi questioned him the cia debriefed him but both dismissed him as a twerp unlikely to be of any consequence they had no idea about the walker shooting i have you the late piece of information was that on the afternoon of tuesday november the dallas times herald announced that jfk was going to be parading down elm street in front of the texas book depository at twelve thirty in the afternoon on friday two and a half days later remember thisthey couldnt possibly find oswald in that short amount of time and they couldnt possibly have predicted that kennedy would pass within seventyfive feet of this screwball so you ask who knew all that about oswald not the fbi not the cia i know the answer i know what you want me to say of course the russians hed been to them hed begged them to take him back he said hed do anything for them im sure he bragged about the shot hed taken at walker as the proof of his willingness to serve they knew they had to know but all that was in september he didnt start at the depository as i say until october howd they know he was working there over a month later i dont know this is where the russian james bond factors in the fifth element hmm she said someone who would see the potential in oswald after the walker shot and establish a clandestine communication so he would be uptodate he would know oswald was working at the depository see i see theoretically we need a certain personality actually i say james bond but im being inaccurate james bond is an operator we dont need an operator what we need is a case officer do you know what a case officer is ive heard the term but thats about it he would be the guy like the movie producer he has the vision he sees the possibilities he sets the goal his talent is putting a team together to get the job done he keeps everybody focused he adjudicates he administers he finances he hires he fires hes the tough guy not the creative guy he does logistics he gets everybody there when they have to be there he figures out cover stories escape routes all the petty details that the specialists are too good for hes the guy who makes it happen hes the guy were looking for she said nothing heres what im seeing maybe this isnt exactly how it happened but im guessing its close oswald does his crybaby number for the kgb and of course is laughingly turned down ha ha what a schmuck but theres this guymaybe hes gru or some other branch of the apparatusand he hears about oswald particularly the part about trying to hit general walker and unlike the stooges he thinks you know this guy has possibilities so he tracks him down in mexico city which would be easy as theres a whole sunday september when we dont know what oswald did he says speaking in russian lingo that would astound lee say comrade let me buy you a beer he says you know they all think youre a loser but id like to give you a chance if you want that chance you have to clean up your act none of this letterstotheeditor bullshit none of this fair play for cuba bullshit none of this reading the party newspaper in the cafeteria you get a job you live straight you work hard you put your radical past behind you your goal is to get a job in the next ten years in aeronautics defense hightech engineering medicine something where you can do us some good can you do that oswald is flattered nobodys ever trusted him before thought he was worth a damn yeah sure he says the guy says look im giving you an address you can send me a letter there any place i am in the world i will get that letter quickly now go home get to work and keep me uptodate oswald goes home he gets the book depository job dear comrade i am now gainfully employed at the book depository at blahblah elm street my plan is to remain here five years complete high school be a success put all crazy radical childishness behind me and then maybe begin some college as a way of getting into the sectors you need me to be in yours truly comrade lee harvey oswald our guys got one of those caseofficer minds that doesnt forget anything it happens the really talented guys have them when he finds out kennedys going to dallas he thinks of lee harvey and when he sees the routetwo and a half days beforehe sees hes got the chance of a lifetime hell never have another chance like this he flies to dallas he meets lee on that thursday he says youve got to do this comrade but would kgb see maybe its rogue maybe he knows the general committee would never say yes too risky but he doesnt see it as risky at all and he can take out a guy whos making noise in vietnam and putting pressure on cuba and looking for a place to draw a line in the sand and replace him with a texas guy who knows nothing about foreign policy and just wants to be the next fdr its easy as pie he can do it she said it sounds original but i dont know enough to point out your errors oh theyre there for one thing this whole thing started with someone looking at the daltex as the site for another rifle so if theres another rifle theres a complex ballisticdeceit issue involved ill spare you the details but no one could have figured out the complexities of it recruited another shooter found him the place to shoot and gotten him in and out without a hitch in two days not even the greatest case officer in the world it cant be done thats the crucial issue of the assassination how did they set it up so fast the route wasnt known until the nineteenth i just cant get by that maybe she started then no i dont know anyhow thats why im here thats why im hoping youll help me theres not much else i can say ms reilly i told you its so coldwar how could i turn it down maybe maybe maybe somewhere down the line theres a story in it for me if theres a story youll get it was she sold enough to do the job which after all was only scanning old files looking for records of visits by soviet intelligence personnel to one embassy over a relatively short period of time nothing to it chapter the russian spoke stronski translated you will not be challenged you may run into others in there for the library is never empty they are simply other spies whove paid the same price for their few hours of gnawing at the scraps of history they will not see you nor should you see them the officer led them to a dedicated passagewayno other entries were placed along its way except at the endand to that last door again it had that old commie look the steel the harsh lights behind cages girders with rivets everywhere the smell of paint and iron the sense of muscular even brutal industrialism as aggression the officer did discover a bright plastic keypad selflit a concession to the modern era his fingers flew across the pad and the door clanked ajar he led them into a final chamber this one had a sense of hospital to it the officer pointed to a box of freshpressed surgical green utilities and they pulled them on over their clothes a mask slipped over nostrils and mouth a rubberized surgical cap to contain the hair gloves came next rubberized as well tight and thin to handle the delicate papers when they were sealed off in their operatingtheater garments the officer took them through a last door and they felt the temperature drop twenty degrees swagger blinked to adjust his vision to the greenish hues it seemed they were on a metal balcony of some sort restrained by a railing from a twentyfoot drop to the floor of the place itself a vast hushed space with metal racks on two levels cut by steel stairways running this way and that the whole thing seeming to extend to infinity or whatever was beyond the realm of the greenish lights on the far side of the opening clearly the cavern occupied the entire eighth and ninth floors swagger beheld the belly of the red beast a vast room with crude steel shelving sustaining boxes each box labeled and containing a forced mass of good old paperandink documents how many coups how many deceits how many black ops how many wet ops how many pix of fat diplomats with whores sucking their cocks how many assassinations all chronicled here so it wasnt a belly it was a memory a part of the brain loaded with forgotten info hard to access buried deeply away barely acknowledged sixtythree mexico the russian officer said swagger nodded okay you come he led them downstairs and into the maze of twoleveled shelving turning so many times that hansel and gretel would have become lost now and then another pilgrim would pass in the green night without acknowledgment the officer turned at last down an aisle no different from any others he spoke in russian to stronski who translated he says during duty hours clerks process requests from svr or army intelligence officers of rank take the box find the file check it out and present to officer who can only read in reading room also on ninth floor you do not have it so easy you will have to find your own files pull your own documents sorry for dust sorry light is not good sorry no place to sit no bathroom no coke machine the two americans nodded the russian spoke again through stronski rules once again no pictures no notes no xerox machine all must be memory replace everything delicacy please no tugging no folding no forcing you must respect the material and make allowances for its age and brittleness you are interviewing an old man and his attention may wander do you see you yourself do not wander do not leave this area do only business you have paid for be honest diligent and bring glory on your cause whatever it is i will come get you in four hours ask him said bob if this is all agencies including im guessing not only kgb but gru as well as specialized military teams or just kgb the russian listened and in time responded i dont know the idea initially was to consolidate all by hemisphere and target country all of it in one place so that access would be better and those who had to know could find all from one area but budget ran out before it could be completed and i am not certain if consolidation project got to or not also this is only offensive materials that is initiatives generated by heroes of the past defensivethat is counterespionage in response to something done by main target and otherswould be on different floor that is not so interesting just notes of suspects being followed wiretaps being uncovered traitors found and executed would i be able to get in there at some later date asked swagger i will take it up with committee the officer answered then laughed at his own joke all things are possible for a man with cash in his pockets excellent said swagger i will see you in four hours said the officer not a second longer they worked on their knees as if in genuflection to the material before them station alpha read the marking on the box that would be it the mexico city kgb reports that year that place stronski removed the box and set it on the floor for inspection and they crowded in close this as much as anything was what bob had come for to see the thing to check it for evidence of tampering he bent and looked at the cardboard box full of papers all held in coherence by a red ribbon illuminated in the beam from stronskis flashlight bob went lower looked carefully at the knot has it been untied and retied a lot he asked his two colleagues closed in as well i can see the wornflat signature on two of the intersecting ribbons that suggest it was untied once said reilly but it doesnt look as if its been subject to chronic tying and retying im guessing that when norman mailer was here in or thats the last time the box was opened they untied it found and removed the oswald reports from the kgb goons and took those to him in the reading room does anybody see signs of disturbance since then all looked as stronski rotated the beam across the messy surface of the raggedly stuffedin paperwork tatters and flags stuck out unevenly a corner or two peeped out at the edges stronski gently ruffled the uneven edges as though pushing his hand through sheaves of wheat and fluffy clouds of fine dust puffed outward roiling in the flashlight beam it does not appear to have been disturbed recently said swagger everybody agree let me compare with others said stronski and leaped up with his flashlight and walked a few feet making random examinations he returned it is same dust chaos paper disintegrating at the edges okay said swagger now what do we see i can see divisions im guessing by month said reilly do we start with september when oswald showed up that makes the most sense said swagger reilly pointed to the appropriate cardboard separator that demarcated the adventures of september and he pulled it out as gently as possible amid more clouds of dust and flecks of disintegration as the paperat least at its edgeseased toward oblivion three sheaves extended a bit from the more neatly collected mass of april reports they were an obvious starting point he pulled them out and held them open she examined the first this is just the september report by kostikov on his immediate discussion with oswald its been published by mailer i have the book standard stuff would you do me the favor of examining this one for any info that mailer might not have published or missed sure she read it carefully i dont see anything anything on claims or boasts by oswald no his intensity comes through his seething anger his disappointment that they dont greet him like a brother but theres no specific dialogue or claims youre sure absolutely swagger considered this carefully but is there a transcript no she said its based on notes not recordings okay fine i get it lets go to the next one he slid the next file over and her eyes attacked it this is a report by nechiporenko another kgb the next day on the disposition of the case the rejection oswalds anger and unpleasantness please read for any indications of boasts or claims no nothing but there is a second page she read it her eyes scanning hard behind her glasses as stronski tried to keep the light steady okay this is a summary by a third kgb im guessing the boss his name is yatskov hes a jock oswald comes back a second time saturday the twentyeighth shows up at the kgbgru volleyball game and yatskov is there and takes him into his office oswald is beside himself by this time god he even pulls a gun yatskov takes it from him and the idiot collapses crying on the desk the only thing that yatskov can do is tell him to submit for a visa through regular channels and no he cant get in contact with the cubans for him meanwhile nechiporenko shows up and pitches in then yatskov gives him the gun back and leads him out pathetic no boasts no claims why is that important i have to know what he told them about himself that might be interesting to the james bond guy im looking for the gun doesnt that signify something possibly but no transcripts no specific language nothing like that no okay then thats that next move we scan start to finish looking for visitors to the embassy by that i mean intelligence professionals not assigned to it but arriving and departing around the same time the last week in september kgb but also gru or military as well smersh even why not maybe there were units of intelligence i dont know about connected with the air force or strategic warfare or signals intelligence intelligence outfits are like mushrooms they grow in the dark and thrive in shit said reilly i thought i made that line up but i guess i didnt are you ready both nodded mikhail you hold the light i will pull the documents one at a time and turn the pages kathy you tell me when you have the gist of the page and we can go on that was what they did for three hours with breaks for sore knees eye fatigue backaches and on and on it was not fun it seemed to last six or nine rather than three hours finally she reached her verdict agriculture reps diplomats doctors lawyers but nobody is in the official record as a case officer an agent a recruiter nobody who seemed remotely like an operator maybe the russians used codes within their own topsecret documents and when i see dr menshav the agronomics professor that means boris badanov special assassin but i doubt it i doubt it too they had done all of september then the october and november files through the assassination that event produced its own tonnage of paper and demanded its own box but swagger saw no point in looking at it since everything after the fact was meaningless no sign of james bond said reilly no sign of any cogitation activity meetings anything that would suggest the embassy was anticipating or knew that someone in its own sphere was involved in what would happen on november no sign of any contact with outside agents from outlier espionage groups no suggestion of special visitors from moscow did you see the name karly vary asked stronski its the spetsnaz and kgb training site on the black sea all wet operators go through there for technical expertise and are held there on downtime no karly vary said reilly not a whisper red bastards probably killed your president anyway said mikhail they like that shit they pull it all over the world if so it was entirely out of the embassy sphere and none of the bureaucrats noticed anything out of place or out of norm said swagger mikhail said reilly the reports are consecutively numbered i kept careful track she had noticed something swagger hadnt that means nothing could be inserted or removed without retyping the entire file that came after i dont see any difference in the tone or state of the paper to suggest that new paper was added sometime also the typing is clearly from the same typewriter and i got so that i recognized the font particularly since the h was clouded under the bridge that typewritersome poor russian girl had the job of typing more than forty pages a daywas used all the way through i can recognize her style she was a little weak on the last two fingers of her left hand and those letters were always a little lighter but she had mondays off and a much less gifted typist took over more typos by far more uncertain on the right side of the keyboard so im guessing the substitute was a lefty wow said swagger kathy youre in the wrong business you should have been an intelligence analyst ive looked at a lot of russian documents a lot of reports i get used to the style the diction the nomenclature even the bureaucratic culture it hasnt changed all that much since even if everything else has this has the feel of the authentic so i dont think theres any suggestion that someone came back to it and tampered with the evidence to hide james bonds visit that damn james bond said swagger hes never around when you need him the next day swagger as agent homan had his sitdown with the ranking gang specialist of the moscow police who well known on the international circuit and a moscow rep to interpol spoke fluent english they sat in the inspectors office glassenclosed off the usual bright impersonal ward of the organizedcrime squad on the third floor of moscows central police station this fellow bodonski he was a nephew of the izmaylovskaya boss or in their language avtoritet also a bodonski said the inspector as they looked over the thick bodonski file and swagger saw a photo of the man hed killed bodonski had been handsome dashing even with thick sweeps of dark hair and piercing eyes he must have had the gangster way with women the last time swagger had seen himwhich was also the first and onlyhis face had been pancaked into the steering wheel of his car and what flesh was visible in the nest of crushed plastic and bent steel looked like the rotting fruit of a watermelon smashed against a brick wall too bad for him he was a tough guy very capable the inspector continued if someone topped him whoever did it must have been a tough guy in his own right inspector said swagger he just shot him it wasnt a fight a gun is always tougher than a man even a man in a car the car was coming right at the man as i hear it yes thats true so that man if he panics and runs as most will do bodonski breaks his spine in two he did it enough here we have him for at least fifteen hits which was why his uncle suggested he get out of town anyway your man on the gun he didnt panic he stood and fired well bravo my compliments ill tell him you said so this izmaylovskaya is the toughest of the gangs in town most of these outfits they call themselves a bratva meaning brotherhood it gives them some gentility like a guild or something a group of business associates looking out for each other not the izzies they just go by gang their specialty is applied force murder for hire extortion human trafficking the dirty end of the stick much more disciplined much more violent much scarier theyre smallerthree four hundred maybethan the brotherhoods which may have as many as five thousand men theyre not jewish they make no show of religious belief or ethnic identity hard guys killers danger boys they take their money up front lots of it you want to swindle a financier you go somewhere else you want to murder your boss the izzies are for you any connections gangs usually flourish where they have some kind of semiofficial connection with power only rumors nobody talks you only get out of that gang the way bodonski did on a slab in the morgue nobody gets inside as each rank is tattooed with a code of stars and dragons and all the codes have to be perfect or you go swimming in the river moscow with a zinc sink chained to your ankle ill be honest its a thing i cant look into closely or ill be the one with my spine broken in two on the street but the rumors say they have an affiliation with oligarchs the one most usually named is viktor krulov i heard the name before i think we have oligarchs too yeah everywhere the same smart guys figure out how to get to the front of the line and get all the potatoes they get so big you cant stop em if i go against an oligarch i dont mind telling you my wife is looking for a new husband let me ask you this since there was no personal reason for this bodonski to hit our undercover clearly he was a professional doing a job how would you go about hiring him would you do it from moscow or could you do it from new york good question which i will have to look into see with other groups much bigger groups there is more sophistication they have lawyers brokers advertising directors journalists all on the payroll many ways to approach them to slip through that portal between legal service and illegal service like a murder with the izzies its different theyre so small theyre so specialized you would have to know exactly who to go to there would be one guy thats all do you have a source who could tell you the name of that guy in new york again ill put it out how long are you going to be here you want to go on raids we do a ceremonial raid once a week so it looks like we have a chance of enforcing the law against the bratvas its a big joke everybody laughs and goes out drinking together afterward certain sums are passed do i shock you no i appreciate the honesty inspector agent homan i dont want to represent myself as a hero above it all i take my envelope too i know the rules i know what can and cant be asked and what will and wont be answered am i getting you you will ask about that name i requested but you wont really ask about that name is this the message im getting im trying to be honest and dont want to get your hopes too high its not a problem you have to do what you have to do you live here i dont this i can tell you you say two killings one in baltimore one in dallas for a known man with a high rep bodonski would expect big dollars plus expenses im thinking fifty thousand dollars for one maybe a discount only twentyfive thousand dollars for the other if business has been done before not small change whoever paid he had big money to spend and he had highly sophisticated connections he is not a small fry this is not something that would be arranged to punish an adulterer squelch a debtor get a store owner to pony up his monthly this is quality work bigtime stuff usually for other bosses big debtors wellguarded politicians youve been a great help inspector wish i could help more agent homan do give my congratulations to the shooter he was a man in a million so i will said bob chapter the man wore the baggy nondescript workingmans grunge so common in eastern europe and russia corduroys an untucked plaid shirt an indifferent burgundy jacket of some chinese miracle fabric whose zipper didnt quite work a watch cap pulled low over his eyes he carried no luggage though anyone with a close eye for observation might have noted a bulge on his hip even possibly suspected that it represented the sleek lines of an ixgroup gsh but nobody had that close an eye he was too ordinary he was one of moscows unseen millions the cheekbones suggested magyar or tartar the gray hair full and brushy suggested good genes and he kept his mouth closed because his teeth were too bright and he knew few russian factory men used crest white strips he had picked up a pair of red and white nike ripoffs made in malaysia and he walked like any of the proletariat of the earth head down hands stuffed disconsolately into his jacket pockets not quite homeless but seemingly without destination past or future flashing russian federation id he checked in to a workingmans hotel in a zone far out of the flashier precincts of the new moscow disco king bmw and porsche capital armani outpost of the world there he sat in his room and waited for four days eating mainly from fooddispensing machines in the underground station nearby where his lack of russian wouldnt cause problems or be noted nursing his scraggy beard and unkempt hair he let his teeth turn yellow with disinterest and the hair in his nostrils grow repulsively he had one companion on this journey into shadow lee harvey oswald the killer would not leave him alone and haunted his dreams swagger could not stop thinking about him it seemed just when sleep was deepest lee harvey would poke him in the ribs and start muttering in his ear actually it was his subconscious muttering in his ear and the damned thing was no respecter of regular work hours so swagger blinked awake in his russian shithole more like a fiftiesmanontherun hideout than anything and a voice was muttering to him about the timing the timing it kept saying the timing the timing was am that was the timing but no sleep returned and the voice grew louder and he saw that the muttering came from his own throat timing timing timing this is where most conspiracy theories wander out into the ozone because the time schedule was so fucking fast from the evening of november when the route became known to the early afternoon of november when the kill shot was deliveredsixtysix hoursa great number of things had to happen very quickly those who wanted to believe in conspiracy could only ascribe that kind of speed and efficiency to the result of deep government intrigue someone in deep government in a shadow department of great but unseen influence was able to arrange something far in advance so that immaculate longrange planning could be initiated oswald had to be found and brought under discipline a job for him had to be arranged and that job had to be on the motorcade route that itself had to be forced on the kennedy people since only cia was paid to do such things professionally quite naturally cia was almost always invoked since both cia and fbi had previous knowledge of ran files on and had dealings with oswald their presence could be quite naturally inferred but that was all shit the hard data points of the assassination totally dismissed any deepgovernment intrigue rather things happened as they do normally by chance opportunity by whimsy turning on someones eavesdropping swagger felt he was on to something he ordered himself to begin at a beginning how did lee harvey oswald end up in the texas book depository on november swagger recalled posner and bugliosi the first hard fact that would never go away was that he got the job before thered been any announcement that jfk would come to dallas at a specific time and date there was a general acknowledgment that the president for political reasons would have to make a texas trip in the fall so any idea of placing oswald in tbd was absurd on its face what would be the point of placing him in any building in dallas against the faint possibility that the president might someday drive by dont make me laugh and that becomes even more ridiculous in view of what actually happened he got that job the way most people get most jobs someone who knew that he was looking for work heard a certain place was hiring made some phone calls notified lee and lee showed up in a place hed never heard of was hired in the lowliest of positionsessentially a stock boyand started work the next morning wednesday october at an hour were these cia or militaryindustrialcomplex shadow agents or even men from uncle or spectre manipulating bureaucracies to bring killer and victim within range hardly they were the redoubtable ruth paine a sublimely decent quaker gal who had met and taken a liking to marina oswald and was trying to help her by helping her husband whom she didnt like muchshe had a nose for character that oneand roy truly supervisor of the book depository who was always filling his staff of clerks with transients knowing that the jobs were perishable and demanded little except a strong back and a willingness to do boring menial work in fact truly was responsible for another facility and assigned oswald to the dallas building only on a whim he could have as easily sent him to the suburbs by what secret method did the uncle agent ruth paine learn that truly was hiring she heard a neighbors son had just been hired there swagger was now up walking about the muttering getting louder later that week the white house announced that there would be a fall trip but planning didnt begin on the trip for some time agendas had to be worked out and translated into schedules which had to be coordinated with texas officials as well as the vice presidents office all this took time and negotiation and it wasnt until november that the dallas trade mart was selected as the site for the presidents pm luncheon speech the secret service advance party didnt arrive in dallas until the seventeenth to begin the more intensive preparation for the trip and it wasnt until the nineteenth when two secret service officers and two ranking dallas officers drove the routes from love field where the president would arrive on the twentysecond to the trade mart that a certain routethe one that took the president down main to a righthand jog on houston to a sharp lefthand turn down elm to access the stemmons freeway entrancewas selected at best a mole representing the deepgovernment conspiracy could have alerted the kill team the night of the nineteenth but in all likelihood the killer or killers didnt find out about it until the next morning when the route ran on the front page of the dallas morning news since oswald was in the habit of reading dayold newspapers he probably didnt learn about it until november the day before swagger tried to advocate against himself for a bit if indeed there was a conspiracy planning to kill jfk in dallas long before oswald entered the picture he thought it would have had a maximum of the night of the nineteenth the days of the twentieth and twentyfirst and half a day of the twentysecond sixtysix hours to do the following find and recruit oswald and get him committed to the sixthfloor book depository shot learn what kind of rifle he would be using develop a method of ballistically counterfeiting the rifle that was so successful it would withstand nearly fifty years of the highesttech scrutiny with the tech getting higher every decade find an alternative shooter who could make the head shot on the president that everyone who knew oswald would consider well beyond his modest range of talent find an alternative shooting site whose angle to the target was close enough so the trajectory of the counterfeited bullet wouldnt give the game away plan and execute an entrance and exit with such precision that it would go unnoticed in the hubbub one more thing occurred to him and he wondered why his gunsoaked brain hadnt come up with it earlier the rifle would have to be silenced so its noise wouldnt give away the existence and locale of the second shooter silencers more accurately suppressors are not easy to come by in the first place they are class iii items controlled by federal regulation like machine guns its probably safe to assume that as with machine guns professional government espionage agencies and underworld organizations have access to them but procuring them quickly and testing them for effectiveness and their influence on the point of impact demands time that these theoretical conspirators didnt have also a sudden search for such a device is certain to have attracted notice and even in or particularly in the underworld people talk if circa november a search of underworld inventories for a rifle suppressor had been suddenly run snitches sure as hell would have squawked to the police as a way of sliding a few months off a breakingandentering sentence so the suppressor remains completely mysterious another item that could not have been obtained in the time frame without having left a record bang bang bang he looked around startled it was someone in the next room pounding on the wall something was yelled in russian presumably shut up asshole swagger took the hint he turned off the light and crept back into bed and this time sleep was awarded him but he had a new conclusion to add to his mental inventory theyd have to be the best team ever assembled in order to bring it off on the fifth day late in the afternoon he took a roundabout walk to the underground and headed into another precinct of moscow he arrived at the flea market late most of the tourists had left there was little activity and already the merchants were rearranging their wares and closing their booth fronts it was another maze as avenue bisected avenue on a square mile all of it with the appearance of something temporary that had become something permanent most of the structures were low wooden booths possibly walled or awned in canvas the plaza of lowend retail was dominated by a central building in the old style with the typical onionshaped dome of gold gilding which rose on a tower from a complex structure that could have been a monastery or a refurbed software outlet the flea market was the place to go for nesting dolls which had come to represent the universal symbol of russia and shop after shop offered them in dazzling variety including those boasting the symbols of great nfl teams as each doll inside revealed a new and smaller icon of gridiron greatness ceramics were another popular sales item as were watches particularly the russian divers model with the screwon cap chained to the case protecting the winder jewelry knickknacks of all sorts imitation icons photo books and store after store of medals and badges where you could pick up a panzerkiller award with three bars signifying that you had knocked out three tiger iis in the ruins of stalingrad swagger dawdled here and there setting up switchbacks and ambushes to check if he was being followed finally satisfied that he was at least for now unobserved he found a corner navigated a street and then another and found his destination a surplusmilitary hardware shop that sold ponchos helmets bayonets tshirts boots tunics everything that spoke of war including some old marine corps helmets with the junglegreen camouflage cover he slid up pointed to the pile of helmets and said to the proprietor ill take six of them please the man looked up from his newspaper took a second to comprehend then said in english jesus christ swagger that he spoke english was no surprise since the flea markets economy sustained itself on tourism so if a fellow wanted to make a living he had to know the language of the people with the dough i have to see stronski there was nobody else around though down the way an old woman was closing down a nestingdoll joint delicately stacking the ornate doll faces back on the counter so they would be enclosed when she lowered the shutter man do you know you are the most hunted guy in this town here look at this he shoved over a piece of paper from the mess on his counter and swagger beheld himself sans the beard and low cap in a kind of disney caricature my eyes arent that close together he said and in a second tumbled to the rest how had theynever mind yet who they weregotten this out so fast so completely so nearly lethally how did they know the intelligence operation was superlative whoever put it togetherthe red james bond again knew what he was doing he felt his anxiety level raise six degrees is it shoot on sight or anything like that no said stronskis man person of interest the instructions are detain for questioning they had these all over the place four days ago figures three days ago i went and saw a cop and his eyes lit up when he looked at me i didnt know why but i had a feeling hed seen me before and was interested in continuing the relationship i thought it was time to blow town fast ive spent the last four days in a crummy room in the crummy suburbs sneaking out at night to buy clothes from usedandmaybewashed places and here you are now the underground man you could be some raskolnikov lurking in an alley with an ax whod notice you except for the height where is stronski you never know where stronski is he hides well he was a sniper so ive heard said swagger well disappear you it became a progression of squalors he was shunted from place to place in darkness by friends of stronskis who had no names and issued no instructions some spoke english most did not he stayed in a room in a brothel and heard people fucking all night he stayed behind a laundromat in a room of nearunbearable heat with lint floating in the air he stayed in the cellar of a star dog place that sold imitation american hot dogs he had one it was good always it was the same at a certain time in the evening a new man showed picked him up and drove him through dismal streets to another dismal hovel without a word he was dropped entered shown by his new host his deluxe suite for the night and there he spent the next twentytwo hours a farmhouse a suburban garage another brothel the rear of a pawnshop on and on for what seemed weeks but was shy of one time doesnt fly when youre not having fun he lived in a cold fusion of nerves and shallow sleep knowing in his heart of hearts that he was exactly where no man should be hunted in a country whose language he didnt speak whose streets he didnt know and whose culture baffled him he knew also i am too old for this but it was a thing he had to do he had given his word crazy with honor nah stubborn was all an old cranks privilege food was brought or bought but nowhere within the whole elaborate structure of escape and evasion was there a cash economy and no one wanted or would accept payment on the seventh day he was dropped at a bar and told fourth booth he entered a dark place full of bitter isolated drinkers found his way through the low lighting and the cigarette smoke slid into booth no and indeed there was stronski my friend said stronski still alive by the narrowest of margins theyre hunting you everywhere do we know who they are powerful enemy whoever the izmaylovskaya have called in a lot

record of course not but i dont mean id go myself i mean my representative i have to get a man in there get him in there to check a certain thing then i am out of here stronskis blunt face showed

stuff so i trust him so there are no doubts that is why there is only one man for the job that is you stronski jesus christ youll get me killed too in your madness over something that happened fifty

finland border stuff no crawling through the snow im way too old for that stronski shook his head in doubt well set it up swagger said so that i meet you somewhere public close by the embassy we have our debrief chat thats that shake hands and i walk into the embassy theyll cooler me for a day or so but theyll verify me through us sources the fbi will okay it and im out of here does that work for you what makes you think i can do it i am sniper not professor that kathy she was good she would get it but me suppose i cant find it im sure you can what would it be there has to be a security sweep every few years all services do that i have to know to what degree the embassy in mexico city particularly the kgb suites were penetrated in that was the game back then microphones all over the place in the most amazing locations stalins eye lenins beard the mens room urinal that place the american place all the places all over the world they were radio stations broadcasting twentyfour hours a day and not far away we had a little roomful of listeners writing it all down or monitoring the tape recorders there were no secrets at least not until cybercryptography came in and that probably didnt last too long either i need confirmation that anything oswald told the kgb goons wasnt private that is it reached other parties i think i know who youre talking about said stronski yes the red james bond didnt have to be red at all he could have been a listener and who was he listening for he could have worked for the cia chapter it cost ten thousand dollars and that was after much haggling give it to stronski he drove a hard bargain and finally got his price swagger was driven in the back of a delivery truck to a bank of america atm in downtown moscowhe was too tense to ponder the ironiesand took out the money after having arranged it via satellite phone call with his banker in boise the miracle of modern satellite communications he in the back of a bicycle shop in moscow calls a man in boise who calls atlanta so that a computer transaction is verified back in moscow and the next day with the pin swagger walks away with the cash gets in the delivery van and heads back to the bicycle shop then it was wait wait wait more days fled by days of nothingness and boredom that did nothing to alleviate the crush of anxiety too bad he no longer smoked or drankeither crutch might have provided some mercybut it was a thing of staring at the ceiling as the plaster crumbled away while time decayed slowly he cultivated an interest in a soccer team wondered when the nfl would get to moscow tried not to think of his daughters and his son and the fine lives they were building missed his wife mourned his dead always thought about certain flavors colors and smells and more or less concentrated on existence his only companion was the pistol brilliantly engineered by the instrument design bureau flawlessly manufactured by oligarch ixovichs ixgroup he stripped it examined it dryfired it drew it grew proficient and familiar with it learned it in all the ways a man can learn a gun without firing it which happen to be considerable his nighttime visitor lee harvey oswald stubbornly stayed away no ideas no insights nothing swagger tried to nudge the work along by sitting at the desk of one hole where he stayed and writing lee harvey oswald three or four times in the margin of a russian magazine about health food the pen wouldnt work the paper was too glossy and nothing came of it or maybe something did that night as before he swam from unconsciousness in the dark and felt the presence of the other man lee you fucking little monkey what are you up to now the chilly punk bastard was silent and smug as always and swagger scoffed as if to play hard to get and sailed back into sleep but then it started he saw the creep in his snipers nest hair a mess limbs atingle full of hunger for glory and immortality on his sleazy tiny rifle what the fuck are you up to you little bastard the first question that came to mind was why did he wait until the limousine had turned the corner off houston onto elm and was obscured in the few trees in the area to take and miss his first shot what a moron this one had stuck in swaggers craw since hed stood in the snipers nest it spilled over him again what the fuck whats going on here any shooter looking at the situation would know that he was assured one clear unhurried shot before any kind of reaction took place he would not choose a shot through the cover of trees at a moving target rather as swagger had chewed on a million times or so the best shot was when the limousine had slowed almost to a standstill as it was rotating around the left turn directly below oswald at that point the president was at his closest to lee harvey around seventyfive feet his chest and head were plainly exposed the angle was roughly seventyfive degrees so the trajectory ran well over the windshield of the limousine and the windscreen that cut off the drivers compartment from the passenger compartment it was the literal fishinabarrel shot and it was so close that difficulties with the scope alignment or even the threehundredmeter battle zero of the iron sights wouldnt move the bullet placement outside of the lethal zone that had to be the shot oswald planned to take that was in fact the shot he tried to take consider that when he arrived on the sixth floor that morning he had his choice of windows there were six why did he chose the lefthand corner because it gave him direct access to the turning automobile immediately beneath him it was the right choice if planning a shot farther down elm street he surely would have chosen the righthand window it was the buildings width closer and in terms of the curve in elm street gave him less deflection to the target it seemed that even oswald fired up on a wave of egomania and sense of destiny as he was doubted his ability to make a deflection shot at close to three hundred feet which was what his choice of the lefthand window ultimately committed him to doing it was difficult to believe he could hit that shot if he didnt think it was within his powers and had planned to avoid it knock knock hello whos there an insight swagger realized the little creep in the nest had tried to take the closer easier shot and his failure to bring it offconsistent with his goofups personality and his tendency to fall apart at big momentswas what determined the outcome of the next eight to ten seconds oswald prepped for that shot put his scope squarely on the presidents chest and at the moment of minimum movement and maximum proximity pulled the trigger to discover that the rifle would not fire had he put the safety on his loaded weapon and in the heat of the moment forgotten to remove it the safety on a mannlichercarcano is a devilishly small thing poorly designed and not for battle usage its a button located under the bolt plunger at the rear of the receiver to manipulate it youve got to break your hold look at the fucking thing and carefully guide it out of one condition and into the other the idiot whom the other boys called ozzie rabbit snapped dry panicked went through the process then went back into the shooting position aware that he was already behind the action curve his first shot may have been premature as he was hunting for a target through the trees and stacking the trigger for the final pull and the mc trigger unlike most of the age is surprisingly light the rifle fires he knows its a clear miss and now the clock is ticking on his effort and his old friend failure is nipping at his heels again he rushes through cocking the weapon reacquires the position and is amazed to see the car emerge from the trees into plain view with almost no reaction from occupants security or crowd he throws the crosshairs onto the presidentthis is his most likely shot to hit the brain as the president is much less than two hundred feet away the angle is beneficial to oswald producing little lateral movement and only slight diminishment probably not even noticeable through the cheap glass of the inferior optical device and hes on much firmer ground regarding the trigger pull knowing exactly how much slack to take out to get the trigger to stack up at the point of firing and when to exert that last ounce of pressure to fire and he misses again of course thats the famous magic bullet and not only does he not miss he puts a bullet through two men its not gods point of view that matters however but oswalds point of view the president does not react spastically to the bullet strike rather he makes a little jerk which being lost in the blur of the recoiling scope oswald may not see by the time he gets the rifle cocked and is back to the target he seesnothing that is the president doesnt collapse tip tilt implode pitch forward splay his arms instead he begins a slow subtle forward lean and his hands go toward his throat but not with any woundedanimal instinct or speed oswald cannot see any indication of a hit and must think you idiot another fuckup and he must think what the hell is wrong with this scope i was right on and i missed is it all fucked up where do i hold to make the shot given that psychological reality swagger found it mindblowing that oswald recovered enough to reacquire the target after running the rough action a second time and though the target was smaller his psychological condition possibly more scattered his doubts about his system more intense his fear of failure even more concentrated he managed the perfect brain shot what the fuck how did this schmuck go from two strikes to a home run how did he recover so fast and pull it off you can look for years at his record for any hint of such a moment and be bewildered there is nothing but utter failure random mediocrity is his best accomplishment swagger sat back astounded that he was sweating and that hed been transported to a faraway place and time now he was back in a sordid room smelling of piss and puke sleeping on a dirty mattress man on the run all the way yet the dreamscape of lee harvey oswald killing a president would not abandon his head in another second it took over his brain and swagger was back among the boxes smelling the burnt powder standing next to the little prick who brought such shame on all of us who call ourselves shooters the question eternal and lingering what the fuck was it simple snipers luck that he hit that last shot it could have been the wild shot can hit as accidentally as it misses the bullet doesnt know where its going whats on the other end it just goes where the physics tell it to go and that can be into a brain or a curb whatever swagger understood that this idea sucked nobody wants the key moment of the late twentieth century turning on nothing more than a nobody losers one stroke of luck but maybe that was what happened luck or whatever oswald has just shot the president in the head freeze the moment which is the most interesting moment in the entire event he has just seen his bullet detonate the presidents head into a geyser of brain matter and blood even if he lost specifics of the image in the recoil when he comes back on target out of the recoil stroke he sees chaos panic and hysteria in the back of the car and what does he do he cocks the rifle again excuse me but what the fuck why does he mean to shoot again is it pure reflex it wasnt learned in the marine corps where his m automatically reloaded itself what is his motive most good hunters have trained themselves to cock again for a fast followup but by no means is this assclown an experienced hunter and theres no indication that hes hunted in five years or does he need a motive at the time maybe it cant be explained it just is it happened because it happened and to look for motive is to see him as rational when he was an irrational man at an irrational moment still it seemed to swagger aware of the snipers instincts after the kill in that situation his task done oswald now knows that his chances at escape can be measured in mere seconds it seems far more likely that instead of cocking the rifle he abandons it exits the nest and beelines toward the only stairway which is over ninety feet away diagonally across the empty space of the sixth floor he doesnt do this instead he carries the rifle with him loaded and unlocked across the floor those ninetyodd feet suppose he meets a colleague suppose someone sees him from a building across the street the daltex building or the dallas county records building both of which have floors and windows that look directly onto his area at that point he is acting more like a marine on combat patrol fearing ambush than he is a fleeing assassin he reaches the stairway directly in the floor at the other corner of the building and realizing he cant reenter the world with rifle in hand he shoves it between two boxes there at the stairs where it will be found fully loaded shell in chamber an hour or so later why does he cock the rifle after killing the president why does he carry it with him as he proceeds across the floor these issues seemed to bother nobody they bothered swagger finally enough time passed so that stronksi felt safe enough to set a night he met swagger again this time in the back of a van to arrange the debrief and pass over the money you swear said stronski that after i have this thing for you we will proceed directly to embassy i will watch you enter and can then finally relax knowing i served you as you required and lived up to all promises absolutely now tell me where to meet no swagger you are such a bastard such a stubborn son of bitch you dont trust me what choice have i got but lets take elementary precautions though troublesome in the long run they will cut down on the yips and we can concentrate on our work you talk like general all the time soothing reasonable and probably right goddamn you man you are a hard friend to have im just a country boy scared of city slickers thats all i dont know what slicker is but i get the meaning so when we settle on place i will call you on a cell that morning after you are out of the lubyanka i will give you a street you will drive down it at a set time i will call you with a turn to make i will guide you by me in this way and make sure nobody follows i may do that two or three times when i am certain you are alone i will give you the destination my choice and you will be dropped we will chat then head by another cab to the embassy is that acceptable you have a cunning russian mind no rush to do anything its how i earned a glorious retirement in the basement of a bicycle shop where i watch the plaster slowly fall from the ceiling it is not very interesting i am sure but still i am sure it is more interesting than death it is swagger gave him the envelope ten thousand dollars in rubles i hope what i get for you is worth that there are no refunds said stronski i understand i take the risk cheerfully i wonder why do you do this swagger the money it costs the danger you run after all youve been through its so insane i can make no sense of such a thing vengeance you took the death of this president fifty years ago so seriously the pain is so deep swagger laughed frankly he said i dont give a shit about jfk three days later stronski called at precisely am i have it said stronski it was fine walked in found the second directorate volumes found the right year found the report broke the rules by writing it down he never asked or wondered got out easily now i am with driver anyone following hard to tell its crowded all porsches look the same but no i think not take a few more turns around the town ill call back shortly and give you a boulevard shortly swagger called go to bruskaya then go north on bruskaya thats seven miles i will call in half an hour then it was bruskaya to simonovich left on simonovich swagger waited forty minutes simonovich to chekhov right on chekhov he himself stood in an alley on chekhov and watched as stronskis black cherokee roared by he watched the busy moscow traffic flow that followed looking for cars with intent pairs of middleaged men their eyes hammered to the vehicle they were following he saw nothing like that mainly commuters as glum as those on any freeway in america truckies cursing the schedule buses driven by women a few cars of youngsters too full of booze and vitality to notice how early it was he moved a block rerouted stronski around another street brought him by and again noted no professional followers this time he looked for repeats from the first batch of vehicles hed monitored he found none okay he said youve heard of the park of fallen heroes near the tretyakov gallery i know it well i will meet you there in an hour i will take the underground to the oktyer okty abrskaya station yes its a few blocks see you atlooked at watchninethirty or so sit in front of comrade dzerzhinsky he will appreciate the company said stronski possibly comrade dzerzhinsky did enjoy the company he had no one else there he stood on his pillar twenty feet above the ground wrapped in a swirling greatcoat his strong face ascowl with contempt for the world he looked upon the man had ruled from the same altitude in the center of the square named after him where he had commanded the ceremonial space before the lubyanka whose apparatuses he had invented as founder of cheka in the early days after the revolution he was the first of the communist intelligence geniuses if polish by birth and had helped lenin cement his hold and built the machine that helped stalin sustain his he ruled from that spot in stone certitude for years radiating the red terror from each eye now covered in graffiti and bird shit he commanded nothing look ye mighty and despair was that the message something like that after the fall he had been removed to this far place a glade behind the tretyakov art gallery he had become a perch for the avian citizens of the state and he looked out on a small patch of grass and bush in which other dead gods had been dumped including about twentyfive stalins some big some small all broad with the muscular mustache and the wide georgian cheekbones but all turned somehow comic by their extreme proximity to the earth it was as if the russians were afraid to throw out the icon that was the boss but at the same time they couldnt honor him with a dictators height from which to command fear and obedience so low to the ground sometimes swaddled in weeds sometimes noseless or otherwise defaced from street action at various colorful times he looked in his rows on rows like a mysterious ancient statue unknowable mysterious vaguely menacing but easy to ignore and he was ignored for of the many beautiful moscow parks this was the least beautiful and maybe the least visited it was unkempt and overgrown unlike the formal perfection that was within the kremlin walls it was strictly an afterthought swagger sat in almost perfect aloneness with the stone men sparsely visited in normal time the park was even more desolate this early he felt secure from his hunters he had not been followed on the underground he had not been followed on his walk over he checked constantly and knew himself to be unmonitored it was a matter of minutes before stronski arrived and then he could go home and get on with it he yearned for a shower american food a good deep sleep and a fresh start maybe all this shit would begin to swing into focus after he got away from it for a while he knew he had to persist in his nighttime journeys with the creep oswald who what how why nah fuck why why wouldnt make any sense only how mattered oswald went away and swagger returned to manontherun guy he looked up and down the sidewalk from the direction of the tretyakov a museum whose modern fortresslike walls could be seen through the trees he saw stronski approaching he had read stronskis file which nick had obtained through cia sources he knew that stronski had his finger in a hundred dirty pies but everyone in russia did some didnt have so many pies he also knew stronski was known as a reputable assassin he always delivered he never betrayed his stock in trade was efficiency combined with trustworthiness he worked with equanimity for whichever bratva needed a job done never tarnishing himself with their affairs never playing their games so swagger trusted him as well as he trusted anyone in this game this is petrel five at tretyakov do you read static crackled over the handheld radio set but the young man on the roof of the tretyakov waited patiently until it cleared have you loud and clear petrel five go ahead ah i think i see stronski whats your distance about four hundred meters im on the roof hes got stronskis hair his build muscular he looks to be about the age where is he going hes in the park just like you said no rush no worry no indication he realizes hes under observation okay drop out of sight let the situation settle come back up in three minutes and tell us what you have got it the young observer did as he was told sliding into repose below the edge of the wall at the roofs precipice he was by profession a construction worker in one of the companies that the izmaylovskaya mob owned but he and many others had been pulled out for observation duties on sites known to be favored by stronski this was quite exciting for him for like many young men he dreamed of gangster glory of running with the feared izzies on their violent adventures in moscow the chicks the blow the bling it was the same for gangsters everywhere he rose looked through his heavy binoculars had a moment of panic and then made contact petrel five go ahead he is sitting on a park bench with someone yes now i see a taller man at least his legs are longer thin not so big as stronski workingman probably not a westerner doesnt look like an american can you see his face his eyes let me move a bit the young man slid down the wall of the flat roof coming to the corner this would give him the best angle i can now see they are sitting before the statue of dzerzhinsky the eyes he dialed the focus carefully hoping to squeeze a bit more resolution out of it the eyes he said very wary hunters eyes good work petrel five now stay undercover first the good news said stronski the good news is that there is no bad news swagger nodded he waited for it in those days kgb started a program where a second directorate technical team was in constant rotation station to station the world over thats all they did they stayed a few days a week they did a complete sweep using every electronic countermeasure and tracking device at their disposal and they issued a report to center with copies to the kgb resident in place a comrade bukhov seemed to be in charge very thorough man very patient very wise in the ways of concealed microphones wires longdistance amplified eavesdropping the power of batteries swagger nodded listening hard soviet embassy mexico city inspection twentythree listening devices found eighteen of them removed the point of leaving five i suppose to feed bad information to your eavesdroppers so in your people had it all everything in that building your people heard it swagger nodded of course he finally said that was a lot of info most of it routine im sure almost all of it routine i wonder how carefully the work product was examined who made the initial discrimination probably someone low on the totem pole and then what they winnowed out got passed upward to senior officers very good questions my friend but answers will be found in langley not in lubyanka was there a report no the program started in and mexico city being not exactly a big priority the team didnt get to it the first time until again swagger considered i saved best for last said stronski so pleased with his success comrade bukhov very professional very thorough as i said includes offices that he had found penetrated and chief among them was that belonging to yatskov senior kgb and supervisor of kostikov and nechiporenko in mexico city and first interrogators of mr lee harvey oswald swagger let out an involuntary sigh that means that cia had access to whatever oswald said the last day when he was so distraught and pulled the gun he was in yatskovs office i suppose that is conclusion you could draw i only tell you what the records say about wire operation at the embassy at the time what it proves swagger said is that someone in the agency could have known about oswalds hit on general walker it is not proved but it cannot be ruled out youre the genius youre the he went still swagger picked it up immediately two said stronski in the same even tone coming from around the bushes behind us heavy coats i cannot see hands you have that pistol i do said swagger his mind gone instantly tactical was this a setup had stronski betrayed him if so stronski could have pulled a pistol and finished the job in one second he wouldnt have placed himself in the kill zone in an odd way a clarification had been issued on the point of bad action swagger felt a wave of inappropriate enthusiasm he could not help but smile you laugh swagger you are crazier than even i this is the only shit i was ever any good at said bob still smiling he scanned for threat immediately seeing two men also in heavy coats with obscure hands coming at them from the same direction that stronski had come from the tretyakov maybe moving with a little too much energy for so early on a sunny moscow morning in such an outoftheway place two he said my twelve oclock and two more make six heading in from other entrance just passing by dzerzhinskys statue on the right are you hot im hot but no reload neither body posture had altered neither man had swiveled his head or signaled sudden anxiety through tensed body in fact stronski laughed and as he did he reached over and shook swaggers arm in mirth and swagger felt something heavy slide into his jacket pocket and knew it to be an eighteenround magazine for his gsh pistol no cover here said stronski laughing and theyve got baby kalish im sure on three draw and fire then break around the bench run straight back to cover swagger knew what was back there sixty feet or so stalinland row on row of stone joe wisdom in his eyes sagacity on his face mustache flowing like the don hair thick as the wheat fields of ukraine i lay down fire you move get into the stalins good cover you can move will stop their rounds you can get shots well see if they have guts to come against our guns when we are on the sights and shooting calmly lets kill some badasses said swagger on my one three two one it happened so fast after such a long wait the izmaylovskaya kill team had sat in a mercedes limo behind the tretyakov a glossy black beast of a car with three ranks of leather seats smelling of new car and also of perfume as if someone had a woman there recently but not now two men in the front two in the middle two in the rear very tough very good men had done wet work all their lives first in spetsnaz then for the mobs and now as dedicated izzy hard guys it was a great life and they had everything that the kid codenamed petrel five dreamed about blow chicks and bling they had bleak faces and small dark eyes and wide slavic cheekbones and frosts of gray hair and each weighed over two hundred pounds each could bench his weight and was expert at systema combat sambo an advanced russian and deadly martial art all had scars mended limbs jagged knuckles memories of death in cold or faraway places or more recently in back streets or nightclubs to see them was to fear them and the exquisitely tailored dark suits they wore over dark shirtssome black some chocolate some dark bluewarned the world to step aside each carried what is commonly but incorrectly called a krinkov or krink in the vernacular the preferred weapon of choice of the late osama bin laden and perhaps the instrument he was reaching for when seal team popped his balloon these men had done a lot of that sort of work themselves it was a shortbarreled ak variant with a large almost bulbous flash hider a folding stock now cranked tight along the left side of the receiver and a wicked curving plumcolored mag of thirty mm highvelocity steelcored cartridges it was secured by shoulder sling under the heavy armani overcoats they wore and in each voluminous pocket were a few more mags the news came to the team leader when he answered his cell in perfunctory language without drama or excitement they were professionals at this none of it was new oleg weve got a confirm theyre on the bench at the dzerzhinsky statue you set to roll on our way papa bear said oleg tapping the driver hard behind him he heard the sound he loved best in the world which was the klack of bolts being racked as they were slid back to turn the gun hot and ready he himself made that wonderful adjustment feeling the slight vibration as the bolt slid back permitted a cartridge to pop into place then rammed it home to the chamber the firing pin held tense by the trigger his fingers inspected while he called out the commands to his team as he had done in the mountains so regularly bolts back safeties off full auto engaged all positive came the ragged response the heavy car gunned to life but did not jump into the traffic as in all action smooth is fast and the izmaylovskaya driver was an equally experienced pro he slid arrogantly into the traffic accelerated made the proper turns while obeying all laws and in a few minutes pulled up to the margins of the park oleg spoke into his phone papa bear were set still a go he heard papa bear speak into another phone and then come back with yeah hes still got them sitting there like birds perched on felixs cold nose go rock their world showtime he said to his boys the car slid to the side of the road and two men slipped out theyd hold a few seconds the other two twoman subteams would get out at two other spots around the perimeter of the park of fallen heroes theyd coordinate the walkin and then theyd converge on the bench all would go to guns the shooting would be over in seconds and in the stunned silence theyd return to the patiently waiting limo which they knew would go unseen by any of the hundreds of witnesses in the roadway including moscow police or militia the car deposited the second team turned a corner and drove fifty yards to deposit the third the driver began the heavy labor of a uturn meant to move him back and place him at the exit to the park closest to the bench out of which if all went well the six shooters would soon emerge all did not go well pistol up two hands front sight front sight front sight and press the jerk of the recoil snapping the pistol up a bit its slide in supertime hard back a spent shell a blur as it spun away and then swagger found the front sight again and followed up with another to the midsection cranked right a degree or so and hammered two more nines into the partner who was unlimbering his krink and watched that one blur spastically while his nervous system announced hed taken hits and he staggered the krink dropping but not falling as the strap held it swagger heard the reports behind him of stronski his own gsh rapping as he fired a suppressive spray having more targets and not being able to aim after the first swaggers old legs drove him off the bench and behind it and he was stunned to see that though hed hit and slowed them the two on his side had not pitched to the earth he fired again even as one of them in a lurching move jerked on the krinks trigger and chopped up a cloud of dust and debris at his own feet go go goddammit yelled stronski over his own new dialogue of shots swagger was too excited to feel his age and ran like hell low with first a zig and then a zag and then a zig and was in seconds it seemed absorbed by the formation of joes in stalinland he fell behind the nearest went prone and shooting with the earth as his sandbag fired at the smears of men to the left moving and shooting scattering as they looked for cover their choppedforhandling assault weapons jerking arcs of unaimed fire into the air to cascade wherever stronski ran and swagger held on the head of a man whod wisely dropped to kneeling to steady his front sight for an aimed shot but swagger fired first careful on the press and saw a splat of gasinflated shirtfront to mark a hit high in the chest the man staggered to his knees dropped his weapon and seized it again swagger fired and the man went sluggishly reluctantly to earth he seemed so disappointed swagger looked back one of the first two hed hit was down finished but the otherthough his black shirt now wet and heavy clung tightly to his cheststaggered ahead weaving the krink with one hand bullcrazed by his job and meaning to finish before he bled out holding carefully swagger managed to press one off that blew a jet of mist from the mans broad forehead he fell like a toppled statue a strange ripping sound went stereophonic on swagger as a spray of stone or marble frags lacerated his cheeks and hands he turned and saw that two of the original four to the left had taken positions behind the bench and were laying out fire into the fleet of stalins ripping through nose and mustache and wavy georgian hair blowing out allseeing eyes ripping the comfy pudge of sanctimony that in some variations bunched the bosss cheeks one joe split radically in two its lesser half dropping to earth another of porous material simply evaporated into a fog of dust as hit centrally it shattered go back go back screamed stronski from an adjacent joe head and swagger usually the yeller of orders in such situations obeyed crabwalking back a rank to find another stout stone joe behind which to crouch even as he heard fullmetal jackets hum through the air and was aware that around and behind him the whole world was dancing and crumbling to the jig of velocity situated and alive he rose and though he could see only flashes and that thin scrim of burned chemistry that accompanies multiple smokeless powder discharges screening the bench fired the last five shots of his mag at the bench hearing the protest of punctured wood as his bullets bore into the bench slats stronski under that distraction scuttled backward hooked behind a joe and slammed a new mag into his gsh swaggers similarly hors de combat received the same treatment and dropping the slide on a fresh eighteen he hoisted it before him to hunt for targets he heard stronski yell in russian i call them fucking gutless izzy dogs tell them to come visit me in the joes and i will kill the rest of them and fuck their asses when they are dead hah he translated in the next lull a new fusillade ruptured the blasphemy and more stone fragments sang as they pranced from the various joes that the highvelocity bullets pockmarked hes coming around yelled swagger seeing that the two on the bench were covering for a brave guy cutting right and hoping to ease among the stalins from that flanking point of entry swagger rose guessing the gun smoke floating debris and floating slivers of grass and brush would give him a little concealment and set to intercept he dropped back a row of joes cut right ran low paused as he waited for the shadow of the gunman then stepped out on the diagonal and fired twice into the approaching killers heavy chest then fired a finisher into center forehead it was not pretty but it was final the gunner went down hard headfirst feet flying up with such force that a gucci loafer popped off one swagger scurried leaned forward and retrieved the krink deftly unlinking the sling catch swagger rose and as steadily as possible emptied the mag about fifteen remaining rounds into the bench where the last two bad boys hid this time rendering it further useless under splinters and dust one of them rose to run and stronski leaned into a sight picture to take him he fired once and his pistol jammed its slide stuck halfway back swagger swung to take the runner down with the krink not remembering it was empty and pulled on nothing he dropped it shifted the pistol to his right hand and suddenly felt a horse kick in his hip as a pelting spray of frags and superheated dust flew upon him he rolled left into the fetal locked his elbows between his knees and found the man who stood over the defenseless stronski and pressed just as that guy got another mag into his krink and was about to massacre the sniper swagger hit him in the eye blowing it out and the man twisted like a dancer and corkscrewed earthward swagger turned back on peripheral motion and settled in for a shot on the surviving gangster now fleeing saw civilians across the street behind him possible friendlyfire casualties and opted not to shoot the big guy all athlete and amazingly fast made it out an exit and dove into the open door of a sleek black limo which burned rubber on the acceleration dump guns get out of here commanded stronski youve been hit it was true the left side of stronskis white silk shirt bloomed the dark spread of blotted blood its nothing you go get out of here do it now i am fine i cannot run much swagger dropped the pistol pulled his watch cap low and started to walk forcefully away crossing a street finding an alley cutting down it finding a broad boulevard police cars roared along it looking for a turn to the park which as it developed was not accessible from that thoroughfare two passed within feet of swagger but in them youngish men seemed alarmed and unaggressive unwilling to get any closer until they were sure the shooting had stopped finding a small restaurant swagger tried to look cool he said koka and waited as the drink was brought hoping no one noticed that he was hit too chapter reilly emailed her boss at foreign seems to be a big shootout downtown here they say five dead in an assassination attempt some mafia deal interested she heard back in a bit sounds routine happens here all the time pass thanks stay on that siberian gas thing for the time being maybe if putin comments on shootout set up a sunday thumbsucker on russian mafiagetting more violent think about it so she went back to taptaptapping while concerns about the danger of cold drilling for natural gas under the siberian tundra continue to rise after last months blast petrodiamond spokesmen argue that the explosion was a fluke moreover they say the billiondollar energy firm will stick with recently announced plans to expand drilling operations beyond the nebeyaskaya range in the arctic circle her cell rang she saw the number was local but didnt recognize it hello hey she heard swagger say normally able to handle cops as well as grieving widows angry generals and romantic drunks she was momentarily nonplussed by the voice arriving as it did from a man whod vanished ten days before where are you calling from why are you here i thought youd left im in the parking lot im under your car actually flat on my back what i seem to be bleeding i made it here on the underground i had to get flat or even this small wound could empty me jesus christ swagger you you were in that gunfight i should have known i think im the missing bodyguard and that was stronski stronski and swagger the two of us both old guys against the world how is he they say the purported target is all right wounded but expected to recover very good news okay stay there ill come down and get you i need to get you to a medical no no it just tore through some muscles and skidded off the steel ball i have for a hip thats all bandages will do fine in a few days maybe you can dump me at the embassy and ill be all right some corpsman will sew me up the fbi will verify me and they can ship me back more or less in one piece i dont want any police interviews believe me swagger you have such a talent for getting yourself into bad shit she got down to the dark lot to find him wriggling out from underneath one of the small chevys that the post provides its reporters in moscow once he got himself upright he was able to move without much more of a limp than he normally had though looking closely she saw the small bullet hole and a dark stain that suggested some blood loss no arteries no veins like a whack from a baseball bat my whole sidell be purple for a month but once the laceration heals itll be fine youve been shot she said it cant be fine ive been shot before please its not a big thing my main worry is stronski now hell be all right the small elevator took them up seven flights they turned through a metal door that could have guarded a bank vault and walked into a spacious double living room apartment laden with sofas icons books textile hangings art all of it in splendid taste swagger had nothing to compare it to he had never seen such a den of the mind as opposed to the body but he imagined it as the kind of place some sort of fancy professor might keep nice he said lots of books bet youve read em all not hardly the office is through the door down the way its another apartment rigged for business with our computers which are tied in to the posts in washington its like im twentyfive feet away from my boss not four thousand miles he flopped on the sofa not that interested in miracles of modern journalism this is fine for me maybe in a few minutes ill head into the bathroom and take a shower the bleeding seems to have stopped i can feel it stiffening do you want anything to eat or drink you know i am hungry she fixed him a sandwich and a koka which he greedily consumed then he told her all about the event god she said her face alarmed how can you be so calm all those men trying to kill you and its some kind of a joke sooner or later somebody will manage it or ill fall off the porch and starve to death like an old stag with a broken leg itll happen ive seen it enough its a fact i just want to get this one done though that would be enough how did they find you they didnt follow either of us maybe they had a gps planted on stronski but i doubt it i picked the spot he didnt and he didnt know about it early enough to notify anyone and neither could anyone else in his outfit so my guess is they had a bunch of likely stronski places under static observation with a kill team near each one and when we showed up they got into action in a few minutes what that tells me again is what someone else said someone is spending a lot of money on this only governments have money like that to spend or oligarchs or hollywood directors i doubt steven spielberg has it in for you you never can tell youd better get some sleep do you want to move into the bedroom ill take the shower sack out i should be okay to move tomorrow you wont tell anybody im here if i told my editors i had a guy on the couch shot up in a russian mafia gunfight who was investigating the kennedy assassination theyd ship me to the anne arundel county mall in two minutes i dont know what that is but if you say its a bad thing ill take your word for it he lay on the sofa escape i made it tomorrow im safe the moscow thing is over and nobodys hunting me he tried to relax and in a bit fed and showered and only marginally uncomfortable from the hit on his steel hip he fell into a restless sleep but escape was the theme of the evening and as he tried to draw some pleasure from his own his mind naturally went to his buddy ozzie rabbit that guy had been on the run too although he never made it swagger reliving the sense of crushing dread that had accompanied him on the walk out of the park of the fallen heroes came awake in the moscow apartment he knew sleep would not visit again but ozzie rabbit would he rose went to the window and looked down across the open park between the buildings in the complex while on the horizon those various new dallases that were the future of moscow rose and sparkled against the dark of the night he could barely make out his own image in a trace of reflection on the window he saw a specter a shape haunted by the nearness of death in time lee harvey moved in and sat next to him face dull as it always was except when he got shot hair a mess skin pasty broadcasting distress and melancholy and yet defiance and pure psycho anger man on the run he makes it out of the book depository though he is briefly stopped by a policeman and heads up elm street he has skipped out seconds before the police arrive in force to cordon off the building and search it he continues on elm street passing the daltex building disappearing into the crowd and four blocks later jumps aboard a bus heading back down elm street he is so determined to get aboard this vehicle that he stops it in the street and hammers on the closed door for admittance that was a mystery in the classical assassination canon swagger knew many wonder why he chose to go back in the direction he came from back toward dealey plaza the site of the assassination where crowds and policemen were collecting in large numbers and traffic as a consequence was backing up some say he had no plan at all he was a moron in a panic he took the first chance he saw to get out of the area on the other hand it is the no bus and its destination is not arbitrary it will take him past the depository under the triple overpass over the trinity river and into oak cliff the area of dallas where his roominghouse is located swagger realized peculiar its clear he has no escape plan in place this means either first hes an idiot acting irrationally beyond comprehension or second his original escape plan is ruined for some reason and the only thing he can think to do is return home he counted on something happening and it has not now he must deal with that reality the bus soon runs into traffic as it approaches the chaos of dealey oswald hops off cuts a few blocks across town to a greyhound station and catches the only cab ride of his life swagger had a new thought this known fact has been undercommented on oswald is at the greyhound station he has dough in his wallet and hey its a bus station right so there are buses leaving regularly for other cities in texas yet he does not buy a ticket and climb aboard its true he may know that its a matter of time before law officers arrive check on lastminute ticket purchases and send messages to the highway patrol to waylay buses but if escape were his goal given the way his world was about to be closed down wouldnt that be his best chance to scurry away before the manhunt net was thrown out no answer presented itself swagger continued narrating to the two figures in the dim window that overlooked the russian nightscape it is known that oswald takes the cab to his roominghouse in oak cliff hes smart enough to have it drop him a few blocks away so he can recon for law enforcement activity before blundering in that suggests that the roominghouse is a rational destination something hes thought about and decided makes the most sense given the problems he faces he knows that it wont be long before a canvass of employees is taken at the texas book depository and his name comes up and hes idd as missing he knows that eventuallybut not how quicklythe police will connect him to the recovered rifle the cops could arrive at any second yet he takes the chance to go to his roominghouse to beat the police response in order to get one thing his pistol who did he think he was baby face nelson the next day right at pm when the office closed she pulled up to the american embassy on bolshoy deviatinsky pereulok and he peeped up from the well of the front seat where hed been crouching and opened the door the marine guards were twenty feet away across the sidewalk so he felt quite secure you were great he said i cant thank kathy reilly enough if anything happens with this ill try to repay you swagger get out alive thats all the repayment i need good idea here can you get rid of this he pushed the pistol across the seat toward her wrapped in newspaper just dump it in a trash can it cant be traced sorry but i had to carry it until now its loaded extremely ill throw it in a river much better its a great little gun saved the geezer bacon your friend mr yexovich knows what hes doing ixovich the oligarchs are allwise plus they give great parties endless caviar he leaned and kissed her on the cheek kathy reilly the best im sorry it didnt work out oh that he said the trip the trip you paid what forty thousand dollars in bribes fifty there was another installment you paid fifty grand in bribes you got hunted like an animal for two weeks in the moscow demimonde you lost about twenty pounds you got shot and you didnt find your red james bond he smiled thats true but it reminds me i swore to set something right with you please dont hate me but i lied to you or rather i played you a certain way why is this not a surprise i told you i wanted to find the red james bondactually the super case officer that was to motivate you to make that your goal to try to see him everywhere in every file and every report you tried your damnedest to make me happy but you failed except you succeeded i wanted your best effort because then i knew if you couldnt find a red james bond there really wasnt a red james bond see a red james bond screws everything up he muddies the waters makes all the linkages problems confuses the lines of command brings in foreign guys makes the thing international and not home sweet home its all spymovie then and im a lost puppy so i was hoping to christ he didnt exist but before i could move on i had to make sure he never existed he had to be eliminated a lot of it is about elimination it all traced back to the soviet embassy but as it turned out the reds were conduits of information and basically everything they told that guy mailer was true their role is small their oswald info was intercepted by the real killers now i can go after them if you can find out who they were you mean oh no ms reilly i know who they are ive always known who they are from the first second that bicycle print remember it its actually from a wheelchair i know the guy you know who they are i even know his name and what happened to him i saw his body hes dead yeah but he wasnt the brains guy the case officer he was just operations i think the case officer is still around because he keeps trying to kill me she looked at him dumbfounded i dont i dont know what to say you dont have to say a thing he said theres nothing to say anymore its time to hunt part iii back in the usa theres a man with a gun over there chapter its a peculiar way to run an investigation said nick swagger couldnt think of an answer his hip had been sewn up a process that essentially involved tying two slabs of scar tissue together with hemp thread the highest strongest magnitude with a needle that looked like a stainlesssteel flagpole hed been loaded with antibiotics and the state department with fbi intervention had found space for him to return from moscow quite the worse for wear aboard its weekly diplomatic flight complaints had been filed fbi agents were not permitted to work undercover in moscow much less shoot up parks with wellknown gangsters leaving bodies all over the ground if the new director hadnt been so busy giving speeches and interviews he might have objected and brought heat and smoke on nick not his favorite to begin with but he missed the boat on this one so for the time being it went officially unremarked upon now swagger sat in his living room in idaho hip sore and swaddled in bandages in the silence of his disapproving wife and daughter while nick upbraided him its not the diplomatic embarrassment i care about im too old to give a damn about that but this technique youve come up with is pretty spectacular you find a target you run at it in full aggression guns blazing daring it to destroy you it makes that attempt and somehow by luck talent whatever you survive and proceed to learn what can be learned from the assassins whom youve just killed does it ever occur to you that youre too old for this kind of shit that sooner or later your luck is going to run out and when that happens it will be tragic as well as a mess for all involved it never occurs to him jen hollered from the kitchen he is selfdestructive and stupid bob didnt answer her either he couldnt i didnt plan on the gunfight he explained to nick that was their idea it came we dealt with it and we prevailed we were armed we reacted faster than they expected we won the fight to the action curve honey can you get me some more coffee get it yourself came the call from the kitchen id say your wife is a little perturbed can you get nick more coffee he can get it himself too there you have it said bob at any rate i feel we made substantial progress i feel i have cleared the brush away from any highlevel soviet involvement in this thing and that any information that was in play in may have originated in the soviet embassy in mexico city but it was available to other parties meaning agency they were the ones who were listening now you want to focus on the agency yeah i know theres not much left of that place at that time it was so long ago everybodys dead still if people in the agency knew oswald took a shot at walker which they could have learned from their intercepts that made certain things possible they used the same model in in their operation against archbishop robertolopez manipulate a patsy into place with a known rifle engineer some sophisticated ballistic deceit have the backup shooter make the kill shot that the patsy couldnt be trusted to make then betray the patsy it was the same goddamn thing its a lot of could haves might haves possiblys and maybes said nick there was nothing possibly or maybe about the bullet lon scott was about to put into me and there was nothing possibly or maybe about the bullet you put into him in you tagged him before he tagged me maybe by a second true enough nick remembered the sixhundredyard shot the way the dust or debris vibrated into a puff when he put the bullet into the man and watched him slump back and disappear into his hide later he remembered looking at him crushed so still just wreckage great shot somebody said it wasnt till later that nick learned that lon was wheelchairbound and though confined to the steel trap had fought his way admirably to a righteous life that is until the end the ops were similar yes but theres something in latin that means just because it came first doesnt mean it caused it in other words they could have planned on the model of what they thought happened in or what could have happened in nothing that happened in proves anything about its too goddamn provocative to be left alone agree with me on that thats the favor im asking youve come this far its worth a hard look and people seem to be trying to kill me because im taking that hard look and you remember the people even better than i do one in particular i remember him said nick thinking of the frosty figure of a man called hugh meachum who supposedly represented the buddings institute of foreign policy but clearly spoke for a larger more secretive entity when he tried to convince nick to testify against bob so are you going to help me asked bob i know youve gone way out on a limb but the fact that twice highpriced highly connected killers have tried for me and that previously one of them killed james aptapton is evidence that were close to something nick shook his head i know youve never really believed in this said bob im not sure i do either but i dont know what to do except push ahead heres one idea the people who tried to take stronski and me out were from an outfit called the izmaylovskaya gang known to be the most violent of the russian mobs they seem to be by reputation connected to an oligarch named viktor krulov very powerful international presence that sort of thing could we run a deep cybersearch of krulov see what connections he has to american businesses my assumption is that whoever hired the izzys had to do so under the auspices of krulov so if we get a shakeout on krulovs business affiliations in the us well know who was capable of making such an arrangement theres also one named yeksovich no no dammit ixovich weird name huh he owns some gun companies and that might tie him to arms exports that might involve criminal activity and possibly the izzies yes i will look into krulov and ixovich okay the next thing is hugh meachum he died in officially that has to be looked at carefully i have unlike john thomas albright whose life as lon scott was clumsily hidden everything about meachums death is perfect all ts crossed all is dotted i looked very carefully at the public documents and they are complete said nick but he was a spy one of the best he would be good at that you cant say that lack of evidence is evidence then it all goes crazy thats why all the conspiracy theories are bullshit and i can show you his ashes can his ashes be read for dna no aha swagger it proves nothing it was a joke he has three sons in the washington area they appear to be outstanding men above reproach im reluctant to engage them until we have something definite on hugh meachum and were far from that i have no plans to visit or otherwise agitate them this is america they are not responsible for anything their father may or may not have done agreed said swagger that would leave only other vets of clandestine services from the early sixties most are dead these are guys who lived hard they fought the cold war and it should be noted won it paid a high price in alcoholism divorce breakdown suicide heart disease through the retired cia officers association we have been able to locate only one and hes been institutionalized for over five years agency records hard to access unless youve got something to trade or hard data youve done them favors maybe you could get in contact i dont know anyone there since susan okada died and i hate to play that card i dont blame you i have an idea though you attack the cia with an m when youre captured you escape and recapture your capturers and we interrogate them exactly thats it what could go wrong no no its actually subtle this i gotta hear swagger flew to washington a few days later it was a wretched flight through lightning and cloud not smooth and as usual his mind would not settle down he tried to nap couldnt got up and went to the bathroom earning displeasure from the flight attendant because the seatbelts sign was lit he returned sat back glad he had gotten an aisle seat and tried once again to relax tried again not to look at his watch or disturb the person next to him lee harvey oswald of course not just a slumbering american male teacher salesman lawyer father uncle brother what have you mr ordinary sleeping through it all but his hair was slightly disheveled maybe that was it like oswalds and the next thing swagger knew he was back on the run with ozzie rabbit who despite the fact that he is the object of a citywide manhunt and has only a limited amount of time to escape has risked everything to return to the one place the police will expect him at any second to retrieve his revolver why didnt he have it with him in the first place a gun makes a man comfortable swagger remembered his own recent adventures with the super in dallas and comrade ixovichs gsh in moscow not using them having them the weight the reminding pull on the waistline the density the pressure of the hard metal against the flesh if you knew someone was going to try to kill you that pressure was what let you operate you were armed you could fight it was the enabler of all those who for whatever reason knew they would travel in violences way oswald knew that up front he had to know that yet he didnt carry his pistol with him even though it was designed for that reason it was after all a midframed revolver with a snubnosed barrel built explicitly for undercover use for concealment its the gun you carry when you cant carry a gun his ability to hide it really wasnt an issue while the guna smith amp wesson special of the model known as m ampp originally chambered in the less powerful british s ampw round then rechambered for the more powerful special its barrel cut down for that detective lookis no derringer it can be easily concealed after all that is its point for example he could as he did later have tucked it in his belt under a shirt or sweater since nobody was looking for it it would have been an easily sustained deceit or he could have taped it to the barrel or the forestock of the mannlichercarcano and concealed it in the same paper sack that held the rifle he could have taped it to his own ankle he could have hidden it in a sock and secured the sock to the barrel lacking tape he probably could have hidden it in the pocket of loosefitting pants and kept his hand on it to keep its weight from distending the trousers attracting attention he could have carried it in a readily secured lunch pail or bag he knew he was going to shoot the president of the united states he knew he was going to be the object of a bigtime manhunt he knew armed policemen would be hunting and ultimately confronting him he probably dreamed of a glorious death in a blazing gun battle at the hands of law enforcement as the fitting climax to his heroic sacrifice yet he leaves his snubnosed revolver at home this struck bob as either the product of a mind too deranged and incoherent to have brought off the assassination in the first place or at the least a curiosity the fact that he didnt bring it was superseded only by the astonishment that he went back an immense risk to retrieve it so here was a question what happened that made the revolver so valuable after the assassination clearly something happened clearly oswalds circumstances changed and his thinking and tactics changed swagger listed the things that his subconscious had brought to his attention three odd behaviors in a few minutes from to pm november first from two abject failures oswald makes a great recovery and shoots on the president then he arms himself for a ninetyfoot walk across an empty room with the manhunt tightening around him he passes up a bus out of town and takes an incredible risk to get home and arm himself again when he could have been armed all along excuse me said his seatmate i have to go to the john sure said bob and radio contact with station klho was lost the house looked like a book a slim volume packed into a shelf of larger more intimidating tomes the others were mansions set back from the brick sidewalks of georgetown under the places looming elms but this humble dwelling was like a ragged paperback squished between the heavier works it was a woodframe with white shingles and a mansard roof and a sidewalk around back where perhaps someone once built a modest garden the shutters were black the door was red the number sixteen stood out in brass next to it and when he knocked a man his own age answered he put out his hand sergeant swagger or do you prefer mister he asked the man appeared unlikely to have been shot at and looked comfortable in a professorial way he wore corduroys a blue buttondown shirt wirerimmed glasses his hair was a softly tousled white as if on some birds breast mr gardner thank you bob is what i prefer please then come in call me harry im very pleased about this i love to talk about dad thats whatbob mentioned a nametold me the fellow named was an editor in the washington bureau of newsweek to whom bob had arranged an introduction via a mutual friend because the editors first book was called the new heroes the cias first generation of cold warriors a multibiography of some agency stars of the postwar years gardner led bob into a wellfurnished if oldfashioned living room revealing the houses surprising depth then to a study lined with books he taught at georgetown university law school some blocks away please sit down coffee something stronger no thank you ive been told you almost won the vietnam war singlehandedly no sir my one accomplishment was to come back more or less intact all the truly brave men died over there im sure youre too modest i heard the word greatness whispered the whisper should have been lucky old crank harry laughed very good answer anyway dad you wanted to know about dad he was a hero in his way as well i understand what put me on to your father were the several references to him in the new heroes book he was boswell the biographer he put together fictitious lives that the agency forgers documentedlegends i guess theyre called in the tradeand as these fictitious men our people went out and penetrated or at least operated in dangerous areas dad never lost a man no agent who went underground as a boswell construction was ever arrested or tortured or imprisoned he brought em back alive he was very very proud of that yes sir as well he might be but i have to tell you bob dad was also discreet believe me i should know i tried to write his biography i went through everything all his papers all his notes all his diaries all his unfinished novels the man committed nothing to paper and when i was growing up in this house mum was the word he never brought work home with him which is another way of saying he was almost never home because he stayed in langley eighteen hours a day i see i dont know if i can be of help to you i just dont know a lot maybe if you told me specifically what it is youre after yes sir said bob there is a slight possibility and i can offer you no proof that somewhere in the world a man is living under a biography that your father assembled for him it still hasnt been penetrated as an example of your fathers genius wouldnt it be in the agency workname registry if he exists he would have managed to remove it he was a sly dog this guy all right can you tell me his name youll scoff according to all documents he died in hugh meachum yes hugh was capable of something like that hugh was the best my father loved hugh hugh was the ideal agent bold cunning unbearably brave but nothing like james bond whom dad loathed hugh was smart and never showy he didnt need recognition or glory the work was reward enough he was like a priest a jesuit i think intense not macho dryly witty many a time hugh has sat in the chair youre sitting in now drinking my mothers wicked vodka martinis his beautiful wife peggy over there dad and my mother here on the sofa the four of them laughing like hyenas hugh was quite a guy no doubt anyhow he would be what eightyfive or so if still alive eightytwo born in oldschool spy raised in france spoke russian french and german flawlessly yale lit major turned out to have the gift for the game that sounds like him i cant tell you anything specific about hugh neither hugh nor dad would talk about specifics they were so disciplined it couldnt have happened or been committed to paper they distrusted journalists even if at one time dad was a journalist its more a mindset by that i mean your father had a technique for building a legend it may have varied case by case but it had tendencies it had patterns it had technique possibly you would know that or you could have discerned it or inferred it so if you could talk about that subject you might give me some road signs id be on the alert for as i continue with my inquiry im not going to ask you what for if youre vouched for by the right people and you fought hard for your country then ill take you at face value i would tell you if i could thanks for not making me cook up a lie if its about the war then i can tell you hugh was against it that i know i heard him arguing quite explicitly with dad hed been over there early im guessing he was involved in the plotting against diem so hugh was definitely a good guy see i didnt know that very interesting said swagger thinking thats one for the bastard he may have killed kennedy but he tried to keep me alive anyhow as a result of my investigations ive come upon some indicators that hugh might be alive but underground for one reason or other yes a man like hugh made a lot of enemies he can clear up some things if i can get him to talk if hugh doesnt want you to catch up with him you wont be catching up with him hes that clever maybe in his old age hed spill his secrets and theyd be many and interesting he does know a lot about vietnamhe tried to stop it failed and then waged it hard as any man any man except possibly you he had three tours in heavy danger he was a wanted man and the two of youboy id like to be a fly on the wall during that conversation im just an arkansas farm boy i wouldnt say much sure anyhow dad how would dad proceed in building a legend thats the issue right yes sir it depended on whose influence he was feeling most keenly he was remarkably sympathetic picking things up from the air it seemed a movie would stimulate him and hed draw on images from it something would happen in the news that would set him off hed learn a new name it would buzz around in his head until he found a way to use it a painting could do it and he was an inveterate museumgoer he was a stimulus junkie needed provocation to work do you have a time frame im guessingmiddle seventies early eighties vietnams over and done no one wants to think about it chinas coming up dad was not one theyd go to for something chinese it could be american it could be but again not dads forte he was classic himself old espionage ohio state but he could hold his own with the snooty ivies russia eastbloc countries the cold war the old standbys the eternal enemy okay said harry gardner that would be dad got it one word nabokov bob blanked and knew his eyes registered emptiness nabokov the writer the genius well sir said bob one of my embarrassments is how poorly educated i am i have tried to catch up but a day doesnt go by when i dont humiliate myself by exposing my ignorance i never heard of any nabokov i even had to look up boswell to figure out what it meant vladimir nabokov white russian born at the turn of the century st petersburg lost it all in the revolution and the family fled to paris where all the white russians went cambridge education iq or something like that spoke english french and german as well as russian spoke em all brilliantly wrote intricate troubling books usually about intellectuals with always an undercurrent of dark sexuality and violence probably regarded humans as another specimen to be mounted on a needle and studied he was a butterfly collector too your father was an admirer a devotee as was hugh theyd rather sit in this room and argue nabokov and smoke and drink and laugh than almost anything so whether it was conscious or unconscious im betting that any work product dad turned out was touched by nabokovs influence and what would that be nabokov loved all the candy corn of prose puns allusions crosslinguistic wordplay wit for wits sake ill give you an example youve heard of lolita old man young girl dirty as hell thats all i know believe me its the cleanest dirty book ever written but the bad guy is a tv writer named clare quilty quilty who ultimately steals lolita from humbert and uses her for his own purposes nabokov loves to play games with the names and at one point has humbert muse in french something like that he is there and in french its quil ty that is quapostropheilspacetapostrophey you see how it works its a pun but in two languages the phrase in french the name in english so a boswell work name would have a pun in two languages this is literature not physics so nothing is definite it would be a hint a shade a ghost of a meaning subtly brushing against a word if the name were a russian namethis is a real simple exampledad might have come up with babochkin that means butterfly man and nabokov was known as a worldclass butterfly collector so anyone looking for a giveaway who happened to know that dad in his nabokovian phase was the author of the legend and spoke fluent russian might look at a list of names and immediately babochkin would stand out it would be a dead giveaway of course thats the principle as enacted at a primitive level if he were doing it for real it would be much subtler and go through a batch of meanings and languages before it gave up its final meaning it would bouncebouncebounce all over the place and no one would ever get that last meaning because youd have to know such a broad range of disciplines languages cultures that was the sort of thing he liked to do i think i got it said swagger would you like to see dads office i kept it the way he had it when he died i think its a kind of portrait of the way his mind worked you might enjoy it great thatd be very helpful okay come this way harry took swagger up a narrow creaky back staircase down a crooked hallway and into a room off to one side with a window staring at nothing except the vines on the house next door bob looked this was the mind of niles gardner creator of legends who always brought em back alive this is where dad tried to write his novels harry said im afraid it never worked out he was a brilliant beginner but whatever it is that brings the writer back to the chair week after week and month after month dad lacked he didnt have it in him to finish by the time he was halfway through with anything hed changed so much intellectually that he no longer recognized the person who began the story and had no sympathy for him and the characters hed created a lot of geniuses never finish their novels i guess its too bad bob said he must have had a lot to say the walltowall ceilingtofloor shelves were crammed spine out with books books more books arranged alphabetically many were foreign and of the ones in english bob recognized no titles except some hemingway and faulkner a couple of incongruities stood out for example there were four ceramic bluebirds on one of the shelves papa mama and two babies there was a surprisingly sentimental picture or more of an illustration of six green elms against a countryside the oddest thing of all was on the desk piled with pages of typescript an old underwood typewriter battleshipgray and weirdly tall and complicated stood in the center on the desk were jars of paper clips pensand a pistol i see what youre looking at yes for some reason dad glommed on to this old thing and wouldnt let go of it harry picked it up carelessly by the barrel and bob recognized it as a c mauser commonly called a broomhandle for it carried that shape in a grip that plunged almost at degrees from the intricately machined receiver the handle was freed up to be unique because it had no responsibilities for containing a magazine the magazine was contained in a boxlike structure ahead of the trigger the barrel was long the whole thing oddly awkward and beautiful im sure you know more about these things than i do said harry handing it over bob pulled back the bolt latch on the receiverit was so early in the evolution of semiautomatic technology that it didnt have a slideto expose the chamber revealing the gun to be empty mauser broomhandle he said yes exactly winston churchill carried one in the cavalry charge at omdurman in when it was the latest newfangled thing i think dad kept it around because it reminded him of classical espionage you know europe in the thirties comintern the storm petrels the recruitment of the cambridge four the gestapo gauloises poum the novels of eric ambler and alan furst that sort of thing that was when espionage was romantic and he loved that part of it as opposed to the cruel war he was engaged in fighting where the stakes involved nuclear exchange and maybe global annihilation swagger looked at the old pistol feeling its cavalrymans solidity loading was problematic especially on horseback ten rounds held in stripper clips had to be indexed into grooves in the magazine then forced down into the gun by a fingers pressure you wouldnt want to do that with dervishes whacking at you swagger turned it this way and that somewhat charmed by its ugly beauty or its beautiful ugliness he noted the number nine cut into the wooden grip to signify its calibration you wont mention the gun to anybody will you definitely illegal by current dc law your secret is safe with me swagger said i have no objection if you want to stay here and go through the papers to your hearts content i will tell you that when dad died in a team from the agency came and went through everything they took a few papers thats all but they assured me that everything that remained was of a nonclassified nature thats very kind of you sir said bob but for now i dont think its necessary maybe when i have more information somewhere down the line and have something exact to look for then i might come by again if the invitation is still open anytime anytime as i say talking about dad is always fun for me those were great days that was a great war he fought we won that one didnt we so they say said bob in his washington hotel room that night bob didnt need to sleep to get to the subject at hand old man gardner had raised it himself pistols his was an ancient thing from the jurassic of the semiauto age two centuries earlier yet it meant something to the old guy even if he wasnt an operational type who might have used it in hot or cold blood hopelessly obsolete or not swagger opened his laptop went online and quickly acquired the basic info about the c pistol confirming what he knew with more details he also learned the source of the nine on the grip seeing that during world war i the inscription was the prussian way of informing the troops that this variation was a mm instead of a mauser mm like the earlier s the thorough germans even painted the nine red and the pistols became known as red nines even if old gardners red had worn off then swagger had a thought red nine four bluebirds blue four green trees green six bob wrestled with that radio codes somehow map coordinates agent work names a way to remember the number or er or he came up with exactly nothing except a headache and a feeling of stupidity this wasnt his game he went back to his game when he tried to price the red nine on the gunsamerica website that vast repository of used firearms he came across something else a s ampw m ampp of exactly the sort lee harvey had gone all the way home in the middle of a manhunt to carry it rolled up the screen and bob fixed on it recognizing the sweep and balance of the brilliant smith design which had lasted over a century the odd orchestration of ovals and curves arranged in a stunningly aesthetic package that achieved as had just a few other handguns an accidental classicism how odd it was that oswald had risked all to go back for a gun he could have brought with him try as he had bob hadnt cracked that particular nut maybe oswald was going to head to general walkers and take him out too as his last beau geste to the world he was leaving behind maybe he thought if trapped he could administer his own coup de grace the only coup de grace he administered was to a poor man named j d tippit who like bobs father had done his duty and caught a slug for his trouble j d tippit was the forgotten victim of that bloody day a dallas policeman he was armed with a description of the assassinit nailed lee harvey to a tand ordered into oak cliff closer to downtown to patrol and scan he spotted a man who matched perfectly the fellow walked perhaps too hastily up tenth street in oak cliff tippit trailed the walker from his squad car then halted and hailed him over their conversation is forever lost at one point it seems that oswald satisfied the inquiry left the squad car and began to depart but tippit had a second thought called and got out of his car it does no good to wonder why in that age of less politically correct policing he didnt brace the suspect more aggressively at gunpoint and put him in cuffs before sorting things out he chose the courteous way and took three bullets as a consequence but what was odd wasnt tippits politeness swagger thought with the silhouette of the stubby revolver before him on the screen so much as the intensity of oswalds homicidal response it is known that the man had a temper and was prone to and not afraid of interpersonal violence as frequent arguments and fistfights attest but at the same time he was a yakker a talker a debater he may have had or believed he had the skills to talk his way out of anything he may have thought hed done so when he was hailed a second time and saw the officer emerging from the car he never deployed those skills his whole personality was based on them his sense of self yet he abandoned them and drew and fired a case can be made he snapped he was a fugitive on the edge of rational control his mind wasnt working properly and he saw that he had to act or wake up on death row in a panic he did that swagger thought i suppose that makes sense at least as much sense as anything even if it contradicts his basic character but what happened next is even more peculiar and out of character why did oswald walk to the prone body and fire a last shot pointblank into the head you might say executionstyle but that would be wrong it wasnt style it was execution it seems to have attracted little attention but it puzzled swagger deeply he might concede that a fleeing man in a panic with no impulse control and abject fear for his life would draw and shoot almost certainly he would turn and walk away rapidly he is killing to live that is not what happened instead of turning oswald deliberately closed the ten feet of distance between them bent over the fallen man and delivered the brain shot at such close range that he could see the face as he drove the bullet into the head see the spew of blood and the fall across the body of that utter stillness that marks the dead from the living why it makes no sense in terms of his situation and it really makes no sense in terms of his politics and previous behavior he never hated jfk he wasnt a punisher a psychopath a coup de grace giver a scalper a bushido warrior who took the skull knot of his fallen adversary his killing never had that personal edge of contempt yet in this instance he goes the extra effort to lean over and deliver the final expression of contempt with the brain shot at close range why the next day was the first stop on what swagger thought of as the hughlon grand tour from georgetown he traveled to hartford and went through birth records finding out that indeed a hugh aubrey meachum was born in to mr david randolph meachum and his wife the former rose jackson dunn both of whom listed their address as american embassy paris france he found lon as well born five years earlier to jeffery gerald scott and his wife the former susan marie dunn address green hills ranch midland texas evidently the dunn sisters preferred that their beloved hartford obgyn deliver their children in the comforting confines of hartford episcopalian hospital on then to new haven mostly decayed old city but part of it medieval university with real ivy on the towers and buildings clotted with elm and oak the whole thing a delusion of propriety and yet oddly comforting he didnt bother with yale itself whod cooperate with a cranky geezer with a cowboy accent and boots who looked like clint eastwood on a badhair day it probably intimidated him a little too maybe the only thing that ever had the public library was more accommodating it had bound copies of the yale daily news that yielded information without attitude and paging through the lost and forgotten record of elite success on the gloried fields of new haven had a weird feel as if he were on a different planet so far from the squalor of his own upbringing in the hills of polk county arkansas but yale in the forties what a glorious place it must have been as half the faces later achieved under the camouflage of more chin and less hair national distinction of some form or other of the cousins lon scott was by far the more outstanding particularly as a fullback and linebacker for the bulldogs many old photos showed that particular form of american male beauty the square symmetrical face the strong nose and jaw the ease of smile and warmth of eye confidence it was born into this man as surely as his blond hair and the aquiline blade of his nose broken once to great dramatic effect on some ball field somewhere swagger remembered lonthen calling himself john thomas albrightstuffed in his hole on the ridge over hard bargain valley in the desolate ouachitas of head destroyed by the energy of nick memphiss sixhundredyard shot it came to that yes it did so sad three touchdowns against harvard led the league in points scored few field goals in those days except by the rare drop kick to say nothing of his spring glories where for four years running he won the ivy rifle championships in standing and prone it was too bad the war couldnt have lasted a little longer for lons skills at riflery and football would have done the american forces good wherever he served there was much less of hugh five years later hed been no macho jock dominating the back pages of the daily only a sub on the bulldog basketball five besides the cage mediocrity best game eight points against brown his senior year he appeared in only one other notice his election to the board of the yale review though bob couldnt force himself to look that up and see hughs undergraduate poetry hugh was smarter he graduated with cum laude honors lon did not back in washington swagger had the entire fiftiessixties run of the national rifle associations american rifleman publication shipped to his hotel room off an internet purchase he spent nights going through the volumes tracking lons early run of brilliant victories in competitive shooting at the national level even finding a picture of lon standing with a trophy exactly where bob stood with the same trophy twentyfive years or so later bob had no father to stand behind him but lons beamed proudly from behind his soaccomplished son who in just a few years he would paralyze from the waist down by day at the library of congress bob combed the gun magazines of the same fiftiessixties for lons work as a writer as an inveterate reloader and experimenter as a rifle intellectual if such a thing existed and saw that he was as revered as jack oconnor elmer keith and the others of that golden age bob could find no mention of the paralyzing accident or the supposed death in but after a severalyear interval the byline john thomas albright began to appear and did so steadily for the next twentyfive years that left one more stop a visit to warren virginia near roanoke where lon died swagger learned there only what he already knew the death was a thin counterfeit all the documents forged all the newspaper accounts based on a funeralparlor press release the body naturally had been cremated the ashes scattered suddenly there was no place left to go no one was following him nobody was cybermining him nobody was trying to kill him it seemed that when he had lost hughs scent hugh had lost his even if it wasnt clear whether hugh meachum existed the memoirs of a case officer by hugh meachum you can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style writes the great russian novelist nabokov well well see about that i am undisputedly a murderer but my prose style has been abraded of its sparkle if there was ever sparkle to begin with by four decades of filing largely unread administrative reports a few research papers too many afteraction reports my daily vodka intake hardly helps matters nor does the arbitrariness of my memory speak memory i command it responds with vulgarity the issue is whether my old and creaky imagination will be stimulated by recollection and at least propel my words to the level of readability or whether this record will disintegrate into drivel and incoherence that would be a shame i have much to tell for though im a dismal writer im a great murderer ive never pulled a trigger but ive sent hundreds maybe thousands to their deaths in that bureaucratic intelligenceagency way ive planned and authorized assassinations raids and commando assaults the necessary byproduct of which is murder i supervised phoenix for a year in vietnam and made a jaunty figure with a boonie hat and a swedish submachine gun slung under my arm even if i never fired the damned thing which was annoyingly heavy phoenix probably killed at least fifteen thousand including some who were actually guilty i put together and managed from close at hand all manner of paramilitary black operations involving every sin known to man then i went home and slept in a warm bed in a very nice home in georgetown or tan son nhut youre probably right to despise me but you dont know the half of it i am also the man who murdered john f kennedy thirtyfifth president of the country in whose services i labored so bloodily i did not pull the trigger but i saw the opportunity conceptualized it found the necessary arcane talents to staff it recruited those talents handled logistics egress and fallback via safe routes and counternarrative alibis also as it turned out unnecessary moreover i was in the room when the trigger was pulled then my shooter put his rifle away and we left to be quickly absorbed in the public frenzy of grief and mourning nobody stopped us nobody questioned us nobody was interested in us by four oclock we were back at the bar at the adolphus it was as you must know a perfect crime no sixor was it eight or ten seconds in american history has been more studied than those between which alek poor little mutt fired the first shot and missed and my cousin fired the last shot and hit yet in all the years and against all investigation and attempts to comprehend in all the theories in the threethousandodd books by clowns of various mispersuasion no one has ever come close to penetrating our small tight highly professional conspiracy until now i sit on my veranda i am eightythree healthy years old and hope to be around for at least another twenty before me the meadow the valley the purple forests the river the land is mine as far as the eye can see and it is well patrolled by security in the large house behind me are servants a japanese pornstar mistress a chef a masseuse and occasional mistress a gym nine bedrooms a banquet room an indoor pool the most elaborate entertainment center on earth and an array of realtime communications devices by which i can administer my empire in short the products and perks of a vastly remunerative and productive life im worth more than several small countries at long last five decades later there is a tremor in my world a threat a possibility a chance of discovery and destruction even vengeance it has impelled me to sit out here in the warm sunlight with a yellow tablet of legal paper and a cupful of bic ballpoints though im a traditionalist im not so goofy as to insist on a fountain pen and tell the story in my own hand at any moment in the next few days a phone will ring and tell me if the threat has gotten larger or has gone away forever but as im a man who generally finishes what he starts i expect that no matter the outcome of the drama being playedagain at my insistence and according to my instructionsi will finish this manuscript assuming i havent been interrupted by a bullet i will consign it to my safe maybe when i die it will become known and shake the foundations of history maybe it will disappear tossed into the furnace like citizen kanes sled thats beyond my control and therefore beyond my care i know only that now for the first time i will set it down speak memory though i am naturally reticent resolutely shallow and not one for selfanalysis i feel obligated to produce a few brisk paragraphs of pedigree recordstraightening i am hugh aubrey meachum of the hartford meachums its old yankee machinist and tinkerer stock with branches in the hardscrabble farming that connecticut offers my forebears were known for a shrewd eye on the dollar and opportunities to make it quiet severe faces men and women good hair and taciturnity with a black streak of alcoholism and melancholy evincing itself a couple of times in each generation given that as my stock i was more fully formed by three mentors about the first two of whom i will say just a bit the first would be a man named samuel colt i was wise enough to pick as a greatgreatgrandfather an otherwise odious tyrant named cyrus meachum who did one intelligent thing in a legendarily grim life as a hartford hardwarestore owner he believed in young samuel colt and his twirling new gizmo called the revolver and invested in the sprouts first connecticut plant the first of all in new jersey had failed it was an excellent career move as all of us subsequent generations of meachums have benefited from the colonels invention in a neverending supply of just enough moolah to let us do what we wanted instead of what we needed we had the best of schools the best of holidays the pleasures of big houses on hills under towering elms and of hearing the peasantry call our fathers sir we rode the genocide of the indians the elimination of the moros the whipping of the hun the destruction of the nazis and the greater east asian coprosperity sphere to financial independence happily a few of us died in each of those campaigns and my father a career diplomat who served in the state department before the warin paris where i was raised where i picked up the language easily and totallyand in an outfit much heralded and like all intelligence agencies almost wholly worthless called the office of strategic services which was actually more red than moscow was in the thirties then back to state for a genteel gentlemans career thank you colonel colt for underwriting it all here i should insert a footnote about the language that i learned easily and totally it was not french though i speak french it was russian my nanny natasha was an exiled white a duchess no less an exquisite and cultured lady she moved in high white circles and paris before the war was the white russian moscow with the largest population of exiles anywhere on earth they were brilliant if deluded people immensely cultured extravagantly cosmopolitan charming and witty and bold to a fault of extremely high native iq generously seeded with genius indefatigable in battle and literature after all they produced not only the great nabokov but tolstoy and dostoyevsky as well i may have even as a small child attended a soiree where n himself was present though i have no memory of it so russian was my first language with a bit of aristocratic frost to it meanwhile my parents were busy doing the paris scene all but ignoring me for which i thank them natashas lessons were far more meaningful and lasting than anything they could have taught me this will explain much of what is to come in the tale ahead my second mentor was a man named cleanth brooks of yale where i majored in american literature with a view toward going to paris and working with some harvard boys on an enterprise they had started up that seemed damn keen to me called the paris review dr brooks had his problems about which i will remain discreet but he was the founder and high priest of an earlyfifties discipline called the new criticism it held with spartan rigor that text was everything it didnt matter what you read about a fellow in time or life or what movie star hed married or whether his dad had beaten him or his first wife had belittled the size of his dinger none of that mattered he didnt even matter only the text mattered and it must be examined closely under laboratory conditions without regard to personality or psychology or voodoohoodoo or what have you only then would its message its meaning its place in the universe if any be teased out i loved the discipline of it the zeal of it the sense of probity i suppose i longed to apply it to life and i suppose i did in some fashion enough of those old ghosts my most powerful mentor was a famous man a glamorous man a brave man a man who sent me on my way i must address him at some length for you to have any grasp of what happened and why in his name was cord meyer he recruited me on my fathers recommendation spooktospook as it were from the university of pennsylvania where i was a graduate student in lit and alone insisted on the seriousness of a pornographer named v nabokov to the plans division of the central intelligence agency where i was to toil and happily murder by proxy for forty years every second of every day spent in the ideaor possibly delusion that i was helping my country against its enemies that i was living up to the standards of dead meachums the worlds battlefields over that i was ensuring all those big words that made hemingway cringe in the rain such as freedom and democracy cord was a toot and a half believe me i still have dreams and nightmares about him ill never escape him perhaps you know the story he was one of the most famous men the agency ever produced and i would say having known most of them the best he was thrice touched by fire when i went to work for him in he had first of all lost an eye as a marine officer in the pacific cord never discussed it but we are given to understand that he saw the hardest of hard combat even the gory squalor of handtohand with bayonet and entrenching tool against a desperate enemy cord was too diffident to wear an eye patch knowing that it would make him too famous too young he simply slipped a glass orb in the vacant socket and only a man studying him would notice it was the idea of the eye gone on iwo or entiwok or one of those godawful neverheardofagain places that was far more powerful than a showy patch would have been his background after the war is probably pertinent he emerged a pacifist having seen too many bayonets crammed into the bellies of teenage boys whod never gotten around to getting laid he was attracted to the idea of oneworld government so that nations wouldnt send fleets of boys with bayonets after one another on flyspecks in far oceans he was active in the united nations movement and labored sweatily in service to that dream somehow around after three years of hard work it dawned on him that the whole outfit had been infiltrated and taken over by commies and that it would henceforth work exactly the opposite of its intended missionthat is it had come to exist to enforce the hegemony of the red over the blue disillusioned he made contact with mr dulles who duly impressed offered him a position he had a talent a nose for it within five years he became head of clandestine services in the directorate of plans and if you dont yet know clandestine was where it all happened a hatchery for mayhem other outfits would call such a unit operations and it would acquire flashy nicknames like the ranch or the ok corral and its operatives would be called cowboys or gunslingers or some such it never looked as deadly as it was a bayful of mildlooking yalies a few princetonians and brownies thrown in the odd nonpedigreed genius with special skills with narrow ties never loosened hornrims or blackframed heavy plastics brooks brothers dark gray or summertan suits barrie ltd pebbled brogues or loafers as dull as the episcopal ministry on weekends a lot of madras rather lurid bermudas red was popular i recall old jack purcell tennis shoes usually battered orange by clay courts khakis old blue buttondowns maybe an old tennis shirt little would one know that behind those bland eyes and smooth faces lurked minds that plotted the downfalls and upswings of tyrants the murders of secretpolice colonels an invasion or two and a coup or three back to cord wizard of clandestine his second immersion in flame was not cool or enviable it was awful in he lost his second child a nineyearold son who was fatally hit by a car in of all places the spiritual home of all us yalies waging the cold war georgetown the loss of a child is something i cannot fathom as emotion embarrasses me i will not linger on it nor try to conjure its effects on him it cannot have inclined him to a merry view of the universe it was his third tragedy that made him famous pitied beloved scorned doubted mistrusted suspected and yet somehow vivid he was in his way a pregeorge smiley smiley in that his public cuckolding served allegorically for the earnestness with which he loved his country and the disdain with which it repaid him the name of his disaster was mary pinchot meyer i suppose she could be termed a transitional woman she came too late to be called a beatnik and too early to be called a hippie wellbred bohemian though it has no public cachet is probably the most accurate term it goes without saying that she was beautiful that she had the social ease being well bred confers upon its progeny why do i insist on progeny instead of children fancy again that she had beautiful flashing legs that most everybody fell in love with her that she was witty effervescent charismatic that she had a great mane of hair tawny and thick and that lipstick looked redder on her than on any woman in washington she must have been sexually precocious she must have loved danger she must have had in her the seedlings of feminism and a need to be a person outside the illustrious reign of her husband as warriorking of the cold war and smartest of the very smart people who coagulated in thenseedy dumpy but somehow glamorousamidtherot georgetown she left him in citing the usual suspect of that age the catchall mental cruelty whatever that meant and i suppose it means anything its attorneys want it to mean did she begin her famous affair before or after the divorce was cord officially cuckolded or did the two lovebirds have the courtesy to keep it legal until the papers were served no one will ever know and its doubtful that cord ever told anyone he never told me the two were georgetowners before it is known that she was friendly with and passed time with his gorgeous if slightly vague wife moreover they must have seen each other in the streets perhaps at the grocery perhaps at the various drunken lawn parties to which their set our set the set seemed to gravitate all the bold young shapers of the future all the technocrats of the fashionable agencies and our agency was very fashionable while the poor boobs of the fbi were not and all the young ambitious journos who would write books about us and end up richer and more powerful than any of us it is not known when mary pinchot meyer began to sleep with john fitzgerald kennedy before the november election or after nor if they waited till the divorce was final but have at it they did and she is credited with at least thirty visits to the white house during his three years at many odd times of day or night it was such a terribly kept secret in the washington of the era that it could hardly be called a secret at all although perhaps she was most in the dark for she may never have quite caught on to the fact that if he was sleeping with her he was in the meantime trying to bed every vagina between baltimore and richmond with the odd moviestar bang thrown in for good measure other rumors swelled in the wake of the two she had some mysterious connection to the least interesting man of the period timothy leary harvard of course agh so it was said that she brought lsd and marijuana into the white house and introduced the president to them in hopes of somehow lessening his childish aggression apologies i have no inside dope on this and mention mary only because she was part of cords glamour and because this was one more reason why plansnot the agency as a whole as there is no agency as a whole only a loose confederation of tribes some of whom get along and some of whom do notwas not a big kennedy supporter possibly i will address that later let me just assure you that as far as i am concerned sexual jealousy was not part of the equationit would not be recognized under the new criticismand that i little hugh latest of cords yale wonder boys was not secretly in love with mary i always loved cord i never loved mary and let me hasten to add i had nothing to do with her murder in or whenever it was i did what i did for the dreariest of reasonsa policy dispute again youll have to suffer my fancy for prose another few pages before i discuss that so i did not murder jfk to punish him for sleeping with mary pinchot meyer the former wife of my boss and mentor and a far better man in all respects than he was too bad it would give a nice spin to what follows would it not if the assassin of camelot turned out to be the noblest of them all and the man he slew the rankest of dogs it would turn popular history where by default i am the most hated of all men on earth on its ear the truth is i never saw or met mary she was only a ghost a whisper a legend as i said i did it for the policy let us pick a beginning spot i know exactly when my subconscious announced its decision to me and my life turned on its axis i also know that the subcon had been busy grinding away for months trying to fit new intelligence new insights new relationships into a sort of coherent action plan that i felt i must engineer even before i conceptualized it something was wrong in the kingdom and it would kill the kingdom if it was not stopped and yet nobody had recognized it no vocabulary existed by which the issue could be discussed and when that vocabulary emerged it would be too late wed be gone wed be doomed if you believed you had to act now if you didnt act now you were letting people down even if they had no framework by which they could comprehend your motives beginning spot a party in georgetown at win stoddards the crummy west side of wisconsin avenue he and his family in an old decaying pile of bricks painted yellow to scare the termites with a garden straight out of a tennessee williams play all thick and jungly and rancid with moisture and rot pathetic fallacy dangerously close i agree and will not mention the garden again it was mid to late october the year of our lord two and a half years into the kennedy era camelot anno duo and all that and what was happening was nothing much a shop party that is to say the glamour ivies of the clandestine services subgroup of the directorate of plans met to let their hair down figure of speech we wore neat trims in those days and ease office competitions grudges cabal forming and the like by applying copious quantities of gin or vodka anthropological note we did not favor brown drinks as a lubrication to the competitive friction of the place as well as a dash of fizz and some citrus wafer in each glass the martini being entirely too uptown mad avegray flannel for us crusaders it was i suppose any staff party any department party any unit party any entity party in any town in any state on saturday night in america in cigarettes dangling insouciantly from lax mouths points made stabbingly everyone too loud too close too drunk maybe some jazz playing on the hifi we were the last prerock generation you know how such things go and thats how they went in the early hours the high officials pay their obligatory visits even old man dulles though deposed after the bay of pigs fiasco came by for a quick drink with his old boys and there was an obligatory lookatme appearance by his successor mccone if memory speaks the truth and to have them both would have been a good nab for win cord came with his youngest boy tommy though i dont think he stayed late and just glowered with tragic nobility while holding a glass of gin in one hand and absently running his other through the boys thick hair and smiling at the gifts of wit and insight his supplicants brought him the almost legendary frenchy short came and went quickly with a beautiful chinese girl in tow an honorary dropin had to be james jesus angleton a friend of cords even if he was charged with catching theoretical doubles and could destroy any of us with a whisper of suspicion it was probably better to suck up to him than to ignore him though it was always a tough call the dry stick colby was there briefly though he had bigger fish to fry that night des fitzgerald whod run the bay of pigs and was rumor had it engaged in replacing fidel came got drunk and left early by cab just powerful secretly famous men behaving with mild sloppiness no harm done probably better for morale that way anyhow by the big shots were gone by most of the wives all of them luscious and creamy tans not yet faded from their summers at bethany and since most lived in thensafe georgetown there were no difficulties about leaving they had been upstairs anyway my own dear peggy among them smith girls mostly as we were yale boys mostly theyd come down give the sweet peck on the check warn us not to drink too much and remind us that we were due at early mass or to serve communion or something ceremonial the next morning at st whatever or first whatever memory speaks i remember a sea of ragged baggy tweed jackets an ocean of blue or white buttondowns maybe a faded madras here or there dimpled khakis the more frayed the better loafers or possibly those suede things that used to be called dirty bucks the hair was short the cheeks clean the noses straight the teeth white we were square yet cool brazen yet innocent savage yet mild win demanded the floor my brothers he cried i need an ethical finding laughter we never discussed ethics to discuss it was not necessary as it was part of our heritage to know what was and was not allowed hmm yes i would say that i would soon push that line a bit so that set the key which was irony accelerated by gin or vod and the need to be funny if not coherent win you gave up on ethics the night you stole morisons final in american classics and again everyone laughed because the idea of win stealing from samuel eliot morison was quite amusing partially because the old admiral was harvard and win hated harvard he never locked his windows what can i say joked win anyhow he paused refortified the gin surge to his system took a puff on cigarette thirtyfive or forty and proceeded dramatically anyhow you know how cord encourages us to dip into wire transcripts from the embassy teams everybody groaned it was a testing ground for newbies their patience and diligence but cord liked to see people seriously busy and if you found as the business often produced an odd spare hour or half hour in the duty day he encouraged you to wander down to embassy wire pick up typescript of recent interceptions and peruse did anything ever come of this i dont know not until tonight so said win im running through the pages from the sov mex city joint and its the usual crap lowgrade beneath action or contempt mostly how come we have to work so much overtime and how come boris got paris when i was supposed to get paris crap theyre just like us always whining and i come across what seems to be some kind of interview with some kind of beatnik defector or something an american i mean southernfried variety an exmarine as far as i can figure out i track down the actual tapes and run em on the reeltoreel and over the earphones i hear this guy lee something something trying to talk his way into russia i should say back into russia because it seemed hed already been there for two and a half years and now and then hed burst into bad russian well igor and ivan arent having any of it even if he was a genuine united states marine and everything but hes the asshole type wont take no for an answer always looking for a fight or a chance to impress and he claims i kid you not oh youll get a kick out of this one he claims hes the guy who took that shot at general walker lots of astonished laughter shooting general walker was a muchapproved action in our circle it had taken place on april of that year in dallas someone had winged a bullet at the old beast as he sat at his desk plotting the next weeks atrocities it missed typically i was soon to learn as the unknown shooter apparently had an uncertain trigger finger major general edwin walker ret was a particular bete noire of clandestine services he was an authentic war hero in both the war we thought of as the war and the thing called korea he had prospered but as with so many of that warrior ilk hubris destroyed him his anticommunism became a zealotry then a psychosis and finally a craziness the commander of the huge th infantry divison in germany he and his men would face the red tanks pouring through the fulda gap if it ever came to thathe lost all perspective he indoctrinated his men with john birch society pamphlets he gave them voting instructions he gave speeches in which he declared that all the postwar democratic leaders particularly truman and acheson had been pink as was by inference anyone who followed their steps in the democratic party of treason its not that we were democrats although we probably were some of usthat would include young hugh with the soft face and meek eyes and grownup pipewere even liberals its not that we were in any way procom but he did not meekly disappear into the night as one would have hoped when he resigned after refusing mcnamaras transfer all this occurring after a newspaperman exposed his ugliness he returned to america a kind of hero like macarthur i suppose though lacking the elegance and poise he set himself up in his hometown as a speechifying oneman infantry division riding his notoriety to the max demanding action from kennedy denouncing kennedy and his minions supporting segregation generally raising hell and crowding the administration into postures not sound in the long run did he seek power himself and imagine a career in politics possibly at one point he threatened to unify his followers of whom there were thousands into a kind of political action force and that sounded ominous he was a troubling psychopath with clear fascist tendencies who did not like the negro or any who supported the negros quest for equality who loathed diplomacy as a solution to soviet expansion as opposed to battle who would leap to his feet and start singing tearfully wheneer old glory was unfurled he may have petered out when his gadfly act grew tiresome and reporters no longer bothered to cover his stemwinders but all through the summer of particularly emboldened by the missed snipers shot he seemed to be everywhere hammering away not so much a threat in a political or operational sense but more of a malign presence clouding the policy debate pushing kennedy hard to the right even as kennedys own instincts may have pushed him hard to the right already i particularly loathed him he made anticommunism to which i had devoted my life stupid coarse loud ignorant rabblerousing and suspect to the intelligentsia a particularly fickle audience with fear of fighting deeply ingrained he would be one more reason for them to withdraw from duty and strength a brute a bully a screamer a sprayer of saliva no one with an iq over seemed to care for him there was a deeper issue it was pure policy and here i apply the new criticism and speak no more of the generals manifold unpleasantries and vulgarities stripped of all psychohistoricalstylistic nuances his sense of anticommunism was inimical to mine that is ours he was macho and wanted to dominate by daring and if it came winning a military confrontation that millions would die in such a conflagration meant nothing to him his was the iron fist in the ironglove approach as it worshipped domination destruction and enslavement as the highest purest form of triumph our gestalt was far different we feared the big war the fulltheater nuclear exchange the dark piles of rubble corpses and poison air that such a crusade would unleash we felt that to defeat communism we had to coopt the soft left and offer sensible alternatives to the billions of people who yearned for freedom from colonialism imperialism and capitalism we fought surrogate wars culture wars if you will we funded socialist parties all over europe we sponsored fashionably lefty lit mags like encounter to woo the intelligentsia to our more reasonable approach we promoted american jazz and expressionism as a way of winning the hearts and minds of the world population to our gentler persuasions if we had to resort to force it would not be the th divisions five thousand patton tanks taking on the ts in a new more tragic kursk on the plains before the fulda gap and not another iteration of fat man and little boy providing instant genocide to half the world it would be a coup here a labor union strike there at most an assassins bullets we were influencers nudgers political engineers reluctant snipers we were not soldiers so whats the problem win somebody shouted okay said win heres the problem do i a snitch this guy out to the dallas police or bwin let it build master comedianbuy him a new box of ammo the place exploded in laughter as well you might imagine no one laughed harder than quiet hugh leaning against the sofa nursing a gin and tonic tamping his pipe joining heartily in the merriment i was aware that i had the answer to wins dilemma i would buy lee something something a new box of ammo it was all different in those days the building was new and smelled of paint and fresh spackle and putty it had yet to acquire the dinge that old bureaucratic sites acquire the grease spots where generations of sleepy clerks have rested their heads the scuff marks on the linoleum the bathrooms leaky and stinky and stained with god knows what all the caulking having begun to rot the light uncertain and sure to go bad when most needed no the new campus smelled delicious seemed in synchronization with the spirit of camelot and also symbolized the official putting of the bay of pigs our last scandal behind us it was all beige with muted carpeting and we had definitely entered the miracle age of the fluorescent lighting system so it was always illuminated in the stark light of scientific truth which was oddly comforting you looked out windows still dustless and smearless and saw green trees everywhere as the virginia countryside cascades of leaf seemed boundless and lush in memory at least it never rained a lot in camelot from some high northoriented windows you could see a flash of the broad potomac and on a sunny day as i remember most were that plate of liquid turned blue itself off the sky overhead trees walks freshness ripeness everywhere cheer and high morale pep and vim and vigor hope and audacity the perfect background for my treachery in the most heinous yet most successful intelligence operation in history the earths or any other planets i had to get that transcript and learn who lee something something was it was not hard to do a few days into the next work week i sent win stoddard some kind of meaningless though top secreteyes only file with a cover note requesting his input on the proposed project i cannot remember what it was and i knew that even with the melodramatic stampings on it win would routinely stuff it in his desk drawer for a few days before he got around to considering it i waited a day then timing it perfectly managed to intercept win on his way to the elevator at on a wednesday afternoon i could tell by the speed of his gaitim not a spy for nothing you know that he was in a hurry win say sorry to trouble you that report i sent did you have a chance to look at it not yet hugh sorry this that the other thing i kind of need to get it circulated could i have it back and ship it on to the next boy on the list if cord calls a meeting on it ill brief you sure hugh first thing tomorrow damn id like to get it to one of wiseners people tonight okay look im in a rush he smiled reached into his pocket and pulled out his ring of keys here the little one itll open the drawer right away help yourself you can give me the keys back tomorrow ive got drinks with a senator at the armynavy club and im already behind good man i said and i exchanged with him the one secret i will not violate in this account the skull and bones handshake as i said easy too easy security then was a twentytwocent hardware lock on a file drawer made of tincan alloy no computers no magnetic striped cards no monitoring video cameras nothing in the beige hallways suggesting war or aggression or intelligence just a fairly messy if broad office that could have housed an insurance company or a newspaper or a drivers license agency it had no spymoviecliche clubbiness and never did this was way before the age of computers and we had not gotten electric typewriters in everything was on paper paper was the fuel that we fed into the flames of the cold war win being a senior staffer had a cubicle with three walls of privacy which made my task somewhat easier not that it wasnt easy to begin with only a few staffers lounged about none of them paying much attention to a familiar figure such as mine and i opened his drawer and found my report and removed it then pivoted slightly opened two more drawers and found what i was looking for in the second one top secreteyes only meaninglessly stamped askew over the title phone transcriptsmex citysov emb and a ref to master file rpkm i slipped this document behind my own legal document locked everything up and went back to my desk i eased it into my briefcase for study at home but not before seeing for the first time the name that would become so indelible to the lens of history in such a short time and thus i met lee harvey oswald my first encounter with him that night after peggy and i had enjoyed an oldfashioned and put the boys to bed and she retreated to her boudoir and i to my study was not compelling it was in fact repellent i read through the interview transcripts recorded september and at the soviet embassy rm g at the first day and the next kgb and why do you wish a visa lho why sir i renounce capitalism and wish to raise my family in a society that values the teachings of marx and the struggles of the workingman kgb but you spent years with us mr oswald and you seemed at a certain point to have your fill of the teachings of marx and the struggles of the workingman lho sir that was not my fault i was undone by jealous people who hated me for my intelligence for marrying the most beautiful woman for the heroic will they sensed within me as the great lenin and stalin were envied and hated by petty rivals i recognized almost everything i despised in a man he was arrogant which combined with his manifest stupidity made him particularly appalling he was pugnacious bellicose yet quick to retreat and start sucking up aggressively to watch the crude ploys of his personality over the play of the interview with boris and igor in agency argot all russian operatives even if their names were known as these were went by the noms de guerre of boris and igor was somewhat dispiriting hed throw himself at one until he ran into resistance and then hed throw himself at the other on and on it went they didnt have to play mutt and jeff with him only mutt and mutt from what i gatherednot having seen our files on him or the fbishe was some kind of epic failure having bungled every job ever handed to him having offended every boss who ever hired him having betrayed every friend who ever reached out to him he had that classic ineffective personality all front and bluster backed by nothing of substance bravado for show cowardice for content a braggart and a phony and i guessed that all he claimed for accomplishments would turn out to be lies as they did throw in some other defects an inability to concentrate an exaggerated sense of grievance an iq that would be classified dull normal no outstanding compensatory talent and the little mans classic resentment of all things in the universe larger than himself he would be both a bully and a coward a liar and a cheat without charm or charisma prone to true belief in nonsensical goals in all a human wreck waiting to happen that would be my department he explained to them that his goal in life was to get to castros cuba but the cubans sensibly had declined they had left him with a proviso that if he could get a visa from his good friends the russians they would allow him entrance on that document for a limited amount of time here he was giving himself up to the maw of history in order to achieve the greatness he knew as his own and to claim his place in the socialist firmament it was a tough sell particularly on the second day by which time boris and igor presumably had been in contact with kgb moscow had seen synopsized accounts of lhos unspectacular two and a half years in minsk and the no doubt unflattering comments on his personality and work ethic from socalled jealous people and had reached the proper conclusion the reds are familiar with this oddity of the american system it produces men who can move mountains build industries win global wars and break the speed of sound it can down migs over korea at a sixtoone ratio at the same time perhaps inevitably it produces a small number of malcontents of ambitious dreamers who lack the skills or the diplomatic grace to achieve anything in life and rather than face their own inadequacies they blame some amorphous structure called the system and look for its opposite where they believe they will shine then they spend their dream lives imagining themselves as secret agents destined to bring down the larger apparatus and be rewarded by its opponents whose conquest they have so wonderfully lubricated these odd birds know history superficially and never notice that the first thing a socialist totalitarian state does when it takes over is round up all the secret agents who have worked so hard in its interests cart them to the lubyanka by black maria at midnight and plant a bullet behind their ears reds cannot tolerate traitors even traitors who have aided their own cause ask the poumistas of the spanish revolution who made that discovery while standing at the execution wall in barcelona oswald knew or cared for none of this he was determined to be a traitor though he had nothing of value to offer his new friends failing completely to master the nuance that treason was a negotiation and that it takes two to trade and had failed miserably at his first attempt little mongrel how i loathed him that night sitting in my study in georgetown listening to the midnight crickets and enjoying a splash of vodka then came the key exchange late on the second afternoon after theyd already given him their negative decision and before calling in the goons to eject him from the property forcibly when hed come back to protest i gathered that neither boris nor igor was there and this new fellowwell call him ivanwas a little higher in the kgb tree he seemed wiser smoother less awkward in dealing with the screwball american ivan tells him mr oswald it is our conclusion that you would not be happy in the soviet union a second time any more than the first my own recommendation is that you could most appropriately serve the revolution from within your own borders pursuing these activities you have mentioned such as passing out leaflets for the fair play for cuba committee and arguing passionately in private with american citizens on the merits of our system versus yours lho sir do you know who youre talking to i am not some stupid pamphleteer not by a long shot i am a soldier of the revolution i am a man of action kgb here now mr oswald please settle down we do not need an incident lho crying no you listen to me on april i was the sniper who took the shot at general walker fascist traitor bully wouldbe tyrant enemy of the left of socialism of cuba of the ussr that was me in the dark with my eyetie mannlichercarcano sixfive bang i had him dead center i just didnt see the window frame that deflected the shot me i me i went to war for us and for you i risked prison the electric chair i kgb mr oswald please get hold of yourself theres no need a few minutes later he would pull a gun and begin to gesticulate wildly then break down sobbing on mr bigs desk it ended with him deposited in the mexico city gutter what did he expect how deep could his selfknowledge have been he had no awareness that the nakedness of his needs and the tragedy of his incompetence were the signals he broadcast the loudest he had no idea of the ocean of space between the ideal image of the self he wished and pretended to be and the tragic limited feckless little twerp whom he forced the world to see up close and instantly he was a mess the worse he was the better for me it took no genius to see the path by which he could be manipulated into anything and such a ploy was easily within my capabilities the plan formed perfectly with no need of revision and only a little required preparation it would be so simplelike giving candy to a baby to make certain of my own intentions i applied the new criticism to my plan laboring intensely to occlude personality opinion immaterial knowledge or rogue or random feeling from consideration and concentrate entirely on the text that was oswald understand its dynamics and dimensions without regard to outcome or hope or past indignities or whatever it was that formed the twisted creature he was i must say although this sounds egotistical i felt somewhat like a great white hunter with many tusks in his lodge on the track of a titmouse i was so overgunned for this safari it seemed a little obscene so i made a pledge to myself that though i would use oswald even as i loathed and despised him i would make a tiny effort to see the humanity that lurked underneath to understand what forces had so warped him and try to reach somehow the soul in him and touch it with a gesture that in whatever larger context of manipulation and betrayal it arrived had a whisper of authentic human feeling i had tasks to be done first i had to conjure up a fantasy operation and code name so i could liberate black funds to pay for my instantly conceived oswaldwalker operation which involved selling cord on a fiction sure i had enough money from uncle colt and his councles winchester smith wesson and remington to say nothing of the duponts the five marques of general motors and the whole industrial cash box that sustained my portfolio to pay the limited expenses this thing would cost on my own but in case it ever came back to me any investigator would go to finances on the first day and learn that i had spent a hundred grand of my own dough on a mystery project in november i could swindle the money from the agency far more easily than i could swindle it from myself and it would be protected in perpetuity by our agencys larger mandate to keep all things secret it has not been uncovered to this day nearly fifty years after the fact generations of case officers enjoyed this privilege some corrupt and for their own benefit some pure at heart and laboring in the hope that they were helping win the war as for my pitch it would not be difficult i enjoyed high status in clandestine services as the recent removal of mr diem from both presidency of the republic of south vietnam and occupancy of planet earth was conspicuously viewed as a victory for our side and had found its origins in a classified report i authored entitled us interests in rsv an assessment for the future which made me a star in factions of the agency far beyond my own more on this later second i had to secure the oswald master file as indicated on the transcript an assignment any thirdrate secretagentman pretender ought to be able to bring off for the record i will summarize with apologies to any of you reading this account who havent a taste for sober explication and prefer the rush of narrative i cannot however let the narrative rush without satisfying myself that i have fulfilled the expositional requisites if only for the one reader in a hundred who requires such a thing as for the fictional operation i named it peacock and sold it to cord without a hitch establishing a hundredthousanddollar budget out of the bank of new york shielded by accounting ploys so subtle that only a few men none of whom worked for the government were capable of penetrating them peacock i claimed was meant to look at the possibilities of identifying young harvardyaleprincetonstanfordbrownuchicagoandotherelite graduates who had writing talent and seemed headed for the powerful luce publications or the new york times or the upstart post properties that had just acquired newsweek cords wifes sister was married to a prominent newsweek fellow to show you how small and cozy the world was in those days with an idea to nurse them in their careers with secret deposits of information not money they would be offended by money so as to accelerate their climb and at the same time make them indebted to us although theyd never know who us really was peacock was named for vanity as i assumed such fools would be morally vain and easily manipulated i would write cord a monthly report on what scouts i had befriended in the thickets of academe and what i had offered them and what we could expect from them it was wonderful as it was entirely unsubstantiable no actual journalist would know he was being manipulated by us and could never squeal and no one could look at a particular piece and say yes the tip came from us or no it didnt thats how the old agency was it worked on a trust i was only too happy to betray in search of a larger contribution as for acquiring the oswald paperwork again not terribly difficult i memorized the master file number as referred to on the transcript jacket then went to records at a particularly busy timemonday when all the girls were overworked with juniors who had been requested to pull files for this or that invasion of italy or nuclear detonation over moscow scenario the place was chaos and anguish as i expected the girls overtaxed and bitter because they were too smart for their jobs and too connected to be treated this way by mrs reniger head of files in one of her perpetual menstrual flareups the wheels were definitely off the cart so i pulled liz jeffries aside she was peggys older sisters daughter and my niece by marriage i said liz cords on a tear i need this fast oh hugh the wan beauty replied distress making her more lovable than usual we are so behind liz its my tail on the line she knew who had gotten her the job with its glamour opportunity to marry a spy a much better catch socially than a diplomat or a legislator so she said look you know the system just duck back there and pinch it dont let reniger see you thanks sweetie i said and gave the childshe was a few years younger than i but she seemed from a different generationa peck it was a common enough thing so no eyebrows were raised i slipped back sliding by a busty young thing in one of the aisles and being careful to make no accidental contact with her breasts so that she wouldnt remember me found the file opened itthe files were controlled by a series of master locks that old bitch reniger an oss london vet opened each morning at and closed each evening at and slipped out the oswald file and the one i had requested hid mr os inside the covering one and dropped my file request slip in the box for recording that night i made further contact with lho i will not bore readers with intricate accounts of one of the most overbiographized men in the world the details are depressingly familiar a chaotic childhood ensued upon the tooearly death of the father the strange domineering and slightly crazy mother marguerite hauling the family all over america in hopes of finding a place to stay marrying twice wrecking both marriages hauling lee and the other two boys from school to school state to state poverty to prosperity and back to poverty in a single year sometimes no wonder he was so screwed up he was always the new kid in new york his growing malfunction was spotted by an alert social worker who wrote perhaps the most penetrating prose everlittle did she know three thousand authors would eventually come into competition with her yet never best herand alone in the world seemed to worry about where this sad bean would end up she was underwhelmed by the narcissist marguerite as mom and the incoherent wandering as lifestyle and thought the boy had it in him to do great harm if not put into some kind of treatment quickly in the whole mad circus that was the life of lee harvey oswaldand i am speaking as his recruiter his betrayer and indirectly his murdererthis brave lady alone did a job we can take pride in as americans too bad for lho and jfk nobody listened marguerite snatched him away from the dogooders and hauled him back to texas or was it new orleans before anything official could be done influenced by his older brother little lee like many a small man who dreams of toughness joined the marine corps immediately out of high school from which he did not graduate like everything he attempted it came to nothing the marine years were wholly undistinguished and anyone who trusted him to guide an airplane to its landing striphis official jobmust have had rocks in his head i saw that the marines didnt let him do much of that sort of thing as they always had him on noncrucial duty somehow he managed to shoot himself in the arm what a dimwit it was in the service where he first proclaimed himself a communist to the irritation of all around him in his various postings you wonder why some fellow pfcs didnt beat the hell out of him and spare the world the tragedy that ensued its one of the few times the united states marine corps has failed in its duties it won the battle of iwo jima but it lost the battle of lee oswald and once he was out his first moveanother hastily considered crusadewas to defect to the soviet union our first notice of him came via the state department after hed gotten into russia on a student visa and refused to leave sensibly the russians didnt want him eithernobody ever wanted him and for a while state and kgb fought to see who would inherit him as a consolation prize he spent two and a half years in the soviet union mostly in an electronics plant in minsk mastering the intricacies of cheesy transistorradio assembly he met and married a young woman who seemed quite attractive in the photo i wondered in my study that night if the poor gal knew what a damaged package shed hooked up with he burned out in russia and managed to talk his way back into the united states i am well aware that some in the conspiracy communityconspiracy community god what an appalling concept it was both loud and wrong for half a century have maintained that the cias fingerprints are all over this strange sojourn good god the only fingerprints on it were mine and i knew paper didnt record fingerprints so i was safe what i saw was what real life produces as opposed to the dark master planning of the spy conspiracy believers the shaggy shapeless pilotless planless bumble of luck circumstance and opportunity as this weasel of a man tried to get two giant bureaucracies to pay him the slightest bit of attention agh you could feel their lack of enthusiasm in the slow grind of their cogwheels as eventually while the long dreary months passed this nobody was allowed to reclaim citizenship in a country he loudly despised from that point on we got a new narrator a much beleaguered fbi agent named james hotsy who inherited leei will call him alek from now on for that is his russian nickname and marina and i both called him thatwhen the fellow came back to the united states from russia he was known to the bureau as a suspicious person given his welldocumented love affair with the reds poor hotsy of the dallas field office overworked and underloved had alek added to his immense caseload and it was my privilege to read his reports in photocopy because at that low level of security the two agencies happily shared data hotsys picture of him more or less confirmed mine although the hostility he received after aleks return added a particularly unpleasant new pathology the chronic whine hotsy could find nothing hed done that was illegal only in poor taste which should be a crime ive always believed but who listens to me on these matters hotsys intensity picked up when he discovered that alek had been to mexico city in late september and visited the cuban interest section and the soviet embassy and soon he was interviewing marina her friend but never aleks ruth paine and anyone else who had knowledge of or insight into alek again he could come up with nothing substantial because oswald himself was not substantial he was as they say in texas all hat and no cattle nobody had any need for him not even marina for mrs paine passed on to special agent hotsy the bad news that marina frequently displayed bruises on her arms or swelling around the eye alek was up to his tricks again i do not have one here before me as i sit in the sunlight on the veranda scribbling and merrily riding the vodka express to the amazement of the servants watching the slow progress of shadow across the far meadow awaiting a call on my satellite phone that will inform me whether my current threat is finished or has grown more complicated but i do know that at that time i had a photo of alek that face was soon to be burned into the consciousness of the world i expect it will never be forgotten at the time who could know who could anticipate what i saw was american workingclass sui generis remarkable in its unremarkablity it was an old shot taken by a newspaper when our selfproclaimed communist hero ma call the papers returned from russia to proclaim the glories of marxism but the folly of communism only a trot could appreciate the nuances its unlikely alek did the camera reveals truths things that alek did not know about himself and would not learn the thickness of his nose his most prominent facial landmark revealed or at least represented his pugnacity he had a thickness to him in many respects both physically and mentally a kind of fixation on a goal or object from which he could not be stirred his eyes were beady and small and squinty and any hollywood casting director would see him as a villain no a minion who administered the beatings or the knifings but had no grasp of mr bigs vision and simply took it on trust he had a small mouth that gave him an unattractive piscean quality his face somehow pointed as it reached its end point in the surly orifice surrounded by thin lips his receding hairline and overbroad forehead seemed to suggest the same motif and all of these features together created a typology as amplified by the perpetual shroud or grimace of annoyance he wore he looked exactly as he was surly obstreperous selfindulgent charmless you knew he would be tricky to deal with to command he would be a resenter a creep a wife beater a natural traitor an obdurate whiner a tooquicktomeasure quitter i dont know if he was a little monster because he looked like a little monster or he looked like a little monster and so he became one i doubt if any of his three thousand chroniclers do either in any event i stared at that picture committing its nuances to memory sometimes a man in life can look so unlike his photo you can hardly believe one is the record of the other i sensed with alek this would not be a problem and that when i saw him first in the flesh i would recognize him right away i can remember lying in bed listening to peggys even breathing to the night rush of wind and knowing that my boys were down the hall as secure as possible with futures fixed before them and thinking of little alek pawn and creep lynchpin and sucker upon whom the weight of my plan would pivot and i hoped he was up to it that was when i realized that very night he wasnt it turned on shooting alek was a trained marine marksmanwhatever that meant and i suspect in those dreary peacetime years not muchyet he had missed a target according to news reports who sat at a desk forty feet away with a rifle that had a telescopic sight good god even i could have made that shot i realized that shooting wasnt just shooting he had done his rifle work in the marines with that old warhorse the m garand rifle a heavy steady accurate semiautomatic that had served from the halls of montezuma to the shores of tripoli with distinction he could not have had a garand rifle at his disposal in texas for his try at the general hed called his gun an eyetie mannlichercarcano sixfive a circumlocution so baffling that our poor typist had no idea that eyetie was argot for italian if it was italian it was probably some piece of surplus junk with a squishy trigger and a vinoswilling peasants intrinsic precision which is to say none at all and that would be his weapon of choice and ours too as it was linked to him by paperwork witnesses and circumstance for the job i had in mind then there was the larger issue of incompetence he had failed at everything hed ever tried and this meant part of him expected failure and the expectation became the father of the event could i trust him could i risk my whole career and good name to say nothing of a long stay in a texas penitentiary on this idiot it had to be clean smooth crisp efficient professional not a bumbling staggering mass of twitches and mistakes i dont think i slept a bit that night or the next either and i began to doubt the wisdom of a course that depended on firstclass work by an idiot thats how lon came into it and because of lons presence it made a whole universe of other possibilities real and unleashed my imagination in ways that astonished even me chapter swagger summarized his findings for nick at a meet in a dallas coffee shop hes not tracking you asked memphis maybe he hasnt made the leap maybe he doesnt know who i am maybe im off his radar so far maybe he doesnt exist then whos trying to kill me bob youve made a lot of enemies it could be anyone right im just playing devils advocate here the same hired killer got james aptapton fair enough you got him i got a feather in my cap we took a bad actor off the street forever nice transaction all around any word on this krulov the oligarch whos supposedly in with the izmaylovskaya mob yes and no it turns out that through his many companies comrade krulov has many official contacts with american corporations such as ford motor company mcdonalds m procter and gamble and on and on to investigate wed have to get justice department approval and convene a task force with subpoena powers and begin a massive effort do you think we have enough to take it to justice swagger knew the answer of course not what about i can never remember the name yecksovich ixovich that guy owns a gun company weird name youd notice that name the name turns out to be a nickname means nothing his father was named aleksandr and when he was a kidthe father i meanhis little brother had trouble pronouncing it so he called big brother ks pronounced ix ix stuck the guy goes through life as ix he grows up has a kid and since he was a successful goon he gave his son the patronymic russian middle name of ixovich thats all dimitry ixovich spazny spazny is hardcore kgb in line when yeltsin dumps communism and gets all kinds of breaks and becomes a billionaire i have his businesses and hes invested all over the world like the rest and as with krulov id need a federal task force to begin to make a dent in his affairs thats not going to happen afraid not its just me an saic on the outs with dc and you a contract undercover i can finesse some backup and nurse you through the system with as little exposure as possible i cant fund you i cant make a major issue of you if that happens our wiggle room goes away and already im getting odd looks from my second whos not sure whats going on whats your next move i have to make contact with richard monk again one way or another hes a sure conduit to whoevers pulling strings i can play him and see what happens the swagger investigation method shake the tree until hired killers come out hope you can kill them first then learn what they knew never fails loud dangerous but sure i agree with you and my wife and daughter i am too old for this shit but i dont seem to have another choice except maybe to go away and let old hugh alone you could never do that even if he tries to kill you again richard was just sitting there his usual breakfastegg mcmuffin hash browns coffee and ojand suddenly there jack brophy was he slid in next to richard with a cup of coffee hey richard he said long time no see friend he shook richards hand and richard sort of choked had to swallow and said jack im glad youre all right the way you disappeared oh that bob said family crisis had to take care of some unexpected issues jack richard said there was a shooting on the night you left near the street where you disappeared a man was killed trying to kill someone else they say somehow i worried you were involved me said swagger no sir im a rabbit i love the guns but only when im shooting at some faraway fuzzy animal or on a nice safe firing range swagger laid some stuff on richard about how hed done some experimenting back in idaho and he was convinced that whoever shot jfk used what he called a hybrid of some sort two calibers mulched together but richard couldnt stay with it he didnt see how two bullets could fit in the same er bullet or two shells in the same bullet or two cartridges in the same shell something like that then swagger went off on the daltex building still on daltex richard said the angles are right but it was a huge public building full of people coming and going its almost impossible to believe anybody could be brazen enough to get in and get out plus the cops sealed it off within three minutes youd need to have a sniper going in the front door and out the front door unseen in the middle of a mob scene i dont see how it could be done you used the right word brazen i figure these boys were topoftheline pros the kind of guys who dont make mistakes and have nerves of steel mafia hit men richard said that grounds been trod over and over again and nobodys picked up anything but craziness i didnt say mafia fact is i dont have no theory about who yet im still working out the how if i get the how maybe ill find the who the gist of it turned out to be that jack wanted richard to help him find some old guys who remembered how daltex was in the old days he had to build a case that getting in and out that day was feasible he swore richard to secrecy within the community he declared himself the sole owner of valuable intellectual property richard said hed look into the possibilities but discreetly because of the value of his intellectual property jack told richard he was afraid of a claim jumper or someone beating him to the punch hed be the one to contact richard in a couple of days he told richard if you dont know where im staying and youre captured and tortured you cant give me up ha ha not very funny richard thought but being a nice guy he laughed anyhow okay said nick initial contact made now weve rerun richard monk i was able to slip that one through and that guy jeff neal the computer genius i had him do the actual search hes the best and if he cant find anything theres nothing to be found or its been buried by superpros at a deep level we can say once again we come up with nothing its the same as it ever was brown graduate twenty years us army cid mostly in europe good record he retired as a major said bob how can that be good any fuckups jeff got his records fabulous fitness reports all the way through even reading between the lines the problem is that after all the military intel branches clogged up with careerists who saw it as a fast way up the ladder by the very fact that was what they did they made it a slow way up the ladder plus monk was in europe a specialist there and nobody wanted to move him to baghdad hes on record as making many transfer requests but he was too good to let go so they fucked him for his excellence bob snorted sounds like typical service shit he stayed in germany while the connected career boys got to the sandbox and soaked up all the promotions he was never going to make lieutenant colonel so he took the outattwenty and went to washington and eventually connected up with that lefty foundation that pays him well and sent him to run their show in dallas we can find nothing untoward about him except the japanese porn collection and the bangkok vacations man said swagger the way this is going i may head out to bangkok too this is the hard part i knew id have to get to it sometime i suppose it might as well be now pardon a shot of vod sometimes i call it vod the impaler yes impale me vod impale me ah thats better poor lon he is the tragic figure in what happens it was a shame to watch it happen it was worse to have made it happen he was given so much and it was taken so cruelly he soldiered on heroically without ill will doing the best he could then i used him and turned him into an official monster the years passed and he never betrayed me he never quit on me he never resented me he never violated his pledge he just had to be alone for a while he was an honorable man so i used him again and this time i got him killed at least he died as he never believed he would or could with a rifle in his hands in the intense rapture of a manhunt in any event and for the record lon scott was my cousin on my mothers side his mother being my mothers sister the family dunn old money maybe older than mine she married a man who was far richer than she jack scott texas oilman connecticut gentleman farmer biggame hunter champion rifleman aviator extraordinary war hero fifty missions in a b including the nightmare that was ploiesti and the father who paralyzed his own son lon was born to be a hero and he genuinely achieved that status young at fourteen he shot and killed a wounded lion as it charged him his father and a professional hunter in what was then called british east africa his reflexes were the fastest and when the beast came out of the high grass at fifteen yards lon stepped in front of the older men took the charge and put two nitro express solids into it as it leaped and when it hit him and knocked him down the animal was already dead as for lons character that was a story he never told or wrote he was a fine writer see his classic hunting africa in the fifties which i believe has been reprinted recently it survives only because others told it of him so frequently it made the later tragedy even more tragic lon was born to wealth and rifles the former he used modestly never bragging never splurging always generous to family and causes the latter became his life i suppose he got it from his father but there is a genius gene for the firearm that does not respect class or race or economic circumstances it simply descends and enlightens once every generation or so i suppose the great gunfighters of the west had it possibly a few thirties desperadoes clyde barrow for one possibly pretty boy floyd and a few great lawmen the great snipers have it a few of the great hunters lon had it from the time he laid eyes on a rifle that was his life in those daysthis would be the early thirtiesthere was no opprobrium attached to such a fixation and in his circle it was celebrated and encouraged his father gave him his first before he was five years old and by the time he was ten his skill with the firearm had made him a legend he spent summers on the texas ranch where he became a damned good cowboy im told by the time he was eighteen and left for yale hed filled a bunkhouse with horned treasures as well as the lion and three rhinos two cape buffalo and a dozen or so antelope species from his adventure in east africa that being a randy part of the world im sure his nobility grace and courage earned substantial reward between silk sheets during the many evenings in happy valley where all the exiled brit nabobs and their grumpy but beautiful women gathered to smoke drink and fornicate in abundance his real passion was for thousandyard shooting he won his first wimbledon cup in had an off year then won again in and it is an extraordinarily demanding discipline that brings all the shooters skills into play not only his stamina to hold his position for great lengths of time but his ability to dope the wind and reload ammunition skillfully to get the maximum accuracy for the range the rifle and the conditions he was at the time an honors graduate of yale and unspeakably handsome it was thought in some circles that he would follow the path of another great shooter the national prewar skeet champion robert stack and eventually move into movies his grace with a gun in handthen a necessity in the american movie industryspoke well of his chances and his high iq which made flash memorization a trifle as in scripts and his intense empathy which marked him as a charismatic young man all suggested such an outcome he was betterlooking than rock hudson not a homo smart as a tack and could hit a running target offhand at a hundred yards ninetynine times out of a hundred he was already famous by and was just waiting for the next big thing to happen to him on october when lon was thirty his father shot him in the spine he fell to the ground and never walked again characteristically lon never made much of it it happened thats all lets get on with it of course the thousandyard shooting was out most of the hunting was out so he devoted himself to the newer sport of benchrest and its application in the fields varmint hunting and he spent most of the summer at his place in wyoming killing vermin at distances up to a thousand yards off a bench and experimenting with the best ways to get this done he learned a lot and it could be said that at one time he knew more about longdistance shooting than any man on earth he remained on good terms with his father the official story it was an accident a model in a prime hunting weapon was dropped and it went off though the safety was on nothing could be done except get lon to the emergency room fast which was what his father and other shooters on the line did lons life was saved but his mobility from the waist down was not he spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair no one ever said a thing what could be said the act had no meaning except for the tragic randomness of the universe its cruel whimsy whats the line whom the gods destroy they first make interesting possibly i made that one up or possibly its vod speaking but in outline antioedipal dynamics are visible the father so long thought a great man sees his usurpation in his young son he loves the boy but a serpent of ego whispers into his subconscious he will replace you he will steal your memory you have given him everything he will take everything you are soon to become a supernumerary thus the gun falls from the hands thus the safety is perhaps not forcibly off but wedged gently into that nomansland between on and off thus by freak mischance or the weird imposition of evil will on a falling object the muzzle is lined up for one tenth of a second on lons lower spine and the rifle discharges he was lucky i suppose it was s no quad no respiratory problems no iron lung no electric wheelchair or writing with a paintbrush by mouth muscular and athletic he adapted well he could drive he could prepare food his mind was intact he could dress drink laugh read watch work at his bench s so much more mercy than c still what is his subconscious making of all this perhaps he has felt the hate under the love perhaps he has heard a whispered resentment in all the lavish praise perhaps he knows his father a little better than the father knows himself he suppresses he conceals his feelings as ive said he gets on with it who knows what snakes have been released into his mind what need to strike and kill fathers universally or fathers symbolically or sons who like him were created by their fathers and then surpassed them no one knows any of that least of all i but it may explain why at some level lon was okay with the monstrosities i pitched him and kept the faith to the very end in fact he died of the faith in late october none of this could be imagined i told myself i had a question for lon that needed answering perhaps denying to myself the inevitability of the course i had set up i did know that i couldnt be affiliated by record in phone contact from house or office and i was aware that nobody knew whom that devious busybody james jesus angleton was or was not wiretapping my solution to this was to drive downtown on a saturday afternoon wearing suit and tie park around fifteenth at n walk up n and stride boldly into the office building at upon whose facade the words the washington post were emblazoned in some sort of ancient gothic typeface in those days newspapers were wide open to the public especially if the public looked as official person as i did in dark tie dark suit white shirt horn rims and natty little princeton haircut as it was called i strode in nodded at the eversleepy negro guard and took the elevator to the fifth floor where the newsroom was sited it was hardly a tenth full as a skeleton crew watched teletype machines or took dictation from farflung correspondents on the rare breakingnews stories i sat down at marty danielss desk aware that i looked a little like marty who covered the defense department for the post and rifled through the pink stack of messages that had accumulated i hoped marty called mo back and i hoped he avoided the angry fellow at the west german embassy and i hoped that susan didnt call to cancel lunch or anything more interesting and then lazily i picked up the phone as a senior correspondent marty enjoyed direct access to longdistance and i quickly dialed lons number i got monica she put me through to lon in the shop and i said hello hugh hows my favorite secret agent have you caught dr no yet the slimy bastard changed lairs on us again he found a new volcano and hows my favorite cripple you know hugh said lon amiably i thought i felt a sexual impulse below my waist the other day but it turned out to be a house falling on my knee we both laughed i had followed his steps to choate and yale he was five years older and id gone down to new haven my senior year to watch him on the football field where i took great pleasure in the way he left the harvard bambis smashed and bloody in his wake that was his strength deployed in righteous fury seriously how are you doing lon im fine except for the ulcers on the leg they dont hurt but theyre a little annoying ive got a piece due for the rifleman at the end of the week and im going to a conference on combatoriented pistol matches next month that looks to be interesting you just spying away like a busy little beaver i said spy spy spy all day long soon enough our jocularity out of the way i progressed to issues lon something has come up on the job and i thought id run it by you good lord hugh id think if anybodyd have experts on this sort of thing it would be you fellows im sure we do but its the weekend nobody spies on weekends plus it will take three days to go through and three days to come back via channels you probably know more than they do anyway ill do my best ive come across a reference toi pretended to withdraw it from memorysomething called an eyetie mannlichercarcano sixfive now i am a professional intelligence officer so i have been able to determine that eyetie probably means italian excellent hugh i feel we are well protected indeed but the rest other than the fact that its from the firearms world is gibberish well he said i dont know too much about it it could refer to the rifle or the cartridge depending on context or both anyhow the rifle was the italian service rifle beginning in and running through the late fifties it was probably the worst service rifle of its generation less effective in every respect than the german mauser the british leeenfield our own springfield even the french lebel but they kept making em in various iterations including a short cavalry or ski troop version i see i said how would an american get one very classified buy a stamp thats the secret when the italians joined nato they converted to our armsyou know the garand thecaliber machine gun the carbine the automaticso they sold off a billion or so of the mannlichercarcano rifles in various formats as surplus and a great many of them came into this country where they are being sold as downmarket hunting rifles by mailorder gun houses i see ads for them all over the place these guys put a cheesy jap scope on them and sell them as deer rifles for the workingman who cant afford a winchester model so its no sniper rifle its basically a piece of junk barely accurate shoddily made ugly as sin with a cranky bolt throw it shows that the italians never took war seriously particularly when you compare it to a brilliant piece of engineering like a mauser now the cartridge it shoots is more interesting and probably deserved a better rifle than the mannlicher its a mediumbore flat shooting round meant for battle at more or less longer ranges the bullet is heavy for its size with a thick copper coating to hold it together on those rare occasions when italian marksmanship prevails its a viable round for just about any thinskinned game animal up to and including a whitetail id use it on a man before id use it on a bear if you hit a man in the head with it goodbye head assuming a relatively short range out to two hundred meters hmm i said by which utterance i meant information received but not processed what have you got in mind hugh is this about some kind of cuban invasion operation because you have a line on ten thousand mannlichercarcanos real cheap if so id strongly suggest that you avoid the temptation theres a lot better rifles available in surplus than pieces of junk manufactured by people who eat spaghetti for lunch and take a nap every afternoon thanks lon let me ask you thiswhat can you do with it do with it kill out to two hundred or so meters smallgame animals human beings possibly rabbits if you could hit them which is doubtful shoot targets unsatisfyingly grow annoyed at the roughness of its action and the sloppiness of its trigger cut it up for firewood thats about all but im a snob dont listen to me no no thats not what i meant i suppose i meant could youuhcounterfeit it you mean build a fake one good god hugh thats ridiculous im not explaining myself well because i dont have the vocabulary im thinking about forensics about the clues guns leave that identify them its not something i know anything about except from perry mason heres what i think i mean if you knew you had an agent who was going to shoot somebody with a mannlichercarcano but you didnt trust that person to make the shot could you do something so that somebody else who was a much better shot could shoot the person with i dont know the same bullet or the same kind of rifle at the same time but it had been fixed so that no investigator would ever figure out that the second gunman with the second rifle and the second bullet was there counterfeit in that sense i mean is this for your next james bond novel hugh i wish i were that clever lon well let me think okay im guessing another requirement would be a silencer its really called a suppressor you know so the real assassins shot doesnt draw attention they have such things i asked i was so naive then yes its not just a movie gimmick hiram maxim figured it out over sixty years ago any clever machinist can handle it its just a tube with baffles and chambers and holes in it ill look into it and call you back and no no let me call you back when a week next saturday will you be available hugh i live in a wheelchair im always available he said cheerily i sold cord on a scouting trip to boston for peacock had travel book me moved five thousand dollars from the peacock account to larry hudgets foxcroft account knowing he hadnt bothered to master the finances and would never find it drew a check and cashed it in a small bank in the negro section of dc where id done some business and could trust mr brown to be discreet the next day i flew to boston checked in to the hilton in cambridge then took a cab to the airport and paid cash for a ticket to dallas twa in my grip was a suit that i had bought in moscow in which fit as well as a shirt id picked up in brno a few years ago and a black tie id bought from brooks brothers when i had to attend milt golds fathers funeral i figured even a genius like alek wouldnt notice the difference in tailoring quality between the brooks tie and the gum suit which looked and fit as if assembled by chimpanzees i checked in to the adolphus rented a car and put on my russian monkey suit it felt odd to walk across the hotels pretentious oldoak lobby with its harvard eatingclub flourishes dressed like a kulak afraid he was about to be arrested nobody noticed it was texas after all nobody notices anything down there an hour or so later i parked my rental car across the street and watched when the downtown bus dropped off its passengers at pm on the corner of zane and north beckley in the suburb across the trinity river aqueduct called oak cliff it was probably november maybe the sixth i had no trouble spotting him he wasnt cut out for any kind of undercover work because if any cop or agent were searching for a spy theyd pick lee harvey oswald out of any crowd he was more substantial than i expected i thought hed be a feral little rat quick and shifty ready to pounce on any morsel of cheese but he was thick solidly muscled stumpy rather than fast solid rather than limber or light on his feet you couldnt miss him he looked miserable his charmless uninteresting face was set on grim to the highest number he looked around sullenly as if waiting for the fbi to arrest him already and he radiated a leavemealone frequency at its highest pitch about four people got off and the three others knew each other and were joshing and talking the way guys do the world over and alek just blew through and by them head down walking steadily down north beckley it wasnt far because his roominghouse at north beckley was just a few houses down from the zanen beckley intersection nevertheless he passed within five feet of me on the sidewalk completely oblivious and i got a good look not that there was much to see head slumped forward shoulders slouchy he plodded along in cheap workingmans clothes that probably wouldnt be changed that week he wore a pair of gray chinos black oxford shoes of inferior manufacture and a green jacketnot a sport coat a kind of golflike jacketover a brown shirt all nondescript i watched as he turned in to the roominghouse a rundown dwelling as nondescript as he was i moved the car to the next block and through my rearview mirror watched and waited in fortyfive minutes he reemerged his hair wet from a quick standing bath but otherwise dressed the same this time he walked more jauntily to the bus stop climbed aboard paid his nickel and sat halfway back i followed a few car lengths behind saw where he was dropped waited until he went into a building and then parked and moseyed in it was the dougan heights branch of the dallas public library and i quickly checked the meeting bulletin board and saw that in room the sovietamerican friendship society had convened the prospect of spending a couple of hours with a crowd of american commies whining about capitalism plus a few bored fbi agents nauseated me so i drove to a good restaurant had a steak and got to bed early the next morning either i was early or he was late but i saw him coming down the street to the bus stop finally after missing the and the i was again wearing my gum suit and id done a little purposely bad buzzing with my electric remington giving myself that raw poorly barbered look seen all through the east bloc where tonsorial grace had not yet penetrated did i think alek would notice these things probably not consciously but one never knows what the unconscious picks up and how that contributes to frame of mind receptivity trust and malleability if i had been able to come up with russian underwear on such short notice id have worn it too he paid no attention to me as we passed on the sidewalk made no eye contact but as our shoulders almost brushed i said in russian good morning alek kostikov sends his greetings and continued on hey he said in fractured russian after having chewed the information over for a few seconds and processing the information that i knew his russian nickname and that i had evoked the name of the kg bwho had interviewed him in mexico city hey who am you i turned and watched him eat me up with his ratty eyes trying to decipher the strange figure before him you should say who are you i corrected youre still unclear on your transitive verbs eh alek then i smiled and hurried on my way i thought he might run after me and knock me down but he didnt he came a few steps in my direction and then i guess the bus rolled in and he was caught in the dilemma and at last decided on the bus i heard him run to it when it passed i felt his eyes on me as i walked along seemingly uncaring i gave him a restless day a sleepless night and another restless dayi used the time to recon the area of general walkers house to check his public schedule to visit a gun store in oak cliff with the absurdly texas name ketchum and killum on kleist and to buy three white boxes of mannlichercarcano ammunition and actually hold the thing that some cowboy tried to sell me telling me it was the best damn rifle on the market for the money it seemed like a piece of junk to me though i had been prejudiced by lon it was nothing like the fine sleek rifles that i had seen lon shoot when we were boys i thanked him but politely declined that evening i watched alek get off the bus check around nervously for whatever his imagination had prompted him to suspect then start walking i pulled up next to him before he could turn in to the roominghouse comrade alek i called in russian come ill buy you a vodka for old times sake he looked around nervously then dashed to the car you am might be seen he said at this point i cease to replicate his horrid russian i will recount in standard english as if he spoke in standard russian simply because i grow tired of mangling the language to no real effect you get the picture no nobody will see us agent hotsy is watching his son play little league in fort worth tonight we have the world to ourselves direct me to a tavern please i dont know dallas he muttered something and more by body language than words did he guide me to a godawful dew drop inn or some such and we invaded the dark crummy insides it wasnt crowded and was garishly lit in one corner by a jukebox which an idiot had primed to play hillbilly music we found a booth more or less isolated in the rear i dont really like vodka alek said in english good i answered in russian it was a manner of speaking i wouldnt order anything out of the way in a place like this as one of these men might remember us talking in a foreign language drinking stolichnaya i would also speak in english but i speak it with a new england accent and that would probably be more remarkable to them than russian a sluggard came over and we ordered mexican beer when he brought the frosty cans the waiter also brought chips and some kind of tasty red sauce it was my first experience with mexican food and i was surprised by how much i enjoyed it who are you alek said leaning forward and fixing his beady suspicious eyes on me youll never learn my name security but youre from im from your friends you know i know hotsy the police agent who bedevils you in the mexico city embassy i know kostikov i know yatskov i have talked to the first russian woman you loved ella german i have spoken to your wifes former lover anatoly shpanko i have talked to your wifes uncle ilya prusakov the mvd colonel i have discussed you with your comrades in the minsk electrical appliance facility i will say that all of them have one thing in common they have a very low opinion of you comrade i took a slow draft of the beer enjoying it immensely watching a whole dictionary of emotions flash across aleks dim little face anger at being reminded of his mediocrity his many failures defensiveness as he tried to quickly construct his battlements against the truth fear that someone was here for him pleasure that he had been noticed at last by what he perceived as the apparatus bliss that someone somewhere somehow thought he was special finally he said i made mistakes but only of trying too hard i believe too hard it makes some people hate me it seems they all hate you they resent me people always resent me do you know the term projection from psychology no but ive studied marx ive studied youve studied everything but yourself which is why nobody cares for you alek he looked gloomily into the distance an actual tear may have formed in one of his eyes he started to speak but i cut him off in the whole world nobody believes in you to all you are negligible a failure a man without a past or future you beat your pregnant wife and terrify your dear little baby daughter junie you are the shame and scandal of the russianspeaking community in dallas you go to the cuban embassy and they throw you out and you go to the soviet embassy pull a gun break down sobbing and they throw you out no one in the world believes in you alek oh wait i just remembered there is a man probably a fool who thinks you might amount to something who thinks you can be saved who alek asked me i said i had a few more of the chips with the tangy red sauce delicious i loved the crunchiness of the chips with a vigorous salty aftertaste subsumed in the fiery yet not unsubtle blast of the sauce clearly by color tomatobased yet not sweet like so many tomato derivatives the whole thing suddenly going nuclear to the taste when the pepper component detonated then ameliorated by the tidal thunder of the cold cold beer a fellow could get used to such a thing i looked back at alek say these chips are swell i dont believe ive ever had mexican before why dont we order some dinner go ahead youre the expert call him over and order for us i think id like another beer please i held up my empty can it was called tecate and had a lime slice wedged into the opener puncture why had i never tasted this before it seemed not to have made it to georgetown yet i made up my mind to search out a mexican restaurant in dc and take peggy and the boys that would be an adventure alek waved the waiter over and ordered something from memory as we waited for the food i made small talk so tell me when did you begin to notice that socialism in reality was considerably different than socialism in theory and that working on an assembly line anywhere in the world is pretty much the same he wouldnt engage for a few seconds but then lurched on sullenly it wasnt the work it wasnt the guys they were okay guys some of them liked me i just start thinking about reality and lose my concentration you messed up thats all it was no i had big thoughts i just couldnt get them out but somehow your type will always locate a somehow somehow this somehow that its never your fault somehow its always someone elses fault maybe you should for once in your life forget about somehow and concentrate on one thing do it well thoroughly completely and not give a shit about what happens somehow to you then if you know you did your best possibly soon enough they will know and there will be no somehow he brought out the dale carnegie in me i tried to i tried to he protested thankfully the food camethinking about it now i realize it was enchiladas rice and beans and a taco on the sideand we were spared more chatter as we put it down with another beer again it was a good meal and i was happy for the rest of my life to enjoy mexican whenever the chance arose that much i owe lee harvey oswald we finished without much chatter and i paid and out we went to the car it was dark now and twenty minutes had passed since we had spoken his face was knit tight i guessed partly in fear of saying something stupid partly in confusion he could not meet my eyes when the car doors were closed and id pulled out into traffic i finally said alek you know how it works dont you sir he said in english that is the organization i represent i suppose so you find people who no no not the idealized the propagandized version i mean the reality that reality is that its a big organization and it has many subunits many departments many cells all of them driven by ego fear ignorance full of average men attempting to curry favor with supervisors attempting to be supervisors out of nothing more than petty ambition some work at crosspurposes to others some work at purposes that have no relationship whatsoever to the purposes others work to accomplish and the communication between them is at all times inefficient even weak yes sir he said kostikov and yatskov for example theyre in a division that is charged with servicing and monitoring our embassies abroad they watch for spies they try to recruit spies they also have responsibilities for vetting defectors dealing with walkins this and that their hope is to get through thirtyfive years without making a bad mistake or offending a superior if they accomplish that they get a medal a nice but hardly remunerative stipend and possibly a small dacha outside moscow in one of the less fashionable districts if so they can consider themselves heroes and successes you see i do to them you are simply a problem they do not care to deal with imagination is not their strong suit careerwise for themand there is no other concernits best you go away fast and forever and not upset or reroute the kostikov express to a dacha yes sir but im in a different department when news reaches me of the crazy american who says he took a shot at general walker im not annoyed im fascinated i have to learn more my department has use for people like the crazy american were charged with actually accomplishing something not merely maintaining a security perimeter alek nodded we occasionally do whats called wet work can you guess the meaning of wet underwater the idiot said i sighed try again alek oh blood you kill people rarely sometimes its always a tricky decision its not like theres a doubleoh license or anything and we can go about blasting people with burp guns but yes sometimes when necessary say a defector a murderer of one of our people a particularly loathsome political opponent then we may kill people we reached his neighborhood i pulled up a few doors down from his roominghouse because i had no way of knowing if people there knew him and might remember him getting out of a car driven by a stranger alek i said i have a present for you its in the glove compartment please reach in and get it he opened the glove box and took out a white box of western cartridge co mm mannlichercarcano ammunition he held it in his hand jostled it felt its considerable weight his eyes lit up bullets he said for my gun you know kostikov and yatskov thought you were making up your story so did everyone in the apparatus except me i thought perhaps this man who lies about so much and has not finished one thing in his life nor impressed one person perhaps he is telling the truth about the shooting thats why i had to know you alek i had to look into you thats why the travel the investigation all the interviews but not till now this second have i confirmed for myself that yes you are the rare man who believes in the cause so much that he will do the wet work for it its easy to hand out flyers and go to meetings with homos and negroes and federal agents its easy to defect if you get to marry the sexiest russian babe and begin fucking her right away its easy to tell people that youre a red that you believe in the workingman and that changes must be made because you like the attention it gets and the ruckus it causes the campuses and beatnik cafes are full of such worthless scum but rare truly rare is the man for whom the revolution is worth dying for and worth killing for he would be the man of action an ideal i believe you are such now get out go home go to bed and prepare for another day of glory boxing books on the sixth floor i will contact you again after these matters settle in that tiny little rathole you call a mind but i go i commanded and out he scooted chapter a week passed before swagger dropped in on richard again this time intercepting him at a pharmacy where he was picking up prescriptions damn said richard jumping visibly when his old pal jack brophy showed up from nowhere you are tricky he declared im paranoid as hell swagger said ive done some work and have made some progress dont want any of those other boys knocking me off you might be better off to relax and let me introduce you to some people who might be able to help you too shaky for that richard you mean well but ive got spiders in my mind telling me everygoddamnedbody is spying on me i got it i got it well how about thisi think i could help you no one else involved hows that richard laid out his plan he knew someone in the dallas association of nursing homes which put out a weekly bulletin his idea was to run an ad requesting that anyone who had worked in the daltex building in and wanted to share memories with a researcher contact richard then richard with jack along would interview that way they could at least get a sense of how likely it was that a brazen penetration like the one jack envisioned had happened swagger thanked him thought it over watched him surreptitiously for a number of days then okayed the idea the next week they visited three homes and talked to three old gadflies two of whom said it was possible one who said it wasnt the building was particularly deserted that day mrs kolodny recalled we all rushed down at noon to get good spots to see the president and afterward who wanted to go back to work i didnt go back to work until monday it was so sad mr ofarrell disagreed primarily because it turned out he was an amateur assassinologist if you look youll see that the houston street side of the building had a fire escape and there was a bunch of people sitting there watching the president now if someone fired a rifle shot theyd be the closest theyd be the ones whod hear it and testify that a shot came from just forty or fifty feet above them yet theres no testimony to that effect goddammit so how could it be swagger said possibly they used a silencer silencer shmilencer said the old guy hollywood crap thats what you get from tv and the goddamn movies no silencer really silences you cant make a sound that loud and sharp go away it might be lowered somewhat but if he was shooting out the window theyd feel the shock wave and theyd hear something damn suspicious the only thing any of those folks heard was what everyone else heard which was three loud cracks from the rifle of no one other than mr lee harvey oswald swagger knew this not to be the case absolutely as the sound itself could be modulated by a variety of techniques primarily the efficacy of the suppressor and its location in an otherwise sealed room a savvy shooter would place himself well back from the narrowly opened window containing much of the sound and much of the shock wave unless the people beneath were listening for it and had experience with the vibratory patterns of suppressed weapons it was unlikely that any lowerfloor fireescape sitters noticed a thing what with so much else going on simultaneously swagger ambushed richard at the palm over his weekly steak and martini mind if i join you swagger said appearing from nowhere just as richard had finished his meat and put in an order for coffee and key lime pie man said richard you were in the spy business i know you were you move too silently you follow too well aint true a bit said swagger i picked up my skills by being worried about communist guerrillas in the mountains of ecuador had a runin with the same mob different race in malaysia those were men who wanted us exploiters of the wonderful peasants dead i developed a sixth sense for danger and i learned how to disappear in plain sight i was once three feet away from two guerrillas with aks and went so still they looked right past me and here i am to tell the tale you could have fooled me anyway i wanted to tell you about something i discovered on the net thats interesting to me a lot of it is shit but this gal seems to know a thing or two swagger went on for a few minutes about the discovery some researcher had noted that when the fbi expert robert frazier had talked about the relative zero of the hollywood scope on the oswald rifle it was clear that frazier a distinguished highpower marksman was unfamiliar with scopes and unaware that if a scope is miszeroed it will shoot groups in the same spot on the target relative to its miscalculated aiming point altered only by the geometric progression of the range if its an inch low and an inch to the right at fifty yards it will be two inches low and two inches to the right at a hundred yards and three inches low and three inches to the right at yards out until the distance where gravity and falling velocity have a larger influence than the scope misadjustment the point is said bob how can this guy say the rifle is accurate if he doesnt know the most fundamental thing about the physics of the scope how can he say a scoped rifle is easy to shoot he doesnt know enough to make either of those judgments but those are key factors in the commissions conclusion that oswald was capable of making the third longest shot at the smallest and most quickly moving target its not really my thing said richard i guess i get it but it would be helpful if you could show me some of this stuff i will i will said swagger when ive got it all put together i want to fly you out to boise and take you to my range youll see it in the meantime please be thinking of ways i could package this or someone i could write it up with oh all this on the rifles richard said as if a new thought had kicked its way into his head it reminds me ive been meaning to mention this to you ever hear of a guy named adams in the gun world i mean nah said swagger cant sayoh wait theres a guy named marion adams a writer does these big fancy picture books on say ruger or winchester like corporate histories or historical collections that the guy richard handed him a card marion f adams it said firearms historian and appraisal expert it had a cell number an email address and a little picture of a sevenandahalfinch colt peacemaker richard said he came by a couple of weeks ago he told me some story about his theory of the casei hear a lot of those you know but his was very guncentric it was sort of like yours i thought having to do with some winchester gun firing bullets meant for the carcano at a much faster speed shit swagger said goddammit thats my theory its my intellectual property youre telling me another guy who no no wait a sec heres the deal he said he was way behind the curve on what did or did not happen in the event and he could never catch up the websites gave him a headache hes not a net guy he wanted to shortcut the process did i know an investigator who was conversant with the facts of the assassination the state of the art of assassination research and theory and firearms does that sound like somebody we know swagger didnt say a thing his face darkened as if his mood were tanking fast his eyes narrowed finally he barked it took me years to get where i am i sure dont want to give it away to some fellow with fancy friends who writes the words nobody reads in picture books its my intellectual property itd be like giving away a piece of land with a mineral claim on it jack said richard i see your point dont let it upset you i didnt get the impression he was too organized or anything did you tell him about me not by name i told him i had a guy in mind who would fit the bill perfectly and ill get back to him and tell him youre not hold off on that if hes published it means he knows publishers i mean real new york publishers like simon and schuster and knopf and random house the big guys whose books get noticed by everybody i had an idea that if i got it together somehow id take it to them even if theyd probably steal more than the little guys what do you want me to do oh said swagger going a little over the top on the angryproprietor thing hold off a bit let me look into this guy im not a writer im an engineer maybe he could help me i could help him but goddammit dont tell him no more about me memphis got agent neal working again and the results came back quickly enough he summed them up for swagger a few days later in their weekly coffeeshop meet at a randomly selected seattles best in the suburbs okay once again we get a clean read he said marion adams fiftynine born into gun aristocracy his father was ceo of a nowdefunct connecticut gun valley company that mainly produced target pistols of very high quality when target shooting got small in the late sixties the company folded but marty as he is called knew everybody he was er connected and he was able to forge a career as a writer and consultant hes published nineteen books many on the bigticket manufacturers his connections get him in the doors he writes whitewashed company histories he knows everybody and he produces what many people consider technically beautiful volumes ive seen em said bob may even own a few he seems to service the highend gun trade you know the bigdollar guys who go on safaris with gunbearers and hunt doves in argentina with purdey shotguns and pay fifteen grand for a painting called ducks on a chesapeake morn got the picture said bob knowing the kind of huntcult gent who was secretly in love with the traditions of thirties biggame hunting and yearned to tramp the savannah with hemingway and philip percival at his side and would have cocktails with the memsahib under the lanterns before dining on linen every night in camp while the boys did all the work he makes most of his money advising these guys on what and what not to add to their collections its a tricky market and the main problem is counterfeiting turns out that counterfeiting a rare gun is much easier than counterfeiting a thousanddollar bill or a rembrandt marty works both sides of the trade he matches collectors to guns gets a fee from both sides of the deal and validates the authenticity you dont want to spend two hundred thousand on a rare early colt and get it home and hold it to the light and find made in italy stamped on it no said swagger you dont it does seem like a world where a crook could make a ton of loot thats why someone of martys integrity is valued now there have been rumors its so psychological guy buys a bigdollar piece on martys recommendation but his buddy says hmm looks fake to me and the guy who was proud and confident is now full of doubts and he says something and it gets repeated but nothing substantial that we could find like richard he seems on the upandup and theres no record of contacts with exotic operators no hint of criminal malfeasance got it said bob are you going to meet with the guy absolutely i think its the right decision i can find no suggestion that anyone here in dallas is on to you those two exvice pis are out to pasture theres no underworld interest and our random intercepts never turn up surveillors everything is looking like hugh or whoever he is has either lost interest or hasnt picked you up yet swagger nodded albeit a bit grimly thats what every man i ever killed thought one second before the bullet arrived i am fully aware that as i write i am being hunted i await word from the various agents i have afield confident that my disguises my barriers my fortifications my confusions are impenetrable i am sublimely confident hmm then why am i drinking so much vod anyhow let us return to the far more interesting past and my courtship of the fool called lee harvey oswald after our dinner meet i let him stew a day or so let him think it through get himself ginned up not force too much on him at once i spent the next day in west dallas trying two more mexican restaurants truly enjoying each one i read the times at lunch thoroughly as was my custom noting yet another white house conference on the republic of south vietnam which was disappointing everyone in its militarys lack of improvement in the wake of the coup that killed diem a few weeks earlier i dont know what they expected and it began to make me mad again not merely that my report had been twisted to nonproductive ends but that another parade seemed to be forming and i fancied i could hear the drums drumdrumdrumming and the bugles blowblowblowing i had spent six months there from october through march and i saw little in the place worth dying or killing for the southerners werent a warlike people and without a great deal of aid theyd never stand up to a sovietfortified and sovietadvised north vietnamese army i was long gone by the time of the coup which seemed to me a clear doublingdown on an unwinnable bet but i heard reports and could imagine the look of fiery anger on captain nhungs face after hed shot the diem brothers in the head in the back of the armored personnel carrier on the way to general staff headquarters at tan son nhut i saw the picture that circulated in langley president diem a pleasant enough fellow in my dealings with him with his head blown in at close range anyway i tried to put my anger aside and pursue my true goal in dallas to look around at a cocktail lounge called the patio a few miles north of downtown in another dreary suburban neighborhood the place had little appeal to me but it was said to be a favorite of general walkers where he loved to sit on the outdoor platform and drink margaritas whatever they were with his staff he was slated to give a speech at smu november and having spent some time with the dallas times herald i knew it was likely that he and his boys a few years later though i was out of the country at the time he earned the quotation marks around boys would head there for the hooch it didnt take much time for me to figure where to put alek so that he couldnt miss although he would and where to put whomever was shooting backup so he wouldnt miss yes i had a pretty good idea who that would be but that lay in the future at least a week i made notes to myself considered angles heights and so forth tracked getaway routes and although the planning of sniper assassinations wasnt one of my strong points i satisfied myself that late on a monday evening with vehicular and pedestrian traffic low alek could easily cut through the alleyway across the street hide his rifle then cut through backyards to a pickup spot meanwhile if needed our real shooter would have undisturbed escape by vehicle all that would take place in the four minutes that in those days was the norm for dallas police department response again according to the times herald i felt we could probably do it in two with practice maybe even one within a day or so everything would be back to normal in cowtown and a certain nasty piece of work would trouble nobody least of all the united states of america again i think i should say that committing to this murder made the next murder seem not so great a reach in clandestine services we had a culture of leader killing we had done it before we would do it again as i have said a few weeks earlier the apc had clanked into tan son nhut with its bloody cargo aboard and everybody was convinced the killer had done the right thing and was willing to assume the mantle of murderer for the sake of his country there were others a red puppet in africa a series of strongmen in guatemala an appalling boss in the evertroublesome dominican des fitzgerald was by rumor at least currently planning the removal by violence of fidel castro thats who we were thats what we did there wasnt all this weepy nonsense about the sanctity of life the preciousness of each human soul someone had to do the mans work and we were the men who did it took pride in it felt righteous about it orwell never said it i am told but whoever did must have worked for clandestine services in the fifties and sixties people sleep warm in their beds at night because rough men do violence on their behalf we were the rough men although we had very smooth manners that night he got off the bus and started down north beckley again and i pulled up good evening alek i said possibly some vodka tonight agent hotsys son has another game he looked either way then jumped in and off i sped he didnt wait for me ill do it ill help any way i can its my duty ill do it congratulations alek i said three complete sentences without a grammatical error youre learning quickly this time he said there wont be not any mistakes there goes the record i said anyhow i went on let us move beyond grammar i take it you have understood what i have not yet stated but only inferred and what it is i require of you i mean not just your heart and mind and body your faith in revolution and the righteousness of our way but what in the practical sense it is i want you to do i do i have to hear you say it comrade he took a big breath and broke eye contact he knew he was leaving shore sailing off again on uncharted waters to what he hoped would be his destiny i will this time succeed i will shoot and kill general edwin walker for crimes against peace and the revolution i can do it i can be the assassin there wont be any mistakes no there wont be any mistakes because this time i have drawn up a plan an approach route an escape route we will time things to the second we will measure the distance we will know that there are no impediments to shooting our intelligence will be sound our preparations thorough we will do this professionally yes sir now tell me alek why is it were doing this what why because you asked me forget that part i mean politically strategically morally what is the purpose this is murder were talking here its not to be done lightly on a whim or for shabby psychological needs hes a bad man he needs to die thats all and thats enough for you it is it isnt for you not for authorization in my memo to authority i argued that general walker applied rightist pressure to president kennedy and kennedy wasnt politically able to stand up to it after failures at the bay of pigs vienna and the cuban missile crisis i thought america won that i was angry propaganda khrushchev traded him russian missiles in cuba for american missiles in turkey we won as our missiles were far less valuable than yours kennedy knows this and is spoiling for a fight and general walker is shoving him into it wherever he chooses to fight it will be a mistake possibly the republic of south vietnam possibly cuba possibly somewhere in south america perhaps even europe walkers popularity squeezes kennedy and something tragic for both our peoples happens because of walkers insanity and kennedys weakness so we take walker out of the equation by taking one life perhaps we save many i agree i agree said alek his face lit with inner zeal again i thought i saw a tear why did i do this it is odd im not sure i know alek was an easy mark i could have gotten him to wear ladies clothes in times square shouting long live russia if i had wanted to i think i was arguing with myself and using him as a surrogate i wanted to hear the arguments said out loud and i thought in some way i might speak from my subconscious and say something more honest than i intended i might learn something of my own true motives as opposed to the policy mumbo jumbo by which i justified the killing knowing that policy is malleable and that it could be used to justify anything i suppose i was also preparing for upcoming seductions knowing i would have to convince the man who would act as backup shooter to do so and he was far smarter than alek and might have come up with unexpected counterarguments in another sense i felt i owed it to him he was the expendable one the sacrifice if it happened he would be left to burn to death in the texas electric chair screaming of red agents whod given him orders straight from smersh i doubted if the officials who executed him could keep a straight face during the operation i wanted to give him at least an idea of where it fit in in the grand scheme of things and the belief that he had somehow made a contribution it might help get him through the long night before they turned the switch in a few days i will contact you again at that meeting i will present you with a plan and a map i want you prepared do not get in any arguments do not read any papers do not trouble your mind with new information i want your mind unagitated since youre a fighter and a yapper i know thats hard for you but do your best for me i want you ready to read and commit to memory do you see you have to concentrate for me because you cannot possess the plan on paper if things should go wrong you cannot be found with a plan written in russian it would cause problems security do you see i do but what should i do if im caught you wont be caught i know but plans can backfire it could happen then be patient say nothing we will get you out somehow possibly a prisoner trade possibly a breakout i dont know we always get our people back thats our reputation if it goes sour and you keep the faith well spring you and youll spend your life in havana as a valued citizen who sacrificed for the revolution well even work out a way for marina and junie and the new child to come to you i knew i could count on you comrade he said okay now go i will get you the plan you will memorize it you have the ammunition do you have the rifle its with marina in fort worth she doesnt know i still have it i can get it anytime excellent leave it there for the time being concentrate on concentrating in all likelihood you will do this thing get away with it and in months to come possibly we will find other wet tasks for you to do you will help the revolution this is what you want correct i will show you he reached into his shirt and pulled out an envelope that he had been careful not to fold he pulled a photograph out of it see he said this is who i really am i pulled to the side of the road and turned on the light in the car the photo later became worldfamous when it appeared on the cover of life magazine and a thousand crazed conspiracy books youve seen it alek in black holding his rifle across his body his pistol tucked into his belt and in his other hand copies of the daily worker and the trotskyist internationalhe had no idea that these two organs like the parties they represented were in blood opposition to each otherstaring forthrightly at the camera lens in poor marinas hand wearing that eternal smirk of the sucker who thinks hes figured the game as the game is figuring him i could see that it was a kind of romantic image of the red guerrilla that animated his deepest fantasies like something out of the s an assassin a bomber with a bowlingball explosive and a long sparkling fuse a gavrilo princip a figure out of conrad i felt sorry for a man who could be so deluded even as i said yes alek that is it thats the spirit we need i spent the next few days holed up working on the plan i went back to the operational zone a couple of times i took public transportation to and from i walked the distances i charted the police activity i noted the mileages to the police stations i had margaritas at the patio so i could determine whether aleks movement on the roof or my shooter in the car where i would place him would be particularly visible i even climbed up on the roof in old blue jeans and boat shoes yale poof playing jedburgh commando i got a good look at aleks shooting position and tried to imagine his actions i knew certain things first that the immediate result of the shot would be a frozen moment of fear followed by absolute chaos as i saw it my shooter would have the general zeroed and be well prepared for aleks shot if alek missed he would fire a silenced shot i took on faith that lon would solve all problems finishing the issue but witnesses would remember it differently some would say there came a shot and the generals head exploded and others would say there was a shot and the generals head exploded a full second later what if alek missed and the bullet was recovered that would be dicey yes but it would be so confusing to everybody that no one would get it there would beassuming lon had worked it outno record of a second bullet existing since the patio was brick the building behind it stone there was a good chance that a miss by alek would shatter on a hard surface in any event the worstcase scenario seemed to amount to confusion conflicting theories an eternal mystery a suspicion that there was more to knowbut nothing substantial leading to our plot except a theoretically captured aleks crazed insistence that the reds had made him do it the difficult part wasnt the plan itself but reducing it to easily remembered components i tried to find a mnemonic device that would help aleks pea brain retain the information i came up with apple approach position patience liquidation escape i knew that liquidation was weak but i had to get a known word out of the puzzle since it was a word associated in the popular imagination with old nkvd practices and employed frequently by the patron saint of agents ian fleming in his bond books which alek had read devotedly it was okay but not optimal i thought that authorities would consider it the kind of hokey nonsense a fantasist like alek would come up with each letter had further information associated with it approach had a set of numbers which meant bus no to thirtythird street fifteenminute walk down thirtythird to target area and so forth and so on very secret agentlike i thought alek would enjoy the primitive spycraft and if i got his imagination fired up maybe hed apply himself i sent him a postcard knowing in those days of postal efficiency it would be delivered the next day it simply said texas theatre pm show that was the movie house a mile or so from his roominghouse where ironically he would be arrested on november that night he showed up the movie was absurd something about teenagers on a beach and i could not stand it id noted him when he came in i went sat next to him for a second and dropped the plan in an envelope in his hands i whispered take it home commit it to memory and copy it in your own hand do not destroy it it must be returned to me when next i make contact every night study it until you know it by heart run through it one night and be sure you can make all the connections i will be back in contact in ten days or so the week of the eighteenth our target date is november twentyfifth that monday night then i left you must remember in those days there were no easily accessible copying machines xerox had yet to take over the world there was no fax and the only copiers were extremely expensive photocopiers of the sort that produced negative imagery to which alek in his reduced circumstances would be unlikely to have access i knew that making a copy of it was beyond him i left him in the texas theatre while silly california girls did the frug and the monkey onscreen and disappeared into the night i had become an expert on dallas transportation so i walked a few blocks west and caught a bus downtown the next day i flew back to boston and then back to dc my next mission was to see what lon had come up with it took most of the day to get back from dallas i had to pay cash for the flight to boston take a cab to cambridge sneak upstairs come down and check out of the hotel take another cab back to logan then the flight to national the only problem was the checkout where the clerk said was everything all right sir we noticed you didnt seem to sleep in the bed i said yes it was fine look if anyone should ever ask itll be my wifes private detectives so take thisi winked and handed him two twenties after having considered the whole flight back to boston how much to pay twenty being too little and apt to annoy him and fifty being too generous and apt to prove memorableand remember to forget that i never mussed the sheets yes sir he said with a smile and i bet the housekeeping reports disappear too in those days all us wolves hung together manhood was a national adultery culture possibly under the influence of playboy magazine which made such activities hep like jazz and hifi i never once cheated on peggy but many was the time i used the pretense of such a thing to help me out of a tight one i called peggy from national and told her i was back id be home but first i wanted to run to the office it made sense because once i was on the gw memorial parkway it was just a few exits beyond the key bridge and i was at our big shiny new campus i went to my officeit was more than half empty because i arrived around and quickly typed up a fictional report on my peacock adventures what young writing stars i had talked to which of them were likely to go into journalism which would waste their lives writing movies or potboilers or even god help them television i should say as an aside that after dallas i moved peacock from its fictional guise to an actual existence and it was one of the agencys enduring successes i made friends through peacock who served me the remainder of my years at langley particularly in vietnam when i ran phoenix and wanted to get the agencys side of the story told in the right papers it exists in slightly different form to this day i also checked on three operations i was in charge of that seemed to require no immediate influence and whose details will only bore the reader as they would bore the writer i sent interoffice notes to a few colleagues with updates questions requests to get back into the flow of things and make sure my absence hadnt been noted then it was home by peggy had a highball waiting and before i had a sip i visited each of the boys to find that the pattern was the same jack had missed me and showed it and gave me a big hug peter my middle boy never had much use for me and more or less communicated his indifference yet i am told he gave the most passionate oration at my funeral in and will hadnt really noticed as hed had games or practice on all the days when i was gone peggy and i had a late supper and she went to bed and i poured another highball and told her id be up in a bit i just wanted to check the mail im glad i did mostly it was bills but there was one strange rather large envelope without a return address hefting it i suspected it contained some kind of tabular matter it had the weight of heavy paper i noted that it was postmarked roanoke near lons place in southwestern virginia i opened it up it was a copy of a magazine called guns amp ammo and it was full of pictures of various firearms and articles on such things as remingtons new a challenger to the model and llamas big mag makes its point loud and clear whatever those things meant flipping through it once i noted nothing flipping through it a second time i noted that one of the center pages seemed heavier or less flimsy than the others i looked closely and realized that pages and had been glued together i peeled them apart and a letter fell out on the floor i had to laugh lon was playing cloakanddagger tricks on me to his own merriment i picked it up and read the salutation to commander bond from technical department re the assassination of dr no disposition burn after reading good old lon ever the cheerful gamesman and it was in that vein he began commander bond i have given much thought and some experimentation to your requirements and believe i have just found a solution put a pot of coffee on because youve got a long night or afternoon ahead of you much of it boring unless youre like me and find the arcana of firearms and ballistics fascinating in and of their own but since thats about percent of the population i wish you luck i should hereby give the same admonition to the reader henry jamess explication of the prose narrativedramatize dramatize dramatizewill hereby be put aside and replaced by explain explain explain for you to understand how we managed to fool the world for half a century you must steel yourself to the assault of the details after reading lons letter i burned it in the fireplace probably a week hasnt gone by in the fifty years since that i havent thought of it for it made as i knew it would what happened possible it was the fulcrum of the event i think i remember it pretty well so i will now give it to you as i got it from my great and tragic cousin lon let me begin by narrowly defining the technical requirements you james bond have been assigned to eliminate one dr no for his multifarious crimes yet you cannot be caught and there can be no evidence of your involvement or the british secret services involvement fortunately you have a handy patsy felix leiter of the american cia that dunderheaded american wouldbe intelligence service poor felix you can manipulate him into almost anything because he so wants to be like the debonair suave bunnybagging commander bond so you have easily conned him into taking a sniper shot at dr no alas he has only one weapon available and that is a surplus war rifle of italian vintage namely a model mm mannlichercarcano carbine with a dreary japanese telescopic sight of questionable utility you worry that felix is incapable of making the shot so you have arranged for a backup shooter of much higher ability to be present at the moment of the killing if felix as is probable misses the agile backup shooter will take the kill in the next second or so but all ballistic evidence must point at felix he is the judas goat in the operation i will not worry here about firing angles getaways placement any of that stuff that is your department i will not worry about the disposition of poor felix that is yours as well mine is simply the technical how can backup shooter x put a bullet into dr nos cerebellum and leave no trace of his existence so that the apprehended felix leiter is held responsible for the shot as proved by the ballistic forensics scientifically applied by experts its the case of the bullet that never was this is what i would do first i would provide felix with the ammunition he is to use having previously secured an example of it myself this i had already done basically on instinct so i was ahead of the game so we give felix a box of mm mannlichercarcano ammunition manufactured by the western cartridge company under contract from the italian government declared surplus by the italians resold to american wholesalers and packaged in a nice white box the bullet shooter x fires is basically identical to felixs and off the same cartridgemanufacturing line at westerns st louis manufacturing facility we have before us one of those cartridges let us examine it it is blunttipped with a coppercoated bullet protruding from its brass case that has an unusually exaggerated length given the overall size of the cartridge it doesnt look like a missile so much as a cartridge case with a cigar stuck in it it is a heavy dense item for its size speaking eloquently of its seriousness of purpose you are aware commander bond that firearms and ammunition are not the stolid imperturbable things they seem they are plastic they may be altered customized improved their tasks changed their performance envelope shifted all kinds of magical tweaking and petting may be applied to them that is what we are going to do with our mm mannlichercarcano cartridge if youve forgotten or never knew a cartridge is composed of several units it contains a bullet which is propelled down the barrel to terminal effect the bullet is powered by rapidly burningnot explodingpowder which is contained in a brass vessel often called a shell or a case the rear of the shell called the head contains a rim which is machined to fit tightly held in perfect alignment by cleverly machined grooves on the bolt thus locking it into the chamber of the rifle the head also contains wedged tightly into its center a magic gizmo called the primer a chemically potent nubbin of specific materials that becomes a spear of flame when struck by the hammer lighting the powder and producing the expanding gas that propels the bullet down the barrel and into history not that it matters but the cartridge is an extraordinary device so efficient and well designed that it has not been replaced in over a hundred years and will not be for another hundred years but back to our cartridge our mc the first thing we do is pull the bullet from the shell easily done with a common reloading implement we throw out the cartridge case full of powder with its primer dont need em this is about bullets not cartridges now let us examine as i have done at length what is before us it is inches long it weighs grains it is coppercovered and its copper covering is somewhat thick thicker than normal as it is designed to be a hard object that does not deform when it strikes flesh but penetrates deeply the copper is wrapped around a lead core which can be seen by looking at the base of the bullet observing the lead interior where the copper hasnt covered we put this bullet in a vise upside down or we put it on a lathe horizontally any advanced hobbyists shop has one or the other we drill ainch tunnel through the latitudinal lengthwise center of the bullet that is through the lead from the base up toward the nose of the bullet though we stop at inch depth leaving the nose of the bullet intact now what have we got we have a bullet that weighs probably grains less than it did originally but has been substantially altered in terms of its performance without sacrificing any of its accuracy next we return the bullet to the vise and we carefully saw or file off about an eighth of an inch of its blunt nose removing enough copper to open up the lead which is much softer to the impact point of the bullet it is now substantially more volatile than it was and instead of being counted upon by virtue of its structural integrityits hardnessto penetrate and stay more or less together on penetration it may be counted upon to disintegrate when it strikes a living target particularly if it strikes the skull or other bone structure that is because of two dynamics first the nose of the bullet which is now soft lead will rupture on impact peeling backward almost blooming like a flower second from within the boredout center has left the whole far more fragile it will atomize in the violence of the explosion expect massive brain damage if the round hits the brain next we take that doctored bullet and reload it in a case for shooting at dr no but wait we threw out the mannlichercarcano case and its powder why we have a dressedup bullet with no place to go or do we heres the key we reload that bullet into the case of a cartridge called the winchester magnum how is such a thing possible stop and think commander bond the mm italian cartridge is simply measured in metricsystem terminology mm equals inches diameter or close enough for government work like assassinations the carcano bullet fits neatly into the win mag case and produces a new cartridge the hybridcarcano which slides neatly into the chamber of a winchester magnum rifle in the interest of making this less boring i simplify you might have to make slight adjustments to the hybrid cartridge or the rifle to get it to fit the actual diameter of the is three thousandths of an inch larger than the barrel diameter of the rifle that might make a difference in the cartridge fit to the chamber but it doesnt require surgery to fix only minor alterations for example you might turn the carcano bullet on a lathe against a hard blade held at a precision measurement and whittle it down three thousandths of an inch or you might neck turn the cartridge casing meaning you mount the shell in a fixture and rotate it by hand against a blade set to a particular depth benchrest shooters do this all the time because manufactured cartridge shells are frequently inconsistent in their neck thickness and in that game regularityzzzzzzzz wake up bond more coffee damn you is the key to accuracy what have you accomplished first of all youve made the bullet now explosive much more lethal so what it was lethal to begin with as any object that strikes a human skull at over feet per second will result in death the subject i assure you wont notice the difference he wont be deader with one round than the other there is no deader than dead more important youve made the bullet more accurate not in itself but now it can be fired in the model winchester with as mine has a unertl x vulture scope one of the best if not the best rifles currently manufactured in the united states of course the idiots are changing it next year and absolutely the best scope the reasons a rifle is accurate have to do with a variety of factors all of which the model enjoys and the mannlicher model does not the precision fit of metal to metal and metal to wood the crispness of trigger pull the fit of the rifle to the human body the precision with which the scope has been mounted to the receiver the quality of the rifling in the barrel and the kind and grade of metal used in the barrel the quality of the glass in the optical system maybe there are others that i have forgotten but you get the picture the shooter with the model has extraordinary technical advantages over the shooter with the and this is before the quality of the shooters their experience their natural levels of talent their strength health stamina and mental preparedness are factored in youve made the bullet invisible you say do you not commander bond sir youre mad i am not at all here is another key point by making sure the bullet explodes upon striking the skull and renders itself into fragments and powder eviscerating the cerebral vault you guarantee that it cannot be read for rifle signature that is no piece will be recovered that will bear any marks from the lands and grooves on the interior of the barrel it was fired through it cannot reveal its fraudulence it cannot be linked to felix leiters barrel but it cannot be linked to any other barrel either from the physical evidence available there is no suggestion or inference that you commander bond were firing your fine model at almost the same time poor leiter was firing his eyetie eyesore dont the witnesses hear two shots when there was only one not at all youve seengood god bond youve starred in movies with silencers no of all the hollywood gun gimmicks those devices are the most accurately portrayed no they do not work on revolvers and no they do not sound like a midget sneezing but a suppressorthe real namecan blunt and diffuse the sound of the report considerably so that people around it are unable to associate it with a gunshot and equally unable to say from what direction it emanated your yank colleagues in the war the oss fixed them on high standards and thompson and sten submachine guns and used them creatively you brits had a gizmo called the welrod pistol same thing ill spare you the long description since i know youre drifting drifting drifting but a boltaction rifle is admirably suited for such a device which consists of a tube attached to the muzzle that tube contains a series of baffles or waffles within it a series of chambers and holes so that the expanding gas is slowed down as it wends its way through the thing until it escapes with a fizzle rather than a pop any competent machinist can put one together for you in a day or you can obtain a professionally manufactured item as theyve been available to certain markets for a long time it so happens that in my collection i have a schalldaempher type the mm silencer the luftwaffe paratroopers used during the war theyre pretty rare but a friend of a friend wanted to move one hed brought back and you can guess the rest of the story out of curiosity and enthusiasm i went ahead and machined a steel application to fit it to my model so that affixing the german device was a snap even with supersonic ammunition which emits a crack downrange but not at the shooting site oh i sense your suspicion it all turns does it not the deception the getaway the mission itself on that bullet how do you know the bullet will explode in gun events something always goes wrong something anomalous or untoward happens nothing can be predicted with percent confidence its too big a risk and on and on and on i left the best for last this winchester magnum isnt just any cartridge its brandnew from new haven a cartridge designed specifically for western plains game shootingthat is longdistance shots at antelope and mulie way out beyond the briar patch possibly in the next county it shoots flat it shoots fast it shoots fasterim talking about bullet velocitythan any bullet known to man the metallurgy of the model is such that unlike the it can stand up to the highest pressures of modern chemistry that the geniuses at olin can conjure that means our doctored bullet will strike dr no not at the velocity of a mannlicher carcano which is just under feet per second but at the full vel of the which is over feet per second it will explode it is guaranteed by the laws not of man but of god that is the laws of physics and still more if it leaves any trace amounts of metal in the destroyed head of dr no and the autopsy doctor manages to salvage them the only possible test will be metallurgical by looking with an electronic device they will be able to determine by comparison with other metallic samples what kind of bullet felled dr no it will prove undisputedly that dr no was shot with a mannlichercarcano bullet manufactured by the western cartridge company and no other ive appended a drawing to chart these developments i want a nightful of martinis for all this labor bond and the sooner the better there was no signature of course i read it over and over then burned it and its envelope in the fireplace having committed the salient points to mind i had trouble sleeping i was so excited but eventually the long day of travel caught up with me and i drifted off the next morning at breakfast i said to peggy sweetie i think we should take a weekend in virginia i havent seen lon in several years and im feeling bad about it peggy said but wills team is playing gilman in baltimore on saturday hell be so disappointed if we miss it oh gosh i said oh i hate to disappoint him on the other hand lon is family also and i feel that we havent seen him in too long itll be okay with will hell understand peggy knew when i had my mind set on something and she also knew my defying her was so rare that when i did so it was for a purpose she relented such was the rarely deployed but nevertheless uncontested power of the husband father and provider in those days i called lon that afternoonit was an easy call from cousin to cousin sure not to rouse any suspicion from mr angletons theoretical eavesdroppers so no subterfuge was requiredand told him wed be down for a visit and dinner on saturday that night i had a mantoman with will he was never a rebellious or resentful son he understood and by that time the boys were old enough to be left alone so there were no difficulties with lastminute babysitters i had one last task other than convincing lon to join my little crusade that was to recruit a third member to the team if lon was to handle the shooting and i the driving and logistics as well as running alek i needed an action guy who could navigate us out of troubles way and handle with aplomb any unseen difficulties or tough stuff that could come up though i had planned assiduously to avoid that while lon and i concentrated on our task i needed someone who was a field agents field agent slick quickthinking tough with a burglars guts naturally i chose a burglar i will call him jimmy costello not his real name because he has sons alive in the washington dc area all like mine prosperous and wellregarded members of the community i want no shame affixed to them on account of their fathers deeds years later i wrote the middle one a letter that got him in to yale it was the least i could do for jimmy costello jimmy was in his forties by this time and well known in the intelligence trade though we assumed he had learned the trade on the far side of the law he had somehow turned to the side of us angels and now worked strictly for the agency or the agencys friends some other agencies and a number of divorce lawyers he may have been the best burglar in washington he could get into any place because he had a natural genius for locks im guessing he was raised in the locksmiths trade as no one could pick up so much any other way he simply looked at a lock and understood how it worked and carried with him always a set of picks and in a matter of seconds could spring any secured door safes took a little longer but not much he had no fear of heights or of walking at midnight along the precipice of an embassy roof gymnastically lowering himself to a window under the eaves hanging by one hand from a gutter and with the other popping the lock then propelling himself through the open orifice our embassy section used him to plant microphones and wire and with his nimble fingers he could loot an inner sanctum of its secrets in a matter of minutes then be gone and leave no trace of having been there and from that night on we were a third party to any discussions between igor and boris and their supervisor just in from ye olde country i dont know if we used the intelligence cleverly or not but we got it cleverly the fbi used him against both sov agents and the italian mafia divorce lawyers against wealthy philanderers so that after the proceedings they were not so wealthy he could have stolen the recipe to cocacola for the pepsi people if it had come to that and he could have gotten us the bomb diagrams if we hadnt beaten the reds to it the best thing about jimmy was his loyalty he could be counted on he was a standup guy all you have to do is look at the history of the irish to understand how that attribute ran in his veins he would have kept mum to the point of torture it was bred into him by long centuries on the bog plotting against my ancestors and leaving them dead more often than not and never snitching when caught out of fear of facing the eternal hell of the traitor that he would never be that he never was his other skillit goes with his profilewas his charming brazenness or possibly his brazen charm he had that irish gift of conviction and when the sneak wouldnt do bullshit would he could talk you out of your underpants and send you home happy i suppose he was a complete psychopath but he was our psychopath and that was exactly what the proposition demanded i met him in the bar of the willard where he hung out every night when he wasnt working jimmy me boy i said in my phoniest movie brogue a joke between us i am he said affecting his own version of a brogue which hed probably learned from bing crosby movies and hows his eminence mr meachum he always called me mr meachum as if i were of the castle and he of the cottage and no amount of argument could convince him to do differently dont know about his eminence i said but im fine it was an old line but he pretended otherwise and laughed we exchanged banal chitchat for a few minutes each consciously eyeing the room to see that no known adversaries happened to be there when we were satisfied that we were publicly in private we proceeded to business might you have a few days toward the end of the month for your old pal meachum i might though i am busy this time of year is there any flexibility alas no my sales plan is cued to something i cannot control it would require your presence in the city of dallas texasour expense of coursefrom the nineteenth to the twentyfifth well stay at the adolphus a firstclass joint indeed it is i need a trusted fellow at my side while i deal with problems as they may come up someone smart tough fast hes not available so i thought of you he laughed they do keep james bond busy these days do they not james bond was on everybodys mind then never have trusted the brits jimmy i said wouldnt take him if i could have him give me a son of the auld sod with a twinkle in his eye and steel in his fists he liked the compliment even if we both seemed to be playing movie roles so dallas he said not your usual sales area mr meachum he was drinking glenlivet on the rocks myself pinch and soda duty takes us where it takes us jimmy id rather it were paris myself i do pay well and if theres hardship involved and some schedule shuffling then ill pay for that a kind of schedulerearrangement bonus as it were well mr meachum yours is my own favorite firm and continuing in their favor is definitely in my interest so aside from travel expenses ill not charge more and i will see you where you want me in dallas at any time on the nineteenth simple as that i got jimmy and as with lons genius and talent for rifles what happened could not have happened without his contribution he was always a rogue and hero the bravest of the brave the truest of the true you see we werent monsters i suppose thats the lesson youve been taught that if we existed we were the vilest of the vile snatching greatness from the young prince and sending our nation on its way to hell but to us we were professionals patriots and men of honor we werent in it for the money or to sell more bell helicopters and mcdonnelldouglas fighter jets but to save lives and lead the nation through the swamp to the hilltop besides we were only going to kill a screwball rightwing general chapter as i said sergeant said harry gardner dad was a man of literature really so his books his private books were all fiction swagger once again stood at the threshold of niles gardners office that booklined cave where the cias famous boswell had tried for thirty years to write novels and failed he could see the red nine lying undisturbed on the desk and the four ceramic bluebirds and the illustration of the six green elm trees on the shelves well said swagger as i say its a long shot but i noted that beside the pistol which is sometimes called a red nine theres that collection of bluebirds four of em and that picture of elm trees six of em it occurred to me that somehow the phrases red nine blue four or green six might have had some meaning to him like in some private way he was commemorating them wow said harry you know thats remarkable i noted those things too and i thought them strange but it never occurred to me to put them in a pattern they were so unlike dad he was not a sentimentalist and those bluebirds in particular are so kitsch that i cant understand why theyre there lets look at the picture he took it down from the wall handed it to swagger then took it back dimestore frame lets see what the picture is he turned it over unfolded four soft copper flaps securing the mounting board and shook the board free of the frame the picture fluttered to the floor bob picked it up and discovered that it was folded in such a way to display the six trees but it was actually an illustration from a redbook short story entitled passions golden tresses unfolded it showed a handsome young man chastely embracing a beautiful young blonde against a forest backdrop the subtitle on the story was her hair was beautiful but was that all david loved the author was agnes stanton phillips good lord said harry now theres your classic fifties kitsch he turned to swagger youve introduced a strangeness to my father that not even i knew existed what on earth does this mean it connects with nothing of your father or his mind or anything that you can think of nothing im astonished wheres this going i found the pistol odd too in its way i noted those other things all with the numbers attached to colors i thought radio call signs agent names map coordinates some kind of color code all of which could have some connection to intelligence work and might have some bearing somehow on the fake name he cooked up for hugh meachum in other words if you can decipher the pattern maybe its the same pattern that connects to hugh or the same principle of pattern is that it something like that i know its thin believe me thin or not its fascinating but way beyond me sergeant it could also be nothing he liked bluebirds he liked trees he liked mausers but he didnt like trees he didnt like mausers he most certainly didnt like bluebirds that i can guarantee you particularly ceramic ones so maybe you are on to something if so i aint smart enough to figure it out ill tell you what you feel free to dig around here as i say ive been over it all and i can guarantee you no porn no hidden notes from mistresses no decoded instructions from his secret masters in the kremlin no movie scripts nothing that anyone but a son would find interesting and even his son didnt find it that interesting i am going to leave you alone with niles gardner and if you find anything more power to you do you need coffee beer bourbon wine a sandwich anything like that no sir the bathroom is down the hall feel free to use it thank you mr gardner bob turned and faced the mind or at least a portion of it of niles gardner he found it intimidating it was all books and most of them bob had never heard of but starting at the top lefthand corner of the top lefthand bookshelfthe book was a death in the family by james ageehe began to methodically pull each one out flip the pages for inserts bookmarks underlines whatever and work his way through the shelves going from the as to finally the zs it took over three hours and from the wellthumbed wellworn condition of the volumes swagger could tell that niles gardner was a man who loved his novels hemingway faulkner dostoyevsky tolstoy orwell dickens wolfe wells bellow friedman golding brautigan pynchon fitzgerald crane flaubert camus proust wharton spillane tolkien robbins wallant he read passionately and catholically a classic in a modern library edition was apt to be found next to something by jim thompson kurt vonnegut and james gould cozzens and lloyd c douglas and herman wouk and bernard malamud and robert a heinlein and norman mailer and anton myrer and nicholas monsarrat and john le carre and howard fast and irwin shaw and robert ruark and franz kafka all were equally displayed and beloved on the long feet of floortoceiling shelves on and on it went and there was no relief from the weary task of unshelving flipping the pages reading the comments then replacing occasionally something would fall to the floor some kind of longago bookmark like a dry cleaners slip or a folded index card or someones business card or whatever and each would indicate a stopping place or a passage of brilliance that niles had awarded an exclamation point finally bob was done he had come across no oddities no irregularities no anomalies it was just a serious readers collection of the best his species had done at the ridiculous effort of telling a long story in prose howre you coming asked harry leaning in the doorway i suppose it was a game try but i didnt learn a damned thing i didnt already know except that the world is sadly full of books ill never read this room makes me feel the same way i he paused this probably has nothing to do with anything he went on but i did find one book hidden away when i was searching it was nonfiction old a first edition it was strange for dad to have and hed hidden it in the bedroom in his nightstand under a pile of magazines what did i do with it swagger waited as the internal drama played out in harrys head i thought it might be valuable so i set it aside for an appraisal and then never he snapped alert wait here i put it in the attic where i have some of dads old suits that ive been meaning to give away he turned and swagger heard the echoes in the old house as the man bounded up the stairs two flights then bounded back he walked in with his trophy some kind of obscure victorian science book though the authors name is slightly familiar i cant remember from where he handed the heavy volume to bob it was the visions of sane persons by francis galton it weighed about three tons swagger turned to the title page and saw that it had been published in its got a bookmark said harry swagger cracked the old volume to the page that sometime in the distant past niles gardner had designated as of special meaning and found himself at the intersection of pages and where he began to read frances galtons comments on numbers and colors ill spare you details on the weekend and the pitch i made to lon and his eventual acceptance as you may have gathered i would make a later tougher pitch to lon and that was the dramatic one ill detail it at the proper time to sum up peggy and i got there around had cocktails and took him to dinner at his country club where all knew and loved him the food was excellent and he was in good spirits i could tell the intellectual exercise of solving the problem had energized him the next morning he and i went out to his range and he showed me the rifle he had prepared and the ammunition and convinced me that it was fine that it would work i suppose he knew what would come next he displayed no surprise at the course the conversation took lon was a big man thats why he played fullback ask the harvard pansies they know him well he watched his weight and worked out his upper body with dumbbells regularly but he was always fighting the pounds they seemed to creep on him like fog and cling like putty he had a square american face wore wirerimmed glasses and kept his hair short like all of us did without question in he favored corduroys chinos and crewneck sweaters all well worn so that he looked like an english professoragain like we all did in those days you were an english professor in a rumpled sport coat or an ibm salesman in a sharp dark suit and black tie that was all there was his face was so lively and intelligent that people oftentimes didnt realize he was moored in that hateful steel chair s forever hed gotten awfully good with it over the years and he may have been the one who invented the wheel ring of smaller circumference than the rubber tire he used to propel himself he could probably climb a mountain in the thing or rob a bank or go up or down stairs but it got to him i know it did his vitality crushed into that metal framework his liveliness anchored by the great dead wastage of his lower body his talent frustrated by his immobility it took a bit as it always does when you recruit a solid citizen to go against all that hes been taught but i had advantages i knew he read lippman in the post and admired murrow on cbs and had what might be called enlightened social ideas about negroes and jews and while he wanted to destroy communism he didnt particularly want to kill anyone doing it especially not millions of innocent russian peasants we all felt that way and he hated as did most ivy league people general walker who seemed part of a long tradition of recent american troglodytes from martin dies to joe mccarthy to richard nixon to the john birch society and the ku klux klan men who saw commies everywhere and made it much tougher on those of us charged with fighting real commies men who hated negroes and wished them to stay backward and pathetic and never equal under law or in opportunity men who still hated jews and thought they secretly controlled everything men who just hated because that was all they had been taught to do when i explained my fears that walkers rightwing pressure might force the callow and decadent jfk into doing another stupid thing this time a stupid tragic thing and assured lon there was no chance whatsoever of being caught and laid the plan out for him he finally agreed let it be known here and now that he never asked for a cent he never got a cent he never discussed a cent he did it because i convinced him that it was the right thing to do and he believed in me there was some logistics planning to be done but thats always a task at which i excel i got a big chunk of operating funds out of the black budget by my usual means bought each of the tickets at a different travel agency paying cash booked rooms for us from the nineteenth to the twentysixth at the adolphus under fake nameseasily done in those precomputer daysused a fellow in the gray economy who did a lot of intelligence trade work to put together fake drivers licenses for the three of us and made sure everything was delivered and nothing was written i had my own career to tend to so i worked extrahard in the meetings and at appending notes to reports and keeping cord uptodate on peacock and the like i was busy or at least i gave the impression of being busy my one worry was that kennedy would make another mistake and wed find ourselves on crisis footing and stuck in weeks of eighteenhour days while the grownups at state worked out ways to prevent him from ending the world in fire i guess those midweeks in november he was busy screwing cords exwife marilyn angie and everybody except poor forlorn jackie when he wasnt plotting his next campaign he didnt seem to do much except think about his career and wait for things to happen it was that hunger that killed him the trip to dallas was strictly politics and had nothing to do with his actual job as president in any case i sold cord who had seemed hazier and more morose of late and perhaps was drinking more than he should as his nose was turning into a big red blob on another peacock tripthis time to make it easier on myself to the south the idea was to hit the prestige north carolina schools like duke and wake forest and the university of nc and spend a week trolling for talent down there for some reason north carolinians always did well in prestige journalism circles possibly because although they were southern they werent too southern from my point of view the hop to dallas from raleigh and back was much easier and less exhausting or timeconsuming than the one to dallas via cambridge the night came when lon jimmy and i met as a team for the first time it was november i had rented a jeep wagoneer and the three of us drove from the adolphus a grand hotel that bathed in the red glow of the neon pegasus atop the magnolia petroleum company next door out to the patio and got acquainted first with one another and second with the field upon which our operation would transpire it was a good trip jimmy and lon bonded instantly and it was understood without having to be explained that jimmy would be the action guy the assister lons special friend lon would shoot he was the artist the special talent who made the thing work i would supervise though discreetly more by studiously considered suggestion than direct order i would also handle everything organizational logistically and strategically it was a good healthy dynamic there is no i in team or so they say and for the three of us it was true i drove lon was in the back where hed be a week hence and jimmy sat next to me we had not much trouble negotiating the dallas traffic i can remember only a little about the drive over to the neighborhood the colors of the early s somehow in the soft air of that time and place and season they were lighter i cant put my finger on it and no words may exist at least within my reach to describe it but everything was less urgent less hardedged and more light filled the air the great nabokov could probably conjure it in two or three words but i grope and babble it was as if america was too comfortable for primary colors they would come later after the event i engineered during vietnam during the huge change in demographics as the ignorant generation whose fathers had won the war took over but not then not yet everything was softer lighter quieter i dont know how else to make you feel it speak memory now i remember pulling into a parking space about forty yards down from the patio and sitting there for a bit letting it soak in this is where well be said lon suppose we cant find parking the two nights i visited there were ample spaces i said i cant imagine well have trouble late on a monday night wherell the other guy be mr meachum jimmy asked see the alley directly across from the restaurant ive told him to take up a position entering from the rear well place some wooden crates there so he can get a good braced position well have to walk the range but im guessing itll be about seventy yards and you want me there this guy is such a jerk im not sure how hell do if someone confronts him if he gets confused if he loses confidencein all those circumstances you may have to intercede youve got a slapper that was a cops blackjack a flat flexible piece of leather with about a pound of buckshot sewn into it a master could whack a man to unconsciousness with one quick blow i do and its saved my bacon more times than i can remember jimmy said that would be your move its messy but we cant kill any private citizen we just have to get alek out of there cleanly do you see any problems lon lon grunted this is sort of like the man who shot liberty valance im john wayne i do the real killing i must say hugh i never thought id get a chance to play the john wayne role we laughed we were all john wayne fans technically its an easy shot off a rest i am worried about a deflection it appears ill be shooting through some bushes if you want mr scott i can visit some night late and discreetly trim what needs to be trimmed well take that worry off you great idea i said it was i hadnt thought of it im glad jimmy ever practical had then our patsy falls back through the alley cuts between two houses turns right hides the rifle under the fortyfifth street bridge takes off his galoshes climbs up to fortyfifth street and takes a bus home can he do that thats why i want you with him at a discreet distance its possible hell get scared in the dark if he turns the wrong way at the river hell be miles from a bus stop itll all be different in the dark he was supposed to do it in the dark to familiarize himself but hes such a disorganized twit i dont know ill lead him by the nose if i have to good man jimmy now lets go into the patio get a table and try their margaritas so we did three merry murderers having a good time on the patio of the patio which would soon be the scene of our crime since the duty day was done and we were on to the bonding aspect of the operation i passed on the tequila drink and knocked back three vodka martinis and lon kept up with me though he was a bourbon guy and jimmy sipped beer regaling us with stories of his youthful runins with a sergeant obannon of bostons fifth precinct in the north end of town where it was still more a suburb of dublin than beacon hill he told a funny story in perfect dialect there was hardly anything jimmy wasnt good at i arose early took the wagoneer to aleks neighborhood parked well down from his roominghouse and waited for him to emerge he was late as usual the idiot was on time for only one thing in his life the murder of jfk i let him turn the corner on the way to the bus stop then pulled up to him no one was close enough to hear us in russian good morning alek hop in ill run you downtown he got in and i took a uturn to avoid driving by the bus stop where a few commuters waited in case any of them happened to notice the highly unusual spectacle of the grumpy lee harvey oswald being picked up in a large american vehicle tell me what youve been up to alek i said i memorized the plan i went to the patio twice walking it getting used to the lighting i will make a good shot excellent i said earlier that night well move in some old wooden crates you can use them for support so you dont have to try any fancy positions im a marine sharpshooter i knew that sharpshooter was a relatively easy distinction to attain in the marines he had not made expert i have complete faith in you and you have walked your escape route you wont get lost in the dark i worry about you being arrested going the wrong way home and singing like a canary i will die before talking comrade he said fiercely you can count on my love of socialism and the working fellow to get me through any ordeal the fascists have in mind well said i replied thats the kind of spirit we need there was nothing particularly memorable about the discussion he had a kind of morose personality and didnt seem agitated about what lay ahead we just went through the details rather dully without much sparkle at all any more visits from the fbi nah maybe agent hotsy is bored with me hows marina shes fine ill see her this weekend and junie and new baby audrey also ill get the rifle any problems getting it out of the house no sir you know shell look for it when the news comes and not seeing it shell conclude you went back on your word and murdered him she wont talk he said he held up a fist i am the king of my house and the wenchhe used a cruel russian word devushkaknows better than to betray me he guided me through traffic which thickened as we drew near to dealey plaza along houston street after crossing the river in a block or so we were there and i had my first look at aleks place of employment with its hertz sign set on the diagonal above i cannot say i paid it much attention because at that point dealey plaza and the texas book depository were utterly meaningless to me i had no revelation no surge of heartbeat no epiphany the structure was a big ugly building on the edge of a municipal park of no particular charm brick six or seven stories tall completely without character the cars whizzed by it all the other buildings were equally uninteresting even the triangle of grass that constituted the plaza lacked feature or interest i regret many things i did over the next few days and among themnot the first but up there nonethelesswas that i made the book depository eyesore a historical shrine never ever to be demolished thats it he said okay ill turn here so nobody sees you get out of this car oh i wanted to get the diagram from you he reached into his jacket and pulled it out the only article except for the box of cartridges id given him that both of us had touched i knew id burn it at the first opportunity i dropped him at the corner of main and elm then turned left on elm passing under the shadow of the book depository as i headed down the slight slope of elm to the triple overpass a hundred yards ahead i came within sixty or seventy feet of the even more famous grassy knoll on the right in all the years that followed i always had a smileperhaps the only one the operation ever produced on my faceat the expense of the lunatics who believed that the little green lump explained everything i found a way to reverse my direction got back to commerce and in ten blocks or so reached the adolphus there i made phone calls to jimmy and lon to set up a realtime runthrough that night as we would do for the next six nights to get used to the routes the patterns of the shadows the rhythm of the traffic the different hues of darkness as the conditions altered the nighttime weather that night after dinner i had a moment of happiness and calm i was doing something big that i thought would help my country at the cost of one small worthless ugly man it did not feel wrong at all to me and i had no doubts no qualms no reservations i was going to make a difference i was going to change history the next morning wednesday november i woke ambled groggily to my door opened it and grabbed the newspaper the morning news i think it was and before i sat down i saw the headline jfk motorcade route announced i had not known jack kennedy was coming to dallas on the twentysecond but as my eyes ran down the story i saw the names of streets i had driven the morning before houston to elm elm under the triple overpass and i knew in an instant that i had been given a chance few men have circumstance had bent itself to offer me an opportunity that was not only the logical outcome to my ruminations but almost a moral obligation who could say no to such a possibility not hugh ah vod so dependable such a friend an ally vod always has my back my best interests at heart my happiness paramount in its fermented little potato brain with vod at my side as well as in my blood i launch into the final act which would leave me theoretically at least historys most abominable man i slew the prince who was the king i widowed the goddess of all our dreams i made ari onassis possible theres one i know ill never be forgiven for oh and i orphaned those two little socuteithurtsevennow kids bad hugh hugh you bastard vod a little help here please i knew i had to convince three people to help me tilt operation liberty valance a little bit so that instead of shooting general edwin walker on november we would shoot john fitzgerald kennedy on november two and a half days hence the three people were lon scott jimmy costello and myself as for aleklee harvey oswaldi knew the glory pig would take zero convincing the idiot would be like a rabid dog pulling on a leash he might have come up with it himself if hed read the paper it was everything his fetid little sewercommie mind demanded and had dreamed about for years his eagerness would surely get him killed and everyone else electrocuted but i felt i could control him and improvise a new plan so brilliant that even he couldnt screw it up too badly i would see him tonight at the bus stop as for me did i believe in what i was about to do and if i didnt how could i convince the others i tried to apply the dictates of the new criticism to the ethical issue as if it were a poem demanding the most rigorous attention to detail untarnished by the excesses of biography assumption sentimentality lugubrious emotionalism read the text i told myself read the text alone here was the text i read trying to ignore the young presidents glamour his vitality his beautiful children his strangely beautiful but beautifully strange wife his brood of brothers cousins sisters parents whatever no room for sailboats touch football movie stars no thought of parochial politics we were both democrats all that out lyndon johnson whoever he was out my clinical reading of the text that was jfk demanded only one answer what were his intentions in the republic of south vietnam i didnt give a damn about castro or cuba i didnt see much that could be done in europe except minor maneuvering for minor leverage a missile base exchanged here or there a spy betrayed a minister blackmailed all of it in the long haul meaningless but what of that steamy glade with its ravishing jungle and mountain landscape its little yellow people who wanted nothing in life except to be left alone to raise their rice plants ankledeep in water and shit the issue was would jfk get us into a big shooting war there if so who would fight it the tiny yellows he cared nothing aboutthey would die in the hundreds of thousands for sureor a generation of college kids unlikely to care to risk a war to save a country so far away whose rise or fall meant so little to them and would not be worth dying for left to their own devices neither of these demographics would vote to let slip the dogs it wasnt like the vietcong had bombed pearl harbor much less winnetka no it would happen only if jfk willed it to happen by inventing reasons to send our troops over there hed already begun and id seen them tan lean young men with the close haircuts and narrow eyes of highly trained professional military the socalled green berets yearning for a war they thought would be quick and glorious with a nice sniff of powder to it i knew there were a lot more of them there than the times had reported and i knew also that despite my report and cords passionately earned and argued reluctance there were those in the agency whod smelled the treasure of career enhancement hunting pajama charlie for a year already to me it was shit the place was infinitely more complex than anybody in washington suspected and it had the kind of suction that could drag us down to ruin in its whirlpools of deceit and danger its anthropological conundrums and village traditions its cruelty our enemies would degrade us but not as much as we would degrade ourselves in fighting them i took as i said the recent murder under our auspices of diem as doubling down on a bad bet we knew diem was so corrupt that his military was incapable of winning a war and that the reigning tactical concern for field and generalgrade officers much less administrators and bureaucrats in saigon would be filling their own secret bank accounts in paris we had decided to wipe that corruption off the face of the earth to encourage new younger americantrained and americanallied officers who would win the war if they proved unable we would begin to send more than advisers wed send divisions wed send our new helicopterborne army and the general slaughteras well as eisenhowers feared land war in asiawould be on there was no telling how many would die theirs ours the unfortunate peasants caught in the middle and for what one piece on the board said to be a domino but maybe just a piece on the board that jfk was a philanderer that he was screwing cords wife among the many that he came from a family as narrow and clannish and narcissistic as any tudor or hanoverian all these i tried to discount that his heroism in the pacific was greatly exaggerated that he received the pulitzer for another mans work that his father bought him every election he ever won all that i tried to push aside i dont know if i did but in the end i made up my mind and once id done that it was on to the others i called lon no hugh he said not a chance lon please i will be on a flight to richmond by three if you say one more word hugh i let the conversation simmer off into silence for a bit finally i came back with what i knew was the weakest of propositions just let me make the argument my mind is made up as soon as i saw the paper i knew how that devious little insect that you call a brain would set its antennae to twitching its mandibles to grinding its pincers to snapping and i knew exactly where youd go i know you better than you know yourself hugh anyhow whats the point of listening to the argument theres only one argument really you believe you can pull off the biggest coup in history you would call it an operation in your spynovel lingo so as to distance yourself from it as if its scientific or medical its hubris hugh its just hubris lon you are i know you hugh i know you if youve made up your mind how can it hurt to hear my argument i assure you it has nothing to do with me my needs any of that the psychology involved is yours lon i will make you see how it has to do with your needs and you will see your duty clearly oh right oh thats rich hugh you are a bastard thats what they pay me for the things ive authorized you wouldnt believe the things ive seen please lon meet me in the lobby in ten well go for a little walk agghh he snorted signifying surrender i pushed him in silence across the street from the hotel i didnt head south down commerce toward dealey but north and then i turned east down a street i dont remember it was november the sun was out and true fall as we new englanders would recognize it had yet to begin the leaves were still green in late november we arrived after a block or two at a small park that seemed to be dedicated to some glorious texan or other who had triumphed at the battle of squashing mexicans or some such thats what we did in the agencyif not mexicans some other little brown tribe anyone who got in our way thats what i helped us do we were in the empire business after all and i was paid to make sure that empire stayed strong and lasted forever and anyone who opposed us got squashed if the empire was to fall it wouldnt be on my watch we sat in the sun should i say birds sang the wind blew gently the sun was bright the world seemed full of hope maybe all that is true i have no idea get on with it goddammit lon said i dont have all day i just have one question i said request actually then ill shut up he waited finally i said lon tell me about the chair the what the chair the one youre sitting in its made of steel i can see a label i think it was manufactured by ridgeway medical equipment company rahway new jersey dont be ridiculous i dont talk about such things no tell me youre a goddamn noble roman lon i know you too youre sick with honor youll never complain youll never cease to maintain the code stoic dignified without complaint to the end a study in protestant rectitude and western heroism youre braver than john wayne gary cooper or theyre actors said lon audie murphy neville brand i dont know the boys who raised the flag on iwo robert c scott cord meyer bill morgan joe mcconnell major darby its nothing to do with courage its the practicality of acceptance and resignation its doing the best you can with what youve got tell me lon youve never told anyone probably not even yourself tell me lon waited a bit then he said all right s is lousy it stinks its no fun its better than s its better than any of the ts its much better than any of the cs but still its lousy i get sores on my legs and i dont even feel them but the pants are smeared with blood and pus and have to be thrown away because no dry cleaning gets it out i shit in my diapers and dont know ive done it and i have to somehow deal with the diapers on my own in my room at night a truly repulsive job i worry that therell be a leak that ill offend that something humiliating will happen i get bruises on my spine and sometimes they climb above s and i get tremendous pains i sometimes remember my legs in my dreams remember walking feel the experience and almost believe that by some miracle ive but then i wake up dead from the waist down psychologically thats hard to take particularly the seven hundredth time or so i have nightmares about dad he had a look on his face for a split second before the horror came over him as he saw what had happened i saw it as i twisted around to see what the hell had happened and saw him standing there with the rifle on the ground before him i think about that look was it a smile it could have been a smile ii dont know there was something there a kind of i dont know satisfaction or something dad was great considering until he died he did everything he could to make my life livable he spent a fortune he was with me nearly every single day i know that he hated himself for the accident and that it took twentyfive years off his life but still that look a fathers worries about usurpation his inability to get totally behind somebody who will replace him he was silent for a while gathering wind he had never spoken of such things the women he said i dont know if it was better to have had a decent amount of intimacy before or to lose your sexuality as a virgin because then youd never remember never know what you were missing i have no policy position here but i smell womens perfume i see the crease between their breasts i see the tops of their stockings it happens all the time because around me theyre not so guarded in their body movements they know im out of the game theyre not being cruel its just their nature they love to put out the sniff of sex but they hold it back until the wedding night to make sure he shows up at church that whole ritual guardedness the flash the tease the leanover the crossed legs thats all missing around me because absent a working penis im one of the gals thats what happens to us ss so i see breasts and even thighs all the time and i remember and it makes me crazy and i have to get through it on what i suppose is yankee grit or something but i hate it i hate them yet i yearn to be around them to smell them to see them smile to make them laugh to know that except for the one thing i would be with them instead im the witty eunuch in the chair the gelded stallion so charming yet so unable to satisfy and give to them what they desire children and dick so yes hugh the chair is no fun im guessing you probably already deduced that with your spys keen powers of observation what the hell does this have to do with anything lon i said kennedy is going to send thousands of young americans off to a war we cannot win hes going to do that because he wants the reelection and he cant be called soft on communism we were going to correct that problem by eliminating a fellow who called him soft on communism the loudest now i see it we have a chance not to correct but to eliminate to erase totally i directed you to the chair you ride in all day long because thousands of boys will come back from the war in those chairs at some point or other all of them will wish they had been killed because they wont have your strength your heroism your yankee grit as you call it theyll have nothing and theyll get nothing you command the gun world with your shooting skills you have extraordinary resources of intelligence charm and will to say nothing of a considerable personal fortune these poor boys will have none of that theyll just have the chair you hate the chair but you have managed to transcend it they wont have that chance lon and you know it the chair will turn their lives into daily torture forever and ever and ever which is how long theyll feel their lives lasting so that is why i ask you to do this lon not for my hubris but for yours keep those boys out of their metal chairs endure publically if you get caught or privately if you dont the mantle of regicide the man who killed the king if you can bear the chair you can bear that easily enough he laughed ever hear of an argentine writer called jorge luis borges i said no hemingways as far as i go he writes stories in the form of fictional essays conjectures on this or that always astonishing in their brevity and their insight in one he postulates that the true son of god was judas not christ anybody could be christ suffering and becoming immortal but it took a strength of character that only the son of god could muster to make the crucifixion possible by the betrayal that was the true heroism the true sacrifice for without it there was nothing he didnt bear the pain of the cross for a day he bore the pain of hatred exile universal loathing all that forever that was strength sounds crazy to me he said your borhaze or whatever carries no weight with me how do you know youll prevent this war maybe this texan johnson maybe hell wage the same war he wont hes a new deal democrat forged in the crucible of thirties washington he has no interest in military adventurism nothing to prove because hes an older man with plenty of mistresses and an ugly wife hell use his time in office to siphon money off to texas and his cronies in the party hell give a lot to negroes so lippmann will write well of him hell build dams and highways and buildings with his name on them like all of them hell screw everything in heels he has no interest in foreign affairs ive looked at it carefully internationally hes as sober as eisenhower domestically he wants to be the next fdr hes fdr with ants in his pants the last thing he wants is to go off on a crazy crusade in a foreign swamp its way too expensive this thing this ambush you dont even know if its possible i suppose i knew i had him then hed gone in a single breath from the strategic to the tactical he didnt realize it but hed surrendered on the strategic now it was a matter of details were so close lon weve solved the ballistic issue we have the best rifle shot in the world we have a silenced rifle the most advanced assassination tool in the world we have a prime patsy who will i say again will take the blame for us the poor dummy and we have the best breakingandentering man in america and we have jfk in an opentop limousine parading by at twelve thirty pm the day after tomorrow we have one thing yet to do and its something that should be within any case officers reach we have to find a place to shoot in reasonable proximity to oswalds at about the same moment and while everybody is going after him i will push you away in your wheelchair and well have martinis and steaks that night its not a joke hugh killing a man a young beautiful man no matter the reason its not a joke he was right my foolish attempt at levity had sabotaged the moment i overplayed that hand i know it was stupid i apologize to you lon you deserve better from me no we wont celebrate well mourn along with the rest of america and well never boast or tell but we will save thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of lives damn you again hugh you are so willful so convincing let me sell jimmy and see what he comes up with if he comes up with something thats workable then make up your mind if you still dont want to do it fine i suppose i did my best well go back to the walker thing as we originally planned that was how we left it i pushed him back and he retired to his room for a nap i called jimmy there was no answer i saw him get aboard the bus near the depository and i followed it across the long aqueduct over the trinity river all the way back to oak cliff through the lateafternoon dallas traffic i wasnt interested in the bus so much as in who else was interested in it i looked for black ford coupes maybe with antennas gman cars neither the bureau nor the secret service was there or shared any interest in comrade oswald they were as usual profoundly asleep on the job i could almost hear them snoring zzzzzzzzzzzz in aleks neighborhood i watched from across north beckley as he got out again no other cars were parked on the street and the two other men who got out at the same stop disappeared in another direction alek walked by me oblivious to all in the fading light his details hard to make out even from the few lines the declining sun revealed you could read him he was like a figure out of walt kelly or al capp a caricature of grumpy hostility a stumping glaring shabby figure all lines in face and body pulled down as if by overwhelming gravity broadcasting the message do not approach or you will be fired upon no wonder the idiot was friendless always getting in fights or bitter arguments a trial to those few who had decided to let him into their lives a wife beater a jerk yet he became the ball bearing of history how utterly strange and unpredictable i flashed my lights he looked up startled recognized the wagoneer by shape and came over and got in i pulled away good evening alek i said good evening comrade he said im set or something similar in his garbled russian on friday evening i will go to fort worth and return monday morning with the rifle for alek i said i take it you havent read todays paper or talked to coworkers in the plant i read papers a day late its cheaper i get them from the garbage as for coworkers they are not worth all right all right time is short the stakes are high now listen to me carefully dont say a thing dont react or have a bowel movement or begin to hiphooray the situation has changed radically i felt him turn the ears are all of me he said his clumsy literal translation im guessing of im all ears for which there was no russian equivalent idiot agh anyway i went ahead on friday at around twelve thirty a motorcade will pass in front of your building on elm street in an open limousine will be the president of the united states alek can you alter history for us with one shot of your rifle it is a great opportunity so great that one must suspect the laws of the universe are turning in favor of our moral insistence on progress alek can you do this thing for us are you the man who has been sent to do this thing i heard his breath being swallowed i heard him gulping i couldnt bear to look at his face for i knew i would see a cavalcade of madness narcissism greed and ambition and that his beady little vermin eyes would burn hot and fierce the worst are full of murderous intensity i thought comrade he finally said and then he blurted off into english jesus christ yes goddammit i have waited my whole life for this oh i will in one strike change the course of history i will show the world the magnificence settle down you fool i said youre carrying on like a schoolgirl get ahold of yourself and listen to me all right yeah yeah sure he said still in english in russian i insist all discussions of this matter must be held in russian yes sir this is the sort of thing we do reluctantly but we do not want this young man sending troops off to invade cuba or anywhere and he shows signs of instability poor judgment downright imbecility he is too easily influenced too desperately ambitious he has no moral character he is the kind of sparkler who could start an atomic war he must be stopped and a responsible leader put in charge of your nation alek you must understand in pulling that trigger you are not destroying you are building yeah yeah i get it he said he didnt of course and i was fooling myself really throwing a last grenade into my own lingering defenses i was arguing with myself alek if you are to do this thing you must do it under our absolute discipline we will provide you with an escape route we will get you to a safe house we will get you out of the country we will get you to your glory in havana and your rightful place among the revolutionary fighters in a year or so we will get your wife and children to you but this can be guaranteed only if you submit and trust absolutely our rules do you understand i agree i agree i hear what youre saying if it comes to it i wont let them take me alive ill have my pistol with me ill go down shooting as i am willing to die for no no no i said fearing this idiot on a shooting rampage in downtown dallas you must not bring your pistol believe mei struggled for the appropriate fiction to disabuse himif you kill the president on a policy issue and because of your own sense of idealism however warped they may think it you will be reviled but respected you will have a legacy of courage and dignity if you also shoot some postman or some housewife you become another punk negro murderer and your electrocution will be cheered by your own children and you do not want that believe me leave the pistol at home swear to me you will harm no one except your target that is the discipline we demand we are not butchers we are scientific marxists yes sir he said tell me how you would proceed he laid out the obvious hed have to go home tomorrow nightthursdayto get the rifle he would break it down so it could be disguised and carry it into the building in a brown paper bag nobody would challenge him he would go to the sixth floor which was largely deserted as it was pure stock storage area he would situate himself overlooking elm as it passed by dealey plaza on the way to the triple overpass and he would shoot the president as he passed by which window will you shoot from i asked what which window you have your choice of any which window do you chose uh i guess the one in the middle why its in the middle excellent reasoning you are a genius where on elm will you shoot the president thats the determining factor on the window you cannot make these things up on the spot you of all people cannot make things up on the spot because you will do it stupidly where should i shoot you know the building at the street ii dont know it doesnt seem to make any idiot you want him where hes closest and slowest any map should give you the answer where will he be closest and slowest this is why youre such a failure alek you dont think you just make things up his face knitted in shame then i saw a bulb go on behind that dull face those dim eyes bingo eureka when hes turning the corner he has to turn the corner from houston to elm its very sharp excellent its a hundred and twenty degrees the car is big it will pivot slowly for all intents and purposes he will be standing still his chest will be open to you at a range of about seventyfive feet an idiot could make the shot im not an idiot he said sure i make mistakes but everybody which window alek the corner window the closest window to him if i planned to shoot later as he went down elm then i would move to another window down elm excellent i said glad that he had figured out this elementary riddle though no conspiracy theorists did i might add so that i could praise him and raise his spirits you shoot him when hes closest when hes stillest one shot center chest easy to make fish in a barrel he said in english with that dreadful smirk after shooting i instructed you will have little time to make your escape the police will be in the building within minutes drop the rifle walk do not run downstairs being careful not to acquire oxygen debt so you are swallowing for air look no one in the eye but do not shirk either your face is neutral exit the building and slip off into the mob it will be chaos outside proceed down houston street one block to the corner of houston and pacific you will see this car though i might not be driving and it could be anyone a couple an old lady a mexican a hepcat climb in the back and lie down on the floor commit yourself to a long boring drive in a few hours we will have you at a safe house and at that point you can relax eat drink the next day or really the next night we will move you out of the country these will be an arduous few days demanding stamina commitment attention to detail and obedience trust us alek will you can you he said yes i wish we had time for runthroughs for rehearsals for shooting practice for all of that can you hit that easy almost stationary target under seventyfive feet away im a good shot i wont miss he said all right we must make do with what has been given us for some reason history has chosen you you have to justify that choice i believe in you alek as no one else has you owe me you owe your true motherland you owe history you must not fail comrade i swear to you i cut him off as we were a few doors down from his house and i gave him a russian hug smelling the body odor of a man who seldom bothered with hygiene fastidious new england priss that i am and always will be now go little alek and become a hero he stepped out of the door and i pulled out leaving him behind youre thinking okay hugh call your friend jack ruby and set the second part of the plan in operation tell us about jack how you manipulated him how far back you old buddies went your underworld ties the implicit sponsorship of the mob particularly the trafficante connection running through the attempts on castro that your own section clandestine services under the great cord meyer had set up hah the jokes on you friend you shouldnt be thinking about jack ruby unless you sloppily missed the warren commission detail that hed sent a western union moneygram to one of his strippers a full forty minutes after the announced transfer time of alek to a more secure locale he didnt show up at the station basement until a full hour after that designated time so he could have had no idea that alek was in the building though that is the sort of thing the conspiracy hucksters always fail to mention it destroys any possibility of ruby as anything but a random mote of dust adrift on the currents of history being blown this way and that for the record i never heard of jack ruby until shortly after he finished poor alek and took over the story himself i suppose this may be counted as several of the immense strokes of good fortune that operation liberty valance enjoyed though perhaps it was meaningless in the end the truth is i planned to betray oswald to the police i expected him to be picked up and eventually electrocuted i didnt think it mattered his personalityi am no psychiatrist but id studied him enough and been around him enoughhad the smell of disintegration he was a crackpot to begin with with enormous mental disorders that had afflicted him his whole life the outward manifestations were hotheadedness empathy with outre causes and policies lack of attention to details sloppiness in all manners of being he was a man at war though primarily with himself i suppose inside he hated his absent father and his overbearing vulgar disorganized mother he hated himself for his continual incompetence and his total inability to engage people at any level for his utter intellectual mediocrity he worshipped the god of communism knowing little about it he had a streak of melodramatic vainglorymore than a streak it was perhaps the largest part of his identity i do think that he genuinely didnt care if he lived or died he was willing to risk his own life in an attempt to fulfill his most urgent need which was to matter and no longer be a marginal loser detested by all loved or hated it made no difference to him that his name would be on the worlds lips with this opportunity it was an aphrodisiac that his dullnormal mind and undisciplined lunacy could not have resisted i believe he would have taken those shots whether or not we existed most important i believed if he was captured hed find the pressures too much and in time his mind would fall apart he wouldnt be able to recall his own truth first hed claim he alone authored the deed and cling to that for months because he wanted the glory the notoriety the fame finally hed tell them the truth as he imagined it that hed been picked up by a soviet agent coached and prepped for a mission against general walker and at the last moment diverted to the president as target when that opportunity revealed itself dutifully the fbi would check out the tale and find no evidence of it no one would remember seeing alek in the presence of this agent someone at a desk near mine in langleymaybe it would even be me would be given the mission of discovering if there had been any remote possibility of soviet involvement and using sources networks leverage penetration and analysis would produce a report in a year that aside from the idiots attempts to secure a visa from the russian embassy in mexico city in september there had been no record no rumors no traces of soviet contact with oswald if oswald went through photo albums of known agents in order to id his mysterious mentor hed come up with nothing for in truth i looked far more like dave guard of the kingston trio than i did vassily psycholosky kgb killer and goon if all went well there would be no physical evidenceno fingerprints no footprints no jimmied locks nothing slightly out of the ordinary nothing ambiguous in meaning the clincher would be the ballistics which as i have explained would suggest his rifle and his rifle alone as i drove away he receded into the shadows i would see him only one more timethe closest our plot would come to discovery i quickly headed downtown to the adolphus where i still had to talk to jimmy to convince him and where we had a great deal of planning to do when i got back to the hotel i was not surprised to see jimmy waiting for me in the lobby hi mr meachum he said rising smiling in that irish way how about letting me buy you a drink sure i said and like two cronies from an oklahoma vacuumcleaner manufacturer we trundled off to the dark mens bar not the adolphuss famous century room where a rosemary or a gigi or a maryanne was singing we found a table well away from the few other drinkers left ordered up our poison and waited for the girl to bring it and then to depart for the record in those days texas had insane drinking laws and wed had to join the club in order to receive our own private bottles so jimmy i said ive been trying to reach you have you spoken to lon yet no i havent i thought id let the two of you work things out between you today it seemed like a good time to take a little break actually it was from what youre saying i guess youve figured it all out that i want to change the nature but not the purpose of the mission same operational principles different target lon to be fair is not so sure he didnt sign up for what im proposing neither did you neither come to think of it did i but its here it wont go away i believe it can be done i also believe it should be done its really just a continuation of the original idea do you want the full nineninetyfive sales pitch or the bargainbasement fourninetyfive version its getting late and i havent eaten yet so i suppose the fivebuck version will have to do mr meachum you dont have to break a sweat i get it if you say it needs doing then im the one to do it loyalty you boys in your outfit you got me out of prison and got me a new life doing what i do best and doing some good in the world never thought id have a shot at a house in the suburbs and two boys in private school which is what i have today ill sail with you to hell or the edge of the world whichever comes first youre a good man jimmy plus i hate them castle irish always putting on the airs always carrying on like they werent bogslogging peat burners like the rest of us my father hated them his father before him hated em more than the english youre doing me old dad a favor and hes smiling in heaven youre a great man jimmy knowing i have you along means i know we can do this thing that we can do you know what i did today of course not i was all over a joint called the daltex building daltex know what that stands for dallas texas dallas textiles its the heart of what passes as the garment trade in dallas office building a warren of offices youll find fifty of em in every city in america full of rooms with desks and telephones and secretaries what else do you need to make a buck in america that and a good case of business smarts this one is worth exploring because its located behind the texas book depository on elm street it has at least twenty offices that give a good look down elm street from almost the same angle as the book depository youre way ahead of me jimmy you know me ive got a natural talent for mischief of all sorts theres a fair number of buildings on the plaza that would give mr scott an angle but the only one thats a few degrees off from the book depository is the daltex building i dont see where else we could run the operation from without running the risktoo big in my mindof leaving an obvious clue that some other birds that is us were involved theyre going to investigate this one up the ass with all the national experts and the best techs the bureau has if anythings wrong theyll sniff it out something you never heard of like arterial spray pattern or skin stretch marks or powder dispersal pattern or something subatomic that not even dick tracy has thought of we have to minimize everything that differentiates our shooter from the little red nuthead its a much higher threshold than with general walker thats what makes it a puzzle and frankly for this boyo great fun i love to match wits with the best thats for sure glad youre so excited i said we have to get in and out of that building find a shooting position all within a few minutes and over the last part itll be screaming and panic its no easy thing i suppose its too late to rent an office we dont know if ones available but it would attract a great deal of attention if we contacted the management and put down a deposit tomorrow no theyd tumble to that right away are there any bathrooms or deserted offices where we might set up no bathrooms boss they always put bathrooms on the interior side of the corridor because they get more rental dough for a window one or two of the offices i saw looked empty but theres no way of telling how theyll be the day after tomorrow its a tough one were two bright boys and i see a gleam in your eye i think youve already found a way that i have boss he said with his totalmischief smile and then he told me his plan chapter marion adams gun expert and official lounge lizard to the monied collector set had an insidious charm it was easy to see that he was one of those gifted enablers who helps the big tall rich get what they think they want with a minimum of fuss he was tall fair rather flitty serious only about himself hiding behind square black glasses and a suit so dowdy that it had to be expensive he could have been an embalmer and in a sense he was masterminding the transfers of dead guns soaked in formaldehyde for a profit he insisted on high end all the way no casual tamale and beer joint for him and so the three men met in the french room at the adolphus a texas fantasy of high louis xv dining where every item on the menu boasted its own apostrophe and some two or three marty as he was called by all who knew and could afford him held the floor as he always did it was the divine right of blowhards it turned out he knew a great deal about apostrophes french dishes wines art politics just about everything and even richard yielded to the torrent of knowledge meanwhile swagger picked at the morsels of overprepared food wished hed ordered the chicken and worked at keeping a look of polite interest on his face finally marty turned to business over coffee i am not a conspiracy nut he said in fact like millions of others i accepted without question the warren commission report and was willing to let it go at that but i do make my living telling gun stories i was born into the business really at its highwater mark my father was a manufacturer and his father before him connecticut gun people i had the gene too but from a slightly different angle i had the hunger to know and chronicle not manufacture not shoot not hunt im the amanuensis of the american gun culture ive written books on all the major manufacturers i consult at the countrys finest auction houses i am a registered appraiser in thirtynine states and i advise many of the nations most distinguished collectors on the guns they are about to purchase i assume you have checked my background and found it satisfactory nobody has a discouraging word about you mr adams said swagger nor you mr brophy ive checked too you seem to be a man whos handled crises all over the world i seem to have come out okay i am a lucky son of a gun may i ask you respectfully for a brief account of your life sure said swagger launching easily into a colorful spin on the mining engineers life the risks the nearmisses and the long nights alone with books he finished on brophys fictional jfk obsession some years ago i got hooked on jfks death more i read more i questioned read some conspiracy crap and was not impressed read warren and it seemed ragged started thinking hard about it using my engineers brain realized a couple of years ago i had enough money to last several lifetimes and two or three more wives so i decided i was tired of sleeping bags and would prefer to spend the rest of my life going into this thing in eighth gear and seeing where it would take me always loved guns so that was a start and i guess cause im mechanical by nature my approach has always been through the guns interesting somehow i came up with some ideas that i dont believe nobody has and im trying to push forward from them not for money not for fame just because of a goddamned stubborn streak if i dig a shaft i like to have something to show for it is that enough for you mr adams excellent account mr brophy im going to make the first move here and divulge a portion of what ive found out you see if it squares with what you know and well see where we are at the end go to work sir swagger said all right heres my story i am always looking for subjects for the next book some months ago i got interested quite innocently in the life and career of a great but tragic american shooter named lon scott swaggers eyes stayed modestly interested his breathing smooth his lips unlicked he gave away nothing and made certain not to choose this moment to break off eye contact and take a sip of coffee lon scott interesting fellow adams continued then he went ahead to issue the specifics on lon scott the bright youth the safari heroics the football stardom at new haven the extraordinary run of national match successes in the years after world war ii the tragic accident in at the hands of his father his fathers suicide his reemergence as a writer and experimenter in the late fifties and then his own death in sad story said bob as at last marty had to take a breath and left a gap in the noise i hate it when someone so talented gets cut down young fella had a lot more to contribute yes it does seem so adams said then i made another interesting discovery he went on to tell how in the early seventies a fellow named john thomas albright emerged as a gun writer and ballistics authority and soon became a revered if mysterious figure in gun culture he had an excellent career until he was killed in a hunting accident in at the age of sixtyeight i learned by accident that he was also disabled wheelchairbound youd never know it from his writing i checked for pictures and none existed that i could find i went to albrights home in rural north carolina and learned that he was a mystery there as well i began to wonder could albright and scott be the same fellow if so why would lon contrive his own fraudulent death in and reemerge as john thomas albright what was he hiding or hoping to distance himself from the question hung unanswered for a moment or two and bob glanced at the grim countenance of richard the third member of the group and then answered i suppose youre referring to our point of common interest a certain event in november adams versed in upping the dramatic ante on his tale paused an artful second or so then nodded he waited another second of course so i decided to look into the life of these two men more carefully i discovered that while obviously lon scott never published an article after john thomas albright never published one before i acquired copies of all their articles and first by myself and then with the help of an academic who specializes in forensic reading we made a linebyline comparison and found deep organizational similarities as well as dozens of turns of phrase that were similar i found three cases where albright made reference to discoveries that scott had made as if they were his own i discovered that the documentation on scotts death was very very thin as if contrived by an amateur i could go on with the irregularities but the point is obvious lon became john the question is why youre in areas i havent even gotten to yet said swagger youre coming at it from a different angle see im on the how the way an engineers mind works theres no point in proceeding until the how is answered but youve started on or youve advanced to the who you can see what i need said adams i need that how just like you need the who so what im looking for basically is a theory its one thing to put together a biography full of mysterious elements that might circumspectly suggest that lon scott a great rifleman and ballistic experimenter was involved in the kennedy assassination to some degree but a lot of people if the data is manipulated and selected carefully enough could fit in a similar template what i need is somebody of extreme capability to put together a coherent narrative based on what i can uncover about lon scott in as to the how part of his engagement where would he shoot from what would he use how would he get in and out who helped him remember hes in a wheelchair so he needed allies heres a provocative fact i learned that he had a first cousin named hugh meachum who was some kind of cia star at the time he too died in but the connection of lon and hugh in if it can be documented is titillating but see its all meaningless without that first part how did they do it you dont have any idea well said marty smugly i cant reveal how i know this yet but there is some suggestion that another rifle is involved and it was a model winchester its more than lons engagement over the years with winchester im talking about a specific model caliber as yet unknown i got to thinking what could you do to either a model winchester or a mannlichercarcano to make them compatible somehow interchange parts take the barrel off one and trust me said bob you are now in my pea patch and there is a way of doing just that thats where my thinking is taking me im looking at some kind of deal where acaliber bullet from a carcano shell was fired from acaliber casing say win mag swede maybe a wildcat like a in order to get enough velocity so the brainshot bullet selfdestructed excellent said marty oh this is so exciting theres an issue of timing but the reloading angle is interesting and you say you can link it to a model that would really tie the bow on it thats it adams said im hoping the answers are in sync with the warren commission not crazily opposed to it you have to know the hard facts of the warren commission and it all has to fit in that time frame nobody has ever come close to that swagger went all engineer on him hard and practical i can see this might work but whats your pitch he asked what is it you want from me adams said well id like to hear your ideas though please understand im not forcing you your theory is your intellectual property i am not trying to pry it from you you decide if you care to share somewhere along the line what i am suggesting is that we explore working together id get a lawyer to draw up a contract so that each of us is protected i know youre a cautious man when youre satisfied we should have a working session and a frank exchange of evidence i should also tell youi alluded to this earlieri may have a piece of evidence that could nail this absolutely i wont tell you what it is or where i got it but it could astound the world if its what i think it is is it this mystery model when i explain it to you youll understand what im talking about i cant say more until weve signed contractually i should add that i have a very good agent in new york and we are talking about a book as the end product are we not i will write it you will vet it we may have to bring in another better writer at some point properly vetted and legally obligated by contract to us is this satisfactory swagger squinted hard i never move fast on anything you have your lawyer draw up that contract ill have mine look at it and we will see where we are then that works for me said adams if that happens i will settle down and writei aint no writer so scratch out is a better termall the stuff that comes out when i have a latenight thinking session i think that will do better than any yakkityyak session youll see that its taking you where you think it should well proceed from there absolutely said adams i dont want to apply pressure but i think we should have as our goal going public by either book or other media by or on november the fiftieth anniversary theres going to be a groundswell of attention then so we might as well cash in on it it never hurts to think about marketing the next day swagger issued his report over expensive coffee amid prosperous moms and boho kids and various cinomachines to memphis blew me away when he pulled lon scott out of the hat it is possible that he came up with scott independently without knowledge before of hugh or i mean lon was real he left tracks traces and that is the area in which marty adams is known to be an expert researcher it is i aint saying it aint he seems to be clean weve looked hard at him i will direct neal to look hard again appreciated even a paranoid like me has to admit though there aint no signs of a game before you go anywhere with marty i will have everything on him except his colon xrays if you get them i dont want to see them i dont want to see them either ill have an intern go over them thats what interns are for meanwhile where are you investigationwise i mean still having fun im tussling with red nine its got me up nights and then when i get real depressed over that i think about the other riddle i have made no progress on the deal on the timing how they did it so fast how they got oswald into play when nobody knew until three days before that by fluke jfk was going to be driven under his window man they were good or lucky or even worse both in this business bad days are an occupational hazard i spent several under intense artillery fire at a forward operating base in vietnam when i was running phoenix an israeli rocket buried me in rubble for six hours in beirut ruining a perfectly fine suit i was detained in by some obnoxious chinese border guards for what seemed like years but was only hours i thought they were going to beat me up because i was russian although i wasnt and if id told them who i really was they would have beaten me up twice as hard plus allowed me to rot in their prison system for half a century it was frightening coming close to melting my phony sangfroid and tarnishing my yalie style incroyable but no day of my life has been as bad as november it seemed to last forever and at the same time it seemed to be over in split seconds and the next one although we all had fierce doubts was upon us so quickly we couldnt believe it we were a grimfaced bunch i dont think any of us had come to terms with what we were about to do some doubts you never put away and those haunt youall of us i meanfor years and years now is not the time for the postmortem i can say only that i plunged ahead on the faith that the change would be for the better that it would save lives in the hundreds of thousands white yellow north south theirs ours that it would forestall the anarchy and chaos that i quite rightly had predicted that i was and we were reluctant assassins that we believed ourselves to be moral assassins nevertheless the day was spent in a kind of existential dread a clammy dryness of breath and persistent wetness of body food had no taste or appeal liquor had too much taste and appeal and was therefore avoided and to quote a line from i think james jones in the thin red line numbly we did the necessary i trust my posthumous editor will have the energy to run the quote down alek was out of my control if hed ever been in it there was nothing that could be done at this point he would do what was required of him well enough to enjoy the success that had eluded him in life or he would not i suppose it was possible and i confess it never occurred to me that he could have called his friend agent hotsy of the fbi and turned me in as part of a scenario by which the red spy he thought was nabbed and jfks life was spared hed be a hero then and money and fame would come of it in retrospect im glad i didnt concern myself with such nonsense in the first place he didnt have the imagination in the second truly he didnt have the disposition he was a born dostoyevskian or conradian subversive a hardcore assassin or mad bomber in another century hed have carried a bowlingball bomb with a fizzing fuse under his cape he wanted to destroy it was his destiny he wanted to reach out and atomize the world that had relegated him to bug status cursed him with reading difficulties attention difficulties a sluggish mind an obsessive streak it never occurred to me that such a figure would betray me i was his only hope his true believer my fears about alek instead were practical would he remember the rifle could he sneak it out of mrs paines house without either her or marina seeing it could he sneak it into the book depository the next day without dropping it in the lunchroom with a clatter sending its removed screws all over the place could he reassemble it or reassemble it correctly a black comic vision came to me of him having done everything perfectly the sight exactly on the target the perfect trigger squeeze achieved and snap nothing because somehow hed dropped the bolt and hadnt noticed the firing pin fall out on the floor or maybe his ride into work on friday morning would catch a glimpse of the front sight and the fellow would say lee what the hell is that and lee would panic and jump out of the car with an idiot like him any number of screwups were possible and i have to agree with a number of anticonspiracy commentators who after the fact said that no intelligence agency would trust such a moron for an important assignment they were right but for the fact that operational necessity sometimes compels gambling on a disreputable character i tried to put aside my doubts on poor alek and proceed with business that i could control we met that morning after roomservice breakfast in my room not a bunch of happy fellows as i say jimmy had things to do he had to get business cards printed he had to figure out and fabricate some way to smuggle lons silenced rifle into the building which among other things would involve buying a voluminous overcoat whose sleeves would have to be tailored so they didnt hang down ridiculously beyond his fingertips like a clowns he wanted to go through the daltex building again to reaffirm his impressions to memorize all the stairwells and floors and sequences of offices to check out the locks to conjure escape routes and hiding places though if it came to hiding the jig was already up basically he wanted to apply his professional expertise and mind against the site of the crime again so thered be no surprises during the operation i sensed he had to be alone for that and also that he wanted to be alone he was always the lonewolf type god bless him off he went lon and i decided we should get a good look at dealey plaza i pushed him over to main and we traced what would be the presidents route turning right down houston flanking the plaza then halting at houston and elm for a good look at daltex and its big windows with their excellent vantage over the plaza we then crossed houston and headed down the gentle slope and curve of elm in front of the book depository it was all pretty empty for the plaza wasnt a tourist attraction why would it be it offered no grace or beauty as a boston or connecticut or washington dc park would no grand leafy trees just a few stunted oaks no brilliant gardens no ponds with swans and ducks it was basically banal a greensward plopped absurdly into the middle of nowhere a rough triangle of grass between three streets with for some bizarre reason a little annex to the north where the civic fathers in their infinite wisdom had thrown up some mock roman coliseumstyle pillars in a semicircle atop a little rise as grotesque and misguided attempt as any id seen at classical grace sure it was texas but why didnt they hire an architect for gods sake not the mayors wifes drunken brother or whoever perpetrated dealey upon the world it was less a park or a plaza than an abandoned field we didnt say much and i didnt want to linger i was being careful maybe someone would recall the strange ivy league prince and his wheelchairimprisoned pal and report that to the feds and who knew where that would lead or maybe alek himself taking fantasy shots from the sixth floor would catch a glimpse of me though would he recognize me in a gnarly brooks brothers tweed jacket and dark slacks with a pipe in my mouth and my hornrims firmly in place when all he knew was a fellow in a lumpy gum suit with sleeves of mismatched length because natasha had been asleep at her sewing machine in hour fifteen of her sixteenhour shift back in when she sewed the suit parts together on a soviet sewing machine the size of a buick then i relaxed today alek would be in pretendville riding down the malecon in havana in the rear of a wellwaxed caddy next to his god fidel waving at the adoring crowds i pushed lon down the street we followed the elm sidewalk down the slope and i had to pull against the wheelchair to keep it from getting away in gravitys grasp lon saw a chance for a joke dont let me slip away james bond and get creamed in traffic youll be one pathetic danger man tomorrow i was glad to hear the humor in his voice even if it was sardonic pippip old man i shall do my duty as yale instructed me i said in prisssoprano kidding the bluebloodagent stereotype of which i was almost a pitchperfect example i didnt get lon killed and we passed the book depository off on the right got down the incline and i stopped us about halfway to the overpass just past the idiotic roman folly on the right and turned lon degrees back so that he could see elm street the rise of the hill the two buildings that commanded the angles the depository and the one from which hed be shootingwe hopedthe daltex building a little behind it across houston we were alone on the sidewalk with the traffic whizzing by us i make it about a hundred yards i said to which building lon asked the one in the rear the one well probably be in from that angle you couldnt see all of daltex only the wall along elm though at an extreme angle and a stretch of the houston street facade another completely ugly graceless building i think it was trying to be modern ugh it changed personalities after floor two and went to soaring archways encompassing the windows a flourish that registered as completely idiotic to me what did they think that did for them these texans suppose we dont get in lon said it was as yet unsettled and it worried me too i couldnt let that show to lon cousin or not i had leadership responsibility and had to represent clearvoiced optimism oh hell do it jimmys the best hes very clever and if he doesnt youve had a nice trip to dallas at government expense and gained a story so fascinating its a shame youll never be able to tell it i cant believe im here looking at this talking about this he said i cant believe it either but here we are do you see any difficulties in making the shot no at that range with a velocity a little over three thousand feet per second it wont drop an inch the downward angle wont play because it isnt far enough and the buildings as well as the dip will cancel any wind effects fish in a barrel its technically pointblank except you dont know what pointblank really means and i dont have much interest in explaining it now trust me the bullet will hit what its aimed at and it will destroy what its aimed at even as it destroys itself and then we enter the lyndon johnston era god help us johnson not johnston is this a quiz no im being a jerk because im nervous lets get out of here ive seen enough can you push me up the hill or shall we wait for a cab here im fine i pushed him up the hill november sunny but breezy in the fifties two men in jackets and ties one pushing the other up a slight hill in a wheelchair and that was that for recon planning rehearsal and psychological preparation we dealt with the issues as they came up that was all and improvised our way past any obstacles that night we had a final meeting in my room both lon and i were eager to hear what jimmy had been up to i got this overcoathe held up a tan gabardine model singlebreasted light perfect for the weather and so banal that it would fit in anywhere in americaand had a chinese lady shorten the sleeves here look he threw the thing on it hung well even if the shoulder seams were a little off the shoulder a few inches down the arm who would notice more important you could hide a tank in its folds okay he said heres the interesting part question how do we get a fortyinch eightpound rifle with scope and silencer into a building without anyone noticing it something more sophisticated and more secure please than wrapping it in a paper bag i said youre going to have to break it down obviously said lon and im going to have to show you how to reassemble it it isnt just screwing in screws youve got to set the three screws at a starting point then tighten them three turns apiece in order to a certain total for each hole youve got to line up the slots with a piece of tape that way you preserve my zero hes good at doing things i told lon nodding to jimmy if you show him how to do it hell do it exactly that way mr scott said jimmy i think i can manage im not as stupid as i look its okay jimmy lon said i didnt mean anything snotty im just nervous me too said jimmy who looked as nervous as a stainlesssteel rat trap and we both had a tensionbreaking laugh over such a ridiculous concept jimmy could talk his way into the kremlin if he had to i also had the chinese lady make me this he said he took a roll of material out of the coat pocket and unfurled it on the bed it was about six feet long four inches wide and the woman had sewn pockets at either end with crude but robust stitching meant to support weight i throw it around my neck like a scarf jimmy said he did that so each end hung down the side of his body now in the left pocket i slide in the rifle stock with trigger guard and screws scotchtaped in place and also the silencer in the right pocket i slide in the action barrel and scope the pieces are hanging down my sides halfway down my thighs the metal parts a bit heavier than the wood the whole thing awkward but secure the lady was a good seamstress then i throw the coat on and the coat being much longer than the ends of the scarf are to my knees it covers both completely its so voluminous that nothing shows through the material i just look like a businessman about his job on a coolish fall day in the great downtown trading center of dallas texas as long as i dont run squat bump up against anybody or anything im all right remember my exposure will be short just the walk over from the car the elevator upstairs the walk down the hall and one second to get in i can get the rifle together in thirty seconds you boys arrive we open the window then we leave and go home and watch the rumpus on the television you must have brass balls irishman said lon learned in the bog sir said jimmy tell me the rest will you lon said i dont get it i need to believe in it and bloody hugh here was so gungho and excited i couldnt follow him im jumpy i have to hear it from its author and know its going to work yes sir mr scott said jimmy its a very good plan i said but we do need input we need to know what to look for lon shook his head sadly tomorrow morning explained jimmy around ten ill show up at the daltex building dressed in my best suit my hair all pomaded finelike my eyes twinkly my demeanor all charming irish boyo i will go into six offices on each of the fourth fifth and sixth floors of the daltex building those that front elm as it nears houston and those on houston as it looks down elm from any of those offices elm as it passes the book depository and dealey on its way to the triple overpass is easily reached from the angle we need in each officei know what they are ill spare you the details but theyre garment wholesalers who move goods to texas retailers in and around dallas some ladies lingerie some mens haberdashery a tie specialist two shoe lines the rag trade in shortand ill introduce myself to the girl and present her with my card he reached into his pocket and pulled out a stack of cards james delahanty oneill jimmy representing premiere fashions boston mass da telex premiere then i hit her with my patter jimmy oneill down from boston representing premiere fashions purveyors of fine suitings ladies wear and lingerie and gents haberdashery there is such a place all will know it but its not in this market my pitch were thinking of expanding going national with the fine economy were experiencing and im on a looksee tour to gauge the interest and was wondering if i could get a minute with the boss man to see if hed be likely to take on a new line in all instances the answer should be no not today the reason is that the presidents coming to town and were closing down the office from noon till two to go out and wave at the great young fellow darn i say laughingly my luck ive seen him a thousand times in boston even in bars and restaurants but i pick a day to come to dallas where nobodys seen him when he himself is here she laughs and ushers me out of course im scouting first will the office be closed second how good is the angle to the street particularly since were guessing the idiot will find some way to miss his first shot at the corner and mr scott will have to pick it up as the limo goes down elm and that little hill third how big is the staff in case there are any republicans who might stay behind because theyre not about to admit a democrat irishman has become president fourth what kind of locks on the door and will it be easy to pop if i come back fifth whats fifth you tell me thats what i need to know the windows said lon we couldnt tell from the street how they opened we need an oldfashioned sliding window up and down no foldouts because their hinges dont let them fall low enough to be out of the line of fire very good sir said jimmy books said lon ive got to stabilize the rifle on something other than my lap a heavy board that slides across and is supported on the arms of the chair would be best but i cant ask for that i know youd never get it in the best thing would be some heavy books to pack onto my lap ill rest my elbows on them thats a request not a demand if it comes to it we can secure the chair and i can make that shot offhand i still shoot offhand sitting offhand and im damned good but the books would be helpful books itll be then said jimmy finally you said fourth fifth and sixth floors i did im thinking fifth is the preferable by far i need as little angle downward as possible not for the shooting but for my placement in the room if im on the sixth floor ill have to be close to the window and maybe projecting the muzzle of the rifle beyond it in order to get the low angle not good especially as it lets the muzzle of the suppressor out into the air and the sonic boom wont be contained in the room is that it lon i asked i cant think of anything else lon said all right said jimmy let me sum up how i see it happening i find the most suitable of the offices that matches everything or nearly everything i tell you by telephone which it is then i go back to the hotel and around noon i slip the rifle in its straps about my neck and cover it with the overcoat i amble back through the crowds heading to the plaza to see the young president head down elm and casually dip into the daltex building should get there around twelve ten no problem though there is a busy sheriffs station to the right of the lobby but its a fine public building of commerce with constant unmonitored inout i take the elevator to the proper floor im guessing the place is largely deserted i get to the office pop the lock slip inside quickly i break out the rifle parts and assemble the rifle as mr scott has shown me you fellows hit the building at about twelve twenty by that time most of the crowd has gathered and is awaiting his highness mr meachum pulls mr scotts chair up the three steps and into the lobby and again takes the elevator to the proper floor down the hall to the office its open and you slip in time about twelve twentyfive no need to rush but we all know whats got to happen ill have cleared a space near the window and the rifle loaded and assembled will be there by the way said lon the cartridge is too long to feed up through the magazine youll have to carefully thread the rim into the bolt then slide it forward only one no need or time for a second ill show you later got that sir then mr meachum pushes mr scott to the shooting position and i pile and arrange the books in his lap we hear the roar of the crowd as the motorcade comes down main a block over turns down houston then turns again down elm mr meachum raises the window say i said maybe it would be better if you opened the window first thing that way theres no chance of somebody across the street being attracted to the moving window and then seeing evidence of the shot im guessing even with the silencer therell be some burst of gas thats good said lon it wont be much and itll be so light that i doubt itll be observable but why take the chance so be it said jimmy the second the job is done down comes the window shouldnt he do that last lon asked anybody who hears a trace of the noise might have oriented to daltex and could catch the motion thats good sir said jimmy consider it done anyhow i remove rifle and books from mr scott and mr meachum wheels him out down the corridor and im guessing out of the building within two minutes well before the police can have gotten over to seal it or investigate though im sure theyll be concentrating on our friend in the next building whos making all the noise in any event its a man in a wheelchair and his attendant whod suspect them of mischief off you go in whichever direction seems feasible until youre well clear of the mess possibly you stop off for lunch then back to the hotel as for me i break down the rifle repack it in the whateveryouwanttocallit throw on the coat replace the books close that pesky window as mentioned and slip out using my toys to lock the door im out of the building a few minutes after you i thought of one more thing said lon it just occurred to me i dont think it matters in the hallways because theres a lot of traffic but if you can the office has to have linoleum or bare wood see im a heavy guy and the wheelchair leaves tracks if they get back tomorrow and someone notices these mysterious wheelchair tracks on the floor again questions may be raised maybe i dont know how investigations work maybe its good i said the tracks thats very good jimmy also try to find an office with thirteenyearold glenlivet gold not the glenlivet red but the gold i might want a highball during the everybody laughed and so for the first time i felt slightly optimistic i didnt feel like breakfast that morning but after a sleepless night i had to get some air around am i left the hotel and took a little walk around downtown it was dowdy even shabby since the miracle of dallas with its steel and chrome skyline was years off absent the glow of the flying red neon horse fifteen or so stories up the magnolia oil company building it just looked crummy the sky threatened rain but the fresh air felt good to my lungs the temperature would rise a bit into the high fifties or low sixties and these trees at least had lost most of their leaves which blew about in the skittish wind in those days everyone raked their leaves then piled them at the curb and burned them so the odor of burning leaves was everpresent during the autumn i tasted it as well enough to give the air texture and remind me of boyhood days before i got myself into the presidentkilling business remember the coup in saigon id killed other presidents i stopped at the walgreens soda fountain read the dallas morning news over a cup of coffee and listened as the texans all about me gibbered excitedly about the presidents upcoming visit the main thrust seemed to be whether or not to go to the parade route and see the handsome young man and his beautiful wife there was also some annoyance at an ad that had appeared in the morning paper in which someone accused the president of being soft on communism the texans in this corner of dallas found the ad in poor taste and more than a few of them groused about it i kept to myself engaging no one even if my tweed sport coat and red tie made me stand out a bit from them they were so excited they didnt notice i thought i had a white shirt left in my room and decided to change into it and to a duller tie i wished id brought a dark brooks brothers suit but id not given much thought to wardrobe when i packed for the trip i walked back to the hotel though chance took me by a hatters on main a few blocks over i went inside i looked around and a fellow came to wait on me we had a pleasant chat and i bought a mild little cowboy hat gray for fall with more brim than i was used to and with slightly more dramatic curl i knew i would feel foolish in it but the trick to wearing a hat is to pretend that you are not wearing a hat the idea was to lower my profile and fit into the hatrich dallas culture where a shortbrim fedora as i usually wore would be far more noticeable than the demure cowpokes lid i now capped my head with feeling more camouflaged i walked back to the hotel and went upstairs and lay down for a bit thered been no calls i was assuming jimmy had already left and was doing his jobs and that lon was resting i also assumed that our pigeon alek had managed to get out to mrs paines retrieved his bag of curtain rods gotten back to dallas without spilling them all over the highway and was on his way to work i was never a praying type of fellow and it seemed wrong to invoke celestial support for a deed so foul but i couldnt help myself from looking skyward and muttering a little something in case someone was listening on the upper floors at i showered again changed into my white shirt and dull brown tie and sat and waited and waited and waited at the phone rang i picked it up it was jimmy got it he said a little high but everything else is perfect office the seventh floor right turn from the elevator take the only left and its on the right great lines down elm got it i said and headed downstairs pipe in mouth hornrims on juniorcowpoke headgear firmly mounted lon was waiting and i nodded at him nice hat he said it turned out we had little to say to each other beyond that exchange if i looked as bad as he did we were in trouble hat or no hat then again i had the normal lon to use as baseline the ruddy vivid sometimes outrageous paragon of stoicism and mordant humor not this pale solemn corpse i could feel myself in the same colorless shroud of skin with the same dryness of breath the same sense of dread and doom all about the presentiment of failure tragedy utter destruction of self and all the selflove he had built plus i was wearing a stupid hat i was so damned heroic i made myself sick i pressed on noble yale champ that i am i had decided to spare myself the agony of pushing lon to the site a twelveorso block ordeal made more difficult in those unenlightened days by the absence of ramps or rails for the disabled but getting lon into the cab was never easy you had to sort of rollpush him from his chair to the seat and wait until he squirmed and pulled himself upward then you folded the wheelchair slid it into the front seat and went around to the other rear seat for some reason he seemed especially heavy that morning perhaps he was involuntarily resisting me willing himself into sheer deadweight above the waist as well as below it where to gentlemen asked the cabbie when huffing and puffing i finally got in i gave him the address of a medical building on poydras just beyond main you know therell be traffic there he said jfks in town hes coming down main in a motorcade and itll all be jammed up with viewers damn i hadnt thought of that fool jerk dolt agh what a ludicrous end to the operation if the assassins got stuck in traffic i realize that i said thats why were early jims appointment isnt until one onethirty said lon picking up on the game off we go then sang the cabbie no problem the cab whizzed along did seem to slow almost to a stop on a main stem but the driver cleverly plotted a new course and got us to poydras well in advance of our time i never even breathed hard during the trip he pulled up outside the building and i got out to unload the wheelchair and lon the driver called need any help sir glad to pitch in they are so polite in texas thanks im used to it i said indeed lon somehow willed himself to be lighter i dont know how he managed to vanquish the laws of physics but it seemed he had obliterated a good twenty pounds of matter from the universe and i fairly tossed him into the chair then i paid the driver plus a quarter tip and turned to wheel lon up the steps to the north dallas medical arts building damn the driver seemed to linger waiting for me to call for help to pull lon up the steps but then another fare slipped into the cab and off they went i wheeled lon the half block down poydras and turned him leftthat is west if it mattersand slowly down elm a block to the daltex building meanwhile the threat of rain had cleared itself up a broad cloudless texas sky vaulted overhead full of brightness in the opening between daltex and the county records building on our side of the street i could see the crowd gathered in front of the book depository it seemed like they were three or four deep already and there were batches of people across the street on the grass of the plaza i wonder if it was as merry as it seemed or if thats my memory playing tricks filtering through the knowledge of the event that i knew was about to occur i suppose that was one america there gathered gaily in the sunlight you could hear indistinct crowd noises a kind of purr or mutter from the breast of the mob somehow fueled by happiness glamour hope good thoughts of self and president and country i knew i was about to take all that away and didnt feel particularly great about it but i felti say this over and over do you think im overcompensating a bit i felt that in the long run when things settled down even if we never healed our wounds over the young man slain our collective future would be brighter and fewer boys would come home in boxes or wheelchairs hugh lon said ive got a great idea lets not do this lets take a cab to the airport and fly to tijuana well spend the next six weeks drinking margaritas and screwing whores even if i cant screw anything how does that sound you cant screw whores because of a tragedy called paraplegia and i cant screw whores because of a tragedy called marriage i said even if we both dream of whores thats the end of that youre right i guess we ought to go ahead besides i said we cant find any cabs this isnt manhattan you know at elm and houston we got a good look at the celebration more and more people seemed to be gathering and spreading across the grass of the plaza as if it were some racecourse infield or county fair the sun was bright and i could see hats cameras and sunglasses and feel those positive feelings in the air from pop music good vibrations it felt more like a circus or ball game than a political event but i suppose that had to do with the unique identities of jack and jackie who were more like movie stars than politicians when the light changed i pushed lon across elm then we turned up the street to the entrance of the daltex building i checked my watch it was and felt a little early but it wasnt easy going up elm with the crowd continuing to rush down to get a good place to view the kennedys and a few times i had to pull back or turn sharply to avoid colliding with anybody when i got to the three broad steps that led to the entrance of the daltex building it was i turned lon outward and pulled him up the steps then evading this fellow and that pivoted him and steered him to the main entrance luckily there were no revolving doors a royal ordeal for anyone in a wheelchair someone held the door for us and i slid into the dark lobby to the right behind a thick window and illuminated from within by fluorescent lighting full of bustle was an office of the sheriff of dallas county i could see a few uniformed deputies inside but mainly it was women at desks with typewriters talking on phones or filling out official documents there was a receiving counter and a few people stood in line to be waited on by a sergeant no one in there showed the slightest awareness that in a few minutes the president of the united states would come by in a lincoln limo waving happily to the folks breathing the sweet air and enjoying the lush sunshine one last time i got to the elevators punched up and waited till a door opened a few late stragglers were there and i pulled lon to the side to let them out as they straightened hats or pulled ties tighter or shrugged into jackets against the slight chill in the air when the car was empty i backed lon in and the doors were just about shut when a woman ducked in she smiled punchedahthree and turned and asked me for a floor six i said because lying was natural to my state of being again overcaution a sign of paranoia fear lack of confidence the three of us rose in silence and she got out at three smiling turning to say politely as usual good afternoon and i think we both muttered something then i quickly hit seven to make sure the elevator continued its ascent after the stop on six at seven i pushed lon out the hall was darkish empty with no sign of human buzz or hum anywhere most people had gone to the plaza to see president kennedy i pushed lon down the hall watching the signs on or at the doorways slide by watching the numbers climb until at last we came to an intersection and turned to the left down another betterlit corridor the offices to the right behind opaque glass had exterior windows funtastic fashions mary jane juniors i pushed the door and stepped into the tworoom office suite that was the headquarters of funtastic fashions apparently from the idealized pictures on the wall some kind of line for naive young women whom you might find in the farm belt all wholesome gingham and flowerpatterned jumpers and dresses in heavy patterns as worn in the artists sketches by pictograms representing the perfect happy welladjusted junior miss odd how some details stick in mind in one our heroine was running with a dog and the dog reminded me of a neighbors dog from some distant past i could remember the dog though not the neighbor or the city or the year but the dog rang a bell i pulled the door softly shut hearing it click locked and pushed lon across wood flooring beyond the secretarys desk the name on the door to the bosss office was simple mr goldberg it meant nothing to me nor did the pictures on the wall of a middleaged fellow who looked to be jewish with a wife and three children all five beaming at the success mr goldberg had made in dallas texas i slid lon into the bosss office a square highceilinged woodfloored room full of light with an overhead fan rotating sluggishly with a slight hum it was dominated by two large windows and immediately across the way i could see the upper floor of the texas book depository i pushed lon to the window and as we approached the angles widened and revealed in all its detail and seething mass of witnesses along both curbs the spectacle of elm street trending left as it descended the gentlest of inclines shielded at our end by the canopy of a few oak trees yielding to the broadness of the plaza green in bright sun dotted with lastminute scurriers trying to get into at least the third rank along the curb for maximum proximity to the glamour couple from our vantage we could not see the grassy knoll we could not see the amphitheater the pillars the marble benches all the flourishes of athens on a good day in bc that the texan city fathers had constructed there but we could see every square inch of elm street once it emerged from the trees jimmy had assembled the rifle raised the window a few inches and laid out a few large swatch books on mr goldbergs desk for lons lap i glanced at my watch it was when i pushed lon to the place where hed determined to shoot from we had our inevitable crisis what do they sayno plan survives contact with the enemy the issue was height in order to assure that minimum noise would escape from the room lon told us we had to be as far back from the window as possible even with the german suppressor jerryrigged to the muzzle if it extended beyond the window it would admit the report to the outer atmosphere and might attract attention or at least curious eyes the point was to contain as much of the attenuated report as possible within the confines of the room where it would be deadened by the noiseabsorption qualities of the walls and furnishings and by the buzz of the ceiling fan swishing away overhead lon would shoot from his chair but as far back from the window as possible while still having vantage on the target the problem at no place in the room would lon be high enough to get the necessary angle over the sill we stood stupidly brilliant hugh had fouled up again it never occurred to me nor had it occurred to jimmy why the fifth floor was preferable it was too late to get down a floor or two where the angles would have been more welcoming can we get you standing lon i asked not without my knee braces which are in roanoke we have to raise him i concluded it was jimmy who remembered the swatch books originally destined for lons lap at least three inches deep they contained fabric samples he brought four of them over we can lift him up on these he said he set two down and we labored to lift the wheelchairs right tire not an easy task though lon helped by shifting his weight accordingly then the other one lon plus chair was really heavy and this lift was no picnic i could feel my veins bulging with blood as i gave it all my strength but it was probably jimmy who did the bulk of the work lon was up high enough yeah he said good angle but its crooked the left one is higher than the right one i can compensate but i got it said jimmy quickly he peeled off his nice new overcoat folded it into quarters and bent to the wheel i did my part again using all of my muscles and jimmy got the coat wedged between the rubber and the book i saw that the tire had left a black mark where it pressed into the gabardine dry cleanings on me i said much better lon said it brought him to the level where he had the angle above the sill but beneath the bottom of the window lock the brakes as i bent to do so we heard a rise in sound it seemed that the motorcade had hit lower main a block away and when the magic lincoln passed it unleashed a roar of inchoate human energy cheers and yells yes but also the collective sighs and deep breaths of the enchanted their prince had come i knew that kennedy was but a minute or so away here said jimmy handing lon the rifle it was a long sleek thing not like aleks piece of battered military junk not like the dangerous army guns the carbines and bars and tommy guns id seen in vietnam not like the red burp guns with their ugly ventilated cooling housings and their mobstyle drums featured in every statue in russia i had to say that the rifle had an aristocratic grace and in some odd way it seemed appropriate to the young princes demise lon had told me it was a winchester model and i knew that he and his late father had enjoyed a long and mutually satisfying relationship with the company at one point lons father had been presented with a rifle called the tenth black king in some awesome caliber called that because the american walnut of the stock was so bloodred that it looked black in certain lights and when winchester wanted to give presentation guns to some who were prominent in the gun world they had their custom shop build an edition of ten all called black kings both lons father and lon used that riflewhich turned out to have unusual powers of accuracyto win or place highly in national rifle competitions this one was not customized at least not by winchester lon had done some work on it lightening the trigger bedding the action which i understand to be coating the interior where the metal of the action sits in the inlay of the stock with a kind of fiberglass or epoxy so that the contact between the surfaces is percent even and no odd stress from irregularities is transferred to the rifle affecting the accuracy on the whole the thing was beautiful a graceful orchestration of tubes supported in a slice of burnished wood with a slight streamline that seemed to have it leaning forward like a thoroughbred at full extension muscles cut and the entire beast captured in a kind of forward bound a long tube black and shiny was secured to the action above the bolt by two stout metal rings and at a point on the scopes length between the rings lay an administrative housing the site of a vertical and a horizontal turret by which the scope could be tuned for maximum accuracy i was close i happened to note the white lettering above the horizontal turret and it read simply j unertl what distinguished this rifle from any other id seen was the german suppressor the schalldaempfer type as lon called it it too was tubular and locked over the muzzle by means of a pivoting lever cranked to the closed position the genius of german engineering it was surprisingly stubby under a foot long looking like a steel water bottle screwed to the muzzle and much discolored and tarnished from military use lon handled the gun with extraordinary ease i must say his face deadpan he accepted it and mounted it to his shoulder one hand at the comb the index finger suspended on the stock above the trigger not touching the trigger his other flew to the the end of the stock which he acquired and used as leverage thrusting the rifle back hard to shoulder now supported by two elbows this was the holding position because wed used the swatch books to elevate him they were not available for lap duty hed have to shoot offhand i thought for want of a nail the shoe is lost for want of a shoe the horse is lost for want of a horse the battle is lost and imagined the chain of catastrophe that could undo us nevertheless he was an elegant construction slightly canted the rifle and man solid immutable bent forward a bit under muscular tension as if in sprinters blocks the slight vibration of his slow and easy breaths the only sign of life the rifle was locked in his arms which were resting on his elbows on his dead legs i positioned myself at the window immediately adjacent to the opening craning to the left i could see the houstonelm intersection as i heard the roar rolling toward us like a wave i saw a dallas police sedan and then nothing i guessed he was some sort of advance car a half mile or so out it seemed a minute passed and then a white sedan came down the street leading the parade three motorcycles followed then five more in some kind of formation then another white sedan and finally the large black lincoln with its cargo of imminent tragedy open to the crowd it was flanked by motorcycle policemen and we watched as it pulled wholly into view it looked more like a black lifeboat than a car a huge thing with a driver and guard in the front seat then behind them though considerably lower as if squatting a malefemale couple i took to be governor and mrs connally and then jack kennedy himself and next to him in a pink pillbox hat his wife his reddish hair glinted in the sunlight even from almost eighty yards and without binoculars i could make out the ruddiness of his skin and could tell that all the lines of his face were pulling his mouth up into a smile and at that moment it incongruously struck me that he was quite a handsome man he was waving with one hand but only intermittently and if i read his body posture in that split second it was one of relaxation the man was campaigning and happy the limo reached the hard left turn onto elm from houston just below me at that point it was out of sight to lon but i leaned forward and pressed my forehead against the pane i watched as the car slowed almost to a halt and began its slow majestic pivot toward its new direction i could not breathe this was aleks shot his moment to enter history and send us all home absolved of any guilt nothing happened i dont know what the idiot was doing up there but it wasnt shooting silence obviously some kind of failure as per all anticipation that put us right back on the fulcrum of events the little creep with his cowardice his incompetence his stupidity agh the great car turned slowly left and began its descent down elm sliding down the slight undulation that led to the triple overpass which moved it left in lons sights but gently not radically the public feet away on either side all madly waving and cheering you could see the excitement the sparkle or glitter of crowd passion that you see at key moments of big ball games the car was fully oriented toward elm but just feet beyond the axis of the turn when alek managed to fire his first shot we heard the crack in my peripheral i saw lon react not a jerk or a spasm but a tight controlled lurch he kept his discipline though and didnt lose his hold on the rifle which was still he seemed calm i knew he would fire at a specific point in seconds waiting for the target to climb into his crosshairs and would make final minicorrections before coordinating his shot with kennedys arrival at the point of impact designator i locked my eyes on kennedy and the car nothing stirred no reaction no sudden dive for cover nothing had they noticed i thought maybe its not alek maybe its a backfire or firecracker then a second crack rang out and though the car had traveled a good twentyfive yards or so in the interval between shots i could make out no reaction this time either possibly some movement but nothing radical or reflexive as a bullet impact might have unleashed the fool missed twice of course idiot idiot a burst of rage knifed through me the little moron god what a fool he was never did anything right in his life he was struggling to catch up from the blown easy shot was rushing shooting poorly he missed lon i said again i pivoted instinctively enough to see the fluid grace with which lon raised the rifle right elbow locked up for maximum support canting the living part of his body slightly against the dead part his head utterly still and locked on the opening in the telescopic sight he was a portrait of stillness in motion a discipline acquired over a hundred thousand rifle shots the ball of his finger exquisitely balanced against the blade of the trigger the next two three seconds seemed to hang in eternity although possibly thats a conceit i impose from memory for dramatic purposes to make the tale more compelling even if the only soul ive ever told it to is myself feu the rifle leaped but only slightly in his hand while his head stayed immobile to the scope and his trigger finger followed through to pin that lever to the back of the guard it produced an oddly attenuated report something like a book being dropped on a wood floor with weird tones of vibration maybe a poke and a buzz to the inner ear but nothing sharp and percussive like a gunshot you would expect more would you not it was a phenomenon of vibration this key moment in history a thrum or cello note extended by a master bowman yet in the instantaneous aftermath i thought i heard aleks third shot could they have been simultaneous no because then i wouldnt have heard both it was as if alek had fired a few hundredths of a second after lon we didnt realize then but it was the biggest break we were going to get that day jimmy unperturbed was in charge in another second all right fellows he crooned out you go now while i tidy up here lon stonefaced handed the rifle to jimmy as i knelt and raised the two brakes it took another second for jimmy to singlehandedly ease lons chair from the swatch books and pull the coat off and then i had him turned around and was beelining to the door dont rush sir called jimmy youve nothing to hide remember i took a quick peek back and saw that jimmy already had the rifle half disassembled and was working on the third screw then the door closed and i was in the outer office i sped to that door and it locked behind me with a click and we were in the hallway i pushed down it trying to control my breathing finally i had to ask good hit dont ask me what i saw through the scope hugh ever we reached the elevator i punched the down button and waited an eternity for it to arrive and the doors to open i shoved lon in hit and listened as the doors closed behind me when the elevator doors opened and i pushed lon into the lobby of the daltex building it was as if wed entered a new america i say that knowing how trite it sounds and then i worry again that my memory is playing tricks on me and has added a drama that wasnt there maybe i still say it was like a massive change in the weather ill argue till death that the color had been drained from the day and the atmosphere had turned sepia ill claim that all the human specimens we observed were in a state of stunned shock mouths and faces slack posture discipline unhinged a tone of disbelief bleeding toward numbness and shutdown everywhere it was only about ninety seconds after lons shot and no one had processed what happened yet although all knew almost instantaneously that something something horrible had transpired then as we watched it transformed instantly into panic buzz dread gibbering stupidity people couldnt shut up an insistent yammer began a mutter with high notes inflections voices piping or breaking or losing steam in a flood of phlegm the lobby was not crowded but everyone began yapping at each other along the lines of he was shot in the head oh my god is he dead who the hell could have done it was it the russians did the commies get jfk where did the shots come from the book depository are you kidding the book depository who would do such a terrible thing nobody paid the two of us any attention and i pushed lon to the door rotated degrees to back out and pull him through got that done and emerged into sunlight heat panic incredible motion pandemonium everywhere random braindead movement and people talking insanely among themselves i saw only one man moving with purpose a dallas policeman who raced to the building almost knocking me down getting by and bulled his way inside he was quick that man and i dont know if it was by official directive or his own decision but hed understood that if the book depository was the probable origin point for the shooting other buildings with access to elm street should be sealed for investigation hed missed us or perhaps scanned us from afar and dismissed us because of lons disability as for jimmy still inside i felt confident that he could outthink and outmaneuver a dallas policeman any day of his life i gingerly pushed lon to the edge of the steps and began the ordeal of easing him down into the roiling crowd which drawn to tragedy exactly as had been the thousands whod lined up to see the bulletriddled corpses of bonnie and clyde surged toward the plaza to see to know to feel to bear witness to be a part of what all felt was a calamitous day for our country i was trying to figure which way to go as fighting the crowd with lon wouldnt be easy id pretty much decided to get across elm divert to houston hit main and head up until the crowds had thinned then cut to commerce to get us back to the hotel then the left wheelchair tire caught on something on the middle step i bent awkwardly to see what it was a chunk of loosened cement that had worked out of the joinery between the stone slabs and was readjusting the chair by pulling it back a couple of inches when in my peripheral vision i saw alek i happened to be tilted away from him i was looking down and hunched and twisted to jigger the chair free and perhaps that is why he didnt see me was that luck i suppose the other truth is he probably wouldnt have recognized me under the cowboy hat i wore and under the pall of doom he wore he was the betrayed man for an instant but only an instant i felt a mote of sympathy for him hed been looking through the scope trying to get on target for his third shot when hed seen what only lon had seenthough within months thanks to mr zapruder the world would see it alek with his low weaselly cunning would know in that instant he was tricked and abandoned stupendous fury must have overcome him replaced in seconds with abject sickening panic along with thoughts along the line of fucked again failed again now im really cooked or maybe thered been a twinge of ego gratification in what had to be his impending destruction at last he was important enough to betray his paranoid fantasy had at last come true he was that crazy somehow hed gotten downstairs and out of the building before it was sealed now he had no place to go he had no escape plan he knew the wagoneer wouldnt be waiting at houston and pacific that it wouldnt be long before a canvass was taken at the depository and his absence was discovered a few minutes beyond that when his fbi record was connected to his name he knew he was about to become the most hunted man on earth he already looked it he knew he was the patsy he was grim hunched angry churning ahead with menace and dread in his beady eyes his skin was ashen his hair was all messed up his cheeks were hollow his jowls set hard as if he were grinding his teeth though muscular he had his hands jammed into his pockets which narrowed his shoulders and gave him an almost negligible slenderness he was the quintessential man of the fringes aware that the bright glare of the worlds attention was to be focused on him no trained clandestine operative would have presented such an obvious profile to the world but nobody else was paying much attention either he fought against the human current that gushed toward dealey and the scraps and fragments of hope that filled the air i heard them too maybe hes okay head wounds bleed a lot they got him to the hospital in minutes maybe seconds these days docs can do anything maybe it was a grazing wound you know splashed some blood but didnt do any real harm that happened moren youd think in the war a guy that vigorous hell be up and about and playing touch football in a few days impervious head down clothes ever grubby and attitude ever surly alek bucked ahead ducking stutterstepping evading and soon i lost sight of him his destiny lay elsewhere i got lon all the way down to the sidewalk and joined the human tide everywhere i looked small scenes of grief played out a negro woman had collapsed and was shrieking violently there seemed to be cops everywhere children cried women wept the men had that grave glaring war face that id seen and would see again in vietnam the pedestrian masses overspilled the streets and traffic was at a standstill we could see more and more police cars converging on the scene though trapped in the amber of people and vehicles going nowhere guns had come out and i think federal agents had arrived with their tommy guns or maybe it was dallas homicide with all the firepower i dont know who they thought they were going to fight maybe some red sniper nest defended by machine guns on the sixth floor of the book depository that was the focus of the attention it was surrounded by policemen and cars and earnest federal agents whod taken out their badges and pinned them on the lapels of their dark suits many had pistols out too at the same time the television trucksremember tv news was in its infancy then and the camera equipment was cumbersomehad somehow bulled their way through gotten their cameras out and set up shots i could see every which way earnest reporters addressing the tripodmounted eyes of the networks and the locals i think dan rather was there somewhere farther down the hill i could see armed officers on the grassy knoll that would become such a feature and all across the green emptiness of dealey small groups of people stood many pointing first at the looming book depository then at the grassy knoll nobody pointed at daltex and the noise i cant quite describe it but it was as if involuntarily every one of the thousands of folks there had started to moan or snort or breathe too heavily a persistent murmur filled the air not the surge of joy id heard from daltex but something guttural and low animalistic no one person contributed that much but it was the voice of the collective unconscious expressing its horror and grief and regret id never heard before and would never again hear anything like that i got lon across elm and we began to push our way up houston toward main people stormed by us late to the party but intent on joining nobody gave a damn about us except for one cop at the corner of main and elm who noted me waiting for the solid stream of traffic to break to get across and when i was about to give up and go up main he took command of the traffic whistle and attitude at full blast and cleared a space for us to get across i nodded thanks to him and he nodded back that was my only encounter with law enforcement that day and ill bet in ten seconds the officer had forgotten all about it i continued down houston until i reached commerce and started up it the adolphus was ten or so blocks away then miraculously i was able to flag a cab i gave him the hotel and got lon in the driver couldnt stop jabbering did you see it no i said which should have been sufficient but like any guilty man i overexplained we were at the doctors for my brothers checkup he didnt notice his mind was obsessed with what had happened ten minutes ago man i cant believe it can you mister holy cow its such a tragedy he was such a handsome young man and that wife god what a dish she was jean simmons and dana wynter combined with a little audrey hepburn oh lord what she must be going through i heard on the cop channel they drilled him square in the head and there wasnt anything left and is it official is he dead i dont know god what a mess it took some time to fight our way up commerceit was as if the city had shut down everywhere except dealey plazabut eventually we arrived at the adolphus the doorman solemn as was everybody helped me get lon out of the cab seat and into his chair i could see he had been crying the crying continued inside where a few old ladies of the flowery southerngentlewoman sort sat in a corner of the lobby two of them in tears the other two ministering to them with white hankies i heard someone ask if the show at the century room would be canceled that night i need a drink said lon good idea i said i wheeled us through the lobby past the grand staircase and the elevators and into the dark mens bar surprisingly crowded surprisingly quiet dominated by a large blackandwhite tv above the mirror at the center we found a table with a good view of it requested that the waiter turn it up and went through the texan idiocy of the bottle club jenkins i said giving my official cover name under which i was registered i have a bottle of bourbon jb could i have a shot straight and a glass of ice water lon remembered his own nom de guerre laid claim to his bottle of southern comfort and ordered his own straight shot with ice on the side bring both bottles sirs the waiter asked yes i said i think were going to need them i checked my watch by now it was evidently walter cronkite had just announced then taken off his glasses and pinched his nose that jfk was gone someone said something wise and someone else closed him down fast texasstyle with shut up charlie tait or dadgum i will shut you up myself we sat there all afternoon in the dark silence watching the images float across the screen we watched the discovery of aleks rifle and the three cartridge cases we heard of the swearing in of lyndon johnson all without comment the news came shortly thereafter that a cop had been shot to death in the oak cliff section of dallas but nobody knew whether it was related to the presidents death except me aleks roominghouse was in oak cliff it had to be him and the description of the assailantyoung white man fiveten or so muscular build under thirtyhad to be him at the time i thought damn i told him not to bring a gun and the bastard disobeyed me i knew i never should have counted on him and cursed myself doubly for springing such a dangerous incompetent on the snoozing world later i realized hed gone all the way back across town to retrieve the pistol so he had at least stayed under discipline until he understood that hed been betrayed that was all i could have asked of him i said a prayer for the policeman hypocritical no but hypocrisy is one sin i cannot evade it is after all the core of my profession a demure churchgoing dad and yalie by weekend who plots murder by weekday i was quick to come to terms with it i concluded in the end that i had done all that was possible to ensure such an outcome would not happen it did anyway because of the intractability of the piteous alek it is a misfortune but not a tragedy all operations of forcewe were to learn this in spades in the coming decadeinvolve risk of collateral damage the policeman like the president made his career decision based on a costbenefit analysis took his chances and his number came up that is the wicked way of the real world morally justifiable if the ends themselves are morally justifiable so it goes i dont think i can take any more of this lon finally said you okay i said ive felt better he replied remember i said the long view easy to say he said not so easy to do ill push you i said and started to get up hugh ive had enough of you for one day all right he wheeled himself out of the bar and i watched him propel himself across the lobby to the elevator where another guest had to punch his floor he rolled into the car the brass doors closed behind him and off he went i went back to the bourbon and the television i watched air force one take off with the new president the body of the old president and that poor crushed rose of a woman who was just two hours ago the glamour center of the world at about it came it signified the beginning of a new phase one in which i was extremely vulnerable as was the agency for which i worked and which i loved whose reputation and possible ruin i had risked this from dallas the police department arrested a twentyfouryearold man lee h oswald in connection with the slaying of a dallas policeman shortly after president kennedy was assassinated he also is being questioned to see if he had any connection with the slaying of the president oswald was pulled yelling and screaming from the texas theatre in the oak cliff section of dallas it didnt take long for them to round him up did it about two hours and in that time hed managed to kill a policeman what a complete fool he was again it made me sick and i took another bolt of the hooch which hit like a mallet driving me further into blur i think i phased out after that as the bourbon took over and i fell into a stupor i was not behaving well this was not in the pippip onward and upward tradition of the agency and all its skull and bonesers the event had reduced me to alcoholic stupor i dont remember going upstairs to my room or taking a shower or climbing into my pajamas i dont remember going facedown on the bed i do remember waking up around midnight and i remember the panic i felt where was jimmy costello chapter these strange visions for such they must be called are extremely vivid in some cases but are almost incredible to the vast majority of mankind who would set them down as fantastic nonsense nevertheless they are familiar parts of the mental furniture of the rest whose imaginations they have unconsciously framed and where they remain unmodified or unmodifiable by teaching bob squinted feeling his brow crunch in pain so wrote francis galton in the late nineteenth century and bob thought what the fuck if he understood it and he wasnt sure he did niles gardner had been fascinated by whatever thing it was that sir francis had noted or so years earlier some fantastic vision disease or condition it had to do with colors showing up when cued by encounters with nothing of color a letter could have a color to it or in this case a number he seemed to be saying or acknowledging or somehow having fun withthere was an unidentifiable sense of lightness to it humor almost a jokehow he saw certain things in color he would always see the number four as blue which was why he had four junky ceramic bluebirds on his shelf and the number six as green which was why he had a magazine illustration from the fifties that incidentally displayed six green elm trees most provocatively he saw the number nine as red which was why he had a mauser pistol lying around one of the few mausers designated by the numeral engraved in the grip then painted red and known forever after as red nines swagger sat in the business office of the adolphus where he was again staying in dallas and banged his head against the enigma at a computer monitor that the hotel provided its guests outside the door prosperous men seemed to push to and fro by extreme happenstance the hotel was that weekend the site of some sort of jfk assassination research meeting swagger had ridden down in the elevator with a batch of them mostly heavyset white guys in sport shirts who hung together yall interested in the assassination he asked one mmm said the man looking off as if he had some big secrets cooking and couldnt share them with an outsider maybe he was the guy who realized that the commies had not one or two but three oswald clones in play on november swagger looked back at his notepad where in childish script in an attempt to keep it straight and orderly he had inscribed some notes that anyone else might see as insane blue green red read one line maybe numbers not as significant as colors maybe sequence isnt important maybe its not a code its just what he sees why would hugh have anything to do with or or blue green or red that was a stumper he was he realized on the second step but only on the basis of fragile assumption that assumption that hughs last best lost work name was a reflection of niles and hughs love of nabokov and that it involved a pun possibly crosslingual that could be noted only by someone who knew it existed so what linked them but there was no direct link between the three numbers the three colors and hugh except the pistol as his son noted stood for espionage it had to it was exactly the implement any spy in the twenties or thirties might have carried if he didnt have a luger what were its advantages over a luger more firepower ten rounds to seven longer barrel meaning more accuracy more ergonomic because its weight was ahead of the trigger not above it as in a luger more psychologically threatening to an opponent more flexible as it could be mounted to a shoulder stock and used for longerrange shooting it did have disadvantages bigger heavier a little harder to load with a stripper clip that demanded fine motor control to mate with the interior magazine lips rather than a magazine which by gross motor movement could just be shoved into the lugers grip harder to conceal maybe very difficult to conceal because it was bigger yet these were the sort of things a bob lee swagger would consider not a niles gardner niles after all was a lit guy not a gun guy he wouldnt be thinking tactically but symbolically and in his brain the glamour and the romance and the vividness of classical prewar espionage back when it was called the great game was just as easily conveyed by the mauser as by the luger maybe the meaning of the gun as tool was of less importance to niles than the meaning of it as symbol in his mind it could and probably would be his image of his friend the heroic three tours in nam hugh meachum after all hugh was the man niles could never be but would always want to be the gun solid steel precise deadly able to destroy at long distance concealable under a burberry trench coat the indispensable leverage that enabled its possessor to control any dangerous transaction was a perfect projection into objective reality that expressed all the hugh traits that niles didnt have as niless mind had to work hugh was the red nine it had to be that way maybe the assumption wasnt so small after all the red association was another buttress in the argument for it conjured up russia which after all had been hughs primary target the vietnam tours being mere diversions it all fit together but it went nowhere it didnt connect to nabokov it didnt connect to the agency it just sat there an old pistol on a dead mans desk its secrets locked away only a glow of hopes or fantasies about it its sole uniqueness the red nine on its grip i wish i had a drink i wish i had a cigarette i wish i had a whore i wish i had a mansion by the sea no he didnt he didnt wish he had any of those i wish i had an answer he thought that maybe that answer lay somewhere within the work of sir francis galton cousin to darwin victorian polymath bob had to look up the new word he googled sir francis the wikipedia entry came up first and he absorbed the info quickly eugenicist another word to look up hmm seems to believe smart people should breed and dumb ones shouldnt fingerprints hmm noted the uniqueness of fingerprints classified them and thus invented the forensic discipline of fingerprint index and thus in one sense was the father of scientific crime investigation heredity believed passionately in the power of genes obviously eugenics and fingerprints and that talent clusters could be associated with certain families ie those of the superior english upper class into which he was born synesthesia it was something he had been the first in the world to note clinically but it was another new word bob googled it synesthesia aleks grubby face stared at me from the screen same surly demeanor same anger same radiant negativity and selfpity undercut with toxic defiance it made me sick i staggered to the tv set and changed channels but no matter where i turned there was alek with some demented commentator spewing out the sordid details of his life russia marine corps attempts to defect poor employment record marriage to a beautiful russian girl father of two baby daughters known for temper and abusive explosive behavior there was a fuzzy film of him handing out procuba pamphlets in new orleans really what did he think that would accomplish now and then theyd cut to film of his wife as she carried the two babies to a car amid a swarm of reporters and cameramen i remember being struck with how pretty she seemed but also how confused and vulnerable i hoped she had somebody good to take care of her and was later gratified to discover the ministrations of the angelic ruth paine on marinas behalf thank god for the good people of the world to somewhat ameliorate the pain caused by teams like alek and hugh it took a while but i was more or less sober when i got around to assessing my position of alek even in police custody i had little fear what could he tell them and when would he tell it listening carefully to the reports i concluded hed not yet made any wild charges about russian agents guiding him rather hed been indicted only on the murder of officer tippit for which he had no alibi and no defense and for which there were plenty of witnesses hungering to send him to fry in the chair he was probably enjoying the attention and plotting how to spin it out for years and years and years that he would die at the end was at this point meaningless he was having too much fun being famous at last every time the coverage shifted to washington to tracking the grief and shock of the capital city to images of a weary lbj arriving home of jackie returning alone to the white house i changed channels and by one had turned the damn thing off i knew it was the beginning and that it would go on and on and wed have to get the reaction of each family member each intimate each acquaintance wed attend the funeral and the burial and the it was too much so much for tough guy hugh the new critic of politics and policy not letting emotion or sentimentality get in his way when the tube was dark that left me alone with my biggest fears concerning jimmy costello i checked my watch again i stole down the hallway to knock on his door softly and got no answer i paused at lons too and heard the regular breathing of merciful sleep though now and again hed stir uncomfortably back in my room i tried to think things through suppose theyd nabbed jimmy and the rifle suppose theyd offered him a deal no execution if he rolled over fast though it was against his principles maybe hed seen that taking the rap alone was no bargain so hed talked it went on maybe even now police raiders were assembling to swoop us up men with tommy guns and shotguns hellbent on justice and retribution i wished id brought my with me the best thing under those circumstancesthough tantamount to an admission of guiltwould have been the swift application of grains of hardball suicide to the head but that would leave peggy and the boys and poor lon to face alone the mess id made i knew i couldnt do that if caught id also have to absolve the agency of any blame make certain all knew it was my ploy and my ploy alone that id coerced lon into it against his will that i had done it for what i believed were sound moral policy reasons confess take my sentence and face my executioners with dignity and grace leaving a legacy for my sons and the agency there was nothing to be done i called the desk to see if the bar was still open and it was not and inquired if i could have a bottle sent to my room and was told it was too late so i just sat there waiting forgodot i suppose the knock on the door the explosive entry of the raid team mr dulles so disappointed cord even more disappointed i saw myself saying but cord it was your wife he was screwing and cord answering he was the president of the united states you fool then there was a knock on the door soft but firm oh jesus i thought for it was the climax to the day live or die would be decided upon the opening of the door i glanced at my watch good christ it was nearly five i walked over smiling sheepishly jimmy costello with something wrapped and bundled in his suit coat was standing there sorry im late mr meachum he said hope you wasnt worried i only had three heart attacks and finished my bottle and tried to order another very sorry no no god man not your fault mine i should have been tougher the leader hangs together in the bleak moments and i didnt thank god for that irish rascal jimmy costello bet youve got a story to tell no heroics just me sitting in the dark for twelve hours until the night became wee and i was able to make a dash tell me sure but can i go to my own room first and get myself my own bottle absolutely enough for a glass for the boss count on it mr meachum he laid the bundle down on the bed where it fell open i was happy to see the rifle in parts still in its odd canvas holster straps the man himself returned in a few seconds undid his tie poured us each a couple of fingers and commenced with the tale i cant capture the trace of irish brogue that underlay his account because it was more a thing of rhythms and lightly alternative syllabic emphasis so i wont even try it would be blarney but heres the gist of it as i recall you leave i get the gun disassembled and holstered i snatch up the coat and im out the door maybe thirty seconds after you i hear it click and head down the hall when i remember the damned window the window i give it a second maybe the old man wont notice his window open where it was closed before but hes a jew smart as a tack with a gift for details if hes in the garment trade because thats the biggest of big business games so i duck back pop the lock flee across the outer office to the inner and get the window down as it was so im maybe a minute and a half behind you as i hit the hallway and lo and behold ahead of me the elevators open and a couple of birds pop out theys all concerned about the president but more so about not being able to leave the office because of that damn cop what did he think a haberdasher gunned down the president they were so taken with it i know they didnt pay a hairs attention to me so i figured i was okay but when i get to the elevator and push down the doors didnt open i figure theres been another call and check the indicator above the doors and see both cars are downstairs in the lobby and aint budging i figure that means the cops have put the kibosh on them for a bit while they check out the real estate i go to the stairwell and can hear commotion on the flights below not sure if its cops coming up or citizens going down whatever but its not good i slip off my shoes and in my stocking feet head up a flight to the top me with the death rifle hanging around my neck heart beating like a drum he took a pull of his bourbon and i joined him i make it up and then run out of building im hard against the roof fortunately the stairway does lead up to a door set horizontal in the roof using my picks i pop the door in a second roll to the roof and let the door slip shut behind me hearing it lock i look about the roof is empty and no building stands taller to give vantage the only structure would be the elevator machinery house twentyfive yards away i ease my way to it feeling naked as a jaybird and worried about helicopters or lowflying planes but the sky is empty too ive got my jimmy keys and im in in a flash i squint and can see theres not much but space for the greasy lifting and lowering machines i get past the machinery to the far end of the house where some quirk in design has left a platform in the wall so it forms a shelf or space or something fortunately jimmys a strong boy and he gets himself up there and wedges himself way back to the wall so hes not visible to flashlight beam from the doorway a searcherd have to come by the motor works go to the rear and shine a beam directly in i squeeze this way and have to do some squirming to get more or less comfortable pushing my coat this way fixing it so im not lying on the gunstock or got a lump of coat under my ass because ive decided my best bet is to stay still till the middle of the night then ease out i committed myself to the long haul in the dark a few hours later i hear noises and sure enough the door into the machine room is opened lights are turned on and i hear a couple of detectives and a janitor the janitor is saying see nobodys been up here since the last inspection in july besides you got the guy the cop answers we have to check everything bud i hear them poking around and some light beams shoot around the machinery nobody wants to go in any farther they dip out in a second and thats that for another twelve hours very good i said my jimmy i knew he could outsmart a couple of buckram texas detectives well not so good he said i havent told you of my problem how can it be a problem jimmy youre here poor alek has been nabbed and everythings as it should be im hoping so anyway heres what happened i lay flat after that and let the time pass after a bit they okay the elevator and so im close to the huffing and humming of that motor and can hear the cables winding and unwinding the whole elevator cycle the doors opening and closing the cars going up and down and on and on by ten its settled and by eleven its gone away i figure a few more hours but around two im suddenly smelling something and i dont recognize it acridlike industrial for some reason id say it smells brown if that makes any sense smells of machines and such and heres the funny thing i know ive smelled it before but i dont know where or when the smell continues and i realize its rising out of my own clothes i feel around with my fingers and come across a spot on my overcoat upon which the rifle has lain and its damp and i bring it to my nose and that smell nearly knocks me out ive got the picture somehow i arranged myself in a certain position and the rifle action had slid out of its pouch a bit it laid on its side over a long time and whatever mr scott used in cleaning and lubricating it hoppes i said its a bore solvent and lubricant he uses it to clean then he lightly coats everything with it as a lube yeah its pungent thats it then anyhow this stuff has to obey gravity it begins to seep downward and it starts dripping out this happens over and over as im lying there and a stain is spreading fortunately from the way ive got my things arranged its all on the overcoat and none on the suit coat which id pushed back so it didnt get lumpy on me now ive got a problem its not just the stain but its the smell suppose as im heading back to the car im stopped the cops are sure to be about i can talk my way out of anything and ive got my james delahanty oneill card and massachusetts license to get me out but that stains standing out like a bullseye on my chest and maybe these texas coppers know guns and can id the smell not good after i climb down i take the coat off and fold it it turns out they used that shelf to store carpeting so i slide the coat into the carpeting so that its covered by a lot of weight i smooth the carpeting over it you cant tell from looking at it that the old carpeting pile contains a coat and its so heavy that im thinking itll contain that smell forever at least until it evaporates that leaves me with only my suit coat to hide the strap with the rifle parts and its not long enough i figure i can make it out of the building unseen and then ill dump the rifle behind some garbage cans ill go to the car come back drive around a bit to make sure no cop car is patrolling and jump out and secure the rifle thats my plan and thats what i did and i didnt have no problem it seems theres lots of folks out they keep going down to the depository which is all lit up and theyre placing wreaths and bunches of flowers on the hill anyway sir thats the story i think were okay i said theyre so convinced its alek and only alek and hes probably beginning to think that way himself theyll never do the kind of search that would uncover the coat possibly in a year when all this settles down youd want me to return and revisit and remove that piece of evidence i wouldnt do it too soon jimmy id wait to see how the trial goes id wait to see if the investigation stays with alek or they tire of him and branch out if the government commits to alek and history commits to alek nobodyll ever look any further it could lie there for fifty years and never be seen and never tell its story in the meantime get some sleep and i will too and theres nothing left for us to do here except make a lowprofile exit from dallas and return to our lives youve done great jimmy i shook his hand for the first time in twentyfour hours i felt the weight of dread come off my shoulders and the air tasted clean on the way down i took a last sip of the bourbon and this time enjoyed the mallet it amplified the feeling i realized then wed done it and thats the way it happened i have to laugh anytime i encounter the deep plot theory with various government ours theirs anybodys manipulating forces making exquisite plans based on surgical precision and splitsecond timing the clandestine operation on jfks body on the tarmac at andrews being the most hilarious it happened the way everything happens it was part of the world not an exception to it we had a plan for something else and from that basic text we improvised we adapted we bluffed and lied and risked and we brought it off we were given an opportunity and maximized it but we couldnt have done it if we werent already there on the ground in midoperation on another mission it changed its essence and the scope of its ambition seizing on the oneinabillion happenstance that put jfk seventyfive feet outside the book depository and even that opportunity alek the idiot blew still we prevailed it was like everything ramshackle clumsy full of mistakes and unconscionably lucky we threw it together thats all because it seemed right and moral at least to me and because it was i believed my duty i wont argue the morality and i wontcantargue the strategic outcome in the next years i will say this as espionage it was a masterpiece chapter the lawyersadamss in hartford connecticut and bobs actually a recruited fbi surrogate in boise idahodickered for a couple of weeks on issues that lawyers find fascinating share of profits equal share of expenses equal no firstclass travel a major concession for marty equal exposure in the case of lawsuits for libel misrepresentation the expropriation of intellectual property and so forth meanwhile swagger heard from kathy reilly in moscow that his friend and ally stronski had been released from the hospital with no charges filed and had promptly disappeared figuring he was on an izzy hit list a day later stronski himself checked in am fine brother you saved my life one second later on that shot stronski is dead i owe all see you soon then word came from the lawyer that the contract basically boilerplate with a filigree or two was okay swagger arranged to have it sent to him at the adolphus where he stayed in the open as jack brophy richard was witness to his signing and it was sent off to marty for countersigning along with bobs hastily written notebook recording all his latenight ideas for martys perusal the word came back quickly via an email this is brilliant much more than i expected and it seems to dovetail exactly with what i have suspected but was unable to articulate i especially like your focus on oswalds behavior in the two hours of freedom he had left it seems youve noticed things nobody else has and all point to a conspiracy of the sort that could easily involve our friends the happy cousins hugh and lon and maybe a few others let me come to dallas and meet with you and i will tell you what my contribution to our cause is to be i think youll be impressed french room again on me no need to split expenses on this one im so happy they met in the french room three days later ate more sliced carrots filigreed celery thigh of rabbit marinated for three weeks in squid broth and plumbanana tart under a glaze of honey and strawberry all to martys narration which was complete to all apostrophes and something he called an apercu there wasnt even a richard monk along to absorb some of martys excess attention and keep the conversation from becoming too marty to bear finally marty relented and got to his tale over the last morsel of bunny suppose he started lon scottafter all not a sociopath or naturalborn killer by any meansreturned to his home in virginia on november with two pieces of luggage one contained clothes the other contained a model winchester rifle that he had used to put an exploding bullet into the head of john f kennedy like any man whos never killed lon feels contrition regret doubt selfloathing this can but double triple multiply grotesquely as the week wears on and after it the months and the years and the man hes killed is declared in the popular culture a secular saint a martyred kingcamelot and finally a demigod lon cannot bear to confront the instrument by which the deed was done for that is to acknowledge that he was the one who did it and so he commands a servant to stuff it in a closet somewhere there it sits and sits and sits let us consider such an object the case in which the rifle is stored its leather possibly from abercrombie and fitch about a yard long and half a yard wide able to contain the two parts of the rifle stock and actionscope plus the tube of the suppressor in parallel on velvet cushion theres plenty of room for the bolt for the screws maybe a two or threepiece cleaning rod a pack of patches a brush a small container of hoppes a small bottle of lubricating oil and a rag or chamois for mopping up maybe in the case as well are two or three extra rounds that is of the counterfeit iteration on which you have such provocative insights suppose further a metallic residue could be removed carefully from the uncleaned barrel and that residue by neutronactivation hocuspocus would link it to only one kind of bullet at the exclusion of all others the mannlichercarcano manufactured by western cartridge company in the midfifties thats the point if i understand it right jack thats right marty let us further allow that in those days they always put a luggage destination tag on every suitcase which one can fairly guess bore the initials of the ultimate destinationin his case richmondand wrapped it around the handle and there was some kind of adhesive or stickum by which the two ends were joined and suppose they were always dated and lons name and address would have been validated by another tag we have this object linked by dated tags to dallas november never opened because lon never again used or touched the rifle it is physical proof that lon was in dallas that weekend lon one of the greatest shots in the world we have physical proof that he had a rifle capable of firing a bullet into the president we have several samples of the cartridge possibly with lons fingerprints we have the rifle itself with his fingerprints or dna traces on it the barrel of the rifle will contain metallic traces that can be linked metallurgically to the bullet that assassinated the president your honor i rest my case whoever has possession of that case has physical proof of the conspiracy to murder the thirtyfifth president of the united states and by fair inference the identity of the man who pulled the trigger such a discovery would force a reopening of the case and reopened the case would lead straight to wherever it would lead perhaps to the cia cousin hugh meachum the jig as they say would be up do i have your interest yet jack swagger stared at marty intently his mind was abuzz was this bullshit a setup or had the silly fool stumbled on exactly what hed said and had the key to the whole goddamn thing its very interesting said swagger are you saying lets continue as ive said lon doesnt like to look at it so its stuffed away somewhere in a closet or a storage room in a few years his paranoia gets the best of him and he does some research and then clumsily fakes his own death and takes up a new persona hes not a professional and thats why it will be easy for anyone to learn that john thomas albright is lon scott cousin to the mysterious hugh after he dies a lot of lon scotts shooting materialhis beautiful rifles his notebooks the drafts of the articles he wrote for the gun press his reloading and experimental records all that is left to the national rifle association and some of it is displayed in the national firearms museum first in dc and later in fairfax virginia as for the gun case it is incriminating so he wouldnt give it to the nra when he died and became albright he took that with him unopened it was at his new very fine home in north carolina when he died for real this time as albright in to whom would he leave the case he had no living relatives no children there were no women in his life maybe hugh maybe a faithful servant a loyal lawyer another shooter another shooters son hmmm lets go with that one maybe this son dumped it in an attic having no interest in it but unwilling to dispose of it some years later he was contacted by a writer not a real writer but one of those fellows whose obsession with the arcana of firearms impels him to pen volumes like winchester an american tradition and the guns of ruger and so forth and they are such beautiful volumes and he has such great connections in new york that he can get big firms to publish them maybe this writer has tumbled to the fact that famous shooter lon scott mysteriously dead in became john thomas albright famous shooter who lived another thirty years before dying in a hunting accident in arkansas what an interesting life the fellow had even absent the minor detail of november in dallas texas hes decided to write the biography as i say this writer contacts the son of another shooter who has unwittingly inherited all the john thomas albright material and he sells the young man on his project the young man agrees to turn over all the stuffthe gun case a few other rifles the albright manuscripts whatever is left everything for and by and of john thomas albrightfor research purposes the deal is that when the book is published the stuff will be returned to the son he will donate the papers to the nra and sell whatever other goods remain at auction and the provenance of ownership by albrightscott will make the stuff very valuable everybody wins the writer gets his book the son gets the profits of the sale john thomas albrightlon scott gets his place in history the writer is in receipt of the material at his domicile and the first thing he does is make a catalog thats when he discovers the gun case unopened and hes about to tear into it when he sees the date on the tag and the originating city dingdong something goes off in his head he puts it down his own mind racing he thinks and he thinks and he thinks he sees how lon scott later known as john thomas albright could have been the kennedy triggerman that would explain the otherwise baffling clumsy midlife identity change hes sitting on the scoop of the century but he doesnt know enough he reads books he tries to master the gears and flywheels of the event he tries to figure angles and so forth he realizes he needs help so he goes to dallas and discreetly looks around he locates richard monk who is after all a responsible figure in the assassination community and after they bond the writer tells him his story and admits he cant handle it himself he needs a better investigator someone he can trust someone with practical ballistics knowledge and experience etc etc and that is where we are right now swagger said wow thats a lot for one bite oh theres more said marty he reached under the table to remove a briefcase opened it and produced two items the first unrolled was an xray it clearly delineated a model broken down into action and monte carlo stock a tube that had to be a maxim silencer a disassembled cleaning rod a few spare brushes two small bottles and three cartridges of oddly blunt configuration the second was a photograph that displayed the sealed travel tag in closeup with its inscription dated november and its braniff dfwric route indicator and lons name and signature and phone number mountaincrest swaggers response was explicit do not open it do not open it of course not said marty is it secure its in my gun vault in connecticut in the country house swagger thought feeling overwhelmed is this it does this idiot actually have it he could only come up with securityarrangement questions is the house guarded professionally no but its locked in a vault that guarded my mothers diamonds and my fathers rare guns for sixty years without a problem okay he said this could be big this could be it we have to proceed carefully now i agree i think you should hire a security company to patrol your house or move it to some highly protected site jack im in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows a thing except the two of us no one is going to steal it i guarantee swagger nodded youre right i do get paranoid understandable this is exciting i have to see it i just have to look at it to have a sense of it so its settled in my own mind that its there oh wait lets get a handle on all this have you examined the provenance can we determine that the gun itself is linked to lon outside of the case doesnt his name on the case make that point rather eloquently yes but if we could link the gun going to lon lon possessing it via an outside confirmation the argument is so much stronger any idea where lon got it this is the sort of practical detail i never think of no it didnt occur to me ive just kept it trying to figure out my next step arent the winchester records all at the cody firearms museum asked bob yes but no there was a fire in the winchester plant and all the modern records were burnedamong the casualties all those on the model but lon didnt get his rifles directly from winchester he got them from the abercrombie and fitch gun room on madison avenue in new york city where all the american swells got theirs teddy roosevelt and his sons richard byrd charles lindbergh ernest hemingway clark gable gary cooper probably through lyndon johnson all the fancy big game hunters who went to africa for short happy lives in the fifties abercrombie was purveyor to the aristocrats the celebs the nabobs the millionaires for nearly a century they went bankrupt in and the current outfit just has the brand name marty snorted now its a mall clothing company for twentyyearolds with actual abdominals but the firearms records asked bob were they destroyed no said marty now that you mention it theyre in a warehouse in rutherford new jersey too valuable to throw out i suppose yet not valuable enough to catalog index and display can we get in i do happen to know tom browner who was the last manager of the room though hes old and retired i know he has some sway still but jack its not like you can give a name to a clerk and he comes back with the files ten minutes later its a bloody mess years dumped into other years shipping documents spread everywhere correspondence half there and half not finding lon in that mess would be like cleaning the stables i have cleaned some stables in my time said swagger i see it would make you happier to try maybe youll succeed all right ill call tom browner tomorrow and see what he has to say when will you go ah better leave it open sometime soon early next week say rutherford new jersey anyhow when i get back ill call you do you want to make it one trip and go from no new jersey will wreck me for a week ill need recovery believe me so we should set up a date for me to see the case in a couple of weeks excellent said marty it was your idea to go to new jersey asked nick in seattles best number eight this one in oak cliff yeah said swagger but it could easily be anticipated it would have to be done sooner or later youd think marty with his connections up there already would want to do it but he let me come up with it and volunteer to do it because he wants me to believe in the authenticity of the thing on my own if i find anything in the abercrombie files that nails it on the other hand it commits you to a known place and time and if this is a setup thats where it could go down jack brophy walks out of the warehouse into four guns and thats the end of jack brophy sure but my call is that neither marty nor richard have the stone cojones to get involved in a hit not their part of the forest i dont think they could hold it together mentally setting something like that up thered be tells all the way through martyd be sweating like a pig and richard couldnt stop swallowing licking his lips avoiding eye contact theyre not suited for the violent end of the game maybe they dont know maybe whoevers pulling the string is lying to them telling them its some other kind of scam maybe theyre expendable to this guy who after all is fighting for his life his legacy his family name if hes who you think he is and has done what you think hes done but how can i not go if im who i say i am i have to go or the whole deception falls apart and were left with nothing and i have to sit around and wait for hugh to find me you tell me what to do i have no suggestions pray for luck hows that okay then ill make a suggestion you set up your appointment on that day ill have a team from new york in the parking lot no big deal plainclothes but with enough signs of serious operators onsite overcoats concealing long guns vests under the coats snailcord earpieces tactical shades bloused boots that sort of thing if hugh has people the last thing hell want is a gunfight in the parking lot theyll take a powder fast and there wont be any action okay said bob it sounds good you can pay for that its under the james aptapton investigation and the sergei bodonski investigation capping bodonski wasnt enough we have to find out who let the contract its legit law enforcement initiative great said swagger im appreciative if we can take down the contract taker and hes someone big maybe even a oncedead hugh meachum then we dont have to go to jfk up front and once we bag him we can work for proof and eventually it gets out not bad said swagger there would be your career finisher yourwhat do they call it your capstone just said nick so its not yourwhat do they call it oh yeah your tombstone like many americans im not sure if i saw alek get his in real time live on the network or if i saw it a few minutes later when the other networks ran the tape i suppose it doesnt matter id missed his brief encounter with the press friday night since id been ingloriously passed out but id seen it on tape as they had to fill the time when nothing was happening and what id seen had seemed classical alek he was scruffy as usual hair a mess and the shiner from the punch in the eye hed taken earlier that day from a dallas cop hadnt subsided he was surly squinteyed radiating animus the cops shoved him up on a riser and immediately a surge of newspeople surrounded him shoving mikes in his face yelling questions bulbs flashed he winced and got to speak only a few words before the cops hauled him up to homicide i didnt kill anybody he said or words to that effect and i suppose to him it made perfect sense he had to know he hadnt fired the fatal shot it would be a while before i worked out what had happened to him up there but he must have seen the presidents head take its hit and he knew in his feral way that there was a game going on that hed been played for a sucker and was now somebodys prey and off he went thats why his cry of i didnt kill anybody as he was taken away haunted me what you heard in that plaintive tone was selfbelief he knew he hadnt murdered anybodyit follows that if he was a setup he had concluded that his shooting of the dallas police officer was pure selfdefenseand you hear it in that yell the next morning after an alcoholfree somewhat redemptive sleep i returned to the television it seemed all the tv people were grouchy too theyd been working long hours without sleep chasing witnesses and rumors dealing with bureaucratic recalcitrance and asscovering shoved this way and that by defiantly unempathetic dallas cops being screamed at for being slow by network headquarters and screamed at louder for getting things wrong what a life i wouldnt give it to a dog as i fought for clarity with my first cup of roomservice coffee i could sense the irritation everywhere we were now in the basement of the police station to witness aleks transfer from the supposedly vulnerable jail to one that offered more protection to that order an armored car had been arranged so that only a bazooka rocketeer could kill alek and not even in texas were bazookas legal but the transfer had fallen behind schedule things almost always do dont they the reporters had been milling around listlessly for about an hour and when anyone reported it was timefilling banality updates on the timing of the transfer or explanations on why it was late occasionally theyd cut to washington where again nothing was happening they might run some old tape to remind us what this was all about not that wed ever forget nobody did or could distinguish themselves under those circumstances and i stayed with it only because it occupied all the channels id decided to take a shower get up go for a walk find a nice restaurant head back maybe watch some footballthe nfl had decided amid much controversy not to cancel its slate of games tomorrow id fly back to somewhere under my fake identity then to washington under my real one and rejoin the human race and my family suddenly on the television it was as if a wave of energy had crackled through the blackandwhite image of lolling sullen reporters our correspondenti have no idea who it wasinformed us that lee harvey oswald indicted for the murder of officer j d tippit and the only suspect in the murder of john f kennedy was on his way why do i relive this incident surely any who read these pages will have seen it for himself theres no suspense it turns out the same each time the tape is run and as movie special effects have gotten almost too realistic so the almost chaste bloodless death by gunshot of this appalling man is of little consequence to anybody that is the view from a comfortable perch in our present then it was all different nobody knew what the next big twist in our giant american narrative would be nobody could have predicted it not even i who had made the unpredictable happen two days earlier nobody had any idea that mr deus ex machina was about to introduce himself i saw the surly alek emerge from a door at the rear of the crowded room he was shackled to a cartoon figure out of the old west some sort of gigantic cowpoke in a smallish stetsonit was like mine though light where mine was grayand what had to be called a westerners suit apparently khaki it was captain fritz of the dallas homicide squad but he looked to our uneducated eyes like a foursquare avatar of texas ranger justice he stood out in a sea of dark suits and snapbrim hats as if intent on representing the best of texas to a shocked world next to him alek jauntily perhaps even smugly set the pace hed been allowed to clean up and change clothes and wore a black sweater over some kind of sport shirt he grasped his hands at his waist and for some reason projected a mr demille im ready for my closeup sense of selfpossession i have to say that the quality of the broadcast was exceedingly fine every detail stood out almost as if iridescent the lines were bold and sharp the depth of the image was startling i dont think i ever saw anything so clearly in my life alek never knew what hit him deus ex machina hit him fate hit him retribution hit him the fellow ruby stepped from nowhere and jammed the pistola gangsters snubnose so appropriate to a strip club ownerinto his side i dont think there was a flash but the report was enough to carry the news the famous photo almost does the scene a disservice it freezes and therefore distorts you can see captain fritz bending backward in surprise ruby hunched like a boxer whos delivered a solid gut hit and alek mouth open in pain eyes wincing in reality it was so damned fast like a man slipping under the waves in the grasp of an undertow hes there and then hes gone in the flashing of a nerve synapse then chaos disbelief the whirls of spinning figures as people fled the shot alek pulled captain fritz down with him and various officers leaped on ruby and shoved him to the ground if the famous cry jack you son of a bitch was uttered i missed it in my disbelief i sat back and watched the melancholy play end alek uncuffed slid onto a stretcher and wheeled out fast ruby pulled away the reporters tried to make sense of it interviewing each other to make certain the gigantic plot twist theyd just seen had actually happened i got a glimpse of aleks colorless expressionless perhaps breathless face as they wheeled him out and knew he was a goner you dont come back from that one for id gotten a good fix on the bullets diagonal trajectory through innards and i knew the violence it would do to the sweetbread of mysterious but crucial organs that the middle of the body conceals perhaps youll think better of me for it but my first thought was sadness at his death another man dead of violence in america as if i hadnt been the one who killed the last man dead of violence in america it seemed like a contagion you sow the wind you reap the whirlwind and i had to wonder when my whirlwind would come id known him and loathed him as all did while at the same time understanding that he was nevertheless human like the rest of us did he deserve it i suppose so jack ruby thought so and a few days later id hear my oldest son say im glad they got him alek was a jerk he was a fool he was utterly incapable of doing a single thing right but he was human and died as all too many humans do alone in pain abruptly it wasnt until that night that it occurred to me amid the hysterical news reporting that again wed caught another gigantic break luck does favor the bold no question of it now that aleks lips were forever closed thered be no crazed stories of manipulations by cynical red spies who set him up and played him as a sucker a myth wouldnt spring forthothers did of course all patently incorrectto tantalize the imaginative for decades to come books wouldnt be written not about the red master at least nor movies made nor tv series commissioned all aleks secrets would be buried with him and the narrative would shift its focus to this apparition out of chicago confidential this firepluglike gunman with his titillating connection to the demimonde and women with improbably large hair and breasts and arcs of eye shadow i thought you know what i dont have to learn a goddamn thing about mr jack ruby and thats okay with me i viewed the end of alek in solitude because lon and jimmy had already left both of them early on sunday the twentyfourth i saw lon before he was gone i gave him jimmys report and delivered the rifle i watched him put the parts in the gun case he seemed dolorous and depressed i got little out of him jimmy awakened and came by and the two embraced then lon was gone and jimmy was off to pack for his later flight and i was enmeshed in the oswald denouement jimmy always got it more than lon did and he was too professional to let it affect him i couldnt have known then that within six months jimmy would be dead another clandestine services colleague enlisted him to do a routine wiretap insertion on an eastbloc embassy in canada it was a lowlevel routine thing but somehow he was spotteda firstand a mountie of all people saw his shadow in the alley and drew jimmy knew he couldnt surrender and testify it would embarrass too many people he turned and the mountie fired one shot and jimmy fell dead on the streets of ottowa the death addressed as mysterious as in why was an american businessman messing about in the alleys behind the czechoslovakian embassy and why did he flee the mountie requiescat in pace good friend loyal operative hero as for lon i knew i wouldnt hear from him for a long time until he worked some things out if you are thinking danger man he was the only one who knew why didnt you have him eliminated youve seen too many movies the answer is i dont eliminate i dont even like the euphemism eliminate for kill it sounds like cheap fiction i am a moral murderer i can kill only for policy i cannot kill for personal reasons such as to deter threat or to earn money or for the pleasure of removing one of the worlds annoyances what will come will come and i will accept it if lon went mad with guilt and decided to confess then i would accept that decision and ride the horse where it took me but the world wasnt worth living in if you didnt trust the people you loved so i let it go at that and that is what happened i didnt see him again until when he had a different name and a different identity i stayed in the hotel until monday the twentyfifth ironically the day wed planned the general walker job i stayed even though i was anxious to get home to peg and the boys and help them through the emotional crisis that they couldnt have suspected was my invention but i couldnt hurry because i didnt want anyone associating my coming and going with events in dallas the overcaution of an overcautious mind i returned took a day off then went back to work in an effort to impose workaday normality on the inchoate grief that was everywhere since this is memoir and not autobiography allow me to skip details of the healing of the family the stunned disbelief in clandestine the sorrow of even cord meyer the lugubrious mourning of washington dc that seemed to last through winter and into spring youre familiar with the iconic images of the period no doubt the lasting one for me being the prancing of the riderless horse black jack with its single boot mounted backward in the stirrup if i suggest horribly that i felt grief for the man i had murdered its still the truth never did i feel joy except that one moment when jimmy showed up and i knew we had done it and that was a professionals pride in craft not a hunters exhortation of bloodlust after the kill i should not have been surprised moreover at the way in which kennedy a mild failure of a president who had shown a little promise and the barest possibility of intellectual growth immediately became a symbol of greatness and his time in office christened camelot and held up to the popular imagination as a bright and shining moment of moral excellence star glamour vivid beauty and so forth yet i was not sickened it happens that way and in my midthirties i was barely mature enough to get it nothing makes the heart grow fonder than a nice bloody martyrs death real or imagined dully i soldiered on i lost myself in the agency and began working the terrible hours that i later became famous for i wasnt escaping guilt or voices in my head or the sad faces of my family upon my return or anything like that i didnt feel that i owed anything or that redemption was in order it just seemed the way to go and if i wasnt already the section star i shortly became one and in time a legend its amazing what a little hard work can do god love peggy who stayed true as an arrows flight through it all the travel the intensity of the effort the distraction she was the real soldier she raised three fine boys through difficult american teenage years almost on her own though when around i did try to get to the football and lacrosse games i owe a great debt of gratitude to my forebears who had the perspicuity to invest wisely so that we were always comfortable which helps immensely when the father figure is absent nobody ever wanted for anything and i also hope and believe i taught by example that dedication to task is its own reward even at some personal cost im happy to say that each son surfed through the horrors of the sixties without a major wipeoutno drugs no binges no criminal misdemeanors no bombs planted in police stationsand each has prospered off the workethic lesson that was their real inheritance from me my deepest regret is that in my present circumstances im not able to enjoy the pleasures of grandfatherhood it would be a time yet before we realized the obvious that my attempt to game history was an utter and inglorious failure you might say the patient died but the operation wasnt a success who on earth would have guessed that the peabrained egomaniac lyndon johnson would have wanted as id predicted his domestic revolution at the same time as i had not predicted that he decided to win a major land war in asia no one could be so foolish but heegged on by the slippery weaselly opportunings of the kennedy hotshots he inherited until they deserted him as was easily foretoldproved himself equal to the task no vain murderous folly has ever been more obvious and more unstoppable many is the time i wished i knew where lon was and that jimmy was alive so the old unit could go into action on liberty valance ii it was madness and by at least it was obvious that the american future in vietnam was bleak and bloody that countless boys would die or come home in that dreadful steel chair for nothing beyond the vainglory of a stubborn old man hellbent on proving he was right the more the kennedy slime deserted him the more stubborn he became the pusillanimous robert mcnamara was the worst in my book later stating that he stayed long after he had quit believing thus sending men to their death for no other reason than his own reputation in a cause he cared nothing about when it was over and he grew tired of not being invited to the good parties on the vineyard he mea culpaed his way back into the good graces of the liberals whod abandoned old lbj years earlier it was truly scoundrel time in america and with my peculiar burdens of guilt and responsibility i found the going difficult my answer was to offer myself up to the war gods it was to taunt irony which those gods do seem to enjoy a good deal and let them kill me in the war i had committed blasphemy to stop i suppose i felt i owed it to my sons and that better i go and die than one of them though by the time the eldest was fodder for the draft nixon had ended it the one thing i thank him for as for me three tours each of a years length the first running agents and supervising operations the second overseeing psywar ops against the north from a bunker inside tan son nhut and as i have stated the third as head of the murder program operation phoenix i tried hard to get myself killed and the north vietnamese tried hard to kill me even putting a reward on my head and coming damned close enough times to turn my hair gray but even they clever little devils were never able to bring it off i am proud to say that within langley i was known as the coldest of the cold warriors and the hottest of the hot warriors though i was a murderer i made it clear to any who cared and that would probably be only myself that i was not a coward here i leave off personal narrative only to say that after vietnam i was able to return to soviet affairs my true calling and again i prospered i grew a reputation for ruthless rationalityapplying the precepts of the new criticism againand developed keen judgment a vast network of sources inside russia savvy superb reflexes and a taste for vodka in the russian style neat in a peasants glass i could drink that stuff all night until peggy finally objected at which point i quit cold and didnt take another drop until after her death when you might say i made up for lost time im still making up in september after employing hundreds and working eighteenhour days the warren commission released its report you might think id gobble it up but i didnt i read the news coverage in the times and the post and realized that no matter how diligent the eight hundred investigators had been they still hadnt a clue what happened i left it at that and continued my total immersion in agency affairs i cant say i was surprised but at the same time i was annoyed when the first of the anticommission books came out in mark lanes rush to judgment my annoyance had more to do with the temerity of lane how easy it is to sit back and carp and bitch at the efforts of people who work so hard under a mission mandate to find out the truth and allay national fears how easy to make a fortune out of nitpicking it seemed likely that the report contained errors as anything run by the government on so large a scale and compiled at such breakneck speed is bound to what was called for was a second edition with a few corrections not the initiation of a culture that would swell grotesquely and display its leftist tendencies and true agenda which was to protect the left from any involvement in spite of the fact that alek was created solely in the hothouse culture of screwball commie crackpotism and to sow general distrust of a government bent on winning its war in asia damn the cost in treasure and lives i watched from washington and even abroad as the conspiracy theories metastasized into a huge tumor on the body politic all of the conspiracies shamefully absurd and manufactured out of nothing more than occasional coincidence or goodfaith errors in the rush all of them driven by animus and the profit motive i detested them lefty scavengers picking at the bones to make political points and dough did i read them no but i read the reviews assiduously to see if anyone came close i did see the daltex building mentioned here and there usually as a shooting site in either the fourrifle theory or the sevenrifle theory i noted that the police did apprehend a fellow there though they let him go the next day still it was clear that wed pulled it off as all the theories and speculations remained comically off the mark they seemed to think it was a big conspiracy because only a huge governmental agency would have the wherewithal to make such an event happen which included secretly influencing the secret service and the white house and poor alek in a concerto of such exquisite timing and psychological acuity that it resembled a swiss watch set to music by mozart i suppose i should temper my contempt with a little understanding after all i knew things that no investigator did for example it was possible that the downrange sonic boom caused by lons shot obeying some unpredictable acoustical logic rebounded weirdly in the echo chamber that was dealey plaza and caused a pressure spike or a reverberation or even a reportlike sound which would strike many ears as coming from the grassy knoll perhaps it was that confusion that spawned the thousandodd theories as well i knew that the extreme velocity of the bullet lon fired could have easily unleashed a fragment that would travel another three hundred feet and draw blood from james tague situated at the triple overpass mr tagues facial wound has long baffled and tantalized theorists because the mannlichercarcano grievously underpowered and slowmoving wouldnt have had the oomph to reach out and touch a person so far away the detonation of lons bullet moving at close to three thousand feet per second could have easily accomplished such a trick anyhow we succeeded exactly because we werent a government operation despite my connections it was my op and the team was bound in blood and loyalty working without pay risking all for a belief system it was the kind of highly professional smallscale enterprise that is the only hope of success that needed no documentation no vetting committees no senior supervisors no cliques with their concomitant resenters and traitors no office politics no budget nothing it could be betrayed only from the inside no detective could unravel it because there wasnt one clever enough to read the signs in the dust which were too subtle we were too smart for them for at least fifty years the next few days well see anyhow back from my first tour in vietnam as a kind of hero with a few empty weeks to fill before a tour in moscow i decided it was time to read the damned report and see what they had learned by that time my own internal turmoil had settled and i felt id be able to confront the findings in a more or less rational manner my conclusions were mainly that the operation had succeeded brilliantly particularly lons solution of the ballistics issue if you recall our problem was to shoot a man with a bullet that would leave no trace of itself except in tiny metallic residue that could be traced only to a specific bullet identified by category and lot but not to any particular rifle i suppose if lons rifle were located traces of the same metal might be found within its barrel but lonthough we never discussed this im sure its sowould have destroyed the rifle so that no such discovery was possible that is exactly what lon managed the headshot bullet exploded dynamically when it hit the skull leaving no fragment large enough to be tracked to aleks rifle and therefore no fragment that could be idd as not from aleks rifle the investigators did locate two fragments in the limousine large enough to examine under the electron microscope but clearly they were not from the head shot they were both pristine without any contamination by blood or brain tissue as the fbi expert explained in detail during his testimony he also testified that although fragments are generally hard to relate to a particular rifle these two one twentyone grains the other fortyfour grains did bear marks that related them to aleks rifle the only explanation for their presence is that they were fragments from aleks first missed shot as i see it he fired wretchedly coming off a mistake that i will describe shortly and the bullet other testimony buttresses this argument hit the curb immediately behind or adjacent to the limousine since the angle of refraction is always less than the angle of reflection when the bullet tore itself to pieces against the hard stone its cloud of fragments was projected in a conelike shape that almost perfectly intercepted the vehicle a few feet away all of this in microtime some think that one fragment hit the president in the scalp stinging him maybe so maybe not but one hit the windshield from the inside cracking it and that fragment bounced downward and to the left where it was found the next day by fbi searchers another fragment also landed there but no one can identify the trajectory other than to say that the energies released by explosions are madly random we know the two frags found in the car couldnt have come from lons rifle because of the rifling marks already mentioned but also because of the geometry of the head shot it is not particularly enjoyable to focus on such a morbid topic but in the interest of truth i shall go onward the detonation took place in the upper righthand quadrant of the presidents skull above his ear suggesting among other things the lefttoright axis of lons shot given our position to the left of the snipersnest corner lhos theoretical shot would have created a necessarily righttoleft axis which would have exploded out of jfks lefthand quadrant maybe above his left eye the salient point is that given the physics of the explosion all those fragments would have spewed at high energy from the righthand upper quadrant of the skull along that axis carrying metallic debris and brain tissue to the right out of the car theres no way the widely documented head shot as witnessed eventually by the whole world would have deposited fragments radically twenty full feet to the left and downward no less to the carpet near the pedals where those two pieces were found my one criticism of the report is that its investigators quickly came to believe in the singlegunman theory lane was right about one thing it was a rush to judgment though they worked hard and honorably that precept framed their findings shaping them perhaps only at the unknowable subconscious level had they remained open to theories outside their own invented box they might have seen indications subtle but persistent in aleks behavior that suggested strongly there were other players on the field therefore i shall walk you through aleks last hour or so of freedom there were developments that baffled the commissions investigators and continue to baffle the amateur assassinationologists so let me lay out for the sake of history exactly what i think happened between pm when alek fired the first bullet and pm when he was nabbed in the texas theatre i doubt he was nervous he was too exuberant too happy too coursing with energy i can see him crouched and hiding behind the fortress of boxes hed arranged on the sixth floor of the book depository his eyes beady his face tight with the characteristic smugness that so exiled him from his fellow man presidential assassin or no thinking not what if i miss but hurry up hurry up he must have been hungry for his destiny for his entry into history he wasnt giving escape or survival a thought but concentrating entirely on getting the job done to the best of his meager abilities consider his mind at the moment he was about to strike a blow not merely at the united states which he claimed to loathe but at all those whod seen him as he wasa fringe man clearly unable to hold a job much less have a career a life of normalcy and contributionand insisted on reporting the bad news you are nobody you are not equipped to compete your destiny is nothingness so this was his moment to all of them he was saying i exist in thunder but do not abjure the political for the psychological he was a true believer so true that he could and would kill for his principles that puts him at the very end of the spectrum of political behavior though it does not push him off it in some fashion that he probably could not articulate he thought he was birthing a new socialist world and his idealism loaned him the selfesteem nothing else had provided for him then there was greed the treasure at the end of the rainbow that was the idealized image of himself as hero of havana in the cadillac convertible with dr castro on the malacon waving to the throng that was a risk worth dying for he must have been all taken into account one of the worlds happiest men in the split second before he pulled the trigger as we were he was alerted to the approach of the killing moment not by his watch but by the roar of the crowd as its crescendo followed the motorcade down main like a human wave he saw it emerge the long boatlike vehicle with its bounty of politicians and wives as it turned for its oneblock run down houston im guessing it was here that the rifle flew to his shoulder and he edged closer to the window not caring if he was seen several witnesses noted him all but hanging out of the frame the car reached its degree turn at elm rotating slowly to the left question why didnt he fire then car hardly moving kennedy as close as he would be probably under seventyfive feet headon pivoting slightly as the automobile pivoted plus instructions from his russian control that this was the moment why would he go against his own instincts as well as orders from a superior whom he feared and loved again speculation the safety he pulls ugh nothing happens so he breaks his line of vision through the scope unshoulders the rifle finds the safetya poorly placed button half under the protruding rear of the firing pin assemblyand struggles to get it off perhaps his heavy sweating occluded the scope and he saw nothing and had to quickly clean it with his shirt collar whatever it was already going wrong for him one tenth of a second in desperately he frees the mechanism throws it to his shoulder and fires the first shot in haste true to form a clean clear almost comical miss i hold with many that the bullet sailing along at that leisurely twothousandfeetpersecond velocity broke apart on the curb depositing only its wan spray of fragments into the limo he rushed his trigger squeeze was a mess the target was lost in the single tree that stood between him and his quarry and the first shot the closest shot was a complete failure the man is haunted by folly now hes in a panic having missed pitifully given up his position fair game for countersnipers there werent any that day though there would be evermore and he hasnt even hit the car he labors through the cocking motion the rifle jerked from his shoulder by the raggedness of the manipulation and he comes back on target his finger lunges against the coarse grind of the pull and my guess is that the crosshairs werent anywhere near the target when he fired for the simple reason that he hit it or did he yes according to the commission he did with the famed magic bullet that drilled through the presidents upper back and exited his throat its angle adjusted slightly by the muscle tissue through which it had traveled which also cost it enormous velocity then spinning sideways it hit governor connally in the back its impression recorded indelibly in scar tissue sliced through his body exited much damaged despite claims to the contrary and drilled his wrist and his thigh then it tumbled spent hot mangled to rest in the folds of his jacket to be discovered by a technician that afternoon at the hospital on the governors gurney after the governor was removed oh what a bad boy that bullet was the mischief it unleashed what grist for the mills of the ignorant the malicious the embittered lefty proletariatintellectuals yet i knew then and i know now that the bullet did what arlen specter said it did it is beyond dispute what isnt much thought about is the next issue alek thought he missed i have seen a fair number of men shot its not usually like the movies which instruct us to the theory of the instant spastic reaction the firing of all nerves simultaneously and the twitchylegged death tumble to earth it can happen that way it happens other ways too often men dont even know theyve been hit they think its a punch or theyve bumped into a door or they notice nothing at all and not until they look and see blood welling and sometimes it doesnt even well do they comprehend after putting two and two together that theyve been shot it cannot be predicted each wound is different based on a thousand or so factors from velocity bullet shape angle of strike muscles andor bones encountered vitality of target blood pressure speed of target targets relationship to solidity on earth standing sitting moving whatever weather barometric pressure and on and on and on there is no knowing so anybody who tells you what should have happenedand infers from the fact that it didnt happen something is amissis a baldfaced liar let us not concentrate on what was happening let us concentrate on what alek thought was happening what he saw through the fuzzy optics of his hollywoodthe brand not the townjapanese scope was nothing look at zapruders film we dont see the hit because the president is behind the sign but when he emerges the only thing thats happened is that hes begun to lean forward a bit and his hands have come up which are probably not visible to alek if hes looking at all and hes probably not because hes lost in the drama of cocking the rifle for the second time when alek returns to the scope kennedys head and posture may be incrementally degraded but thats too subtle for alek to note in his mind utter panic complete selfloathing physiology fingers bloated with blood oxygen debt woozy vision yips coursing through his arms and trunk sweat sliding down his face and flanks presentiment of doom target small getting smaller as the vehicle pulls away though it doesnt speed up slight lefttoright movement produced by the angle of the street relative to the position of the shooter our boy is not in a good spot to make the next shot he tries to steer the scope crosshairs ontowhere having missed twicefrom his point of viewhe has no idea where to hold for a killing shot he has no idea of the index between point of aim and point of impact hes in a shooters nomansland even as hes taken the slack out of the trigger and sustains it right at the tipping point between shot and no shot suddenly the presidents head explodes alek is so startled that his own trigger jerks and he fires his third bullet but his jump at the sight of the destruction of the skull is so intense that his third bullet goes sailing off to the general southwest presumably landing in some distant oz beyond the triple overpass never to be noted or found it was an awesome break for us it meant that witnesses saw him fire his third shot it squared all accounting of bullets shells and wounds it forever connected alek to the event lacking any tangible empirical evidence of our existence and it cemented all investigative effort to the book depository and to alek cops are predictable they want to put things in a box and the sooner and tighter it fits the happier they are and the more outsiders tug and pull and poke at the contents of the box the more stubborn and angry they become its all personal to them back to alek for whom the world has just changed mightily given to paranoia anyway he sees in that second that a conspiracy against him does exist that he is a patsy he is a chump a fool hes been set up to take the fall and that reality becomes instantly clear let us also postulate that his narcissism is secretly pleased he is important enough to destroy he realizes that all he believed in was false that there was no russian agent he is not working for kgb theres no escape car awaiting him he will not be hustled away and secreted to havana and the loving ministrations of dr castro instead hes the sucker at the center of every james m cain novel every film noir lost in a nightmare city as forces so vast he cannot imagine them grind into position to crush him it occurs to him that his life might be in danger he knows the sixth floor is empty only because it always has been empty but that wisdom is no longer operative it is from a different world it occurs to him that his death is absolutely necessary for the new narrative it may be that a detective a security guard an armed citizen in the know might already be there hiding behind his own clump of boxes ready to step out and issue the coup de grace and become both the hero of america and the secret lynchpin of the plot against alek he does what any man in such circumstances would do he cocks the rifle throwing another shell into the chamber finger to trigger slack removed weapon at the ready and like a patrolling infantryman in an ambush area he hastens the ninetyfive feet diagonally across the empty space to the one stairway down ready to respond to any emerging attackers nobodys there and no bullet comes crashing through the windows to snipe him as he sought to snipe the president he pauses at the head of the stairs hating to relinquish his weapon but he knows that he cant emerge into society at the site of a presidential assassination with a rifle in his hands so he stuffs the rifle between two book crates at the top of the stairs where it will be found an hour later by a detective that is why it wasnt found abandoned in the snipers nest that is why it was loaded and cocked he heads downstairs and his adventures in the building back in society have been well chronicled he slides into a chair in the lunchroom is accosted by a policeman and identified by a coworker and once the policeman heads upstairs alek zips out the front door now what he knows therell be no pickup awaiting him at the corner of houston and pacific and there may be ambushers instead of heading north up houston where we were nominally waiting to pick him up he turns east and heads up elm past the daltex building that is where i see him as i am pulling lon out of the lobby while we beat our own hasty retreat from the seventh floor alek continues to surge up elm for another four blocks let us assume it is in this period that he more or less returns to his rational mind he knows its a matter of time before they locate the snipers nest and the rifle take a canvass of employees at tbd and note that hes the only one missing though hes been noted earlier as present so theyll know he left right after the shooting possibly thats not paramount in his mind he thinks hes being hunted by his own coconspirators and he remembers my warning him against bringing the handgun because i was gaming him into being the easy prey that would be the exclamation point on our operation i dont believe he thinks he can get away as in escape to a new life impossible he wasnt stupid just incompetent but at that point in his life i think the one possibility of victory he saw the one glimmer of hope was to defend himself against his murderers not the police or fbi if he could shoot one of them and bring the bag to the cops it would be proof of sorts that hed been manipulated though he hadnt worked out the allegiance issues and didnt know who had used him again as for any man on the run his first impulse would have been to get a gun which explains why after walking away from the site of the assassination he climbed aboard a bus headed down elm street back to the site of the assassination no one has bothered to work out the destination of that bus it was to the oak cliff section of dallas he wasnt fleeing crazily as so many have stated he was going to get the gun soon enough the bus is moored in traffic a block east of the assassination site time is ticking by he knows that the police effort is grinding along possibilities are being examined questions asked and answered the winnowing process begun and that it will cast him up quickly he vaults from the bus at the corner of elm and lamar and heads south down lamar for two blocks and goes to the bus station does it occur to him to buy a ticket on the next bus out of town to put distance between self and pursuers he has seventeen dollars with him which can get him as far as san antonio or lubbock or midland or austin but his brain is not working that way he is thinking get the gun he hails what will be known as the only cab he took in his life hes in the cab at in oak cliff a block or two past his house so that the cabbie wont associate his passenger with the soontobeannounced address of the suspect he dashes into his house goes straight to wherever hes hidden it snatches up his revolver stuffs it into his waistband throws on a jacketto cover it which shows hes thinking tacticallyand is gone in seconds consider how dangerous a move hes come up with he knows theyll know who he is and where he lives he risks capture in a daring attempt to get back to the roominghouse because thats where he left his s ampw snubnose the gun is more important to him than his life and he takes an awesome chance to get it because he knows that without the gun he has no chance against his pursuers who arent the cops but the members of the conspiracy whove betrayed him he does this rather than say take the cab to a suburban bus station or train station and try to catch a ride or hop a freight out of town before the authorities can throw out their manhunters net time isnt of the essence the gun is of the essence alek heads back down beckley in the direction hes come diverts at crawford to take a diagonal going nowhere turns down tenth again seemingly arbitrarily reaches the intersection of patton and tenth and notices in horror that a black dallas police car has just pulled over the officer beckons him now comes the tragedy of officer tippit had i known that the monster i created was capable of such violence i would have put a into him and walked away that said i must also say that i should have put a into my own head as punishment for the mayhem that was about to transpire which was entirely my own invention what is the point of claiming responsibility if you dont act on it there is no point i tried to use my sin as a motive for redemption and over the years gave my life in toto to agency and country knowing that i hadnt the guts to punish myself as i should be punished perhaps my punishment lies ahead poor tippit by accounts no genius but a decent exgi who loved his job and did it well content to be a patrolman forever he was on the cusp of the biggest bust of the century when it all went bad on him moved from a farther patrol area into oak cliff as a precautionary measure and to stand by for orders he had been alerted three times on his radio of the age weight height and hair color of the suspect he spies such a man walking down tenth street in oak cliff who knows what other tells alek the idiot was broadcasting walking too fast with his face screwed up in anguish almost running radiating the donttreadonme animosity that was his stock in trade refusing eye contact while looking cautiously over his shoulder now and then it could have been any or all of them no identification of alek by name has yet been given over the radio and none has linked him to oak cliff and the beckley avenue area its just that his appearance is so right thats why tippit tails him for a block or two and then pulls over yeats its old and its sad and its sad and its feary yes it was especially feary that is fearful horrifying tragic had i but known but i didnt guilty guilty guilty alek sees the black vehicle slow up and pull over he realizes hes been nabbed he ambles off the sidewalk to the vehicle where the officer window rolled down awaits him what could they have said its pointless to imagine and it was probably a banality a cliche nothing memorable witnessesthere were several some closereport no hostility no harsh words no threats it wasnt an altercation it was an exchange and alek may have gotten away with it for a second for then he broke contact with the seated officer and turned to go on his way tippit isnt done with him but at the same time hasnt made up his mind to make the pinch he climbs from his squad car gun definitely not in hand and possibly calls to alek alek turns walks around the car to place himself in range draws and fires three times pointblank all three hits from close range are solid mortal blows careening through center mass upper body bloodbearing organs and as soon as he is hit tippit is down bleeding out if not already dead why after all alek is not without his verbal faculties hes a debater an arguer from way back a guy whos always got an answer thats how he defines himself part guerrilla warrior part dialectical soldier why doesnt he at least try to con his way out the performance isnt beyond him and his intellectual vanity that hes smarter than some cop would surely be in play from aleks point of view the fact that the cop is already thereits only fortyfive minutes after the shooting and chaos and confusion reignis proof that the man is part of the conspiracy whoever set alek up either informed the authorities of his address or hired a professional killer dressed as a cop to ambush him when he returned home perhaps dallas is full of professional killers in search of alek already equipped with his name address description and likely whereabouts that would be an easy intellectual leap for a man with aleks tendencies toward paranoia and conspiracy so alek thinks the cop is a hit man his rage his paranoia his violent nature his fear his selfhatred and his other hatred were in full bloom in that single instant and that and that alone can explain his next move which utterly violates any principle of selfpreservation if alek has just shot a cop to escape his next move has to be to turn and flee race down alleyways cut across yards throw off any followers catch a bus get out of the area fast instead he walks over to the downed tippit and shoots him in the temple from the autopsy the bullet is found to enter the right temporal lobe coursed through the brain transecting the brain stem severing the cerebral peduncles surrounded by extensive hemorrhage and found to exit from the brain substance in the calcarine gyrus to the left of the midline of course he wasnt shooting officer tippit he was shooting me his vengeance expressed alek mutters poor damn cop as he empties the shells from his cylinder and quickly reloads then turns and heads up patton down jefferson cuts through a yard and dumps his jacket then cuts back to jefferson which in a half mile or so will take him to the texas theatre his absurd incompetence comes to the fore again so lame is his attempt at escape and so ignorant is he of whats going on around him he is followed by a number of citizens one of them has called the murder in to headquarters on tippits radio two men snatch up tippits revolver and begin to hunt alek on their own in a brief while a matter of several blocks down jefferson trailing trackers alek comes to a small commercial district hes consumed with evading his killers even though he hasnt bothered to look behind him and his main thought is to get off the street to the logic of his twisted brain he seeks refuge by dodging into the texas theatre on that street i suppose he thinks his killers will eventually be driven off the streets by the excess of dallas policemen who will flood the zone in hours if not minutes perhaps he imagines a surrender the revelation that the cop was a mafia hit man and some sort of redemption as he proves he never killed the president and he was manipulated by shadowy others of indeterminate origin he might see himself as a hero the subject of an admiring movie in those ten minutes in the movie theaters private darkness he must have comforted himself by selfdelusion facing the reality for a man whose resources were so fragile would have been too much and then the lights came on his vacation had lasted ten minutes and cops were closing in from both sides i first heard the name sometime in or i was in moscow working undercover in one of several welldocumented soviet identities i was in and out of moscow in those years under a variety of guises and i have to say they were great years maybe the best of my life we knew we were getting somewhere and doing some good and the economics and the demographics were breaking in our direction so we were filled with hope and optimism moreover vietnam was managing to wind down without killing me or any of my sons for which i was eternally grateful we were under pressure from langleyor from the defense department by way of langleyto come up with a gun it was a new sovietissue semiauto sniper rifle that bore the seemingly but not actually melodramatic name of dragunov it sounded like the sovmil had gotten all hollywoody and called the thing the dragon no such luck soviet military nomenclature has always featured the name of the designer which is why sergeant kalashnikov became worldfamous as did in an earlier age comrade tokarev whose stubby little pistol snuffed out so many lives in the cellars of lubyanka during the great purges of the thirties in any event although it seemed absurd in a world where giant rockets carrying nukes could obliterate millions in minutes everyone in american military culture was in a frenzy over this dragunov and it went without saying that he who obtained either plans or working copies of the thing would be awarded a gigantic feather to be stuffed into his cap i meant to get myself that feather petty ambition i am diminished by the memory but bob lee swagger beat me to it can you imagine a name like that what a moniker to conjure with he was every ole miss quarterback every nascar driver every tinytown police chief or state trooper rolled into one he was actually a gunnery sergeant in the united states marine corps with an intelligence background as hed worked with another agency jamboree called the studies and observation group on an earlier tour that was particularly dangerous duty it consisted of leading indigenous troops up near the laotian border to run interdiction missions against the north viet supply line lots and lots of combat lots of shooting the talent pool consisted of aggressive senior ncos from either army special forces or marine infantry outfits and they had themselves a dandy war amid the mountains and swamps of the laotian border it was his third tour as a sniper in which he snatched up comrade dragunov at a forlorn fire base somewhere in the jungle he and his spotter worked a ruse with an agency team and the marines in full coop mode that resulted in our acquisition of the first dragunov in western hands that rifle today is at the agency museum on the first floor of the main building in langley before it was put on display i had a good handson experience with it at the langley technical directorates shop the very same one his twenty years after vietnam were the most banal of hells it seems sad that a man of such gifts should suffer so basely but what are you going to do men of such dark fury and skill frequently turn it on themselves as pilgrim swagger did and the record is beyond melancholy and well into squalor alcoholism business failure brushes with the law car wrecks a failed marriage a whole litany of messages to god requesting annihilation since reality was too painful god must have been busy that day or perhaps he was saving swagger to punish a real sinner such as moi somehow the sniper retreated to the woods acquired a trailer and rebuilt himself despite his many feats of arms this was probably his greatest bravest accomplishment he became a reader curious as to what had caused vietnam and beyond that what had caused so much pain from his traumatic wound and from the losses he suffered his first vietnamese wife and then his spotter swagger i tried to save you from all that i knew as early as that it would come to no good end and your story would be written in blood and pain a million times kill me if you can goddamn you swagger but i committed the crime of the century to save you you should love me as you press the trigger if thats what is in store alone in arkansas except for a dog and a brace of rifles he gave himself over to the history of the vietnam war and then the history of war itself which after all is paradoxically the history of civilization he educated himself in the ways of a world he served but never knew his mind refined itself shed itself of childish notions like pride and bravado and domination and became wise he stopped talking he started listening he shot and shot and shot and turned his gradea talent into something almost beyond knowing he retrained himself for a mission and at last one came along i should know it was my mission in i was sixtythree years old i was a hoary old eminence grise beloved by the younger men known for steady advice unquenchable rationalityi had never abandoned the new criticismand superb technical skills especially at planning and funding black ops i was mr black in agency lore i was in high demand though i spent much of my time on russiait was i who put together the money train that enabled yeltsin to take over after gorbachev and i dont think he or anybody else ever knew i was an american much less an american agenti oversaw or advised on projects in other spheres as well that was how el salvador came into my life godawful place never want to go back it reminded me of vietnam though the food was all mealy and saucy nowhere near the level of the mexican that alek had introduced me to this need not be a long tale and i will spare you details and dramatization i begin with a personal note although my memoir is by design professional not personal but the personal intrudes on the professional in peggy died of breast cancer after a sixweek ordeal it was a terrible thing to see a woman so vital so intelligent so beautiful so loyal so terrific the best of all her peers and the source of whatever strength i had as well as an extraordinary mother to the boys eaten alive by the crab the boys and i were at her side when she passed and she lived long enough to see them through college and through their own wellestablished careers and families it was a devastation for me one that hurt and hurt and hurt i am not making excuses i am merely explaining why i was not at my best in what followed i made bad judgments mistakes my concentration slipped it was far from my proudest hour i was lucky to escape alive even if i didnt lets speed this up time may not be on our side thanks to mr swagger it became necessary to eliminate a man and it occurred to me to replicate operation liberty valance same method a patsy sniper a real sniper a ballistic deceit the patsy caught during the op and eliminated the home team getting away clean the details are forever sealed in langleys files but again i cast lon as the real shooter it turned out he was hungry for the adventure having become bored stiff by his selfdecreed retirement i cast swagger as oswald bad career move as they say swagger unlike poor stupid alek escaped and it became a race and a chase we had to get to swagger before the fbi did this was shreck my main operatives task and swagger outsmarted outfought and outshot him at every turn my first mistake not realizing he would have made a better shooter than patsy neither shreck nor i saw until too late that the plot we had engineered for him generated not his death but his rebirth he reentered the world he had abandoned stronger smarter more guileful more cunning and braver all along we werent hunting him he was hunting us a final ambush was painstakingly set i urged lon to be the shooter and i do think he enjoyed the whole thing it was better than rotting away in a wheelchair in a secluded estate in the north carolina countryside for his heroism his effort his high morale he was awarded a bullet in the head i should regret this more than i do but after all given his tragedy lon enjoyed an interesting life because of my importuning better he passed that way than via decay shreck for his part was unhappy to discover that a shotgun slug could penetrate a bulletproof vest he wasnt as unhappy as his number two a stumpy little exnco of extremely violent tendencies named jack payne who made the same discovery but not until swagger had blown off his arm with the same shotgun swagger the best man i ever heard of in a gunfight bar none even then he had surprises he was captured and our deeper trap seemed to still be in place by which he would swing for murder oops i say hed outthought even the great hugh meachum hed subtly disabled his rifle before the whole thing happened so it was impossible for it to have fired the fatal shot as far as i know theyre still looking for the person who did but it was at this point that hugh meachum decided to die again i pull the screen of discretion between the reader and the details let me say that it should be beyond the ken of no professional intelligence operativeand i was one of the worlds bestto arrange a convincing fiction for his own death i was after all a superb planner a manipulator of documents and secret funding and had long since made the necessary preparations for such a contingency it helped that i lived alone and there was no spousal difficulty to contend with it helped also that i was still under discipline and i knew that once i made the break i made it permanently there could be no going back no farewells not a minute crack in the facade i put the operation into action on a wednesday and by friday i was gone i left without saying goodbye to the boys and their children that hurt that still hurts but i knew them to be secure both financially and emotionally and that the lessons of labor and loyalty as well as the dividends that colt winchester now fn smith amp wesson and so forth and so on provided would continue to comfort them against the rude buffeting of circumstance i enacted a certain computer code meant to eat all my files in the agency database i suppose that was overkill but one can never be certain it was doubtful that anyone would go trolling that deep in the distant past particularly in a world that was changing as rapidly as this one but safer is always to be preferred over sorrier and thus hugh meachum shuffled off this mortal coil as for the real me he went where he went and became what he became i prospered i had been quietly looting money from the agency for some yearsif an old spy doesnt look out for himself who will and the ample fund in a swiss bank account made my new life one of comfort i had some contacts i knew some things i had some documents in time i improved my station for my mind was still sharp in time i did more than improve i became wealthy even filthy wealthy i lived in splendor in my new life i developed a taste for flavors of decadence i reacquainted myself with the nuances of delight that alcohol provided i discovered the pleasures of sex with younger women especially when amplified beyond the power of the man himself by drugs in all their variations i found i excelled in business manipulations that produced munificence for me and all who sailed with me i had fought so hard for capitalism it seemed appropriate to enjoy its fruits i became an entrepreneur a builder an investor i devised layers and further layers of supernumeraries between myself and reality it has come to this i live in a mansion hidden behind a thirtyfoot steel wall off of ulysse nardin drive in an area patrolled by a special battalion i sit out on my veranda in the warm weather and all i see is mine to the river a mile away i am totally secure i have mistresses and masseuses and chefs and sommeliers the world has been kind to me which i take as proper recompense for the efforts i put into my crusade to secure freedom and peace for the largest number of people and which despite some setbacks i believe i accomplished what could possibly go wrong the answer came one night deep in sleep when i was feeling most safe i dont know why it chose that moment to announce itself but it did and while i cant say it changed my life at least not yet i will say it gave me a lesson in paranoia from which ive never recovered and that is why my security arrangements are the most impenetrable in the world the coat the goddamned coat i hadnt thought of those days in the ten years id been building my new life it was so far behind and all the players were dead but i awakened in the middle of the night in a cold sweat remembering jimmy costello had hidden in the elevator machinery house on the roof of the daltex building for a long sixteen hours and during that time the bore solvent from lons winchester collected and migrated and ultimately seeped into the garment soaking its breast from the inside forever cursing it with the smell of the murder weapon even before that it had been placed on the stack of swatch books we used to elevate lon to the proper height leaving a tire tread on the back jimmy had wisely decided not to get it out of the building in case he was stopped by a policeman whod recognize the penetrative odor hed left it there folded as i recall inside a pile of carpet remnants on a dark and deserted shelf in that littlevisited area it seemed unimportant at the time and jimmy had said hed come back at some point reenter the building and destroy it but he had been killed prematurely and in my grief over his passing my mourning for lons exit from my life the press of my career and whatever residue of subconscious guilt and regret remained from liberty valance i had forgotten until that moment the next morning i dealt with the problem my first thought was that i buy the damned building and tear it down and throw in a parking lot it was well within my means but i realized such a radical decision might attract more attention than necessary the building having been declared officially interesting by too many who thought they knew something about architecture and that a prudent first move was to determine the situation on the ground through the various levels of administrative anonymity i had arranged i ordered a discreet texas private investigator to penetrate the building and examine the room in question in a week or so the answer came back the elevators had been completely modernized in and that machinery room demolished and a new one constructed on its spot all well and good but also all sick and bad i had no idea of the coats disposition before the demolition perhaps some workers simply dumped the pile of carpeting remnants down a chute and theyd gone into a dumpster and thence to the landfill or the envirochummy reclamation plant yes that was probably it but what if what if someone had discovered it and remarked upon the oddity of such a coat with such a bounty of evidence being found in a building overlooking dealey plaza and moreover dating from sometime in a past easily as ancient suppose this nugget of info by some whimsical path had drifted laterally and entered assassination lore given the hunger of the conspiracy theorists for new theories new provocations new possibilities new evidence such a tidbit could easily inspire a new area of research a new book a new focus maybe with this new framing theorya gunman in daltexa brilliant investigator could rearrange the old evidence find some new evidence engage in brilliant speculation and see into the heart of the thing could i be located highly unlikely after all i had disconnected myself from that possibility by conveniently dying in but suppose someone got as far as hugh meachum that would be far enough my legacy would be destroyed my memory in the minds of children and grandchildren family members from mine peggys and lons family even jimmys that presented a possibility i could not live with happily i arrangedthrough supernumeraries layers of buffeting clever financial manipulation so that the source of the funding could never be tracked back to my addressfor a man to relocate to dallas and join the assassination community his announced career was to solve the kennedy assassination mystery so he had to be studious highly intelligent laborintensive he also needed delicate social skills for i wanted his penetration to be aggressive enough that he could acquire a network of informants all of whom had no idea they were informing to keep him apprised of the latest in the theory and practice of the ongoing investigations to fit in with the culture down there he needed one more salient attribute he had to be insane despite his evident intelligence and charm he would be seen as harmless his theory would harm no one because it was so manifestly absurd he had to put together a scenario that sounded rational until it reached a point and then twisted off crazily into the ether of the impossible and he had to sell it with earnestness and passion not estranging his allies i feel we did well in recruiting and am satisfied even gratified by his employment and performance and creativity his name is richard monk and he is a former major in army intelligence who retired honorably after his twenty with no sign of disgrace his assignment if anyone on the net or anyone in dallas shows an undue interest in the daltex theory of assassination that subject is to be engaged at a deep level his theories his evidence his capabilities all assessed for further monitoring ultimately after reports are filed and analyzed and passed along the information will arrive to me and i will make a judgment as to disposition subtle methods will be explored as a means of dissuading the subject but if it comes to that place i will authorize and have set up a structure to execute a kill order i do not kill for money i do not kill for anger i do not kill for pleasure i kill to preserve my legacy and the legacy of the institutions and people i served that is enough people have killed for a lot less for pennies or more worthless for pride the first victim was an amiable writer whose specialty was guns and the men who use them i assume it was his analysis of the firearms issues that brought him to dallas as he explained to richard monk he had come up with a theory that was suspiciously like the actual one lon created all those years ago and he had picked the daltex building as his shooting site those two developments alone doomed him nothing personal some months later real trouble started chapter the records of the great abercrombie amp fitch seventhfloor gun room were a mess a disgrace a disaster evidently when the new owners acquired the corporation after its bankruptcy they knew the future lay in jeans for kids not westley richards nitro expresses for nobel prizewinning writers this trove was part of the property they acquired along with the longterm lease on the warehouse facility in suburban jersey that lease had ten years to run so no idea toward disposition was necessary until that time the vast room of ruin and confusion afforded one pleasure to swagger and that was escape from the enigma that was synesthesia which he had learned was a freakish afflictionability gift curse in the brain by which cues mix and produce something called responses in differing modalities most commonly it meant that a letter or a number for some odd reason appeared not as it was objectively but in a peculiar color so to niles gardner the number was red the number was blue the number was green if he saw a headline in a newspaper most pro careers last years study finds he would see the numeral in the color his mind told him was there not the smudgy black of newsrag ink swagger had made one further connection but not to hugh it went down in the chain of linkages not up and anyway what the fuck did this have to do with anything no idea not even a whisper it seemed another dead end and the discomfort of it like an undigested clot of food in his stomach created great anxiety so the files in their chaos represented relief from that anguish they were real occupied space could be manipulated and were on a medium with which he was familiar that is paper he happily confronted them many other researchers had already pillaged the room notably hemingway and roosevelt biographers that perhaps was why bob found no documents for the great writer or president all filched sitting in files in princeton or the university of illinois or someplace there were few pickings for other great men though bob did find an invoice for the colt detective special that charles lindbergh carried through every day of the bruno hauptmann trial but that was a random rare find as marty had promised the files had more or less imploded collapsing into themselves like one of those buildings brought down with a minimum of strategically planted explosives so that it seems to disappear into a hole full of rubble the bound books of firearms sales required by the atf since were casually distributed through the mess some of the shipping invoices were filed in boxes some of which were labeled by years some of which werent other clumps of invoices lay here and there on the damp cement floor of the corrugated tin structure that from the outside was just another cottageindustry headquarters and manufacturing joint in a seemingly endless complex out by i no one was onsite swagger had to pick the keys up at the real estate management company in downtown rutherford after instructions and permission from corporate headquarters in oklahoma city under martys good auspices through the intervention of tom browner whoever he was swagger had been smart enough to bring a can of kroil to lube locks that had grown stiff and unaccustomed to the penetration of keys now he crouched on sore knees trolling in the disaster under bad light in the acrid odor of metal that corrugated tin gives off it unfolded before him a cavalcade of american highend sporting rifle and shotgun life biggame guns elegant british shotguns for upland birds the occasional accidental invoice for a rare expensive sort of fishing tackle fishing tackle had dominated the firms eighth floor a floor above the guns and on the roof there was an artificial casting pond for the troutfishing swells to try out their technique that it was a vanished world meant little to swagger by this time though at the early going he felt a twinge of something when he came across a shipping order for three boxes of kynoch nitro express to an r ruark of honey badger farm rr kingston sc mostly it was longforgotten members of the bourgeois moneyed set ordering ammunition mundane guns for domestic hunting and the like despite the gun rooms fancy clientele and worldwide famethat was marketingits bread and butter lay in servicing the nonfamous dentists lawyers doctors autodealership owners and cotterpin and plastic glass manufacturers of the unphotographed unsentimentalized american smalltown elite many from the south and the west there was no other way to proceed than this straightahead plunge through stuff chronology compartmentalization geography brandname all the retail categories by which a large mass of documents could be organized were pretty much shot so many had gone through grabbed their treasure and left without repacking the boxes much less resetting them on the shelves that methodology seemed useless hed spent three hours going through the boxes tipped sideways on the floor to no effect hed examined clumps aisle by aisle trying to find such elemental regulators as year manufacturer destination no effect it was a maze of random paperwork abandoned most of it facedown goddammit on the cold concrete floor hed moved on to the boxes on the shelves so far to no effect just to make it more unendurable the fluorescent light in this sector of the warehouse flickered on and off making visibility more difficult why hadnt he brought a flashlight or better yet to free up both hands one of those lights you wore on your head so he could see clearly what was before him it bothered him immensely that outside four really good fbi operators lounged going on coffee and doughnut energy as his bodyguard team in the crowded parking lot putting out the message to all observers do not fuck around here didnt these highly trained guys have better things to do than guard him and suck down caffeine and calories shouldnt they be busting cribs in lower manhattan freeing sex slaves in chinatown brothels or serving highrisk warrants on button men on the lower east side nah they just lounged in their cherokee joking and smoking and talking sports finally he was finished six hours and two bruised knees and an oncoming cold later nothing not a goddamn thing it was like synesthesia all over again under better circumstances he could have brought a team they could have indexed and sorted as they went along and when they were finished they would have bucked up the mess considerably and restored some sense of coherency to the chaos not this time which had represented a onceoverlightly approach in hopes that something would turn up on the surface it hadnt time to let the feds get back to busting chops and him to his life on the assassination beat it wasnt the last unit of shelving but nearly so three boxes lay on their sides placed kneehigh on the secondtolast unit theyd been ripped open some material removed some stuffed back in some left on the floor he bent and brought his eyes up close to examine the labels on the boxes whoa mama what have we here one read managers correspondence june august harris he moved the box to the best light pulled the lid off and found himself looking at approximately three hundred carbons stuffed in indiscriminately clearly having been looted for hemingwayania and restored haphazardly they were roughly chronological though when a clump had been pulled out it had been stuffed back in at the easiest point which was toward the end of the carton it was so tight each piece had to be pulled out delicately one at a time he glanced at his watch too much time already wasted do it he ordered himself he found it at july lon scott scotts run rr clintonsburg va dear lon hope this finds you in good health the last time i saw you you still looked like you could crack the harvard line for a first down just about any time you wanted hope youre as chipper now anyhow youll be getting three packages from us in the upcoming weeks or if not from us at least under our power of suggestion youve probably heard that new haven is introducing a new model in a new caliber in the fall the rifle is called the westerner and its in the new belted winchester magnum the cartridge was developed with a lot of conversation from retailrare for new haven i know and has terrific potential its designed as a flatshooting plains cartridge perfect antelope or mulie medicine meant for those long tries over the flat prairies or across the valley it delivers about pounds of muzzle energy at yards off an estimated drop of only inches yard zero muzzle velocity in the factory load will be about feet per second we heard from too many hunters who failed to connect at over yards because they underestimated the drop in their ors and hit nothing but dirt feet in front of the target dirt as you know makes a pretty poor trophy put a nice unertl or bausch amp lomb tube up top and youve got a super hunting machine to us at least it looks like a real winner and believe me the industry needs a winner it fills a definite niche youll get one of the first westerners off the production line ive asked them to select a nice piece of wood hard to believe anything coming from big w with figure in the wood but miracles do happen play with it as long as you want if you want to return it no problem if you want to keep it ill get you a wholesale invoice and you can send a check at your leisure thats the first surprise the second two are also as per our suggestion with new havens heavy hand behind the tiller so to speak roy huntington will be sending you a set of his new winchester magnum dies and bruce hodgdon will be sending you a fivepound canister of their h which looks like it should get even more range velocity and muzzle energy and less falloff when fully developed naturally what were looking for somewhere down the road is a column in your guns amp ammo reloading column on finding the full potential in the new offering i think if you play with loads and the sierra or nosler partition grain bullet youll be impressed with what can be done by the way lon this is a definite exclusive were not sending similar kits to warren or jack its yours and yours alone because we know that lon scott has the market clout to launch a major success where the others dont you cant get jack to shut up about his pet anyway sorry to send you off to the railway station for so many pickups but i think youll find it was worth the effort best charlie charles harris manager gun department abercrombie amp fitch madison avenue new york ny cwh mlb maybe we ought to switch to starbucks said nick this stuff is beginning to taste like swamp water i think i saw a snake in mine said bob putting down his cup of seattles best around them hummed suburban dallas mall life all of it at hyperspeed and lubricated by smiles unction and beauty in the paneled english department milieu of the joint with its fancy frappo cappo and whateverelsecino machines its pastry cabinets groaning with frilly sugared bombs mainly it was moms in here with the odd lonely salesguy on break the servers all looked about twelve okay said nick lets get to it first off i got a good team into richards while he was having his fridaynight steak they did the house top to bottom came up with nothing these guys can find anything plus ive had a wire team on richard not every second of every day but enough to get a fair picture van parked down the way different camouflage again goddammit nothing no microwave transmissions to satellites nothing a little suspicious if you ask me hes too clean absence of evidence is not evidence bob said hmm where have i heard that before okay thats from my end now tell me about yours bob didnt mention synesthesia sir francis galton or colored numbers he didnt have enough i found a letter in new jersey it establishes that yeah lon was sent a win mag in first year of production so the gun in the case could be his no serial numbers unfortunately but it checks out as far as it can you think its legit thats my feeling said bob i spent another hour there obviously im not a scientific document expert but the paper was the same weight and shade as the others in the file even accounting for aging typewriter was the same font perfect to the slight darkness in the center of the small e the format was in accordance with other letters from charlie harris including those to jack oconnor at outdoor life and warren page at field amp stream the diction felt right for about the shipping reference is right he said trips to the railway station thats because guns and powder couldnt be shipped by common carrier in those days meaning they couldnt be delivered you had to go to the railway express office at the train station and sign for the packages and charlie harris was the manager of the gun room i found references to him all through the literature of the time he sold hemingway a batch of guns nick considered i dont like it all that may be true but its within the reach of professional highend forgers maybe but because thats so it doesnt mean this is forged too bad you didnt bring it with you i wanted to preserve the box for comparison purposes and i thought to go the lab route would take too much time if and when we can subpoena for it i stashed it carefully in that mess i dont like it bob if it means you go alone to that estate out of our swiftresponse zone you could be dead and buried before we get choppers in help is minutes away when you need it in seconds i dont like it either but it seems to me we have to keep going on this line or cut bait what about we bust marty and richard for attempted fraud and thirddegree em as you say theyre not tough guys you know theyll fold meanwhile we give that letter the full nine yards in our doc lab marty and richard roll over we go to the next link up the chain and he rolls over if the letters forged our forgery guys will know who did it and we round him up and bang his head against the bars he squeals thats how you bring a crime lord down yeah but a crime lord has property a place in the community investments family all of which make him more or less stuck in place if hughs alive he has none of that that we can find we have no idea where in the world he is he can disengage in a second and hes clever enough to have designed breakoffs in his network so he can disappear from our reach instantly we pick up marty and richard hes gone for good then next year or the year after i catch a lapua in the ear while im riding spring fence and thats the end of that were close i know were close nobody has been this close i feel him what are you getting it has to be hugh hes old cagey smart hes been in the game a long time he knows what hes doing hes no psycho everything is rational objectivedriven hes subtle hes witty in a funny way hes honorable we left his kids alone hes left my family alone i dont know why but i trust him for that like his cousin lon hes a decent man except for the few seconds when he killed the thirtyfifth president of the united states its your ass so its your call then i go ill have people close by chopper teams observation no uhuh if hugh has people theyll see it and hit eject hard and that means hell hit eject it only works if i go in alone unobserved no teams no air cover no radio nets no backup if i need help ill call the state cops swagger still crazy after all these years im not saying im not scared or that i think this is wise i am its not i just dont see any other way thats what they said about iwo jima we won iwo jima look heres my plan ill call richard tell him about the letter have him contact marty and set up a date for next week then i go on vacation do you have a timeshare or something a condo in florida no but i have to get away by myself somewhere quiet ill pick it at the airport i have a lot to think about you seem to have done a lot of thinking already not enough i have crap in my head that i cant figure theres something called synesthesia involved which reflects a mind glitch that sees certain letters or numbers in color niles was a synesthete as theyre called what does that have to do with anything so was nabokov he saw letters in color niles had a connection to nabokov through synesthesia and i think thats why he used it to construct his bogus id for hugh it was an expression of his and hughs love of nabokov and it represented the kind of cleverness nabokov used niles saw nine as red im guessing the fake name that niles gave hugh all those years ago reflects a color or a number probably a variation on red or nine im trying to work that angle its thin said nick i mean even knowing that its a color or a number a red or a nine for some reason what use is that without a suspect pool oh ive got a suspect pool said bob it includes everyone currently alive on the planet earth good said nick thats encouraging then theres something about the charlie harris letter dont know but im getting a buzz everythings perfect as i told you but i get this buzz got to figure that the swagger buzz admissible in all state courts i have complete confidence that youll get your man im sure i will too after all humbert got clare quilty at the end what the hell are you talking about another manhunt story ill tell you later swagger it clawed me from unconsciousness i awoke as before in a cold sweat enfeebled aged overmatched i tried to sort it out before my heart exploded and aneurism did finish me i had directed richard to work with a police artist to prepare a likeness of the jack brophy who had shown possibly killed my driver then disappeared in dallas and it took until that night but could it be swagger no impossible the odds were too distant but id seen long odds cash in enough times not to see it as a possibility i grabbed the drawing from my desk and bore down on it i had seen him of coursethat day in at the preliminary court hearing in new orleans i had sat behind the prosecutors table in gray herringbone and red bow tie i looked like ol perfesser flibbertygibberty out of a frank capra movie very much the ivy paragon of diffident and eccentric genius that was my style then hopelessly tweedy of appearance of mind i remembered lanky jeans boots some sort of cowboy jacket for all my efforts i couldnt get a face i had impressions not images i saw that stretchedout body not accustomed to sitting unsure how to arrange those legs warythe word wary keeps coming to mind he seemed to be watching everything evenly without remarking holding his cards tight to his chest always calm a kind of easy grace to his actions it was easy to project that temper into a sniper whod need wariness a gift for observation patience and could have nothing of the showy boastful immodest or psychopathic about him the work was too dangerous for show it demanded contradictory gifts the precision for equipment maintenance and the patience for detailed preparation but also the imagination to project into space an enemys movement and predict where he might be and beneath it all the stubbornness to keep the imagination from inventing demons and letting panic take hold many men can be brave in batches where sacrifice and support are the group norms being brave on your own out in indian country for hours and hoursthats a trick so now at am i looked at the likeness and racked my memory were they the same man i felt like laurence oliviers crassus in spartacus who learns with amazement that hes seen spartacus fight but cant remember the details i stared frantically at the rendering trying to resolve it finally i faxed it back through the layers of administration between me and the facilitators of my orders and required that the artist do his best to render the same face minus the twentyodd years i thought that might help i also ordered the issue expedited the new version came the next day and it did the trick there was no doubt bob lee swagger was hunting me and if history was any guide i wouldnt survive that distinction now i tried to imagine the fantastical circumstances that would bring him back in quest of me how had it happened what were the links the whimsies the chance connections that put him on my trail again twenty years later when i thought i was out of it i couldnt run an investigation for the simple reason that it would soon reveal itself to him he would then know i knew and the game would become infinitely more complicated the first rule of my war against him was to prevent him from knowing i knew his identity i did resolve that when it was over and i had him dead and buried i would solve the mystery it was that fascinating to me the first step was hard thinking what could he know not what did he know but what could he know as a maximum that would be our parameter for action i had to apply the tenets of the new criticism to my interpretation of his mind to ruthlessly obliterate wishful thinking daydreams sentimentality about his nobility and heroics his capacity for hemingways classic grace under pressure and think of him purely as an enemy who needed to be destroyed i realized that he would come upon the dead hugh meachum sooner or later hed track me through hugh was there much on hugh meachum available no id been smart no family pix no glory wall that washington vanity behind my desk nothing written for the record moreover the buddings institute of foreign policy the feeble cover for me and many of my colleagues in clandestine was long gone and had left no records a genius might tease out some information by tracking through real estate records to determine that the funding that staffed if barely the suite in the national press building for many years originated in agency coffers but i didnt think that was the sort of work swagger was capable of then there was agency culture would he try to find survivors of clandestine men like me in their eighties in hopes of turning up a memory of hugh meachum poor old longdead hugh possibly theyd talk after a lifetime of being coached not to all that didnt matter in the long run even if he discovered that hugh had survived his own funeral my new identity was secure he would never know and he could never locate me while it was a matter of time before i located him i had to like my odds in this fight i made decisions richard in dallas had to stay put it was probable that brophy would try to contact him again since he was the one possible link to me whom he presumed was still alive brophyswagger wouldnt be sure whether our man was an agent or simply someone we kept under observation and piggybacked our ops off of so hed be sly about it but when it happened the dallas operative was to notify us immediately he would be given a special number by which he would directly contact the unit i meant to set up they would be able to hit the ground running the object being to kill swagger i knew id have to put together a firstrate kill team preferably men with specialops experience swat or delta that level at any rate and id have to equip them with the latest toys because those boys would as soon work with cool toys as make millions of dollars id have to put a jet at their disposal have all documents at the ready so that they could be anywhere in the world in twentyfour hours the same unit would have an intelligence component too the best people well experienced savvy manhunters my mind turned to the israelis the worlds best at this sort of thing they would be charged with running as discreet an investigation as possible into swagger what had he done the past twenty years where did he live how did he support himself what were his operating patterns his preferred methods of travel and communication his ties to a logistics base did he have access to sophisticated documents photos forgeries what were his technical capacities who were his allies his relatives his children how was he vulnerable whom would he die for whom would he kill for if possible i wanted to leave family out of it if he was married and had kids i hoped i had the strength of character to keep them off the board after all he had not come after mine and was not interested as far as i had any knowledge in my three sons or their wives and children that was how i hoped to keep it i went back to bed humming with excitement i have to say it was good to be back in the game retirement even in a style of haute billionaire decadence didnt appeal to me that much this was going to be fun within a month i was set up my intelligence team was headed by colonel formerly of mossad with a reputation for prying arab terrorists out of the gutters of casbahs all over the middle east he was assisted by captain and sergeant also israeli manhunters specialists in seeing tracks where there were none reading signs making brilliant deductions and with the patience of hawks high in the air planning and executing the best in assassinations their specialty was the helicopterwiredriven missile hit and they could put a bird through any window in the world if they had to it took a pretty penny to dissuade them from their duty stations in the tel aviv defense complex and relocate them to a command bunker i had prepared fortunately i had several pretty pennies at my disposal i secured a landing site and training ground in new mexico and there located my kill team these were magnificent men two were exseals one exspecial forces all had survived even flourished during much time in both war zones they were under the leadership of a major from commando royal marines where hed run a closecombat troop he had more combat time than the others combined the brit was one of those tough guys who by reputation would not stop coming he had been shot in the head laughed it off and killed the fanatic who shot him who was the real fanatic i leave it to you all commanded another pretty penny but alli personally vetted themhad sterling reputations they spent their mornings in brutal physical workouts to keep themselves in top shape and in the afternoon they worked on devious tactical livefire exercises they were probably the best closequarter battle unit in the world and they loved the unlimited ammunition budget even more than the ample pennies i deposited into their accounts on a regular basis close by them in a rather too nice condo in albuquerque i had my forgery unit this was basically a manwife team who had provided product to all the major western intelligence agencies they cost a fortune too and i must say they were the only ones i resented because while the killers were shooting and practicing jiujitsu or bruce lee kung fu or whatever and the hunters were locked in cyberspace penetrating databases monitoring police reports and accessing satellite data mr and mrs jones as i called them spent their time on the golf course or in the malls living a grand old life at my expense such loafers thats the price of talent i knew that i could send them a blackberry alert and within eight hours they could produce identification documents passports topsecret clearances the whole gamut of access media that would get my killers in anywhere in the world except perhaps north korea and i bet they could do north korea in sixteen hours meanwhile they shopped and golfed we waited we waited we waited life went on pleasant but more expensive than before i encouraged the government to up the budget for and the manpower of the special battalion responsible for security in my neck of the woods and still we waited and waited i spent five thousand dollars a day on ammunition i lived at the end of an umbilical cord to my communications and finally moscow do you need details i am too weary to note them now and besides what difference does it make final score s amps the izzie boys but i knew the real hunt was just beginning chapter jean marquez was how she answered her phone jean its bob swagger oh you she said im so happy to hear from you i thought youd disappeared i can be hard to find at times my old cranks suspicion he was calling from his cell in the arrival terminal at baltimorewashington international vacation in baltimore in the real world its been known to happen but in this case he was on duty as it were it wasnt exactly marquez he wanted to see nor did he want to rent her inherited tommy gunyet he had another purpose i heard about some russian drivermurderer killed in dallas she said i know i cant ask you questions but that was part of the deal he was the wheel man he tried his trick on somebody who was waiting for him it was part of an fbi sting you i had a little to do with it but the job aint finished have you got time to talk im a newspaper reporter i chat thats what i do go ahead ah this is sort of hard to explain but some evidence has come up that suggests a puzzle of some sort many years old might be involved and has to be solved i know it sounds goofy it is goofy but thats how they worked back then im listening did your husband ever make a connection to the russian writer vladimir nabokov i must say the last two words i ever expected to come from your mouth are vladimir and nabokov they were the last two words i ever expected to say believe me the answer would be no jimmys literary period was long past he read about guns and he read history and politics i dont think i ever saw him read a novel long shot here did he ever show any interest in a gun called a red nine an old german automatic pistol you know it was always one gun or another but they didnt stick in my mind i could check his books i suppose he was forever buying gun books from amazon the oneclick shopping was his financial ruin that would be a help i have one other question this one is strange its so strange i cant believe im asking it wow i cant wait she said its about literature not exactly a small topic ill try this puzzle which involves both nabokov and red nine was put together by a guy who loved literature his office was crammed with fiction books up down everywhere with underlines and commentary on what he was reading all of them alphabetized all of them in good shape which i take to mean that they were of great value to him he knew loved dreamed and breathed literature fiction stories anyway so the puzzle might reflect that and guess whos stupid about it me i doubt youre stupid about anything but go on my question is do you know somebody who really knows literature i have to find a principle to uncork the message in the bottle and i dont even know what the cork would be much less the bottle i thought if i could talk to someone who knows and loves it maybe that person would see something i never could or would say something that might organize my thinking in a helpful way she paused theres a creative writing department at johns hopkins thats supposed to no no wait i have another idea theres a nice woman in town named susan beckham shes published a series of novels that have been extremely well received she sent me a wonderful note when jimmy died she doesnt talk to the press she doesnt want to give too much away she says shes the only writer left in the world who doesnt court publicity i could call her this is exactly the kind of intriguing question that she might like and as i say shes nice she was nice they met at three the next afternoon in a coffee shop in a utopian village in baltimore called cross keys where it was possible to forget the ugliness of the rat and crimeinfested city just beyond the fence she was willowy her reddish hair shot with gray her freckles still visible into her fifties wellturnedout in pantsuit and glasses and low heels she could have been a mom a vice president a lawyer a teacher hi he said im swagger miss beckham mr swagger she said rising offering a hand its nice to meet you jean told me you were an extraordinary man a real hero in the oldfashioned sense she got the old part right anyway all that was a million years ago even then i was lucky the real heroes came back in boxes only us fakes came back on two legs i saw a limp as you walked in okay a leg and a half then that got him a smile he sat down across from her ive never solved a puzzle in my life she said so i dont know how i can help you but ill give it a try thank you maam here it is there was an old cia fellow whose job was making up phony biographies for agents overseas he was good at it because he had a creative mind and he knew a whole lot of stuff he may have made up a name for someone and im trying to find that man here is what ive found out so far swagger told her of the office full of novels the special love of nabokov and his puns and gamesmanship and finally the synesthesia that niles and vlad shared i know its hard to believe but mr swagger i happen to be an expert on the tricks the mind can play on people i believe it completely so thats it im thinking youll see a pattern or come up with a question i should ask or might have an idea that tell me what writers he had in his library some i knew many i didnt a few years back i read a lot of postworld war ii novels so i recognized the big war by anton myrer catch by joseph heller away all boats by kenneth dodson and the war lover by john hersey and famous important writers hemingway faulkner fitzgerald updike all the famous foreigners tolstoy dostoyevsky trollope woolf le carre a lot of those modern library classics he had refined tastes not quite there was also a lot of what you might call junk crime stuff thrillers that sort of thing a couple of books by james aptapton lots of paperbacks people like hammond innes jim thompson nevil shute james m cain dashiell hammett someone called richard s prather john d macdonald another macross macdonaldbooks that from their title or their cover seemed to be about crime or murder it was all mixed up he wasnt a snob im guessing if it had a good story hed learn from it all the books felt readyou know all the spines were limber most were marked up he had one of those ex libris labels in each one with his name he was a hard serious reader of stories nabokov he had every nabokov thing some in russian even are you getting anything she sighed no not really only this and i dont see how it would be any help at all it has nothing to do with synesthesia colors russian lit nabokov anything please who knows maybe its the key one thing he would have learned over a lifetime of reading assiduously in both serious and pop literature is the difference between the cliched and the authentic yes maam swagger said cliched and authentic without humiliating him by asking if he knew what that meant she went ahead after a sip of her coffee cliched meaning written to a formula familiar from a hundred other stories with certain expectations if youve read it before its a cliche but cliches are so insidious that many fine professional writers dont notice them and theyre comforting like the furniture in an old house theyre prominent in some of the pop writers you mentioned examples the rescue in the nick of time the hero and heroine falling in love at first glance the hero winning the fight every time and never getting shot you do get shot in gunfights bob said exactly you know that but many of these writers dont they just know that for the formula to pay off the hero has to survive i get you on the other sideand please understand it has its own pitfallsis what im calling the authentic by that i mean the normal the undramatic the small the world is never at risk no one ever mentions a sum of a million dollars people misbehave get angry forget things come down with colds lose the grocery list the hero has terrible flaws that cripple him no plan ever works right the universe is largely indifferent to the fate of the characters but life counts love is important pain is real you have to find a way to dramatize that i understand he said could you give me more cliches somehow that idea what youve identified i have a feeling its something niles would have enjoyed thinking about its not just plot elements its also language words that have been put together so many times theyre as comfortable as an old bar of soap dark as night sky blue winedark sea ravenhaired beauty all those are familiar so their meanings have eroded they dont carry any electricity they remind you of a movie what about passions golden tresses perfect good god whered you get that its from an old magazine anyhow i think im getting it characters can be cliches too compare say chandlers detective philip marlowe with nabokovs humbert humbert marlowe is incorruptible smart and brave and he sees through everything every motive every feint every lie hes too good to be true humbert though hes superintelligent makes every possible mistake is in the grip of a pathetic obsession cant control his own behavior even when he shoots quilty at the end its not some terrific highly choreographed gun battle but a pathetic transaction where shooting wildly he runs after a begging crying man so marlowe is the cliche humbert the authentic nabokov wouldnt write about a cliche except maybe to joke about it to turn it on its nose to make a game out of it i see said bob would niles after nabokov make a game of a cliche well she said as you know nabokov loved games so i suppose niles had to pick up on that he might have his code may involve a spirit of play you know him better than i do can you give me some other plot cliches nick of time was one the hero never getting shot was another the most famous would be the butler did it thats from a type of english crime novel in the twenties when murder was considered an upperclass occurrence and the books were pure puzzle the temptation of the butler was too delicious to resist he was invisible he was discreet he was loyal he knew the house and grounds perfectly there were a lot of books with a guilty butler then dozens hundreds then they reversed the cliche since everyone expected that the butler did it it turned out the butler didnt do it even if he was the chief suspect that became just as much of a cliche but if you wanted to do that today the real joke would be a game on the game that is the butler really did do it i see swagger said heres another one its prevalent in a modern thriller nothing is what it seems the heros in a situation and he continually interprets the signs for guidance what he doesnt know is that some evil genius has purposely constructed false signs to lead him astray it never happens in real life but its a great if cheap device most such books or movies dramatize the process by which the hero sees behind the manipulations and figures out whats going on got it and if nabokov or even niles gardner were to do a game on that his version would make you think that nothing is as it seems but actually everything is exactly as it seems she said i see by the light in your eyes i might have scored a point yes maam im realizing that was the principle of the red nine i thought it stood for something or labeled something or meant something elsesay a code name for an agent a radio call sign a chess move something like that in the end it turned out to mean nothing else it simply was what it was he saw nine as red he saw all nines as red thats all it was literal not metaphorical so it was the subtlest of codes yes the code was that there was no code who would ever figure that out except maybe a bob lee swagger no college professor would figure it out because no college professor would be capable of thinking that clearly im thinking that maybe he used the same principle on the next step something seems like a code but its not it just is what it is in plain sight but you could look at it all day and not get that the code is that there is no code the secret is that there is no secret its too clever she said i could never use it in a book real life is never like that it is all right to fail if you learn from your failure here is what i learned from the moscow debacle swagger at sixtyseven was still very very good he could not be taken by runofthemill criminal gunmen he was too smart too swift too calm in action too determined moscow had hardened him while confirming his suspicions and he would move more directly to the target which was alas me the second thing i learned i have had to learn this lesson over and over again maybe it will stick by the time i reach ninety is that you cant rush things they will happen at their own pace at their own place in time the more you rush the more you cut corners the more damage you do to yourself i should have flown in my kill team at first notice and not tried to make do with a crew of uncertain talents and dubious motivations to take professionals you need to have professionals so that issues of pride are involved not just greed and the will to violence my worldclass killers wouldnt have panicked would have planned better would have shot better would have had more contingencies in play would not have been thrown off their game when their sitting ducks proved to be armed the third thing i learned i knew this too but i forgot it also was to prepare the ground our team took stronski at a place he stronski knew best he knew all the shooting angles the paths through the bushes the locations of the bench pedestals which would stop incoming and the trash cans which would not i resolved to do better next time for one thing it would be the full focus of my attention there would be no tending to empire and pleasure and turning to tactics in spare minutes between soirees no i had to go to war footing to win the war which meant it had to be a operation i had to put aside my decadence and find my war brain again and become the hard and ruthless hugh of clandestine service that old legend whod killed a president and hundreds more in his time my first resolution was take the fight to the enemy i knew i could not back off and let him find a new angle of attack to which i would react because in the reaction would be encoded my failure i was not going to live in anticipation of a move against me by this genius operator at the time and place of his choosing and pray for the luck of my guards no i had to go to him i had to net him i had to lure him to prepared ground where we knew the locations of the trees and benches and all the escape routes were predetermined the sights zeroed the weapons tested it had to be done not just professionally but at the highest levels of professionalism i did have one advantage i knew where he had to go he had to go to texas the only sure link to me was through the man whod been his mentor in dallas and he suspected that man was an agent of mine hed have to reengage and infer from that a way to me who paid him what were the arrangements how did he report how could he be played hed have to confront those questions in texas id put something before him something so seductive he could not resist its temptation he would have to go after it it would be his grail he would study the approach sniff a dozen times seem to go then back off hed circle around hed look for signs for disturbances for indicators of preparation and ambush and id have to prepare carefully enough to survive that scrutiny and finallyweeks down the long and winding path before mehed make his approach and then wed have him since he was by nature a gunman and since guns were in a way his yoknapatawpha i understood instinctively that hed come at me through the guns he would have no choice they were what he knew his terrain he was the master navigator of that small world and he would feel the most confidence in that arena but there was more i could feel it as if it were just beyond a screen or covered by a sheet its outlines barely visible no details yet to be seen it had to do with guns guns were at the heart of it aleks junky little warsurplus italian clunker lons sleek excellent winchester the whizz of the bullet to the target the extraordinary damage such a small piece of matter could engineer within flesh if propelled at the proper speed and then i had it the breakthrough quite a moment when it feels as if god is whispering in your ear no he is otherwise busy im sure the rapping at your chamber door is from your subconscious which has been engaged with the issue fulltime trying facts against possibilities seeing if parts fit or must be discarded testing testing testing all the time until that moment when miraculously it all comes together in perfect stunning clarity what i needed was a physical object a file a confession something tangible and palpable which would prove the existence of our plot against kennedy i needed something swagger would kill to get and at the same time risk death to get to make it real i needed a plausible narrative to sustain it i had to invent documents to validate it i had to have unimpeachable witnesses to verify it i needed a realistic chain of events that would account for its whereabouts since and that put it within swaggers reach today this is what my imagination created in one gushing rush of fact and detail i came up with a gun case containing hughs model the suppressor and some of the hybridcarcano ammunition locked and sealed with shipping tags proving it was shipped from dallas to richmond on the night of november by braniff i imagined a backstory by which it was lost and then found by a writer doing a bio on lonjohn who would need the help of someone with practical ballistic experience i imagined richard bringing them together the one thing i could not imagine would be swaggers refusal i must say that though they cost me a fortune the joneses turned out to be worth every pretty penny the profusion of old documents they produced was amazing it turned out that mr jones was some sort of paper expert who knew about thread counts finishes manufacturing processes the effects of aging and all the minutiae of what i suppose could be called the paper game his true expertise was chemical using a variety of magic potions out of little brown bottles that produced vapors he could give a routine sheet of papyrus the brittle yellowness of age so accurately that it was laboratoryproof as to time of origin that product was dispensed to various nimble professional criminal figures under contract to people who were under contract to various other people who were under contract to me and in a bit of time wed inserted a document in the necessary file which appeared to be the files of the madison avenue seventhfloor gun room of abercrombie amp fitch a legendary place that shipped lon most of the rifles he decided he couldnt live without the joneses had access to a whole range of criminal fabricators i had no idea even existed they were able to hire a contractor who built an exquisite replica of a abercrombie gun case and had it suitably aged they came up with a model of the appropriate vintage a unertl scope aged bottles of hoppes gun oil and an ancient brass brush no luck on the german schalldaempfer so they settled on an ancient maxim silencer that at least was timeframeappropriate they used a noted arms expert to fabricate the cartridges and he did so on brass of the proper historical pedigree loaded on dies of the proper historical pedigree and the bullets loaded into the shells were authentically from the rare lot of the western cartridge co mannlichercarcano whitebox ammo dont ask what it cost id rather not know then there was the man whod play the writer in whose care the gun case would be left i couldnt hire a con man or a real actor for this tricky role it had to be an authentic firearms expert with great knowledge and a list of published volumes with whose work swagger would be familiar he had to be able to talk guns with swagger while swagger was secretly monitoring the conversation looking for telltale signs of a fraud it had to be someone who was known to others in this field so swagger could get personal recommendations nobodies need not apply hmm how would we settle this i chose the expensive course and the mission was given to my israeli manhunters those bird dogs of deceit and human weakness in time they produced they came up with a fellow named marion marty adams who helpfully had a character defect a tendency toward larceny as a known expert he became a broker on many fine gun sales the man who assured the buyer that it was indeed a rare firstmodel henry rifle he was spending his on and not a counterfeit but there was so much more money in the counterfeits marty it seems was in the process of being sued by one enraged buyer and if that became known his reputation would be shattered his career destroyed and his bridge to the high end of the gun biz forever burned marty was approached the offer was one he couldnt refuse he would quietly settle out of court with the plaintiff paying an exorbitant punitive fine and the case would disappear before causing damage to martys reputation since marty was an idiot with no money cash and legal guidance would be our contribution in return he would be prepped to play a part in a larger deception the point of which would never be clear to him there was one more figure the lynchpin that is our man in dallas richard monk i decided to run him myself i would do so by encrypted satellite phone the most secure form of verbal communication in the world i arranged for him to be given the implement already dedicated to my number alone so he couldnt dial up sex talk from vegas or make anonymous dirty calls to teenage girls in tennessee at my expense he would be the one man in the world who could reach me instantly and directly when the situation demanded it i knew i could not tell him he was tasked with leading jack brophy to his death in a violent commando ambush in which he might himself be winged or even terminated he would flee to the moon by tomorrow noon or if he didnt swagger would read the sick anxiety on his face like a road map i told him a little fib as part of the briefing i represent a venture group that has its eye on a nice collection of corporations alas the sole owner of this group a discreet elderly wasp cares not to discuss selling them to us at a reasonable price since we dont kill we have targeted the crown jewel of his collection for ruin and when it collapses it will drag down the stock prices of his other holdings we will pounce and he will wake up the next day a minority stockholder we will buy him out for pennies on the dollar i see but the crown jewel is an old and prestigious new york publishing house we will swindle it through your good efforts into paying an outrageous sum for a book that solves the kennedy assassination with the physical proof to make the case stick that is why everything is arranged so carefully as if we were the cia this is a deep deception when the book is published to much huzzah we will prove through friendly journalists that it is a hoax and that the publishing house has been deceived and is selling a fraudulent product that must be recalled and thus falls the house of cards do you understand so it has nothing to do with the kennedy assassination just some bigdough guys trying to outhustle each other no qanda richard yes sir let us return to business we expect in some time the man you know as jack brophy will make contact with you your job is to steer him very carefully to the man called marty adams this should all be familiar to you its been pounded into my head you will brief me before and after every meet with brophy yes sir you will take extreme security precautions he must never see this communications device never suspect you are in realtime communication with me he will penetrate your house he will go through your underwear your collection of dirties he will read all the squalid details of your failed marriages richard where is the phone secured its in a book safe in the basement shop its in bugliosis reclaiming history which was the only thing big enough to conceal it but there are thirteen thousand other books down there thats the guy richard you make me so proud we started getting responses from the operation almost immediately pings blips echoes readings whatever you want to call them swagger was on my trail and it was impressive it wasnt just his courage and his skill with a rifle that made him a standout by some queer mutation he had been given a superb mind for analysis and deduction it is strange how genius occasionally shows up in a single generation then vanishes yet as impressive as his skill and determination turned out to be they didnt answer the one question that most intrigued me why i suppose he needed a mission and this was the one that came along he was the type who couldnt live without a mission there was also the issue of grief he had lots beginning with his father then moving on to his spotter donnie fenn he was married to donnies widow jen and finally an agency officer named susan okada killed in his most recent foray into our world which ended with a missile detonating in the rose garden was grief driving him or was it something else could it be a love of kennedy was he a jfk groupie whose world had been shattered at lons shot heard round the world was he in love with jackie with camelot with the children johnjohn and caroline did he see himself as their avenger it seemed unlikely to me that a man so relentlessly pragmatic would have a soft core particularly in devotion to something he had never experienced himself but only read about and saw on tv as an american teenager i remained baffled nevertheless he was a formidable opponent and he was getting closer and closer could he win i honestly didnt see how as i knew who he was and there was an impenetrable wall between who i had been and who i was now even if he determined as he was sure to do that hughs death was fiction i had removed all traces from my records of who i might become anybody who knew me then was dead only their children survived and we of the agency did not as a rule share with our children i knew this he had to return to texas the satellite phone rang at pm my time yes hes back in dallas richard he approached you out of nowhere like nothing had happened i was sitting in mcdonalds a few minutes ago eating my usual egg mcmuffin and suddenlythere he was richard continued with his report the upshot being that swagger was back in town as i had anticipated and was playing richard again how did you leave it i asked after hearing the nuts and bolts of what had happened to brophy where his researches had taken him where he wanted to go now im going to look into the possibilities hes interested in he wants me to be discreet because of the value of his intellectual property hes afraid of a claim jumper or someone beating him to the punch so hell contact me in a couple of days do you know where hes staying no he made a joke about that if i dont know where hes staying and im captured and tortured i cant give him up ha ha not funny in my opinion but i laughed anyhow he said its better if he finds me than the other way around just protecting his intellectual property excellent richard do go ahead and help him dont mention marty adams until youve gotten him what he wants dont force it its an afterthought not a main point if he doesnt respond dont mention it again hes paying attention even if he pretends hes not hes mentally recording everything you say and will spend hours going over it hell look into marty sniff paw howl a little head up one trail come back circle around and return if he senses youre trying to force him in a direction hell be suspicious of you sir are you the type who kills people if they fail no richard you will be tortured exhaustively but not killed thank you sir i will spare us all the tedium of close reporting on the game i will say only that its one amusement was the image of richard a fat lake trout with two hooks in his jaw being played by two expert anglers poor richard trying to please me and trying to please the mysterious slippery brophy with his farseeing eye and almost supernatural gift for anticipation on the fourth meet i felt that richard was confident enough to work the adams angle and authorized him to do so he reported that swagger reacted with indignity even anger but in the end seemed to warm to the idea of a collaboration his final instructions hold off a bit let me look into this guy im not a writer im an engineer maybe he could help me i could help him but goddammit dont tell him no more about me he checked into marty through the auspices of the fbi our computer wizards determined that another deep data search was done on marty adams and circumspect inquiries were made in the publishing world and the highend gunsales world and so forth and so on and we knew that theyd come back positive since we had interceded before any stain on martys honor could be recorded just barely hed left many unsatisfied customers so it was only a matter of time in week four we got the news our two fictions would meet jack brophy and marty adams each not who they said they were each with a different agenda but each eager to continue the charade it seemed to go well marty as anticipated and confirmed by richard was a blowhard autodidact and he bored both richard and swagger out of their socks with his various pontifications in the end swaggerbrophy was intrigued enough to agree to another meeting clearly his interest had been snagged particularly by the mysterious thing that marty had promised would tie a ribbon around the case the wait i am required to show that my craft discipline hasnt eroded over the years it wasnt easy but enough was happening to keep me busy and for nights i had viagra shizuka and forties musicals and melodrama the israelis monitoring through their various cyberpenetrations reported a more thorough hunt for marty adams particulars and now a network of field interviews by anonymous young men even marty adamss agent was interviewed seemingly on another matter but the welltrained investigator managed to divert focus to marty and spent most of the time unearthing details on him i realized the time was appropriate to initiate the tactical phase the famous meachum luck provided that martys inheritance included an estate in western connecticut the last remaining relic of the fortune that his father lost trying to sell highquality target pistols to a country gone mad on fast draw and mock combat shooting in the fifties and sixties the place about a hundred miles outside hartford was hard against a scut of mountains in the low northeastern configuration hills with trees to anybody whos seen real mountains on the property was a decaying house and martys taxes were in arrears so we paid them off ouch to preclude municipal interest it wasnt gated or fenced or up to modern security requirements but it was remote from neighbors and marty retired there to write and shoot often enough that gunshots didnt necessarily cause the police to drop by it was also nice that he had a class iii license so the sound of full automatic weapons if heard was not another police signal i had an engineering firm discreetly map the place as i had an aerial photographer record its nuances from his cessna this documentation i provided my shooters in new mexico i asked them to prepare a plan from the documents then to journey up there one at a time infiltrate the property and spend a few days exploring it and learning the land they were all equipped with digital cameras for closeups on the coverversusconcealment issue for the angles of fire for whatever other tactical concerns came up the plan was sound the goal was to get him under all four guns run them hard to empty and take him out in one decisive assault marty and richard if there might fall in the fusillade i decided that was an acceptable price to pay although i never told them that as i never told marty about the incursions on his property and my plans for the final moments he would survive or not depending on his luck but he was strictly collateral there was some debate as to timing i ultimately decided on hitting him after hed had his conversation with marty and examined the unopened case and was on the road out of the place the reason was that coming in hed be wary hed have a tiny worry that it was an ambush and all his senses would be extrasharp hed be volatile prickly at high combat readiness he might be armed if richard was with him that could tangle things as well so wed let him come in and once he saw the package and realized its significance and gamed out what it explained and what it made possible and examined it closely without opening and looked at martys xrays of it once hed swallowed that hed be far more relaxed and at the same time distracted his mind would be going a hundred miles an hour hed be in a mode of triumph because hed found the leverage at last to prove the conspiracy get the case reopened and loose the dogs of law enforcement on hugh meachum and begin the international manhunt that would shake that villain out of the trees no matter where the trees were the hit would go down a quarter of a mile out of martys rambling wreck of a house on a dirt road with a degree angle and no maneuverability due to the dense trees and sharp angles on either side if he should escapedoubtful given the firepowerthere was only one way to run and that was up a low connecticut foothill where the trees gave out hed find himself on robert jordans hilltop in spainno jordan was at the bridge not the hilltop who was at the hilltop anyway that persons hilltop in spain unarmed with only a few low stones as the four best operators in the world moved in el sordo by the way was the fellow on the hilltop el sordo didnt make it off of his and neither would swagger the firepower and accessories someone possibly anna wintour said its all about the accessories the boys had decided to go with deep ghillie camouflage and to infiltrate the property two days in advance thered be no movement on the place the day before and to any observer casual or professional no sign no trace no indication of penetration if they had to move quickly the boys would shuck the ghillies and revert to digitalcamouflage battle tunics and trousers faces would be blackened or painted greenbrown for some reason these commando types love the touch of the painted face hatwear either the ubiquitous black wool watch cap or a suitably dappled boonie cap fashion is so important to highend commandos and i wanted mine to be up to ms wintours standards as for the guns the boys would each have as primary ambush weapon the mk light machine gun that had happily mowed its way across iraq this superb piece of combat engineering was ultrareliable even in the sand and spat out its deliveries at a rate of about seven hundred rounds a minute of mm ammunition it was beloved by highspeed operators the ammo slung underneath the gun body in a hundredround belt rolled into a canvaswrapped container would be standard military ball for penetrating the body of the auto anybody inside that vehicle would be bonnieandclyded in the first few seconds if by some odd trick swagger survived the initial hosedown and headed up the hill the fellows would dump their mks and default to the latest ar platform the m ic from lwrc on the eastern shore of maryland accessorized with eotech hologram sights larue flexible x magnifiers and at least ten hk mags with twentynine rounds of black hills grain hollowpoint and of coursenothing is too good for my boyseach would carry a wilson cqb acp and a randall knife i know all this because i saw the invoices and it added up to pretty penny no too bad these fellows couldnt have been deployed against a meaningful national target instead of my need to get another hundred or so blow jobs from shizuka before the reaper came calling on me but there you have it as far as the extract was concerned i would have a helicopter in orbit on the outskirts of the estate one of the pilots duties was to monitor law enforcement channels to see if the gunfire attracted any undue attention if squad cars were dispatched from the state police barracks hed notify the ground team swoop in and evac if not hed wait until theyd policed the killing ground removing and disposing of the brass and the body and that load finally id made disposition that he had flir aboard forwardlooking infrared technology so that if by a oneinamillion chance swagger got into the brush the chopper could nose him out via his heat signature and direct the kill team to him again in a few minutes meanwhile back in the real world the process ground slowly on swagger leaped at the rifle lure as i anticipated but insisted that he first establish the provenance and marty skillfully guided him to the abercrombie amp fitch records in rutherford which we had penetrated and into which we had inserted a superb forgery establishing ownership when swagger saw that he would be hooked through the gills he would insist on being allowed to examine it and a date would be set for his trip to connecticut that was it no big deal swagger was so provoked by the rifle case that all other precautions were irrelevant that was the whole point of the multimilliondollar operation and it was accomplished in a split second as an afterthought i had him part iv connecticut telling me i got to beware chapter richard made all the arrangements bob met him at dallasfort worth international a week later and the two flew direct to boston then caught an american eagle puddle jumper to hartford where richard had booked two rooms in the airport marriott dinner in a local steak house at eight the next morning richard picked bob up in a blue rental ford focus and they set out for the twohour drive west through the rolling connecticut countryside for the arrival at martys estate in litchfield county west of warren beautiful country said richard reminds me of the cotswolds in england never been there said bob but beautiful it is and you dont see any shacks or rustedout cars on cement blocks or rundown places like you do in the south the american south or any south the trees the houses the farms the towns all mature mostly white wooden clapboard impeccably serviced shutters boldly painted a primary color all well scrubbed by people for whom maintenance was an obsession they took care of stuff these people flowers beautiful hedges trimmed all towns big or small boasting a civic hall a hotel a park a church it felt like some kind of ancient land as imagined by disney every other building seemed to have been built in some faroff place called the eighteenth century and laws of enlightenment rationality were still in control swagger ate it up it was in his genes it lit his imagination it was the way things should be a military duty ethos fused seamlessly with daily life he was also scanning for air covera shadowing chopper or some other sign that nick had violated the agreement and laid in backup too close hed wondered if the next little revolutionary war burg would conceal gunmen with body armor and rpgs you seem tense jack i cant stop looking over my shoulder i told you ive had a price on my head and once youve been hunted you never fully relax jack its a beautiful day in a beautiful part of america and you are part of one of the most exciting historicalintellectual developments of our time which i should add will probably have a tremendous financial upside you should just enjoy the ride in you are so right richard man i wish i had it in me to click the off switch and go to takeiteasy i just want to look at this rifle case get the business deal set and get to work onward they went passing through warren passing more rich yankee farmland and forest finding the hills on the rise and feeling the gentle slope as the car climbed several hundred feet into the hills there it is said richard a rusty green sign at a rusty gate sunk in faded concrete abutments with pretensions of grace announced adams glen and richard slowed and took the turn the road ran through thick trees on hillside with slope above and below the dirt of the track dust flew in two tire contrails behind them smearing the pristine beauty of the azure windless cloudless day but on either side the world seemed green dense and hushed bending over looking through the windshield swagger could see the hill rising buried in forest the whole way to a rounded peak another four hundred or so feet up cubed limestone boulders like fallen ceremonial heads showed here and there among the trees which were heavier or lighter in density depending on natures whimsy they rounded a last gentle turn and the hillside opened up to permit a spacious house against its flank on the same theme as all those before a huge clapboard mansion built with an eye toward symmetry and precision in an age when those things were beauty this one was beyond mature and had eased almost into senility the landscaping had grown ragged with lawn unkempt weeds annoyingly clotting the beds hedges out of square and in some places out of hedge just jumbles of bush richard eased the car to a halt and bob got out noting how badly the house could use some saving paint having faded from white to something near pewter with more than a few of the slats corrupted by rot the shutters flaky and mottled it was a milliondollar house a million dollars away from restoration hello hello said the chubby marty beaming stepping from a lesser door he wore baggy blue jeans and a blue buttondown shirt and a shawlcollar cardigan as sloppy as the decaying house from which he had emerged right on time you engineer everything just right dont you jack swagger smiled taking the soft plump hand and shaking it nice place he said this old monster been in the family three generations damn id love to get the money together to get it all brandspankingnew again then it would be something sorry its so ratty but the taxes alone eat me alive and i can barely keep my nostrils out of the brine come on in marty led them into darkness and more of the same the house had a mildewy quality many of its rooms filled with ghost furniture under white sheeting the smell of dust hanging in the air and where slants of sunlight fell through shuttered windows they revealed an ecosystem lively with debris marty took them into what was his workroom and presumably had been a pater and a grandpaters study it alone was populated by dead animals all with intense glass eyes caught up in the taxidermists high drama shot by one generation or other of adamses the room was paneled and shelved with every book ever written on firearms some of them by marty behind the cluttered desk stood the glory wall the young marty in blackandwhite slimness with this or that prosperouslooking older man of the gun world swagger saw a few he recognized a few he knew say isnt that elmer keith the gun writer i knew elmer he was very old by then you like the old gun writers god what men look theres jack oconnor and over there charlie atkins border patrol gunman and dangerous gent this one is bill jordan he was also border patrol he had hands like hams and i swear i never saw a man so fast bill could put an aspirin on the back of his right hand draw his smith and blast the falling pill before it hit the floor he did it once on ed sullivan swagger had some memory of most of these fellows theyd been his heroes growing up not ballplayers or fighter aces or diseasedefeating doctors but gunmen like his father he could say nothing because those memories didnt belong in the head of jack brophy retired mining engineer when i was trying to learn more about all this he said i think i read a batch of them they all seemed to have good times they sure did said marty now look at this and he was off the next half hour was spent observing his treasures strewn about on random shelves and he did have many he had the first serial number in the last six models of target pistol his father had manufactured pristine in perfect untattered cardboard boxes he had colts experimental mm doubleaction automatic offered to the army in the early sixties for consideration in replacing the government model he had the h amph winchester bull gun that art haymon set twentyseven national records with in the late thirties before being nudged aside by the great lon scott he had henry rifle no the brassframed gun that could be loaded on sunday and fired all week which ultimately morphed into the winchester which won the west though as frequently for red people as white he had colts smiths marlins all exquisite all virtually pristine all glorious sell the guns marty said richard theyd buy your house a new paint job oh no said marty you dont sell history at least not this history i hopeagain maybe its more a dream than a hopeto display the collection coherently in its own museum maybe this place all spruced up that would be an adams legacy marty dont tell me youve lost that gun case asked swagger meaning it to be perceived as a joke and youre just softening the blow no no its here he said i can see ive kept you waiting long enough you boys sit over there coffee not now said bob suppose i spill it on the thing more laughter okay marty said he went to what seemed to be a wall and pulled on some lever or something and the shelving laden with books floated outward on hinges stateoftheart to reveal a vault door dead black dead steel dead heavy he leaned and grabbed a knob beneath the rotary of the combination dial pulled down and a heavy steel clank reverberated through the room loud enough to awaken the dead animals on the walls stir dust from the books and maybe make a buried adams or two turn over the vault door swung out and marty dipped in he emerged in white gloves he held in his hand a stoutly constructed pigskinandcanvas case maybe two feet wide three long one deep of extremely elegant manufacture he set it down on the bare coffee table before his two guestsbefore swagger really as richards contributions at this time were negligible swagger leaned forward hungry to apprehend its meanings it wore its age well with scuffs and stains and obscure marks everywhere but integrity vouchsafed and complete the leather seemed richer in patina as if the process of aging had turned it from the utilitarian to the exquisite bob didnt touch it he put his nose two inches from it and scanned every detail the locks were tarnished but hed noticed that there was no play between lid and case so he presumed it was tight and nothing had loosened or worn within you have no key he asked no maybe if you went to the arkansas state police and got mr albrights possessions from his death in itd be on a key chain but at this end nothing id hate to damage it when we open it said richard well have a bonded locksmith open it said bob he can get it open without damaging it he can attest to the age of the lock he can date the lock and notarize it for us see those are the things id never think of said marty marty do you have a magnifying glass id like to look at the shipping tags of course said marty he went to his desk got the glass and returned to give it to bob id prefer to handle the tags with the gloves you got it said bob richard crowded next to him and marty hovered close on the other side leaning to lift the tags for bobs inspection in the circle of the glass the red one floated in and out of focus until bob found the right distance between eye lens and object for clarity he examined every square inch in black crayon clerks scrawl against the stiff red paper under the company rubric braniff airways into the bright tomorrow he saw date flt dalrich psnger scott ld the tag was looped over the double handles of the case sealing them together since the handles were on different halves of the case that meant it had not been opened since the heavy paper appeared unrotted and at least under martys gentle handling didnt show any giveandtake when manipulated suggesting that whatever adhesive unified the two ends of the loop it held solid itself without decay or much in the way of loosening but it looked brittle as if to bend it would send flakes of dead glue to the floor looks goddamn genuine to me said bob i guess wed have to find an expert of some sort to verify that as the proper braniff tag in the proper time frame and do some chemistry on the glue to make sure its the same kind braniff used where would we find such a guy said marty thats pretty arcane knowledge the fbi forensics people are good at document interp and this is a piece of evidence in a crime dont forget im thinking were going to have to bring in law enforcement im not wild about that said marty those guys might want to hog the spotlight theyll sniff the gold i hate to be mercenary but i have a house to paint this thing is pure gold if its got what we think it has let me look at the other tag marty let the shipping tag fall and scooped up the other it was less frail a luggage id locked in place by a leather case its face spared the elements by a sheet of plastic lon dunn scott it said in blue fountain pen presumably in lons own handwriting and below that scotts run rr clintonsburg va bob said its possible lons fingerprints are under the plastic im assuming theyre all over the locks and the stuff inside the more the better marty could i see that xray again sure said marty disappearing to his desk reappearing in seconds he laid the heavy dark celluloid sheet over the case bob could see that it was a oneonone ratio got any backlighting he asked yeah i have a light table over there i use it to go over contact sheets for the picture books marty led them to the light table a large metal frame supporting a square sheet of whitefrosted glass he turned a switch and the fluorescent bulb inside blinked to life marty laid the xray out and it displayed the cases contents in perfect outline everything recognizable the incomparably graceful monte carlo stock the ovoid trigger guard still on bolt action containing receiver bolt slot barrel with the scopea long tubular construction belled at the muzzle end maybe fourteen inchesheld parallel above the action by the ancient redfield mounts and rings of the time and above them all a long tube with a flange at one end that had to be the maxim suppressor in the corner were a collection of screws what looked to be a folded gun cloth and a small bottle presumably cleaning fluid in the other corner the silhouettes of three cartridges bob took something out of his pocket and laid it next to the three it was a win mag cartridge with a grain spitzer hunting bullet look at it he said the shells are the same size twosixtyfour win mag see how lons have a blunt tip compared to the point on the hunting bullet thats because hes loaded a carcano bullet into the shell he went on with a brief description of his newly revised theory on the ballistics deceit that lay at the heart of the issue possibly marty understood or at least took it on faith richard gave no sign of being awake i think weve figured it out said marty no said swagger theres the big issue of speed we wont have anything till we have that if the route wasnt chosen until late on november they only had two and a half days to set it up impossible in that time they couldnt have done it but they did it youll figure it out said marty itll be something stupid and obvious that everybodys missed if its stupid and i havent figured it out said bob then i guess that makes me stupid i think were already there said richard youve got stuff nobody has gotten before believe me i know this crap up and down i what did you say said bob i said were already there youve got it the rest is just details already there already there he said goddamn already there the insight hit him blindside what on gods earth are you talking about said marty its the final piece of the puzzle swagger said as much swagger as brophy in the flash of revelation i couldnt figure out how they could put it together so fast they were already there on some other job they had oswald under discipline they had the ballistics they had scott in town ready to shoot then fate brought them jack kennedy and they couldnt resist taking him down it would have been so easy does this call for champagne asked marty shall we toast i dont need much of an excuse to pop a bottle nah its just something ive been working on this is exciting said marty marty please put the case away and lock it up tight bob said pointing at the case i will marty did as requested and the three returned to the couches around the coffee table under the raging glass eyes of animals dead nearly a century they talked a little bit more business mainly schedules swaggers job was to refine his theory and put it in writing striving for clarity and simplicity marty thought photos would help because both he and bob knew that many americans had no idea what reloading was and how plastic it made the medium of the cartridge theyd have to be talked slowly through bobs theory richards job was to find the various experts that the project would require meanwhile marty would put together a proposal forward it to the others for comment and then with their permission send it to his agent he thought bob ought to be ready to come to new york to meet the agent and then meet the publisher the editor and the team who would handle the book once that process was in shape marty would draw up an outline and theyd begin to deal with ancillary rights when no one could think of anything more they ambled outside and bob took a deep breath of the pineandoakscented air enjoyed the pure blue of the sky and felt the pleasant persistent pressure of the breeze it felt good to be out of that mausoleum i think weve got something here said marty i cant tell you how pleased i am in fact now that you teetotalers are gone i believe i will open a bottle of bubblelicious and drink that toast to jack to richard to our good fortune in coming together and to our bright and shining future i still cant believe this is happening said bob it is pinch yourself it hurts youre awake i guess i am the three walked to the car handshakes all around then bob said richard do you mind if i drive sure no problem said richard great he got in and slammed the door behind him as richard eased into his seat swagger pulled out and marty watched them go and so at last the mighty day had arrived my killers had infiltrated two days before and lay without moving over that long stretch of time in case any rogue surveillance had been put in place as unlikely as that might seem besides movement discipline they maintained radio silence throughout and simply lay in place vectored on the kill zone while passing the time in isometric hell meanwhile at no time were the approaching swagger and richard monitored part of the plan was to place no human eye upon them besides swaggers sensitivities there were practical reasons the supercautious swagger might have hired or gotten from his pal memphis at the dallas fbi his own team of countersurveillors to stay with him from a discreet distance and look for signs of followers we couldnt run that risk but we did have richard under control though he had no idea for what purpose and his constant email updates by iphone informed us that he and swagger had flown the day before from dallas to hartford secured a blue rental ford focus license number given spent the night at a marriott in hartford and would leave early the next morning for the assignation they were slated to arrive at the rural adams estate at am i was pleased therefore when i received at approximately the appropriate time the notification from richard everything cool leaving now in the car they would have privacy no need to plant a bug that swagger might pick up on also i had decided not to electronically penetrate martys place swagger might have some kind of miniature scanner that would alert him to the possibility of electronic ears which could give up the game and there was the possibility that somehow some way whoever went in would leave a sign of his presence and marty might pick it up and divulge it to swagger in casual conversation alerting the man worse he might decide not to divulge it which would cause him to sustain a fiction over the meet and swagger would detect that easily enough and take compensatory measures which could ruin everything it was important that monitoring of swagger by whatever means be kept to an absolute minimum i didnt have him shadowed by air though i had the helicopter on standby he might notice an orbiting bird catch a glimpse of reflected sunlight off the windscreen hear the pitch of the rotor blades changing as the craft began to descend all these tells could ruin us i settled into jittery anticipation two hours of travel time then perhaps two hours of meet time in four hours it would be finished i watched double indemnity for about the six hundredth time superb movie with the great fred macmurray and that scheming little vixen barbara stanwyck it ate up the time admirably but i still had over an hour to kill i summoned shizuka finally there was nothing left to do or at least nothing i could do except wait ticktock ticktock it was about time for swagger to arrive at the estate i lay on my veranda dressed in expensive apresmbongo wardrobei was hunting after allof cargo pants boots and a heavy dark green cotton hunting shirt with epaulets and bellows pockets i suppose i looked ridiculous francis macombers wardrobe lavished on a spry pink eightythreeyearold who couldnt weigh dripping wet at least i didnt have one of those absurd hats with a leopardskin band as preston had worn in the movie my prescription raybans lessened the glare of the sun but at this time of year the day wouldnt turn hot i used my bic and energetically updated this memoir bringing it at last to the present in which i now write in real time and felt sadness in truth ive enjoyed the writing over the past few weeks recalling my life has been an invigorating experience confronting my follies and misjudgments recalling the men and women i loved seeing them again in the middle distance of my memory god ive had a great life who has lived as hard and well as i who has known such giants as i grand old lon the immensely gifted jimmy with his nerves of steel and his bright laugh peggy i miss you old girl you were the best ill see you all soon my friends not quite yet and youll forgive me for not rushing but soon enough hugh meachum will join his wonderful colleagues all of whom he was so lucky to serve with the buds in my ear were linked to the commo center where a fleet of experts bounced signals between dishes and orbiting orbs so that i could eavesdrop on the drama as it played out now the buds crackled to life and i picked up the initial confirm as my commandos registered the arrival of the swagger vehicle at the compound with a brief break of radio silence blue team this is three i have a visual on road dust theyre on the property easy blue team said blue leader i will confirm on passage i want all your eyes down dont try to see anything dont make visual contact roger leader there was a pause then this is blue leader i have a confirm on vehicle two occupants blue ford focus connecticut license plate checks as romeo victor foxtrot as per intel target confirmed onsite stand down for now i will call a weapons check within the hour roger out came three crackly voices in simo trying to outabrupt one another they were there so far so good i lay back and enjoyed all that i saw before me the surrounding forest was lush and the meadow that was open a mile to the river for some reason at this latesummer date blazed green id never seen such a vibrant shade it seemed almost to shimmer as the sun rolled across it matted only by a few clouds all of it given animation by the persistence of a low friendly breeze there was nothing left to do nothing left to write i lie here feeling the slow and easy slip of the seconds and it seems to go by not in real time but in superreal time and i dont dare check my watch for that would somehow break the spell and id be back to the slow ticktock ticktock instead of being privileged to experience the heated rush of seconds blue team weapons check blue leader this is one cocked and locked sighted in roger one blue leader this is two all sameysame blue leader three ditto on that this is blue leader all good more silence it became time to add the last team member this is blue leader to blue five lets get airborne and to your hold blue leader this is blue five i am lighting up and going airborne and will be monitoring the police channels and holding at point one for quick evac roger blue five notify when on point good and out more time dragged by blue leader this is airborne blue five am on point holding at about two angels police channel open the smokies are all out at some accident on the interstate and all local roads in or out are lowvolume you are cleared to operate roger blue five i have you so noted and out silence ticktock ticktock if a bird cried i did not hear if a cloud masked the suns radiance i did not notice if the wind rose or fell the temp rose or dropped the shadows deepened or softened i did not care blue leader i heard a car door slam good work two go to guns fire on my fire stay ready blue five four simultaneous rogers crackled out blue team i have road dust rising i could see him blue team leader all cammied up like a beast from the bog with a ludicrous greenbrown face and a full canteen leaning in to the machine gun i could see it all the car suddenly visible in the trees then its there in the bright sun of the kill zone on the straightaway coming right at blue team leader blue team on my fire blue team leader said and the radio picked up the ripping sound of the one and then the three other light machine guns joining as they emptied their onehundredround belts into the automobile chapter as the green tunnel of trees absorbed them richard babbled away happily boy that was great really this is going so well were contributing something we will be adding something to our understanding of history we will make some maybe a lot of money its all coming together and the best thing is we get along we like we respect each other and it will continue to swagger hit him in the mouth with his elbow richards head bolted back his hands flew to his wound and his body posture seemed to collapse as all strength left and he became instantly senile the blow loosened some teeth and opened a twoinch gash that spurted blood down richards chin jesus christ what the hell are you doing oh god that hurt you madman what is shut up richard said swagger halting the car now tell me whos behind this thing whats his name where is he whats he get out of it i dont know what youre talking about yelled richard through a snaggle of loose teeth and two hands attempting to stanch the blood flow why are you doing this god you hurt me so bad i never richard about three hundred yards down the road we pull into some sunlight and about five or six guys with machine guns are going to shred this car and anybody inside it i will clonk you again and let you stay here while they do their job they will kill you dead as hell or you can scurry back to martys and hide in the basement with that fat blowhard you got one second to decide richard needed only half a second i dont know no names hes rich powerful he talks to me via satellite phone i report i get instructions its all professional topsecret well done i have no idea who he is not enough richard i dont know a thing about killing it was represented to me as some kind of stock maneuver some highend wall street thing they want to get a house to publish the book then theyll expose it as a fraud the stock of the house collapses they buy in and use the leverage to pick up a whole cluster of related companies from a guy theyve targeted thats all i know i swear give me the phone richard richard reached into his breast pocket and came up with a satellite phone with its stubby folded aerial and handed it over fingers shaking wildly you push one its a direct line hes running it himself but i dont know anything except he knows everything and he pays very very well okay richard get out of here lock yourself in and dont come out until the state cops arrive and get you cooperate with them from the getgo or you will spend the rest of your life as someones boy toy in the connecticut pen who are you richard cried im the man with the nails and this is the day i nail all you guys now get the fuck out of here richard hit the dirt running he vanished in seconds not that swagger noticed he got out himself dipped into the looming woods and came out in seconds with a dead branch about fourteen inches long he drove along at twenty no rush no hurry controlled the whole way the car followed the curve of the road which followed the curve of the hill and before him he saw the darkness of the canopy give way to a blast of sunlight as the trees fell back from the road for a bit about thirty yards out of that zone he halted and took time to precisely regulate the wheel checking to see that the front wheels were locked straight ahead he climbed from the car and hunched beside it he wedged the branch against the seat saw that it was a little long pulled it out and snapped four inches off he rewedged it lowered the unsecured end to the gas pedal took a last look and pushed the branch down against the pedal driving it forward perhaps two inches and holding it there the car accelerated as he spun away and whack caught the rear of the doorwell across the back of his right shoulder knocking him to the ground he rolled found his feet and began to race down the road as the car hurtled forward he heard the firing one and then three more guns so loud that they drowned out any sound of metal shearing or glass shattering the guns roared on for a good three seconds then quit abruptly swagger turned left and slid through an opening in the trees but before him he saw only more trees all of them vertical against the slope of the hill up was the only way to go the sevensixtwo did great said blue two the first to reach the wreckage unfortunately theres nobody here shit said blue leader any blood dont see any just blasted upholstery and a million pieces of glass he set the accelerator with this he displayed the branch okay said blue leader the car couldnt run far like that so he set it up fifty or so yards down the road he got off the road hes running hard the question is up or down we going after him someone asked i dont know said blue leader he pulled up his throat mike blue five this is blue leader roger blue leader we have a running target i want you to vector to our kill zone then look to the south and i will pop smoke orient on the smoke then deploy your flir i have to know which way the bastard is running and if hes got a team in there waiting for us roger that blue leader okay dump the ghillies this is highspeed stuff the team collectively shook itself free of the cumbersome branchandleaf constructions that had obliterated their human shapes now they were in digital cammo sandandspinachpattern a weave of forest colors and shadows i want intervals of thirty yards blue leader barked and if five gets him nailed and its all clear we will pursue if theres heavy opposition well bug out this is a kill not a war roger that came the replies the four operators hustled down the road fingers on triggers their equipment bounced as they ran the mks dangling on slings the ms light in hands ready for return fire in an instant if ambush came all reddot optics on and set to ten smoke canisters and shoulder holsters flopping on harnesses body armor slopping up and down at each step fine here said blue leader deploy into intervals he pulled a smoker off his belt as the boys spread themselves out went to knee and began to eyeball at full intensity blue leader pulled the pin and dumped the signal device on the ground it fizzed then began to produce copious volumes of roiling yellow smoke that drifted upward and in an instant the shadow cut into the sunlight as the helicopter swerved over them the machine hovered there for seconds that seemed like minutes do you have anything in your green eye five okay okay i have a fast mover uphill from you maybe a hundred yards hes pulling himself over rocks hes twelve oclock to your line going straight up anything else hot i have no other targets i repeat no other targets only the one fast hot one man hes moving for an old guy can you azimuth us to him zerozero degrees just go up baby hes dead on a line for the peak and not going much farther once he reaches it unless he finds a stairway to heaven thats our job someone said breaking radio protocol blue leader stood pointed upward to the three other members of the ground team who having heard the conversation were rising too and made the whirlybird hand gesture to give them the order theyd been waiting on which was to pursue and kill swagger climbed jesus christ he was too old for this the incline fought him the trees fought him the slipperiness of the pine needles and leaves sheathing the ground fought him the boulders fought him his hip fought him gravity fought him age fought him everything fought him fuck a slip and he went hard to ground slamming his knee against the inevitable rock sending a flare of pain up through leg to body and brain i am way too old for this he thought the sweat loaded in his eyebrows then dumped to his eyes stinging them turning the world to blur he tried to blink them clear a gut ache came bearing the news that hed been so immersed in this quest over the past weeks hed lost a lot of his conditioning tremors slithered through arms dizziness through vision and he sought handholds anything to pull him upward now and then hed find a bare spot where his new balances would find traction and give him a boost and hed gain a second or two but he knew that four young athletes in superb condition superbly armed guided by the chopper that floated just over the canopy of the trees were closing on him the hip he tried to concentrate on it to accommodate his mind to the pain which was now severe but in its time on earth that joint had been shattered by a bullet replaced with a steel ball then cut deep and hard by a blade of legendary sharpness at full force and finally just recently the whole mess had been shot again though at a shallow angle and was not fully healed it burned it boiled it seethed it disrupted what coordination was left in his old limbs and it eroded his will and stamina as he fought for gulps of dry air wiped his soaking brow ignored the dozens of raw abrasions his passage through bush and needle over rock and in thicket and copse had inflicted upon him how close were they should he zig should he zag was a red dot even now settling on his spine about to sunder it and leave him flat and begging for the coup de grace suddenly he broke into the light and the slope lessened hed made it to the top up here the wind precluded the trees achieving any height but the acre of hilltop was strewn with boulders clumps of brush patches of raw earth and a few small scabby trees that had managed against all odds to hang on around him the green state of connecticut rolled away to far horizons now and then throwing up a cluster of black roofs in trees to signify a town blue mountains blurred the edge of the earth miles away bob slipped and at that moment a bullet came swaggers luck the shooter missed by inches and swagger felt the push of the atmosphere as the bullet knifed through he dropped and began to slither too old for this shit did you get him three no dammit he went down just as i fired i had a real good sight pic on him goddamn he is a lucky sonovabitch do you see him five the chopper hovering four hundred feet over the hilltop floated this way and that i have a visual blue leader hes lowcrawling among the boulders maybe a hundred feet ahead of you i dont know where hes going theres no place to go if i were armed id have the shot but hes stuck up here for sure all right any police activity negative no reports no dispatches its all clear on that front over good i need you to retire to point one now we dont need you hanging overhead attracting attention check and commencing the chopper veered off headed for an orbit a mile away out of range blue team listen up mates you guys on the flanks i want you to move laterally locate at each hardninety compass indicator and hold up i want to come at him from four directions i dont want any chance of him evading us and making it off this hill alive do you read affirmatives came back at him you are cleared to fire if you get a clean shot but i think this is shaping up like fire and movement and then an uptop rat hunt got it blue leader the three highspeed operators scurried away to their holding spots blue leader crouched did an equipment check then took out a smoke and lit up always time for a butt hed been doing hilltops for about twenty years sometimes trying to hold them sometimes trying to take them it was all the same old hand lots of war behind him presumably lots of war ahead he waited enjoying the cigarette an english oval a thick blunt fag unlike the scrawny filtered candy tubes the yanks smoked when he was done years of military experience in rank and officers mess demanded that he carefully peel the paper rub the remaining tobacco and ash away between his fingers crumple the paper and put it in his pocket blue leader this is blue two i am set at due east and ready to rock three due west holding visuals got nothing but rock and brush no movement hes hunkered down solid ditto that ditto again okay let me try a thing blue leader rose swagger mate he shouted make this easy go out with dignity no point in squealing like a pig in the bush as we hunt you down shot a dozen times bleeding out in pain youre an old bastard youve seen this game a thousand times you knew your day would come dignity chum a cigarette a laugh a sip on the canteen ive even got some damn fine scotch aboard and its over clean and painless no response of course not swagger wouldnt give a location indicator hed play hard to get all right blue leader spoke to his team via the throat mike one and three move out two with me on the cover fire do it he rose rocked a mk burst across his front and watched the bullets blow lines of dust spasms and rock frags up where they hit on the other side two put in his two cents worth then it was blue leaders turn to move and he went low and hard hearing the cover fire against the hilltop from the two other points on the compass got to a nest of boulders and slid in he looked and in the jumbled landscape ahead of him saw nothing there wasnt much area left unpenetrated swagger was running out of hilltop okay nice and easy blue team one at a time you move in twenty or so feet scan and hold he may have an ankle piece on him or a knife use your corner discipline be aware of blind spots id go to m for better movement hes just a few feet ahead now blue leader let the heavier mk fall to sling support pushed it around to his backside and deployed the shorter m carbine stock locked in short cocked and unlocked eotech on and turned to ten so a bright red circle displayed his aim point to either conscious or subconscious one in two in three in he scurried in movements smooth fast practiced the gun locked to shoulder scanning for threat finger riding the light trigger ready to put a burst into anything ahead he could feel them they were so close the shout from the leader some brit tough guy mick jagger on steroids followed by fusillades from all points on the compass that filled the universe with bad news and drove him down so he felt he could shrink into the earth the cold blade of fear that maybe this time was the time then it passed he had his war brain back and knew exactly how it would work theyd close the circle driving him back and thered be no place to go then it would be over he slithered around a rock forced himself tasting dust feeling pain to knees elbows and skin through the low tangle of brush found a path between more low rocks that seemed to reach center and scurried ahead he saw it a redorange hunting vest crumpled but vivid the only primary color in a landscape that ran from dull to duller brown even with the sun above he scrambled to the signal dug behind it until he encountered a canvas strap and pulled fifteen pounds of canvas gun case emerged from hiding a quick unzip it was the thompson ma thirtyround mag like the gun with which his father had shot his way across the pacific nick had gotten it here from aptaptons widow just in time thank you nick once again you save the old mans bacon thank you aptapton for your love of guns especially the old tommys he slid the bolt back locking it admitting a acp to position to be swept up and fired as the first round in a burst six other loaded stick mags lay in pouches on a belt curled into the case and he pulled the belt around him and cinched it tight at that moment a young manperfect commando from oakley tactical boots to greenbrown face paintenough firepower on him to take out a platoon crept into the space between two boulders not twentyfive feet ahead they felt each other in the autistic zen of predators made a flash eye contact and got down to business swagger beat him on the action curve by a tenth of a second jacking a tenround burst into his legs knocking him down and askew tearing up limbs and hips but not spending bullets against the armor vest the guy went down hard and in a second his twisted lower extremities were wet and red to the world swagger slipped back into the brush fuck fuck he has a tommy gun a goddamn tommy gun screamed blue two are you hit he blew my goddamn legs off oh shit i cant stop the bleeding you hold two dont panic use your clotting agent and tie it down to stop the blood flow we will be with you soon hold on mate ah fuck said two blue leader had recognized the sound of thes instantly and knew it was of the thompson declension because the rate of fire was well above greasegun speed he was not surprised disappointed stunned or breathless the surprise of it did not occur to him nor would it ever the fact that he was hunted as much as hunter did not matter his hard practical mind simply went through steps new situation armed target full auto heavy bullets savvy experienced operator one man lost need to triangulate lay heavy fire back to mks and close to engage he will be tricky he will another burst of thompson fire roared through the atmosphere blue three im good i think he hit one off to my left blue leader i am moving on the fire do not rush threei will lay down cover on the sound of his gun move under my cover roger he rose readjusting weapons at speed as he came got the mk up and fired a hundredcaliber rounds into the rocks and brush where the thompson fire had sounded and saw and felt what he always saw and felt the world being ripped to dust and supersonic grit the blur of the ejection of the spent shells arching to the right the urge of the muzzle to riseafter all these years it was still so bloody cool while his sharp eyes scanned for movement or target indicators the brits gunfire whistled overhead eating up the world that it struck raising smeary clouds of fractured dust swagger knew the other operator would move under the fire and he drew the thompson hard to shoulder waiting waiting as six inches above his head fleets of supersonic fmjs flew by seeking his destruction and the gun quit as round one hundred passed through it swagger jerked up hard and saw to the right the advancing operator in the hunch not fast enough to get into cover before his time ran out swagger acquired and fired in almost the same instant and put a burst into him watching the bullets lift a straightaway of dust eruptions then went down fast and crawled again just under the line of fire of the team chief whod gotten a quick new belt into his gun and used it up in the search swagger thought hed hit his guy and when he had a chance as the boulders grew oddly larger he went to his feet and curled around putting his target between him and the remaining shooter in seconds he got around enough to see the downed man rifle on the ground wrapping a bandage tight around a bad thigh bleeder swagger screamed hold but the man went for his weaponstupid seal motherfucker hard to the end and swagger had to fire three into his only target other than the head which was the root of the mans arm where it disappeared into the hole on his vest he opened a hideous wound shattering arm and clavicle rendering the gunman maimed for life even still the man stayed in the fight shaking off the destruction looking up in rage and betrayal his teeth white against the greenbrown jungle of his face and reached awkwardly with his off hand to acquire the holstered diagonally across the front of his armored vest unfortunately it was tilted to favor the dead hand and tightly velcroed in and by the time he got it swagger was on him and hit him a butt stroke in the head he went down soggily maybe dead maybe with a concussion to render him eternally stupid swagger noted that this one too had smokers on his web belt beneath the vest and though the vest was a temptation he knew he didnt have enough time to get it off the seal and on himself so he pulled off three smokers pulled the pins and tossed them in the direction from which team leaders fire had come smoke who would have thought of that from three points just ahead of him red green blue catching in the wind blowing mistily across the scrap of flat if rough ground that comprised the hilltop it was like a screen of myth impenetrable masking all movement brilliant improvisation this old bastard was too good blue leader dropped hard feeling vulnerable he knew he was alone it was man on man if he could get close enough to get to handtohand victory was his he had about nine black belts and knew shit for which there wasnt a name and no books had been written he unlinked the heavier mk first disconnecting the belt box and tossing it far then opening the breech latch so this bad boy couldnt use it against him he toyed with the idea of dumping the carbine and making it a pistol fight which would give him much more maneuverability and let him get to full play on his superior toughness speed and stamina but this old one was a trickster who knew a thing or two and might be circling around or might be at the same time two hundred yards downhill racing like a demon knowing that in distance lay survival he stood eased forward as the smoke ceased from the two rightmost grenades and tried to see a target nothing swagger was somewhere ahead but blue leader saw nothing this was roomclearing really two men squatting as they worked their way through a maze guns at the ready who would see whom first who would fire first who would win he eased left then right feeling the whip of wind feeling the warmth of the sun he pushed off his watch cap ripped off and tossed ears and throat mike for total concentration he negotiated the avenues between the rocks and brush with care in that commando crouch and it happened that as he edged around a boulder something flashed in his peripheral and he was on it fast to see a man withdrawing because he didnt have a shooting angle but blue leader did and fired knowing that hed hit he waited nothing swagger give it up i know i hit you i saw the blood its no good going out like a rat no answer was he dead he squirmed ahead a few feet and was rewarded with a blood track got him got him got swagger hit him hard with the crown of his head a smash that skulled both of them into incomprehensibility but swagger expecting it got in his followup and clocked him harder with the inverted barrel of the old weapon blue leader went so still that he couldnt have been faking but in the next second he tried to fight his way out of the grog and swagger was on him he pressed the muzzle hard into the throat and with his other hand he ripped the mans fighting knife away unlatched the velcro on the wilson and tossed it pulled and threw the m as hard as he could he leaned over the brit pressing the blunt thompson muzzle into the neck whats your rank troopie i what what are you your rank and outfit goddammit major royal marines commando major get that bird in here fast pop your evac smoke and get these men out of here ones dead for sure maybe another maybe not get them to goddamn emergency in hartford fast and save them thats your last job as commanding officer i shot you said the major in the fucking hip i been shot there so many times i didnt even notice it bounced off now get these guys out of here save some lives why said the major i dont get it i only want one more head on my wall and it aint yours i heard the fight it was brief violent and as such things always are ugly gunfire shouts bits of panicked radiospeak screams something that sounded like a physical tussle and then the radio went dead that silence that follows a disconnect the airwaves located and destroyed communication lost i shook my head he did it i realized hed beaten them somehow i hated swagger even as i loved him god was he an operator could he have prevailed again against those odds the man wouldnt die was he achilles dipped in the potion of immortality but for a heel that no archer had found a hit of vodka calmed me and i had to appraise my situation realistically he could know nothing else he would be stopped by the firewall of the person id become hed have to set about finding me good luck on that because niles gardner long dead had built a perfect identity and it would withstand any attempt at penetration i lay back watching the sun yield its hold on the day slowly it stayed light so long now which had the odd effect of elongating life i felt like these extra hours were a gift to me they stood for the fact that i would go on and on and on that in the end if through longevity as much as genius i would prevail my phone rang what i reached for it noting that it was not my cell but my satellite richard maybe richard had a report i pressed the talk button richard no he aint here hes hiding in the basement swagger i could tell by his laconic voice its dryness its urtext of southern cadence its lack of need to dominate its irony its detachment yes sir we meet at last he said by the way if you want to talk to your commando team they aint here neither the survivors are in the emergency ward dammit you are a resourceful man i said woe unto him who tries to outthink bob lee swagger i aint no genius mr meachum i just show up and pay attention how i have to know tell me my mistake goddammit it was that forgery in the abercrombie files had me snookered completely then i realized if abercrombie sent your cousin a rifle in a new caliber and asked for a story lon would have written the story he had to keep the bargain part of his noblesse oblige or whatever you fancy donkeys call it but he didnt write no piece on reloading the and i ought to know as i read every word he ever wrote lon it was lons decency reaching out of the grave to bring me down i almost had to laugh that is what i loved about lon and that is what betrayed me i was speechless finally i realized i had only one question to ask it was the only one that mattered why why does it matter to you swagger tell me did you love jfk the myth do you wish youd been a trusted knight of camelot did you have a crush on jackie did the brave little boy and girl at the funeral break your heart why swagger why a young man in service to our country was murdered on november he was handsome and beloved everyone who saw him admired him and trusted his judgment in all eyes he was a hero he was slaughtered in the street without a chance a bullet blew up his brain he left a hole in society children who weep today everyone who knew him possibly you have heard of him his name was john f kennedy no it wasnt he was not the president of the united states john f kennedy about whom i give not a shit the man i speak of was a dallas police officer named j d tippit and like my father he was doing his duty until someone killed him for it so that is who i am i am not a national avenger i am not captain america i dont give a crap about camelot i am the dead policemans son and i did what i did to find out who really shot officer tippit i am the dead policemans boy swagger you are a bastard i know you think youve won but you havent you have no idea where i am who i am what my circumstances are are you going to indict a dead man hugh meachum is dust and ashes scattered across the countryside outside hartford he is a beloved hero and if you try to bring him down you will unleash unbelievable trouble on yourself meanwhile i will keep going on and on and on and you have no idea if im a mile from you right now or sitting at the north pole under the nom de guerre s claus not so fast mr meachum maybe you aint as tricky as you think your pal niles gardner shared your enthusiasm for this nabokov the russian writer niles liked crosslanguage puns wordplay games that sort of thing he had one other thing in common like his hero he suffered from a condition known as synesthesia because of some confusion in the brain pathways he sees some numbers in color he saw the number nine in color red thats why he had a pistol on his desk called a mauser red nine and when he came to cook up the last and best and deepest fake life for his pal and fellow nabokov lover hugh meachum he paid a gamesmans tribute to his connection to nabokov to yours and to nabokov himself by using synesthesia as the key you were born from synesthesia youre the child the son of the red nine mr meachum thin swagger so thin it tells you nothing i aint done yet his smartest trick was the code that wasnt a code it was what it was in plain sight if you could see it you dont even get it do you this is nonsense i said youve gone insane he hung a name on you that gave it up if you could see it clearly the name began with ix mr meachum crosslingual pun ix from english into latin ix mr meachum meaning nine you are the son of the red nine your new name is dimitri ixovich spazny niles really loaded the nabokov mayonnaise on this sandwich the old butterfly catcher would be so impressed niles i thought all these years later tripping me up with his cleverness when it came time for you to die you slipped into russia and took up again as dimitri ixovich spazny of kgb with all the contacts and the timing exactly right you even own the gun company that manufactured the ninemillimeter i used in the fight in moscow as yeltsins pal and money guy you also own what electricity newspaper taxicabs the izmaylovskaya mob radio the air most of the water half of belgium three quarters of hong kong and what else by the time you move on me ill be someone else i said though my heart was hammering in my chest youre not fast enough brains are meaningless without speed then how come i know youre wearing tan cargo pants and a green shirt how come i know youre resting on a chaise longue in sunglasses with a yellow tablet in your hand how come i know youre drinking vodka how come i know youre on your back porch looking down across a mile of grass framed on either side by pine forest how come i know theres a river a mile off i swallowedor should i say i swallow i had not seen that one coming it hit me blindside i suck for air while in my stunned panic i look for a spotter who is clearly at this very second eyeballing me through binoculars youre lying on the chaise at your dacha down ulysse nardin boulevard behind a thirtyfoot green steel wall in an area patrolled by an mvd special battalion youre a mile from the moscow river the sun is setting there mr meachum but the days are long and its light enough for a sniper stronski stronski is out there somewhere hes on the trigger now a ksvk twelveseven no understanding no context no empathy no regret just the snipers bullet it was the ultimate application of the new criticism see you in hell then sergeant ill be along soon swagger said and hung up and so yes its come to this so be it ive had a good life maybe a great one i loved my wife and never cheated on her i loved my sons and saw them grow into fine men and fathers i love my country and tried to serve it well i fought its wars never mind with seconds left its time to face whatevers next with a clean breast talk about an unreliable narrator talk about a murderer with a fancy prose style i killed jimmy costello i blew his action and cover to the rcmp and i knew he couldnt let himself be taken alive i regret it and always will but what if in a few years he i just couldnt help myself and i killed lon i knew by the last move that swagger was strong and my team was weak and i bullied and forced lon to go on that last absurd mission and he finally relented and died i regret both failures of nerve and character i am so sorry i deserve whatever it is im about to get and i hope chapter swagger threw the phone off into the trees somewhere account closed he thought he took a look around saw nothing but green he tried to think of his next step but had some trouble concentrating he looked at the wound in his battered hip more blood than hed expected maybe the bullet had ticked downward into the flesh instead of off into the air he didnt have any first aid or clotting agent he peeled off his jacket and wadded it against the blood flow but it quickly absorbed its limit went magenta and heavydamp and proved useless better get to the goddamn road so they can find me he thought but downhill with a bad wound bleeding hard was not easy particularly as he could feel the leg numbing out on him and in time it ceased to work in coordination with the other leg and there came a moment when he lost it toppled forward put a bruise into his spine ripped the hell out of his arms rolling through brambles felt his shirt rip and hit a rock solid with his head which was already concussed from the clout hed delivered on the commando major he got himself up and put his hand on the wound it wasnt gushing copiously but he could feel the steady warm liquefaction finding ways around his fingers he got a little farther down and noticed that a sudden chill had come into the air as well as a fog that eroded the edges of his vision he staggered over a hump and hit the road he couldnt remember which way was which and realized it didnt matter hed never make it back to the house and what was there except those two guys whose names he didnt remember and he knew they werent worth a damn he began to shiver damn so fucking cold he looked for a splash of sun to warm him up and saw an opening in the canopy a few yards ahead that admitted the light he limped to it falling once then got to it and of his own volition decided to stop fighting gravity and let himself tumble into the dust it was warmer in time he saw someone approaching him he tried to rise but the man waved him back down as he rushed to him bob saw that it was his father earl dad he cried well bob lee damn its good to see you boy earl came to him and knelt down earl wore the uniform of the arkansas state police as he had on the last day of his life and it was razorsharp in perfect duty condition as it was always for earl he had the strong kind wise face of a hero and he was everything a boy could love in a father dad god ive missed you i missed you so much now therell be plenty of time for a nice long visit youll tell me all the things youve seen dad you bob lee you just relax im so proud of my son you have made me so proud i tried so hard dad i didnt want to ever let you down and hes coming back hes coming back swagger blinked and it wasnt his dads face but some crewcut young mans bob coughed realizing that the guy had just jacked a charge through him with an external defibrillator hit him again another medic asked no no hes good the lactate is going in fine the adrenaline is taking effect hes breathing again his pulse is rising swagger breathed feeling clean air come into his lungs jesus christ you scared us said nick memphis as swaggers eyes cleared and the fog thinned he lifted his head a bit and saw an ambulance a batch of state police cars a lot of police activity along the road and above him in the hands of another young man a bottle of intravenous fluids feeding life through a brown tube into his arm he lay on a stretcher his hip was strongly bandaged and bound but some numbing agent quelled the pain okay stat lets move this man to the chopper and get him to trauma im staying on him to monitor vital signs im riding too said nick and he turned to bob and said baby you were gone you were in negative heartbeat but we got you back dont ask me how i saw my dad nick said bob and you will again said nick but i hope not for a long time
