john grisham the abduction chapter the abduction of april finnemore took place in the dead of night sometime between pm when she last spoke with theo boone and am when her mother entered her bedroom and realized she was gone the abduction appeared to have been rushed whoever took april did not allow her to gather her things her laptop was left behind though her bedroom was fairly neat there was some clothing strewn about which made it difficult to determine if she had been able to pack probably not the police thought her toothbrush was still by the sink her backpack was by her bed her pajamas were on the floor so she at least had been allowed to change her mother when she wasnt crying or ranting told the police that her daughters favorite blueandwhite sweater was not in the closet and aprils favorite sneakers were gone too the police soon dismissed the notion that shed simply run away there was no reason to run away her mother assured them and she had not packed the things that would make such an escape successful a quick inspection of the home revealed no apparent breakin the windows were all closed and locked as were the three doors downstairs whoever took april was careful enough to close the door behind them and lock it on the way out after observing the scene and listening to mrs finnemore for about an hour the police decided to have a talk with theo boone he was after all aprils best friend and they usually chatted by phone or online at night before going to sleep at the boone home the phone rang at according to the digital clock next to the bed where the parents slept mr woods boone the lighter sleeper grabbed the phone while mrs marcella boone rolled over and began wondering who would call at such an hour when mr boone said yes officer mrs boone really woke up and scrambled out of bed she listened to his end of the conversation soon understood that it had something to do with april finnemore and was really confused when her husband said sure officer we can be over there in fifteen minutes he hung up and she said what is it woods apparently aprils been abducted and the police would like to talk to theo i doubt if he abducted her well if hes not upstairs in his room we may have a problem he was upstairs in his room sound asleep undisturbed by the ringing of the phone as he threw on blue jeans and a sweatshirt he explained to his parents that he had called april the night before on his cell phone and theyd chatted for a few minutes same as usual as they drove through strattenburg in the predawn darkness theo could think of nothing but april and of her miserable home life her warring parents her scarred brother and sister both of whom had fled as soon as they were old enough april was the youngest of three children born to two people who had no business having a family both parents were crazy according to april herself and theo certainly agreed both had drug convictions her mother kept goats on a small farm outside of town and made cheese bad cheese in theos opinion she peddled it around town in an old funeral hearse painted yellow with a pet spider monkey riding shotgun her father was an aging hippie who still played in a bad garage band with a bunch of other leftovers from the s he had no real job and was often gone for weeks the finnemores were in a perpetual state of separation with talk of divorce always in the air april confided in theo and told him things he vowed to never repeat the finnemore home was owned by someone else a rental house april hated because her parents had no interest in maintaining it it was in an older section of strattenburg on a shady street lined with other postwar homes that had seen better days theo had been there only one time for a lessthansuccessful birthday party aprils mother had thrown together two years earlier most of the kids whod been invited did not attend because their parents wouldnt allow it such was the finnemore family reputation there were two police cars in the driveway when the boones arrived across the street the neighbors were on their porches watching mrs finnemoreshe went by the name of may and had named her children april march and augustwas in the living room on a sofa talking to a uniformed officer when the boones entered rather awkwardly quick introductions were made mr boone had never met her theo mrs finnemore said very dramatically someone has taken our april then she burst into tears and reached to hug theo he wanted no part of being hugged but went along with the ritual out of respect as always she wore a large flowing garment that was more of a tent than a dress light brown in color and made from what appeared to be burlap her long graying hair was pulled into a tight ponytail crazy as she was theo had always been struck by her beauty she made no effort at being attractivequite unlike his motherbut some things you cant hide she was also very creative liked to paint and do pottery in addition to making goat cheese april had inherited the good genesthe pretty eyes the artistic flair when mrs finnemore settled down mrs boone asked the officer what happened he responded with a quick summary of what little they knew at that point did you talk to her last night the officer asked theo the cops name was bolick sergeant bolick which theo knew because hed seen him around the courthouse theo knew most of the policemen in strattenburg as well as most of the lawyers judges janitors and clerks in the courthouse yes sir at nine fifteen according to my phone log we talk almost every night before going to bed theo said bolick had the reputation of being a wise guy theo wasnt prepared to like him how sweet did she say anything that might be useful here was she worried scared theo was immediately caught in a vise he could not lie to a police officer yet he could not tell a secret that hed promised he wouldnt tell so he fudged a bit by saying i dont recall anything like that mrs finnemore was no longer crying she was staring intensely at theo her eyes glowing what did you talk about sergeant bolick asked a detective in plainclothes entered the room and listened carefully the usual stuff school homework i dont remember everything theo had watched enough trials to know that answers should often be kept vague and that i dont recall and i dont remember were perfectly acceptable in many instances did you chat online the detective asked no sir not last night just phone they often used facebook and text messages but theo knew not to volunteer information just answer the question in front of you hed heard his mother say this to her clients many times any sign of a breakin mr boone asked none said bolick mrs finnemore was sound asleep in the downstairs bedroom she heard nothing and at some point she got up to check on april thats when she realized she was gone theo looked at mrs finnemore who again shot him a fierce look he knew the truth and she knew he knew the truth trouble was theo couldnt tell the truth because hed made a promise to april the truth was that mrs finnemore had not been home for the past two nights april had been living alone terrified with all the doors and windows locked as tightly as possible with a chair jammed against her bedroom door with an old baseball bat across the end of her bed with the phone close and ready to dial and with no one in the world to talk to but theodore boone who had vowed not to tell a soul her father was out of town with his band her mother was taking pills and losing her mind in the past few days has april said anything about running away the detective was asking theo oh yes nonstop she wants to run away to paris and study art she wants to run away to la and live with march her older sister she wants to run away to santa fe and become a painter she wants to run away period i dont recall anything like that theo said and it was the truth because in the past few days could mean almost anything thus the question was too vague to require a definite answer on his part he had seen this time and time again in trials in his opinion sergeant bolick and the detective were being far too sloppy with their questions so far they had not been able to pin him down and he had not told a lie may finnemore was overcome with tears and made a big show out of crying bolick and the detective quizzed theo about aprils other friends any potential problems she was having how she was doing in school and so on theo gave straight answers with no wasted words a female officer in uniform had entered the den from upstairs and she sat with mrs finnemore who was again distraught and overcome sergeant bolick nodded at the boones and motioned for them to follow him into the kitchen they did and the detective joined them bolick glared at theo and in a low voice said did the girl ever mention a relative in prison in california no sir theo said are you sure sure im sure whats this all about mrs boone jumped in she was not about to stand by silently while her son was rudely interrogated mr boone was ready to pounce too the detective pulled out an x blackandwhite photo a mug shot of a shadylooking character who gave every indication of being a veteran criminal bolick went on guys name is jack leeper a tentime loser distant cousin to may finnemore even more distant to april he grew up around here drifted away a long time ago became a career thug petty thief drug dealer and so on got busted in california for kidnapping ten years ago sentenced to life with no parole escaped two weeks ago this afternoon we get a tip that he might be in this area theo looked at the sinister face of jack leeper and felt ill if this thug had april then she was in serious trouble bolick continued last night around seven thirty leeper here walks into the korean quick shop four blocks away buys cigarettes and beer gets his face captured on the surveillance cameras not the smartest crook in the world so we know hes definitely in the area why would he take april theo blurted his mouth dry with fear his knees ready to buckle according to authorities in california they found some letters from april in his prison cell she was his pen pal probably felt sorry for the guy cause hes never supposed to get out of prison so she strikes up a correspondence weve searched her room upstairs and cant find anything he may have written to her she never mentioned this to you the detective asked never theo said he had learned that with aprils weird family there were many secrets many things she kept to herself the detective put away the photo and theo was relieved he never wanted to see the face again but he doubted if he could ever forget it sergeant bolick said we suspect that april knew the person who took her how else can you explain the lack of a forcible entry do you think he would hurt her theo asked we have no way of knowing that theo this mans been in prison most of his life his behavior is unpredictable the detective added the good thing is that he always gets caught theo said if aprils with him shell contact us shell find a way then please let us know dont worry excuse me officer mrs boone said but i thought in a case like this you first investigate the parents missing children are almost always taken by one of their parents right this is correct bolick said and we are looking for the father according to the mother though she spoke with him yesterday afternoon and he was with his band somewhere in west virginia she feels rather strongly that he is not involved in this april cant stand her father theo blurted then wished hed remained quiet they chatted for a few more minutes but the conversation was obviously over the officers thanked the boones for coming and promised to check back later both mr and mrs boone said they would be at their office all day if they were needed for anything theo of course would be in school as they drove away mrs boone said that poor child snatched from her own bedroom mr boone who was driving glanced back over his shoulder and said are you okay theo i guess he said of course hes not okay woods his friend has just been abducted i can speak for myself mom theo said of course you can dear i just hope they find her and soon there was a hint of sunlight to the east as they drove through the residential neighborhood theo stared out of his window searching for the hardened face of jack leeper but no one was out there lights in homes were being turned on the town was waking up its almost six mr boone announced i say we go to gertrudes and have her worldfamous waffles theo im in theo replied though he had no appetite marvelous honey mrs boone said though all three knew she would have nothing but coffee chapter gertrudes was an old diner on main street six blocks west of the courthouse and three blocks south of the police station it claimed to serve pecan waffles that were famous around the world but theo had often doubted this did people in japan and greece really know about gertrude and her waffles he wasnt so sure he had friends at school whod never heard of gertrudes right there in strattenburg a few miles west of town on the main highway there was an ancient log cabin with a gas pump out front and a large sign advertising dudleys worldfamous mint fudge when theo was younger he naturally had assumed that everybody in town not only craved the mint fudge but talked about it nonstop how else could it achieve the status of being world famous then one day in class the discussion took an odd turn and found its way to the topic of imports and exports theo made the observation that mr dudley and his mint fudge were heavy into exports because they were so famous it said so right there on the billboard to his astonishment only one other classmate had ever heard of this fudge slowly theo realized that it probably was not as well known as mr dudley claimed it to be slowly he began to grasp the concept of false advertising since then hed been very suspicious of such big claims of notoriety but on this morning he couldnt dwell on waffles and fudge famous or not he was far too occupied with thoughts of april and the slimy figure of jack leeper the boones were seated at a small table in the crowded diner the air was thick with bacon grease and strong coffee and the hot topic as theo realized not long after he sat down was the abduction of april finnemore to their right four uniformed policemen talked loudly about the possibility that leeper was close by to their left a table of grayhaired men spoke with great authority on several subjects but seemed particularly interested in the kidnapping as it was sometimes referred to the menu promoted the myth that gertrudes was indeed the home of worldfamous pecan waffles in silent protest against false advertising theo ordered scrambled eggs and sausage his father ordered waffles his mother ordered dry wheat toast as soon as the waitress walked away mrs boone looked theo squarely in the eyes and said okay lets have it theres something else to the story theo was constantly amazed at how easily his mother could do this he could tell only half of a story and she immediately looked for the other half he could offer up a little fib nothing serious maybe something just for fun and she instinctively pounced on it and ripped it to shreds he could duck a direct question and she would fire back with three more theo suspected she had acquired this skill after years as a divorce lawyer she often said that she never expected her clients to tell her the truth i agree said mr boone theo couldnt tell if he really agreed or whether he was just tagteaming with his wife which he often did mr boone was a real estate lawyer who never went to court and while he missed little he was usually a step or two behind mrs boone when it came time to grill theo about something april told me not to tell anyone theo said to which his mother responded quickly and april is in big trouble right now theo if you know something lets have it and now her eyes narrowed her eyebrows arched theo knew where this was headed and truthfully he knew it was better to level with his parents mrs finnemore wasnt at home when i talked to april last night theo said his head low his eyes darting left and right and she wasnt home the night before shes taking pills and shes acting crazy aprils been living by herself wheres her father mr boone asked hes off with his band hasnt been home in a week doesnt he have a job mrs boone asked he buys and sells antique furniture april says hell make a few bucks then disappear for a week or two with his band that poor girl mrs boone said are you going to tell the police theo asked both parents took long sips from their coffee cups they exchanged curious looks as they pondered this they eventually agreed that they would discuss it later at the office while theo was at school mrs finnemore was obviously lying to the police but the boones were reluctant to get in the middle of that they doubted if she knew anything about the abduction she seemed distressed enough she probably felt guilty for being away when her daughter was taken the food arrived and the waitress refilled the coffee cups theo was drinking milk the situation was very complicated and theo was relieved to have his parents involved and doing their share of the worrying anything else theo his father asked not that i can think of his mother said when you talked to her last night was she frightened yes she was really scared and also worried about her mother why didnt you tell us his father asked because she made me promise not to tell april has to deal with a lot and shes very private shes also embarrassed by her family and tries to protect them she was hoping her mother would show up at any minute i guess someone else did theo suddenly lost his appetite he shouldve done more he shouldve tried to protect april by telling his parents or perhaps a teacher at school someone would have listened to him he could have done something but april swore him to silence and she kept assuring him she was safe the house was locked plenty of lights were on and so forth during the drive home theo said from the rear seat im not sure i can go to school today i was waiting for that his father replied whats your reason this time his mother said well to start with i didnt get enough sleep last night weve been up since what four thirty so you want to go home and go to sleep his father replied i didnt say that but i doubt if i can stay awake at school i bet you can your mother and i are going to work and we have no choice but to stay awake theo almost blurted something about his fathers daily siesta a brief power nap at the desk with the door locked usually around pm everyone who worked at the law firm of boone amp boone knew that woods was upstairs shoes off feet on the desk phone on do not disturb snoring away for thirty minutes every afternoon you can tough it out his father added theos problem at this moment was his habit of trying to avoid school headaches coughs food poisoning pulled muscles stomach gastheo had tried them all and would try them again he didnt hate school in fact he usually enjoyed it once he got there he made good grades and enjoyed his friends theo though wanted to be at the courthouse watching trials and hearings listening to the lawyers and judges chatting with the policemen and the clerks even the janitors theo knew them all theres another reason i cant go to school he said though he knew this was a battle he would not win lets hear it his mother said okay theres a manhunt underway and i need to go help how often do we have a manhunt in strattenburg this is a big deal especially since its my close friend theyre looking for i need to help search for april she would expect me to plus theres no way i can concentrate at school a total waste of time ill think of nothing but april nice try his father said not bad his mother added look im serious i need to be on the streets im confused his father said though he really wasnt he often claimed to be confused when discussing things with theo youre too tired to go to school yet you have enough energy to lead a manhunt whatever theres no way i can go to school an hour later theo parked his bike outside the middle school and reluctantly went inside as the bell was ringing in the main lobby he was immediately met by three crying eighthgrade girls who wanted to know if he knew anything about april he said he knew nothing more than what was being reported on the morning news evidently everybody in town had watched the morning news the reports showed a school photo of april and a mug shot of jack leeper there was a strong suggestion that a kidnapping had taken place theo didnt understand this a kidnapping and hed checked the dictionary usually involved a demand for ransomcash to be paid for the release of the person seized the finnemores couldnt pay their monthly billshow were they supposed to find serious cash to free april and there was no word yet from the kidnapper usually as theo remembered from television the family gets word pretty soon that the bad guys have the child and would like a million bucks or so for a safe return another report from the morning news showed mrs finnemore crying in front of their home the police were tightlipped saying only that they were pursuing all leads a neighbor said his dog started barking around midnight always a bad sign as frantic as the reporters seemed to be that morning the truth was that they were finding very little to add to the story of a missing girl theos homeroom teacher was mr mount who also taught government after mr mount got the boys settled he called the roll all sixteen were present the conversation quickly got around to the disappearance of april and mr mount asked theo if hed heard anything nothing theo said and his classmates seemed disappointed theo was one of the few boys who talked to april most of the eighth graders boys and girls liked april but found her difficult to hang out with she was quiet dressed more like a boy than a girl had no interest in the latest fashions or the weekly teengossip magazines and as everyone knew came from a weird family the bell rang for first period and theo already exhausted dragged himself off to spanish chapter final bell rang at and by theo was on his bike speeding away from school darting through alleys and back streets and dodging downtown traffic he zipped across main street waved at a policeman standing near an intersection and pretended not to hear when the policeman yelled slow it down theo he cut through a small cemetery and turned onto park street his parents had been married for twentyfive years and for the past twenty they had worked together as partners in the small firm of boone amp boone located at park street in the heart of old strattenburg there had once been another partner ike boone theos uncle but ike had been forced to leave the firm when he got himself into some trouble now the firm had just two equal partnersmarcella boone on the first floor in a neat modern office where she handled mainly divorces and woods boone upstairs all alone in a large cluttered room with sagging bookshelves and stacks of files littering the floor and an everpresent cloud of fragrant pipe smoke rolling gently across the ceiling rounding out the firm there was elsa who answered the phone greeted the clients managed the office did some typing and kept an eye on judge the dog there was dorothy a real estate secretary who worked for mr boone and did work that theo considered horribly boring and there was vince the paralegal who worked on mrs boones cases judge a mutt who was theos dog the familys dog and the firms dog spent his days at the office sometimes creeping quietly from room to room keeping an eye on things oftentimes following a human to the kitchen where he expected food but mostly snoozing on a small square bed in the reception area where elsa talked to him whenever she typed the last member of the firm was theo who happily suspected that he was the only thirteenyearold in strattenburg with his own law office of course he was too young to be a real member of the firm but there were times when theo was valuable he fetched files for dorothy and vince he scanned lengthy documents looking for key words or phrases his computer skills were extraordinary and allowed him to research legal issues and dig up facts but his favorite chore by far was dashing off to the courthouse to file papers for the firm theo loved the courthouse and dreamed of the day when he would stand in the large stately courtroom on the second floor and defend his clients at pm on the dot theo parked his bike on the narrow front porch of boone amp boone and braced himself elsa greeted him every day with a fierce hug a painful pinch on the check then a quick inspection of whatever he was wearing he opened the door stepped inside and got himself properly greeted as always judge was waiting too he bounced from his bed and ran to see theo im so sorry about april elsa gushed she sounded as if she knew the girl personally which she did not but by now as with any tragedy everyone in strattenburg knew or claimed to know april and could say only great things about her any news theo asked rubbing judges head nothing ive listened to the radio all day no word no sign of anything how was school terrible all we did was talk about april that poor girl elsa was inspecting his shirt then her eyes moved down to his pants and for a split second theo froze every day she looked him over quickly and never hesitated to say something like does that shirt really match those pants or didnt you wear that shirt two days ago this irritated theo tremendously and he had complained to both parents but nothing came of his protests elsa was like a member of the family a second mother to theo and if she wanted to quiz him about anything she did so out of affection the rumor was that elsa spent all her money on clothes and she certainly gave that appearance apparently she approved of his attire today before she had the chance to comment theo kept the conversation going with is my mother in yes but she has a client mr boone is working this was usually the case theos mother when she wasnt in court spent most of her time with clients almost all of whom were women who wanted a divorce or needed a divorce or were in the process of getting a divorce or were suffering through the aftermath of a divorce it was difficult work but his mother was known as one of the top divorce lawyers in town theo was quite proud of this he was also proud of the fact that his mother encouraged every new client to seek professional counseling in an effort to save the marriage sadly though as hed already learned some marriages cannot be saved he bounced up the stairs with judge at his heels and barged into the spacious and wonderful office of woods boone attorney and counseloratlaw his dad was behind his desk at work pipe in one hand pen in the other with papers scattered everywhere well hello theo mr boone said with a warm smile a good day at school the same question five days a week terrible theo said i knew i shouldnt have gone a total waste and why is that come on dad my friend our classmate has been snatched by an escaped criminal who was sent to prison because hes a kidnapper its not like this happens every day around here we shouldve been out there on the streets helping with the manhunt but no we were stuck in school where all we did was talk about searching for april nonsense leave the manhunt to the professionals theo we have a fine police force in this city well they havent found her yet maybe they need some help help from whom theo cleared his throat and clenched his jaw he stared straight at his father and got ready to tell the truth hed been taught to confront the truth headon hold nothing back just blurt it all out and whatever followed would be far better than lying or concealing the truth he was about to sayhelp from us dad aprils friends ive organized a search party and were about to hit the streetswhen the phone rang his father grabbed it offered his usual gruff woods boone then began listening theo held his tongue after a few seconds his father covered the receiver and whispered this might take a while see you later theo said as he jumped to his feet and left he walked downstairs judge following close behind and made his way to the rear of boone amp boone to the small room he called his office he unloaded his backpack arranged his books and notebooks and gave every indication that he was about to plunge into his homework he was not the search party hed organized consisted of about twenty of his friends the plan was to hit the streets in five units of four bikes each they had cell phones and twoway radios woody had an ipad with google earth and gps apps everything would be coordinated with theo of course in charge they would comb certain areas of town searching for april and they would distribute flyers with her face in the center and the promise of one thousand dollars in reward money for information leading to her rescue they had passed the hat at school and collected almost two hundred dollars from students and teachers theo and his friends figured they could get the rest of the money from their parents in the event someone came forward with crucial information surely theo had argued the parents would cough up the money if necessary it was risky but there was so much at stake and so little time theo eased out the back door leaving judge alone and confused then sneaked around to the front and hopped on his bike chapter the search party came together a few minutes before pm in truman park the largest park of any kind in the city of strattenburg the gang met near the main gazebo a popular place in the heart of the park a place where politicians made speeches and bands played on long summer evenings and occasionally young couples got married there were eighteen in all fifteen boys and three girls all properly helmeted and eager to find and rescue april finnemore throughout the day at school the boys had argued and bickered about how a proper manhunt should be conducted none had ever taken part in such a search but this lack of experience was not mentioned or acknowledged instead several of them including theo spoke as if they knew precisely what to do another strong voice belonged to woody who because he owned the ipad felt as though more weight should be given to his ideas another leader was justin the best athlete in their class and therefore the one with the most selfconfidence there were skeptics in the eighth grade who believed that jack leeper had already fled the area with april why would he stay in a place where everyone was looking at his face on television the skeptics argued that any effort to find her was futile she was gone hidden in another state perhaps another country hopefully still alive but theo and the others were determined to do something anything maybe she was gone but maybe she wasnt no one knew but at least they were trying who knowsthey might get lucky late in the day the searchers finally reached an agreement among themselves they would concentrate their efforts in an old section known as delmont near stratten college in the northwest part of the town delmont was lower income with more renters than owners and popular with students and starving artists the search party figured any kidnapper worth his salt would stay away from the nicer neighborhoods he would avoid central strattenburg with its busy streets and sidewalks he would almost certainly choose an area where strangers came and went with greater frequency thus they had narrowed their search and from the moment the decision was made they were convinced that april was stashed away in a back room of some cheap rental duplex or perhaps gagged and bound and hidden above an old garage in delmont they split into three teams of six with a girl included a bit reluctantly to each unit ten minutes after they gathered in the park they wheeled into gibsons grocery on the edge of delmont woodys team took allen street justins edgecomb street and theo who had assumed the role of supreme commander though he didnt refer to himself in such a manner led his team two blocks over to trover avenue where they began tacking missing flyers on every utility pole they saw they stopped at a laundromat and handed flyers to the people washing their clothes they chatted with pedestrians on the sidewalks and told them to keep a sharp lookout they talked to old men rocking on porches and nice ladies pulling weeds from flower beds they pedaled slowly along trover taking in each house each duplex each apartment building and as this went on and on they began to realize that they were not accomplishing much if april were locked away inside one of the buildings how were they supposed to find her they could not peek in they could not knock on the door and expect leeper to answer it they could not yell at the windows and hope she answered theo began to realize that their time was better spent handing out flyers and talking about the reward money they finished trover avenue and moved a block north to whitworth street where they went doortodoor in a shopping center passing out flyers in a barbershop a cleaners a pizza carryout and a liquor store the warning on the door of the liquor store plainly forbade the entry of anyone under the age of twentyone but theo didnt hesitate he was there to help a friend not buy booze he marched inside alone handed flyers to the two idle clerks at the cash registers and walked out before they could protest they were leaving the shopping center when an urgent call came from woody the police had stopped them on allen street and the police were not happy theo and his team took off and a few minutes later arrived at the scene there were two city police cars and three uniformed officers theo realized immediately that he did not recognize any of the policemen what are you kids doing here the first one asked as theo approached his bronze nameplate identified him as bard lemme guess youre helping with the search bard said with a sneer theo shoved out his hand and said im theo boone he emphasized his last name in hopes that one of the officers might recognize it hed learned that most of the policemen knew most of the lawyers and maybe just maybe one of these guys would realize that theos parents were wellrespected attorneys but it didnt work there were so many lawyers in strattenburg yes sir were helping you guys search for april finnemore theo went on pleasantly flashing his braces with a wide smile at officer bard are you the leader of this gang bard snapped theo glanced at woody whod lost all confidence and appeared frightened as if he were about to be dragged away to jail and perhaps beaten i guess theo answered so who asked you boys and girls to join in the search well sir no one really asked us april is our friend and were worried theo was trying to find the right tone he wanted to be very respectful but at the same time he was convinced they were doing nothing wrong how sweet bard said grinning at the other two officers he was holding a flyer and he showed it to theo who printed these he asked theo wanted to say sir its really none of your business who printed the flyers but this would only make a tense situation much worse so he said we printed them at school today and this is april bard said pointing to the smiling face square in the middle of the flyer theo wanted to say no sir thats another girls face were using to make the search even more difficult by confusing everybody aprils face had been all over the local news surely bard recognized her theo said simply yes sir and who gave you kids permission to tack these flyers on public property no one you know its a violation of city code against the law you know this bard had been watching too many badcop shows on television and he was working much too hard to try to frighten the kids justin and his team made a silent entry into the fray they rolled to a stop behind the other bikers eighteen kids three policemen and several neighbors drifting over to check on things at this point theo shouldve played along and professed ignorance of the citys laws but he simply could not do so he said very respectfully no sir its not a violation of the city code to put flyers on poles used for telephones and electricity i checked the law online during school today it was immediately obvious that officer bard wasnt sure what to say next his bluff had been called he glanced at his two pals both of whom seemed to be amused and not the least bit supportive the kids were smirking at him it was bard against everyone theo pressed on the law clearly says that permits must be approved for posters and flyers dealing with politicians and people who are running for office but not for anything else these flyers are legal as long as they are taken down within ten days thats the law i dont like your attitude kid bard shot back puffing out his chest and actually putting a hand on his service revolver theo noticed the gun but wasnt worried about being shot bard was trying to play the role of a tough cop and he was not doing a very good job being the only child of two lawyers theo had already developed a healthy suspicion of those people who thought they had more power than others including policemen he had been taught to respect all adults especially those with authority but at the same time his parents had instilled in him a desire to always look for the truth when a personadult teenager childwas not being honest then it was wrong to go along with their fraud or lie as everyone looked at theo and waited on his response he swallowed hard and said well sir theres nothing wrong with my attitude and even if i had a bad attitude its not against the law bard yanked a pen and a notepad from his pocket and said whats your name theo thought i gave you my name three minutes ago but he said theodore boone bard scribbled this down in a flurry as if whatever he was writing would one day carry great weight in a court of law everyone waited finally one of the other officers took a few steps toward bard and said is your dad woods boone his nameplate identified him as sneed finally theo thought yes sir and your mothers a lawyer too right officer sneed asked yes sir bards shoulders slumped a few inches as he stopped scribbling on his pad he looked puzzled as if he was thinking great this kid knows the law and i dont plus hes got two parents wholl probably sue me if i do something wrong sneed tried to help him by asking a pointless question you kids live around here darren slowly raised his hand and said i live a few blocks away over on emmitt street the situation was sort of a standoff with neither side sure what to do next sibley taylor got off her bike and walked to a spot next to theo she smiled at bard and sneed and said i dont understand why cant we work together here april is our friend and were very worried the police are looking for her were looking for her were not doing anything wrong whats the big deal bard and sneed could think of no quick response to these simple questions with obvious answers in every class theres always the kid who speaks before he thinks or says what the others are thinking but are afraid to say in this search party that kid was aaron helleberg who spoke english german and spanish and got himself in trouble in all three aaron blurted shouldnt you guys be looking for april instead of harassing us officer bard sucked in his gut as if hed been kicked there and appeared ready to start shooting when sneed jumped in okay heres the deal you can hand out the flyers but you cant tack them onto city propertyutility poles busstop benches things like that its almost five oclock i want you off the streets at six fair enough he was glaring at theo when he finished theo shrugged and said fair enough but it wasnt fair at all they could tack the posters onto utility poles all day long but not city benches the police did not have the authority to change the citys laws nor did they have the right to order the kids off the streets by pm however at that moment a compromise was needed and sneeds deal was not that bad the search would continue and the police could say that they kept the kids in line solving a dispute often requires each side to back down a little something else theo had learned from his parents the search party biked back to truman park where it regrouped four of the kids had other things to do and left twenty minutes after they last saw bard and sneed theo and his gang moved into a neighborhood known as maury hill in the southeast part of the city as far away from delmont as possible they passed out dozens of flyers inspected a few empty buildings chatted with curious neighbors and quit promptly at pm chapter t he boone family dinner schedule was as predictable as a clock on the wall on mondays they ate at robilios an old italian restaurant downtown not far from the office on tuesdays they ate soup and sandwiches at a homeless shelter where they volunteered on wednesdays mr boone picked up carryout chinese from dragon lady and they ate on folding trays as they watched television on thursdays mrs boone picked up a roasted chicken at a turkish deli and they ate it with hummus and pita bread on fridays they ate fish at maloufs a popular restaurant owned by an old lebanese couple who yelled at each other constantly on saturdays each of the three boones took turns choosing what and where to eat theo usually preferred pizza and a movie on sundays mrs boone finally did her own cooking which was theos least favorite meal of the week though he was too smart to say so marcella didnt like to cook she worked hard and spent long hours at the office and simply did not enjoy rushing home and facing more work in the kitchen besides there were plenty of good ethnic restaurants and delicatessens in strattenburg and it made much more sense to let real chefs do the cooking at least in the opinion of mrs marcella boone theo didnt mind nor did his father when she did cook she expected her husband and her son to clean up afterward and both men preferred to avoid the dishwashing dinner was always at pm on the dot another clear sign of organized people who hurried through each day with one eye on the clock theo placed his paper plate of chicken chow mein and sweetandsour shrimp on his tv tray and settled on the sofa he then lowered a smaller plate onto the floor where judge was waiting with great anticipation judge loved chinese food and expected to eat in the den with the humans dog food insulted him after a couple of bites mr boone asked so theo any news on april no sir just a lot of gossip at school that poor child mrs boone said im sure everyone at school was worried thats all we talked about a total waste i should stay home tomorrow and help with the search thats a pretty lame effort mr boone said did you guys talk to the police about mrs finnemore and explain to them that shes lying about being home with april that she wasnt home monday or tuesday night that shes a weirdo whos taking pills and neglecting her daughter silence the room was quiet for a few seconds then mrs boone said no theo we did not we discussed it and decided to wait but why his father said because it wont help the police find april we plan to wait for a day or two its still being discussed youre not eating theo his mother said and it was true he had no appetite the food seemed to stop halfway down his esophagus where a dull throbbing pain blocked everything im not hungry he said later halfway through a rerun of law amp order a local newsbreak blasted out the latest the search for april finnemore continued with the police still tightlipped about it they flashed a photo of april then one of the missing posters theo and his gang had distributed immediately after this there was the same ominous mug shot of jack leeper looking like a serial killer the reporter gushed the police are investigating the possibility that jack leeper after his escape from prison in california returned to strattenburg to see his pen pal april finnemore the police are investigating a lot of things theo thought to himself that doesnt mean theyre all true he had thought about leeper all day and he was certain that april would never open the door for such a creep he had told himself over and over that the kidnapping theory could be nothing but one big coincidence leeper escaped from prison returned to strattenburg because he lived there many years ago and got himself caught on videotape at a convenience store at the exact same time that april decided to run away theo knew april well but he also realized there were many things about her he didnt know nor did he want to was it possible that she would run away without a word to him slowly he had begun to believe the answer was yes he was on the sofa under a quilt with judge wedged close to his chest and at some point both fell asleep theo had been awake since four thirty that morning and was sleep deprived physically and emotionally he was exhausted chapter the eastern boundary of the city of strattenburg was formed by a bend in the yancey river an old bridge one used by both cars and trains crossed over into the next county the bridge was not used much because there was little reason to travel into the next county all of strattenburg lay west of the river and when leaving the city almost all traffic moved in that direction in decades past the yancey had been a fairly important route for timber and crops and in strattenburgs early years the busy area under the bridge was notorious for saloons and illegal gambling halls and places for all sorts of bad behavior when the river traffic declined most of these places closed and the bad folks went elsewhere however enough stayed behind to ensure that the neighborhood would maintain its low reputation under the bridge became simply the bridge a part of town that all decent people avoided it was a dark place almost hidden in the daytime by the shadows of a long bluff with few streetlights at night and little traffic there were bars and rough places where one went only to find trouble the homes were small shacks built on stilts to protect them from high water the people who lived there were sometimes called river rats a nickname they obviously found insulting when they worked they fished the yancey and sold their catch to a cannery that produced cat and dog food but they didnt work much they were an idle people living off the river living off welfare feuding with each other over trivial matters and in general earning their reputation as quicktempered deadbeats early thursday morning the manhunt arrived at the bridge a river rat named buster shell spent most of wednesday evening in his favorite bar drinking his favorite cheap beer and playing nickelanddime poker when his money was gone he had no choice but to leave and head home to his irritable wife and his three dirty children as he walked through the narrow unpaved streets he bumped into a man who was going somewhere in a hurry they exchanged a couple of harsh words as was the custom under the bridge but the other man showed no interest in a fistfight something buster was certainly ready for as buster resumed his walk he stopped dead cold hed seen that face before hed seen it only hours earlier it was the face of that guy the cops were searching for whats his name buster half drunk or worse snapped his fingers in the middle of the street as he racked his brain trying to remember leeper he finally said jack leeper by now most of strattenburg knew that a reward of five thousand dollars was being offered by the police for any information leading to the arrest of jack leeper buster could almost smell the money he looked around but the man was long gone however leeperand there was no doubt in busters mind that the man was indeed jack leeperwas now somewhere under the bridge he was in busters part of town a place the police preferred to avoid a place where the river rats made their own rules within minutes buster had rounded up a small wellarmed posse half a dozen men about as drunk as he was word was out the rumor that the escaped convict was in the vicinity roared through the neighborhood the river people fought constantly among themselves but when threatened from the outside they quickly circled the wagons with buster giving orders that no one followed the search for leeper sputtered from the start there was considerable conflict in terms of strategy and since every man carried a loaded gun the disagreements were serious with time though they agreed that the one main street that led up the bluff and into town should be guarded when that was done leepers only chance of escape was either by stealing a boat or going for a swim in the yancey river hours passed buster and his men went doortodoor carefully searching under the houses behind the shanties inside the small stores and shops through the thickets and underbrush the search party grew and grew and buster began to worry about how they might split the reward money with so many people now involved how could he keep most of the money it would be difficult the payment of five thousand dollars to a bunch of river rats would ignite a small war under the bridge the first hint of sunlight peeked through the clouds far to the east the search was running out of gas busters recruits were tired and losing their enthusiasm miss ethel barber was eightyfive years old and had lived alone since her husband died years earlier she was one of the few residents under the bridge who was missing the excitement when she awoke at am and went to make coffee she heard a faint noise coming from the rear door of her fourroom shanty she kept a pistol in a drawer under the toaster she grabbed it then flipped on a light switch like buster she came facetoface with the man shed seen on the local news he was in the process of removing a screen from the small window on the door obviously trying to break in when miss ethel raised her gun as if to shoot through the window jack leepers jaw dropped his eyes widened in horror and he uttered some gasp of shock that she couldnt quite make out she had lost most of her hearing anyway leeper then ducked quickly and scrambled away miss ethel grabbed her phone and called within ten minutes a police helicopter was hovering near the bridge and the swat team was moving silently through the streets buster shell was arrested for public drunkenness unlawful possession of a firearm and resisting arrest he was handcuffed and taken to the city jail his dreams of reward money dashed forever they soon found leeper in an overgrown ditch near the street that led to and from the bridge he had circled back and was evidently trying to leave the area why he went there in the first place would remain a mystery he was spotted by the helicopter crew the swat team was directed to his hiding place and within minutes the street was filled with police cars armed officers of all varieties sharpshooters bloodhounds even an ambulance the helicopter got lower and lower no one wanted to miss the fun there was a van from the television news channel filming live coverage theo was watching he was up early because hed been up most of the night tossing and flipping in his bed worrying about april he sat at the kitchen table toying with a bowl of cereal watching the small screen on the counter with his parents when the camera offered a closeup of the swat team dragging someone from the ditch theo dropped his spoon picked up the remote and increased the volume the sight of jack leeper was frightening his clothes were torn and covered with mud he had not shaved in days his thick black hair was wild and shooting in all directions he appeared angry and defiant yapping at the police and even spitting at the camera as he neared the street and was surrounded by even more officers a reporter yelled hey leeper wheres april finnemore to which leeper offered a nasty grin and yelled back youll never find her is she alive youll never find her oh my god mrs boone said theos heart froze and he couldnt breathe he watched as leeper was shoved into the rear of a police van and driven away the reporter was talking to the camera but theo didnt hear his words he gently placed his head in his hands and began to cry chapter first period was spanish theos second favorite class just behind government with mr mount spanish was taught by madame monique a young pretty exotic lady from cameroon in west africa spanish was just one of many languages she spoke normally the sixteen boys in theos section were easy to motivate and enjoyed the class today though the entire school was in a daze yesterday the halls and classrooms were filled with nervous chatter as the rumors spread about aprils disappearance was she kidnapped did she run away whats up with her weird mother wheres her father these questions and more were tossed up for debate and kicked around with great enthusiasm throughout the day now though with the capture of jack leeper and the unforgettable words he uttered about april the students and teachers were in a state of fear and disbelief madame monique understood the situation she taught april too in a girls section during fourth period she tried to engage the boys in a halfhearted discussion about mexican food but they were too distracted during second period the entire eighth grade was called into an assembly in the auditorium five sections of girls five of boys along with all the teachers the middle school was in its third year of an experiment which separated the genders during classroom instruction but not during the rest of the days activities so far the experiment was getting favorable reviews but because they were separated for most of the day when they came together at lunch morning break physical education or assembly there was a bit more electricity in the air and it took a few minutes to calm things not today though they were subdued there was none of the usual posturing flirting gazing or nervous chatter they took their seats quietly somberly the principal mrs gladwell spent some time trying to convince them that april was probably all right that the police were confident she would be found soon and returned to school her voice was comforting her words were reassuring and the eighth graders were ready to believe any good news then a noisethe unmistakable thumping of a lowflying helicopterpassed over the school and all thoughts immediately returned to the frantic search for their classmate a few of the girls could be seen rubbing their eyes later after lunch as theo and his friends were in the middle of a halfhearted game of frisbee football another helicopter buzzed over the school obviously going somewhere in a hurry from its markings it appeared to be from some branch of law enforcement the game stopped the boys stared upward until the chopper was gone the bell rang ending lunch and the boys quietly returned to class throughout the school day there were times when theo and his friends were almost able to forget about april if only for a moment and whenever these moments occurred and they were indeed rare another helicopter could be heard somewhere over strattenburgbuzzing thumping watchinglike some giant insect ready to attack the entire city was on edge as if waiting for horrible news in the cafes and shops and offices downtown the employees and customers chatted in hushed tones and repeated whatever rumors theyd heard in the past thirty minutes in the courthouse always a rich source of gossip the clerks and lawyers huddled around coffeepots and watercoolers and exchanged the latest the local television stations offered live reports on the half hour these breathless updates usually offered nothing new just a reporter somewhere near the river saying pretty much what he or she had said earlier at strattenburg middle school the eighth graders quietly went through their daily schedules most of them anxious to get home jack leeper now wearing an orange jumpsuit with city jail stenciled in black letters across the front and back was led to an interrogation room in the basement of the strattenburg police department in the center of the room there was a small table and a folding chair for the suspect across the table sat two detectives slater and capshaw the uniformed officers escorting leeper removed the handcuffs and ankle chains then retreated to their positions by the door they remained in the room for protection though they were not really needed detectives slater and capshaw could certainly take care of themselves have a seat mr leeper detective slater said waving at the empty folding chair leeper slowly sat down he had showered but not shaved and still looked like some deranged cult leader whod just spent a month or so in the woods im detective slater and this is my partner detective capshaw a real pleasure to meet you boys leeper said with a snarl oh the pleasure is ours slater said with equal sarcasm a real honor capshaw said one of the few times he would speak slater was a veteran detective the highest ranking and the best in strattenburg he was wiry with a slick shaved head and he wore nothing but black suits with black ties the city saw very little in the way of violent crime but when they did detective slater was there to solve it and bring the felon to justice his sidekick capshaw was the observer the note taker the nicer of the two when they found it necessary to play good copbad cop wed like to ask you some questions slater said you wanna talk maybe capshaw whipped out a sheet of paper and handed it to slater who said well mr leeper as you well know from your long career as a professional thug you must first be advised of your rights you do remember this dont you leeper glared at slater as if he might reach across the table and grab his throat but slater was not the least bit worried youve heard of the miranda rights havent you mr leeper slater continued yep of course you have im sure youve been in many of these rooms over the years slater said with a nasty grin leeper was not grinning capshaw was already taking notes slater continued first of all youre not required to talk to us period understand leeper shook his head yes but if you do talk to us then anything you say can be used against you in court got it yep you have the right to a lawyer to legal advice understand yep and if you cant afford one which im sure you cannot then the state will provide one for you are you with me yep slater slid the sheet of paper close to leeper and said if you sign here then you agree that ive explained your rights and that you are voluntarily waiving them he placed a pen on top of the paper leeper took his time read the words fiddled with the pen then finally signed his name can i have some coffee he asked cream and sugar slater asked no just black slater nodded at one of the uniformed officers who left the room now we have some questions for you slater said are you ready to talk maybe two weeks ago you were in prison in california serving a life sentence for kidnapping you escaped through a tunnel with six others and now youre here in strattenburg you got a question yes mr leeper i have a question why did you come to strattenburg i had to go somewhere couldnt just hang around outside the prison know what i mean i suppose you lived here once correct when i was a kid sixth grade i think went to the middle school for a year then we moved off and you have relatives in the area some distant kin one of those distant relatives is imelda may underwood whose mother had a third cousin named ruby dell butts whose father was franklin butts better known out in masseys mill as logchain butts and logchain had a halfbrother named winstead leeper winky for short and i believe he was your father died about ten years ago leeper absorbed all this and finally said winky leeper was my father yes so somewhere in the midst of all this divorcing and remarrying you came to be a tenth or eleventh cousin of imelda may underwood who married a man named thomas finnemore and now goes by the name of may finnemore mother of young april this sound right to you mr leeper i never had any use for my family well im sure theyre real proud of you too the door opened and the officer placed a paper cup of steaming black coffee on the table in front of leeper it appeared to be too hot to drink so leeper just stared at it slater paused for a second then pressed on we have copies of five letters april wrote to you in prison sweet kid stuffshe felt sorry for you and wanted to be pen pals did you write her back yep how often i dont know several times i guess did you come back to strattenburg to see april leeper finally picked up the cup and took a sip of coffee slowly he said im not sure i want to answer that question for the first time detective slater seemed to become irritated why are you afraid of that question mr leeper i dont have to answer your question says so right there on your little piece of paper i can walk out right now i know the rules did you come here to see april leeper took another sip and for a long time nothing was said the four officers stared at him he stared at the paper cup finally he said look heres the situation you want something i want something you want the girl i want a deal what kind of a deal leeper slater shot back just a moment ago it was mr leeper now just leeper do i frustrate you detective if so im real sorry heres what i have in mind i know im going back to prison but im really tired of california the prisons are brutalovercrowded lots of gangs violence rotten foodyou know what i mean detective slater slater had never been inside a prison but to move things along he said sure i want to do my time here where the slammers are a bit nicer i know because ive had a good look at them wheres the girl leeper slater said if you kidnapped her youre looking at another life sentence if shes dead youre looking at capital murder and death row why would i harm my little cousin where is she leeper another long sip of coffee then leeper crossed his arms over his chest and grinned at detective slater seconds ticked away youre playing games leeper detective capshaw said maybe maybe not is there any reward money on the table not for you slater said why not you give me some money ill take you to the girl it doesnt work that way fifty thousand bucks and you can have her what will you do with fifty thousand bucks leeper slater asked youre in prison for the rest of your life oh money goes a long way in prison you get me the money and you arrange things so i can serve my time here and we got a deal youre dumber than i thought slater said frustrated capshaw added quickly and we thought you were pretty dumb before we got started with this conversation come on boys that gets you nowhere we got a deal no deal leeper slater said thats too bad no deal but ill make a promise if that girl is harmed in any way ill hound you to your grave leeper laughed loudly then said i love it when the cops start making threats its over boys i aint talking no more wheres the girl leeper capshaw asked leeper just grinned and shook his head chapter theo preferred not to stay at school after classes and watch the girls play soccer he himself did not play soccer not that he had the choice an asthma condition kept him away from strenuous activities but even without the asthma he doubted he would be playing soccer he had tried it as a sixyearold before the asthma and never got the hang of it when he was nine while playing baseball he collapsed at third base after hitting a triple and that ended his short career in team sports he took up golf mr mount though loved soccer had even played in college and was offering extra credit to students who hung around for the game plus there was an unwritten rule at strattenburg middle school that the girls cheered for the boys and vice versa any other time theo would have happily watched from the bleachers taking casual notice of the game but really sizing up the twentytwo girls on the field and those on the bench as well but not today he wanted to be elsewhere on his bike handing out the missing flyers doing something to aid in the search for april it was a terrible day for a game of any kind the strattenburg kids were distracted the players and their fans lacked energy even the opposing team from elksburg forty miles away seemed subdued when another helicopter flew over ten minutes into the game every girl on the field paused for a second and looked up in apprehension as expected mr mount gradually made his way over to a group of women the worst kept secret at school was that mr mount had his eye on miss highlander a stunning seventhgrade math teacher just two years out of college every boy in the seventh and eighth grades had a desperate secret crush on miss highlander and evidently mr mount had some interest as well he was in his midthirties single by far the coolest male teacher in the school and the sixteen boys in his homeroom were aggressively pushing him to pursue miss highlander when mr mount began to make his move so did theo he assumed correctly that mr mounts attention would soon be focused elsewhere it was the perfect time for a quiet exit theo and three others drifted from the soccer field and were soon on their bikes racing away from the school their search party was much smaller and this was by design yesterdays had too many kids with too many opinions and too much activity that might be noticed by cops such as officer bard plus there had been fewer volunteers during the school day as theo and woody got things organized the sense of urgency that theo felt was not shared by many of his classmates they were concerned all right but many of them thought that searches by kids on bikes were a waste of time the police had swat teams helicopters dogs and no shortage of manpower if they couldnt find april the search was hopeless theo along with woody aaron and chase returned to the delmont neighborhood and roamed the streets for a few minutes to make sure the police were elsewhere with no cops in sight they quickly began passing out missing flyers and tacking them to utility poles they inspected a few empty buildings looked behind some rundown apartments picked their way through an overgrown drainage ditch checked under two bridges and were making real progress when woodys older brother called his cell phone woody froze listened intently then reported to the gang theyve found something down by the river what not sure but my brother is monitoring his police scanner said the thing has gone crazy with chatter all cops are headed down there without hesitation theo said lets go they sped away out of delmont past stratten college into downtown and as they approached the east end of main street they saw police cars and dozens of officers milling about the street was blocked the area under the bridge was sealed off the air was heavy with tension and noisetwo helicopters were hovering over the river the downtown merchants and their customers stood on the sidewalks gawking into the distance waiting for something to happen traffic was being diverted away from the bridge and the river as the boys watched another police car crept up beside them the driver rolled down his window then snarled what are you boys doing here it was officer bard again were just riding our bikes theo said its not against the law dont get smart with me boone if i see you boys anywhere near the river i swear ill take you in theo thought of several quick retorts all of which would lead to more trouble so he gritted his teeth and politely said yes sir bard smiled smugly then drove away toward the bridge follow me woody said as they raced off woody lived in a section of town called east bluff near the river on a gentle rise that eventually gave way to the lowlands around the water it was a notorious place full of narrow streets dark alleys creeks and deadend roads the neighborhood was generally safe but it produced more than its share of colorful stories of strange events woodys father was a noted stonemason whod lived his entire life in east bluff it was a large clannish family with lots of aunts uncles and cousins all living close to each other ten minutes after their encounter with officer bard the boys were zipping through east bluff along a narrow dirt trail that zigzagged high above and beside the river woody was pedaling like a madman and making it difficult for the others to keep up this was his turf hed been riding his bike through these trails since he was six they crossed a gravel road plunged down a steep hill shot up the other side and got serious air before landing back on the trail theo aaron and chase were terrified but too excited to slow down and of course they were determined to keep up with woody who was prone to talk trash at any moment they finally slid to a stop at a small overlook a grassy area where the river could be seen below through some trees follow me woody said and they left their bikes behind clutching a vine they scampered down the side of a cliff to a rocky landing and there below was the yancey river their view was unobstructed a mile or two away to the north were the rows of small whitewashed houses where the river rats lived and beyond them was the bridge crawling with police cars on the other side of the river close to the bridge an ambulance was just arriving on the scene policemen were in boats several were in full scuba gear the situation looked tense almost frantic as sirens wailed policemen darted about and the helicopters hovered low watching everything something had been found the boys sat on the cliff for a long time and said little the search or rescue or removal or whatever it was called was proceeding slowly each of them had the same thoughtthat they were watching an actual crime scene in which the victim was their friend april finnemore and that shed been harmed in some terrible way and left at the edge of the river she was apparently dead since there was no urgency in getting her out of the water and to a hospital more police cars arrived more chaos finally chase said to no one in particular do you think its april to which woody abruptly responded who else would it be its not every day that a dead body floats into town you dont know who it is or what it is aaron said he usually found some way to disagree with woody who had quick opinions about almost everything theos cell phone buzzed in his pocket he glanced at itmrs boone on her office line its my mom he said nervously then answered his phone hi mom on the other end his mother said theo where are you just left the soccer game he said wincing at his friends it wasnt a complete fib but it was also pretty far from the truth well it appears as though the police have found a body in the river on the other side near the bridge she said one of the helicopters red and yellow with channel painted boldly on the sides was obviously sending a live feed back to the station and the entire town was probably watching has it been identified theo asked no not yet but it cant be good news theo this is awful when are you coming to the office ill be there in twenty minutes okay theo please be careful the ambulance was moving away from the river then onto the bridge where a line of police cars formed an escort the procession picked up speed over the river with the helicopters trailing behind lets go theo said and the boys slowly climbed up the cliff and left on their bikes boone amp boone had a large law library on its first floor near the front close to where elsa worked keeping an eye on everything the library was theos favorite room in the building he loved its rows of thick important books its large leather chairs and its long mahogany conference table it was used for all sorts of big meetingsdepositions settlement talks and for mrs boone pretrial preparation she occasionally went to trial in divorce cases mr boone did not he was a real estate lawyer who seldom left his upstairs office he did though need the library from time to time to close real estate deals they were waiting for theo in the library a large flatscreen television was on with the local news and his parents and elsa were watching his mother hugged him when he walked in then elsa hugged him too he took a seat near the television his mother on one side elsa on the other both patting his knees as if he had just been rescued from near death the news report was all about the discovery of a body and its transport to the city morgue where authorities were now doing all sorts of important stuff the reporter wasnt sure what was happening in the morgue and she was unable to find a witness willing to talk so she just prattled on the way they normally do theo wanted to tell everyone that hed had a birdseye view down at the river but such a statement would make things complicated the reporter said the police were working with inspectors from the state crime lab and hoped to know more within a few hours that poor girl elsa said and not for the first time why do you say that theo asked i beg your pardon you dont know its a girl you dont know its april we dont know anything right the adults glanced at each other both women continued patting theos knees theos right mr boone said but only to comfort his son they flashed a picture of jack leeper for the one hundredth time and gave his background when it became apparent there was nothing new at the moment the story grew old mr boone drifted away mrs boone had a client waiting in the lobby elsa needed to answer the phone theo eventually made his way to his office at the rear of the building judge followed and theo spent a lot of time rubbing his dogs head and talking to him it made both of them feel better theo put his feet on his desk and looked around his small office he focused on the wall where his favorite sketch always made him smile it was an elaborate pencil drawing of young theodore boone attorney in court wearing a suit and tie with a gavel flying by his head and the jurors roaring with laughter the caption screamed overruled at the bottom righthand corner the artist had scribbled her name april finnemore the drawing had been a gift for theos birthday the year before was her career over before it started was april dead a sweet thirteenyearold kid brutally abducted and killed because there was no one to take care of her theos hands were shaking and his mouth was dry he closed and locked his door then walked to the drawing and gently touched her name his eyes were moist then he began crying he dropped to the floor and cried for a long time judge settled in next to him watching him sadly chapter an hour passed and darkness settled in theo sat at his small desk a card table equipped with lawyerly thingsa daily planner a small digital clock a fake fountain pen set his own nameplate carved in wood before him was an open algebra textbook hed been staring at it for a long time unable to read the words or turn the pages his notebook was open too and the page was blank he could think of nothing but april and the horror of watching from a distance as the police fished her body from the backwaters of the yancey river he had not actually seen a body but hed seen the police and scuba divers surround something and work frantically to remove it obviously it was a body a dead person why else would the police be there doing what they were doing there had been no other missing persons in strattenburg in the past week or the past year for that matter the list had only one name on it and theo was convinced that april was dead abducted and murdered and thrown in the water by jack leeper theo couldnt wait for leepers trial he hoped it would happen soon just a few blocks away in the county courthouse he would watch every moment of it even if he had to skip school maybe he would be called as a witness he wasnt sure what he would say on the witness stand but he would say whatever it took to nail leeper to get him convicted and sent away forever it would be a great momenttheo being called as a witness walking into the packed courtroom placing his hand on the bible swearing to tell the truth taking his seat in the witness box smiling up at judge henry gantry glancing confidently at the curious faces of the jurors taking in the large audience then glaring at the hideous face of jack leeper staring him down in open court fearless the more theo thought about this scene the more he liked it there was a good chance theo was the last person to talk to april before she was abducted he could testify that she was frightened and surprisingly alone entry that would be the issue how did the attacker get into the house perhaps only theo knew that she had locked all the doors and windows and even jammed chairs under doorknobs because she was so frightened so since there were no signs of a breakin she knew the identity of her abductor she knew jack leeper somehow hed been able to persuade her to open the door as theo replayed his last conversation with april he became convinced that he would indeed be called by the prosecution as a witness for a few moments he visualized himself in the courtroom then he suddenly forgot about it the shock of the tragedy returned and he realized his eyes were moist again his throat was tight and his stomach ached and theo needed to be around another human elsa was gone for the day as were dorothy and vince his mother had a client in her office with the door locked his father was upstairs pushing paper around his desk and trying to finish some big deal theo stood stepped over judge and looked at the sketch april had given him again he touched her name they met in prekindergarten though theo couldnt remember exactly when or how fouryearolds dont actually meet and introduce themselves they just sort of show up at school and get to know each other april was in his class mrs sansing was the teacher in the first and second grades april was in another section and theo hardly saw her by the third grade the natural forces of aging had kicked in and the boys wanted nothing to do with the girls and vice versa theo vaguely recalled that april moved away for a year or two he forgot about her as did most of the kids in his grade but he remembered the day she returned he was sitting in mr hancocks sixthgrade class during the second week of school when the door opened and april walked in she was escorted by an assistant principal who introduced her and explained that her family had just moved back to strattenburg she seemed embarrassed by the attention and when she sat at a desk next to theo she glanced at him and smiled and said hi theo he smiled but was unable to respond most of the class remembered her and though she was quiet almost shy she had no trouble resuming old friendships with the girls she wasnt popular because she didnt try to be she wasnt unpopular because she was genuinely nice and thoughtful and acted more mature than most of her classmates she was odd enough to keep the others guessing she dressed more like a boy and wore her hair very short she didnt like sports or television or the internet instead she painted and studied art and talked of living in paris or santa fe where she would do nothing but paint she loved contemporary art that baffled her classmates and teachers alike soon there were rumors about her weird family of siblings named after the months of a wacky mother who peddled goat cheese and of an absentee father throughout the sixth grade and into the seventh april became more withdrawn and moodier she said very little in class and missed more school days than any other student as the hormones kicked in and the gender walls came down it slowly became cool for a boy to have a girlfriend the cuter and more popular girls were chased and caught but not april she showed no interest in boys and didnt have a clue when it came to flirting she was aloof often lost in her own world theo liked her he had for a long time but was too shy and too selfconscious to make a move he wasnt sure how to make a move and april seemed unapproachable it happened in gym class on a cold snowy afternoon in late february two sections of seventh graders had just begun a onehour torture session under the command of mr bart tyler a young hotshot physical education teacher who fancied himself as a marine drill instructor the students both boys and girls had just completed a set of brutal wind sprints when theo suddenly could not catch his breath he ran for his backpack in a corner pulled out his inhaler and took several puffs of medication this happened occasionally and though his classmates understood theo was always embarrassed he was actually exempt from gym but he insisted on participating mr tyler showed the right amount of concern and led theo to a spot in the bleachers he was humiliated as mr tyler walked away and began blowing his whistle and yelling april finnemore left the crowd and took a seat next to theo very close are you all right she asked im fine he answered as he began to think that maybe an asthma attack wasnt so bad after all she placed a hand on his knee and looked at him with tremendous concern a loud voice yelled hey april what are you doing it was mr tyler she coolly turned and said im taking a break oh really i dont recall approving a break get back in line to which she repeated icily i said im taking a break mr tyler paused for a second then managed to say and why is that because i have an asthma condition just like theo at that point no one knew if april was telling the truth but no one especially mr tyler seemed willing to push harder all right all right he said and then blew his whistle at the rest of the kids for the first time in his young life theo was thrilled to have asthma for the remainder of the period theo and april sat kneetoknee in the bleachers watching the others sweat and groan giggling at the lessthanathletic ones mocking mr tyler gossiping about the classmates they were not so fond of and whispering about life in general that night they facebooked for the first time a sudden knock on the door startled theo followed by his fathers voice theo open up theo quickly stepped to the door unlocked and opened it are you okay mr boone asked sure dad look there are a couple of policemen here and they would like to talk to you theo was too confused to respond his father continued im not sure what they want probably just more background on april lets talk to them in the library both your mother and i will be with you uh okay they met in the library detectives slater and capshaw were standing and chatting gravely with mrs boone when theo walked in introductions were made seats were taken theo was secured with a parentlawyer on each side the detectives were directly across the table as usual slater did the talking and capshaw took the notes slater began sorry to barge in like this but you may have heard that a body was pulled from the river this afternoon all three boones nodded theo was not about to admit that hed watched the police from a cliff across the river he was not about to say any more than necessary slater went on the crime lab people are at work right now trying to identify the body frankly it is not easy because the body is well shall we say somewhat decomposed the knot in theos chest grew tighter his throat ached and he told himself not to start crying april decomposed he just wanted to go home go to his room lock his door lie on his bed stare at the ceiling then go into a coma and wake up in a year weve talked to her mother slater said softly with great patience and compassion and she tells us that you were aprils best friend you guys talked all the time hung out a lot that true theo shook his head but could not speak slater glanced at capshaw who returned the glance without stopping his pen what we need theo is any information about what april might have been wearing when she disappeared slater said capshaw added the body at the crime lab has the remains of some clothing on it it could help with identification as soon as capshaw paused slater moved in weve made an inventory of her clothing with her mothers help she said that perhaps youd given her an item or two a baseball jacket of some sort theo swallowed hard and tried to speak clearly yes sir last year i gave april a twins baseball jacket and a twins cap capshaw wrote even faster slater said can you describe this jacket theo shrugged and said sure it was dark blue with red trim minnesota colors with the word twins across the back in redandwhite lettering leather cloth cotton synthetic i dont know synthetic maybe i think the lining on the inside was cotton but im not sure the two detectives exchanged ominous looks can i ask why you gave it to her slater said sure i won it in an online contest at the twins website and since i already had two or three twins jackets i gave it to april it was a medium kids size too small for me she a baseball fan capshaw asked not really she doesnt like sports the gift was sort of a joke did she wear it often i never saw her wear it i dont think she wore the cap either why the twins capshaw asked is that really important mrs boone shot across the table capshaw flinched as though hed been slapped no sorry where is this going mr boone demanded both detectives exhaled in unison then took another breath slater said we have not found such a jacket in aprils closet or anywhere in her room or the house for that matter i guess we can assume she was wearing it when she left the temperature was around sixty degrees so she probably grabbed the nearest jacket and the clothing on the body mrs boone asked both detectives squirmed in unison then glanced at each other slater said we really cant say at this time mrs boone they may have been prohibited from saying anything but their body language was not difficult to read the jacket theo had just described matched whatever theyd found on the body at least in theos opinion his parents nodded as if they understood completely but theo did not he had a dozen questions for the police but didnt have the energy to start firing away what about dental records mr boone asked both detectives frowned and shook their heads not possible slater said the answer provoked all manner of horrible images the body was so mangled and damaged that the jaws were missing mrs boone jumped in quickly with what about dna testing in the works slater said but itll take at least three days capshaw slowly closed his notepad and put his pen in a pocket slater glanced at his watch the detectives were suddenly ready to leave they had the information they were after and if they stayed longer there might be more questions about the investigation from the boone family questions they did not want to answer they thanked theo expressed their concerns about his friend and said good night to mr and mrs boone theo stayed in his seat at the table staring blankly at the wall his thoughts a jumbled mess of fear sadness and disbelief chapter chase whipples mother was also a lawyer his father sold computers and had installed the system at the boone law firm the families were good friends and at some point during the afternoon the mothers decided that the boys needed some diversion perhaps everyone needed something else to think about for as long as theo could remember his parents had held season tickets for all home basketball and football games at stratten college a small liberal arts division iii school eight blocks from downtown they bought the tickets for several reasons one to support the local team two to actually watch a few games though mrs boone disliked football and could pass on basketball and three to satisfy the colleges athletic director a feisty man known to call fans himself and badger them into supporting the teams such was life in a small town if the boones couldnt make a game the tickets were usually given to clients it was good business the boones met the whipples at the ticket window outside memorial hall a sstyle gymnasium in the center of the campus they hurried inside and found their seatsmidcourt and ten rows up the game was three minutes old and the stratten student section had already reached full volume theo sat next to chase at the end of the row both mothers kept looking at the boys as if they needed some type of special observation on this awful day chase like theo enjoyed sports but was more of a spectator than an athlete chase was a mad scientist a genius in certain fields a violent experimental chemist whod burned down the familys storage shed with one project and nearly vaporized the familys garage with another his experiments were legendary and every science teacher at strattenburg middle school kept a close eye on him when chase was in the lab nothing was safe he was also a computer whiz a technogeek a superb hacker which had also caused some problems whats the line theo whispered to chase strattens favored by eight says who greensheet division iii basketball games were not favored by gamblers and oddsmakers but there were a few offshore websites where one could find a line and place a bet theo and chase did not gamble nor did anyone they knew but it was always interesting to know which team was favored i hear you guys were down at the river when they found the body chase said careful not to be heard by anyone around them who told you woody he told me everything we didnt see a body okay we saw something but it was pretty far away i guess it had to be the body right i mean the police found a body in the river and you guys watched it all lets talk about something else chase okay chase had shown little interest in girls so far and even less interest in april and she had certainly shown no interest in him other than theo april didnt care for boys there was a timeout on the court and the stratten cheerleaders came tumbling out of the stands hopping and bouncing and flinging each other through the air theo and chase grew still and watched closely for two thirteenyearolds the brief performances by the cheerleaders were captivating when the timeout ended the teams took the court and the game resumed mrs boone turned and looked down at the boys then mrs whipple did the same why do they keep looking at us theo mumbled to chase because theyre worried about us thats why were here theo thats why were going out for pizza after the game they think were real fragile right now because some thug who escaped from prison snatched one of our classmates and threw her in the river my mom said that all parents are sort of protective right now the stratten point guard who was well under six feet tall slamdunked the ball and the crowd went wild theo tried to forget about april and chase as well and concentrated on the game at halftime the boys went to get popcorn theo made a quick call to woody for an update woody and his brother were monitoring a police radio and surfing online but so far there was no word from the police no positive identification of the body nothing everything had gone quiet santos was an authentic italian pizza parlor near the campus theo loved the place because there was always a crowd of students watching games on the bigscreen tvs the boones and whipples found a table and ordered two of santos worldfamous sicilian pizzas theo didnt have the energy to ponder whether the pizza was indeed so famous he had his doubts just as he doubted the famousness of gertrudes pecan waffles and mr dudleys mint fudge how could a town as small as strattenburg have three dishes achieving the status of world recognition theo let it go stratten college had lost the game in the final minute and it was the opinion of mr boone that their coach had blundered badly by not managing his timeouts better mr whipple wasnt so sure and a healthy discussion followed mrs boone and mrs whipple both busy lawyers were soon tired of more basketball talk and they launched into a private chat about the proposed renovation of the main courtroom theo was interested in both conversations and tried to follow them chase played a video game on his cell phone some fraternity boys began singing in a faraway corner a crowd at the bar cheered the action on television everyone seemed happy and not the least bit concerned about april theo just wanted to go home chapter friday morning after a crazy night of dreams nightmares frequent naps insomnia voices and visions theo finally gave up and rolled out of bed at as he sat on the edge of his bed and pondered what dreadful news the day would bring he caught the unmistakable aroma of sausage drifting up from the kitchen his mother prepared pancakes and sausage on those rare occasions when she thought her son and sometimes her husband needed a boost in the morning but theo wasnt hungry he had no appetite and doubted if he would find one anytime soon judge who slept under the bed poked his head out and looked up at theo both looked tired and sleepy sorry if i kept you awake judge theo said judge accepted the apology but then you have the rest of the day to do nothing but sleep judge seemed to agree theo was tempted to flip open his laptop and check the local news but he really didnt want to then he thought about grabbing the remote and turning on the television another bad idea instead he took a long shower got dressed loaded his backpack and was about to head downstairs when his cell phone rang it was his uncle ike hello theo said somewhat surprised that ike was awake at such an early hour he was not known as a morning person theo its ike good morning good morning ike though ike was in his early sixties he insisted that theo call him simply ike none of that uncle stuff ike was a complicated person what time are you headed to school half an hour or so you have time to run by and have a chat i have some very interesting gossip that no one knows theo was required by family ritual to stop by ikes office every monday afternoon the visits usually lasted about thirty minutes and were not always pleasant ike liked to quiz theo about his grades and his schoolwork and his future and so on which was tedious ike was quick with a lecture his own children were grown and lived far away and theo was his only nephew he could not imagine why ike wanted to see him so early on a friday morning sure theo said hurry up and dont tell anyone you got it ike theo closed his phone and thought how odd but he had no time to dwell on it and his brain was already overloaded judge no doubt because of the sausage was scratching at the door woods boone had breakfast five days a week at the same table in the same downtown diner with the same group of friends at the same time because of this theo rarely saw his father in the morning theo received a peck on the cheek from his mother who was still in her robe as they exchanged good morning and compared how they slept marcella when she wasnt tied up in court spent the early part of each friday morning getting worked on hair nails toes as a professional she was serious about her appearance her husband was not quite as concerned about his no news on april mrs boone said the small television next to the microwave was not on what does that mean theo asked as he took a seat judge was standing next to the stove as close to the sausage as he could possibly get it means nothing at least for now she said as she placed a plate in front of theo a stack of small round pancakes three links of sausage she poured him a glass of milk thanks mom this is awesome what about judge of course she said as she placed a small plate in front of the dog pancakes and sausage too dig in she took her seat and looked at the large breakfast sitting in front of her son she sipped her coffee theo had no choice but to eat like he was starving after a few bites he said delicious mom thought you might need something extra this morning thanks after a pause in which she watched him closely she said theo are you all right i mean i know this is just awful but how are you handling it it was easier to chew than to talk theo had no answer how do you describe your emotions when a close friend is abducted and probably tossed in a river how do you express your sadness when that friend was a neglected kid from a strange family with nutty parents a kid who didnt have much of a chance theo kept chewing when he had to say something he sort of grunted im okay mom it was not the truth but at the moment it was all he could manage do you want to talk about it ah the perfect question theo shook his head and said no i do not that just makes it worse she smiled and said okay i understand fifteen minutes later theo hopped on his bike rubbed judges head and said goodbye then flew down the boones driveway and onto mallard lane long before theo was born ike boone had been a lawyer he had founded the firm with theos parents the three lawyers worked well together and prospered until ike did something wrong something bad whatever ike did it was not discussed in theos presence naturally curious and raised by two lawyers theo had been pecking away at ikes mysterious downfall for several years but he had learned little his father rebuffed all nosiness with a brusque well discuss it when you get older his mother usually said something like your father will explain it one day theo knew only the basics ike had once been a smart and successful tax lawyer then he went to prison for several years he was disbarred and can never be a lawyer again while he was in prison his wife divorced him and left strattenburg with their three children the children theos first cousins were much older than theo and hed never met them and relations between ike and theos parents were not that good ike eked out a living as a tax accountant for small businesses and a few other clients he lived alone in a tiny apartment he liked to think of himself as a misfit even a rebel against the establishment he wore weird clothes long gray hair pulled into a ponytail sandals even in cold weather and usually had the grateful dead or bob dylan playing on the cheap stereo in his office he worked above a greek deli in a wonderfully shabby old room with rows of untouched books on the shelves theo bounced up the stairs knocked on the door as he pushed it open and strolled into ikes office as if he owned the place ike was at his desk one even more cluttered than his brother woodss and he was sipping coffee from a tall paper cup mornin theo he said like a real grump hey ike theo fell into a rickety wooden chair by the desk whats up ike leaned forward on his elbows his eyes were red and puffy over the years theo had heard snippets of gossip about ikes drinking and he assumed that was one reason his uncle got off to a slow start each morning i guess youre worried about your friend the finnemore girl ike said theo nodded well stop worrying it aint her the body they pulled from the river appears to be that of a man not a girl theyre not sure dna will confirm in a day or two but the person is or was five feet six inches tall your friend was about five one right i guess the body is extremely decomposed which suggests that it spent more than a few days in the water your friend was snatched late tuesday night or early wednesday morning if her kidnapper tossed her in the river shortly after that the body would not be as decomposed as this one its a mess with a lot of missing parts probably been in the water for a week or so theo absorbed this he was stunned relieved and he couldnt suppress a grin as ike went on theo felt the tension ease in his chest and stomach the police are going to make the announcement at nine this morning i thought you might appreciate a little head start thanks ike but they will not admit the obvious and that is to say that theyve wasted the last two days with the theory that jack leeper took the girl killed her and tossed her in the river leeper is nothing but a lying thug and the cops allowed themselves to chase the wrong man this will not be mentioned by the police who told you all this theo asked and immediately knew it was the wrong question because it would not be answered ike smiled rubbed his red eyes took a gulp of coffee and said i have friends theo and not the same friends i had years ago my friends now are from a different part of town theyre not in the big buildings and fine homes theyre closer to the street theo knew that ike played a lot of poker and his pals included some retired lawyers and policemen ike also liked to give the impression that he had a large circle of shady friends who watched everything from the shadows and thus knew the street talk there was some truth to this the previous year one of his clients was convicted for operating a smalltime drug ring ike got his name in the paper when he was called to testify as the mans bookkeeper i hear a lot of stuff theo he added then whos the guy they pulled from the river another sip of coffee well probably never know theyve gone two hundred miles upriver and found no record of a missing person in the past month you ever hear of the batess case no probably forty years ago im thirteen years old ike right anyway it happened over in rooseburg a crook named bates faked his own death one night somehow snatched an unknown person knocked him out put this person in his car a nice cadillac then ran it into a ditch and set it on fire the police and firemen show up and the car is nothing but flames they find a pile of cremated ashes and figure its mr bates they have a funeral a burial the usual mrs bates collects the life insurance mr bates is forgotten until three years later when hes arrested in montana outside a bar they haul him back to face the music here he pleads guilty the big question iswho was the guy who got fried in his car mr bates says he doesnt know never got the boys name just picked him up one night as a hitchhiker three hours later the boy was reduced to ashes guess he got in the wrong car bates gets life in prison whats the point here ike the point my dear nephew is that we may never know who the cops pulled from the river theres a class of people out there theobums drifters hobos homeless folkwho live in the underworld theyre nameless faceless they move from town to town hopping trains hitchhiking living in the woods and under the bridges theyve dropped out of society and from time to time bad things happen to them its a rough and violent world they inhabit and we rarely see them because they do not wish to be seen my guess is that the corpse the cops are inspecting will never be identified but thats really not the point the good news is that its not your friend thanks ike i dont know what else to say i thought you might need some good news its very good news ike ive been worried sick she your girlfriend no just a good friend she has a weird family and i guess im one of the few kids she confides in shes lucky to have a friend like you theo thanks i guess ike relaxed and put his feet on his desk sandals again with bright red socks he sipped his coffee and smiled at theo how much do you know about her father theo squirmed and wasnt sure what to say i met him once at their house aprils mother threw a birthday party for her a couple of years ago it was a disaster because most of the kids didnt show up the other parents didnt like the idea of them going to the finnemores house but i was there me and three others and her dad was hanging around he had long hair and a beard and seemed uncomfortable around us kids april told me a lot over the years he comes and goes and shes happier when hes not around he plays the guitar and writes songsbad songs according to apriland still has the dream of making it big as a musician i know the guy ike said smugly or i should say i know of him hows that theo asked not really surprised that ike knew another strange person i have a friend who plays music with him occasionally says hes a deadbeat spends a lot of time with a ragtag band of middleaged losers they take little tours playing in bars and fraternity houses i suspect there are some drugs involved that sounds right april told me he was missing one time for a whole month i think he and mrs finnemore fight a lot its a very unhappy family ike slowly got to his feet and walked to the stereo mounted in a bookcase he pushed a button and some folk music began playing quietly in the background ike spoke as he fiddled with the volume well if you ask me the police need to check out the father he probably got the girl and took off somewhere im not sure april would leave with him she didnt like him and didnt trust him why hasnt she tried to contact you doesnt she have a cell phone a laptop dont you kids chat nonstop online the police found her laptop in her room and her parents would not allow her to have a cell phone she told me once that her father hates cell phones and doesnt use one he doesnt want to be found when hes on the road im sure she would try and contact me if she could maybe whoever took her wont let her get near a phone ike sat down again and looked at a notepad on his desk theo needed to get to school which was ten minutes away by bike if he hit all the shortcuts ill see what i can find out about the father ike said call me after school thanks ike and i suppose this is top secret right this great news about april why should it be a secret in about an hour the police will make the announcement if you ask me they shouldve informed the public last night but no the police like to put on press conferences make everything as dramatic as possible i dont care who you tell the public has the right to know great ill call mom on the way to school chapter fifteen minutes later mr mount got his homeroom quiet and settled which was not as difficult as usual the boys were again subdued there was a lot of gossip but it was more of the whispered variety mr mount looked at them and then said gravely men theo has an update on aprils disappearance theo stood slowly and walked to the front of the class one of his favorite trial lawyers in town was a man named jesse meelbank when mr meelbank had a trial theo tried to watch as much as possible the summer before there was a long trial in which mr meelbank sued a railroad company for the tragic death of a young woman and theo watched nonstop for nine days it was awesome what he loved about mr meelbank was the way he carried himself in the courtroom he moved gracefully but with a purpose never in a hurry but never wasting time when he was ready to speak he looked at the witness or the judge or jury and he paused dramatically before saying the first word and when he spoke his tone was friendly conversational seemingly off the cuff but not a single word phrase or syllable was wasted everyone listened to jesse meelbank and he seldom lost a case often when theo was alone in his bedroom or office with the door locked he liked to address the jury in some dramatic makebelieve case and he always imitated mr meelbank he stood before the class paused just a second and when he had everyones attention he said as we all know the police found a dead body in the river yesterday it was all over the news and the reports suggested that the body was april finnemore a dramatic pause as theo searched their troubled eyes however i have a reliable source that has confirmed that the body is not april the body is that of a man about five feet six inches tall and the poor guy has been in the water for a long time his body is really decomposed grins everywhere on every face even a clap or two because he knew every lawyer judge court clerk and practically every policeman in town theos word carried great weight with his friends and classmates at least in matters like this when the topic was chemistry music movies or the civil war he was not the expert and did not pretend to be but when it came to the law the courts and the criminal justice system theo was the man he continued at nine this morning the police will make this announcement to the press its certainly good news but the fact is april is still missing and the police do not have many clues what about jack leeper aaron asked hes still a suspect but hes not cooperating the boys were suddenly talkative they asked theo more random questions none of which he could answer and they chatted among themselves when the bell rang they scampered off to first period and mr mount hustled down to the principals office to repeat the good news it spread like wildfire through the office and teachers lounge and then it spilled into the hallways and classrooms and even the restrooms and cafeteria a few minutes before am mrs gladwell the principal interrupted the classes with an announcement through the intercom all eighthgrade students were to report immediately to the auditorium for another unscheduled assembly they had done the same thing the day before when mrs gladwell tried to calm their fears as the students filed into the auditorium a large television was being rolled in by two of the custodians mrs gladwell hurried everyone to their seats and when they were seated she said attention please she had an annoying way of dragging out the word please so that it sounded more like pleeeeeze this was often imitated over lunch or on the playground especially by the boys behind her the screen came to life with a muted broadcast of a morning talk show she went on at nine oclock the police are going to make an important announcement in the april finnemore case and i thought it would be great if we could see it live and enjoy this moment together pleeeeze no questions she glanced at her watch and then glanced at the television lets put it on channel twentyeight she said to the custodians strattenburg had two network stations and two cable channel was arguably the most reliable which meant that it generally made fewer blunders than the others theo had once watched a great trial in which channel was sued by a doctor who claimed a reporter for the station had said false things about him the jury believed the doctor as did theo and gave him a bunch of money channel was showing another morning talk show one that started the hour not with the news but with the latest breathtaking details of a celebrity divorce thankfully it was still on mute the eighth graders waited patiently and quietly there was a clock on the wall and when the minute hand made it to five minutes past nine theo began to squirm some of the students began to whisper the celebrity divorce gave way to a bridal makeover one in which a rather plain and somewhat chubby bride got worked on by all manner of flaky professionals a trainer tried to whip her into shape by screaming at her a man with painted fingernails restyled her hair a real weirdo plastered on new makeup this went on and on with virtually no improvement by the bride was ready for the wedding she looked like a different person and it was obvious even with no sound that her groom preferred the version he had originally proposed to but by then theo was too nervous to care mr mount eased over to him and whispered theo are you sure the police will make the announcement theo nodded confidently and said yes sir but all confidence had vanished theo was kicking himself for being such a loudmouth and knowitall he was also kicking ike he was tempted to sneak his cell phone out of his pocket and text ike to see what was going on what were the police doing the school though had a strict policy regarding cell phones only seventh and eighth graders could have them on campus and calls texts and emails were permitted only during lunch and recess if you got caught using your phone at any other time then you lost your phone about half of the eighth graders had cell phones many parents still refused to allow them hey theo whats the deal aaron helleberg asked at full volume he was seated behind theo three seats down theo smiled shrugged and said these things never run on time once the chubby bride got married it was time for the morning news floods in india were claiming thousands of lives and london got hit with a freak snowstorm with the news out of the way one of the hosts began an exclusive interview with a supermodel theo felt as though every teacher and every student was staring at him he was anxious and breathing rapidly and then he had an even worse thought what if ike was wrong what if ike had believed some bad information and the police were not so sure about the dead body wouldnt theo look like an idiot indeed he would but that would be nothing if the police had in fact pulled april out of the water he jumped to his feet and walked over to where mr mount was standing with two other teachers ive got an idea he said still managing to appear confident why dont you call the police department and see whats going on theo said who would i call mr mount asked ill give you the number theo said mrs gladwell was walking over frowning at theo why dont you call theo mr mount said and that was exactly what theo wanted to hear he looked at mrs gladwell and said very politely may i step into the hall and call the police department mrs gladwell was pretty nervous about the situation too and she quickly said yes and hurry theo disappeared in the hall he whipped out his cell phone and called ike no answer he called the police department but the line was busy he called elsa at the office and asked if she had heard anything she had not he tried ike again no answer he tried to think of someone else to call at that awful moment but no one came to mind he checked the time on his cell phone theo stared at the large metal door that led into the auditorium where about of his classmates and a dozen or so teachers were waiting on some very good news about april news that theo had brought to school and delivered as dramatically as possible he knew he should open the door and return to his seat he thought about leaving just going someplace in the school and hiding for an hour or so he could claim that his stomach was upset or that his asthma had flared up he could hide in the library or the gym the doorknob clicked and theo stuck the phone to his ear as if in a deep conversation mr mount came out looked at him quizzically and mouthed the words is everything okay theo smiled and nodded his head as if he had the police on the line and they were doing exactly what he wanted them to do mr mount returned to the auditorium theo could run and hide stop the damage with a little fib something likethe announcement by the police has been postponed or stick with the current plan and pray for a miracle he thought about throwing rocks at ike then gritted his teeth and pulled open the door everyone watched him as he returned mrs gladwell pounced on him whats going on theo she said eyebrows arched eyes flashing it should be any minute now he said who did you talk to mr mount askeda rather direct question theyre having some technical problems theo replied dodging just a few more minutes mr mount frowned as if he found this hard to believe theo quickly got to his seat and tried to become invisible he focused on the television screen where a dog was gripping two paintbrushes in his teeth and splashing paint on a white canvas while the host howled with laughter come on theo said to himself someone save me here it was hey theo any more inside scoop aaron said loudly and several kids laughed at least were not in class theo shot back ten more minutes passed the painting dog gave way to an obese chef who built a pyramid out of mushrooms then almost cried when it all tumbled down mrs gladwell walked in front of the television shot a vicious look at theo and said well you need to get back to class at that moment channel cut in with a breaking news graphic a custodian hit the mute switch and mrs gladwell hurried out of the way theo exhaled and thanked god for miracles the police chief was behind a podium with a row of uniformed officers behind him to the far right was detective slater in a coat and tie everyone looked exhausted the chief read from a page of notes and he gave the same information ike had delivered to theo about two hours earlier they were waiting on dna testing to confirm things but they were almost certain the body pulled from the river was not that of april finnemore he went into some detail about the size and condition of the body which they were working hard to identify and he gave the impression they were making progress as for april they were following many leads the reporters asked a lot of questions and the chief did a lot of talking but not much was said when the press conference was over the eighth graders were relieved but still worried the police had no idea where april was or who took her jack leeper was still the prime suspect at least she wasnt dead or if she was they didnt yet know it as they left the auditorium and returned to class theo reminded himself to be more cautious next time he had just barely avoided being the biggest laughingstock in school during the lunch break theo woody chase aaron and a few others ate sandwiches and talked about resuming their search after school the weather though was threatening and heavy rain was predicted for the afternoon and into the night as the days had dragged by there were fewer and fewer among them who believed april was still in strattenburg why then should they search the streets each afternoon if no one believed she would be found theo was determined to continue rain or not chapter halfway through chemistry with rain and wind pounding the windows theo was trying to listen to mr tubcheck when he was startled to hear his own name it was mrs gladwell again over the intercom mr tubcheck is theodore boone in class she screeched startling the boys and mr tubcheck as well theos heart stopped as he bolted straight up in his chair where else would i be at this moment he thought he is mr tubcheck responded please send him to the office as theo walked slowly down the hall he tried desperately to think of why he was needed in the principals office it was almost pm on friday afternoon the week was almost over and what a miserable week it had been perhaps mrs gladwell was still sore over the delayed press conference this morning but theo didnt think so that had turned out well he had done nothing significantly wrong the entire week violated no rules offended no one successfully completed most of his homework and so on he gave up he really wasnt that worried two years earlier mrs gladwells oldest daughter had gone through an unpleasant divorce and marcella boone had been her lawyer miss gloria the nosy receptionist was on the phone and waved him toward the big office mrs gladwell met him at the door and escorted him inside theo this is anton she said as she closed the door anton was a skinny kid with extremely dark skin she continued hes in miss spences sixthgrade class theo shook his hand and said nice to meet you anton said nothing his handshake was rather limp theo immediately thought the kid was in deep trouble and scared to death have a seat theo she said and theo fell into the chair next to anton anton is from haiti moved here several years ago and lives with some relatives at the edge of town on barkley street near the quarry her eyes met theos when she said the word quarry it was not a better part of town in fact most of the people who lived there were low income or immigrants legal and otherwise his parents are working out of town and anton lives with his grandparents do you recognize this she asked as she handed theo a sheet of paper he studied it quickly and said oh boy are you familiar with animal court theo she asked yes ive been there several times i rescued my dog from animal court can you please explain whats going on for my benefit and antons sure this is a rule summons issued by judge yeck from animal court says here that pete was taken into custody yesterday by animal control they came to the house and got him anton said said he was under arrest pete was very upset theo was still scanning the summons says here that pete is an african gray parrot age unknown hes fifty years old hes been in my family for many years theo glanced at anton and noticed his wet eyes the hearing is today at pm in animal court judge yeck will hear the case and decide what to do with pete do you know what pete did wrong he scared some people anton said thats all i know can you help theo mrs gladwell asked sure theo said with some reluctance truthfully though theo loved animal court because anyone including a thirteenyearold kid in the eighth grade could represent himself or herself lawyers were not required in animal court and judge yeck ran a very loose courtroom yeck was a misfit whod been kicked out of several law firms couldnt handle a real job as a lawyer and was not too happy to be the lowestranked judge in town most lawyers avoided kitty court as it was known because it was beneath their dignity thank you theo but i need to leave now he said thinking quickly i need some time to prepare youre dismissed she said at pm theo walked down the stairs to the basement level of the courthouse and down a hallway past storage rooms until he came to a wooden door with animal court judge sergio yeck stenciled in black at the top he was nervous but also excited where else could a thirteenyearold argue a case and pretend to be a real lawyer he was carrying a leather briefcase one of ikes old ones he opened the door whatever pete had done hed done a good job of it theo had never seen so many people in animal court on the left side of the small courtroom there was a group of women all middleaged all wearing tight brown riding britches and black leather boots up to their knees they looked very unhappy to the right sitting as far away from the women as possible were anton and two elderly black people all three appeared to be terrified theo eased over to them and said hello anton introduced his grandparents with names that were foreign and impossible to understand the first time around their english was okay but heavily accented anton said something to his grandmother she looked at theo and said you our lawyer theo couldnt think of anything else to say but yes she started crying a door opened and judge yeck appeared from somewhere in the rear he stepped up to the long bench and sat down as usual he was wearing jeans cowboy boots no tie and a battered sports coat no black robe was needed in kitty court he picked up a sheet of paper and glanced around the room few of the cases on his docket attracted attention most involved people whose dogs and cats had been picked up by animal control so when a little controversy came his way he enjoyed the moment he cleared his throat loudly and said i see here that we have a case involving pete the parrot his owners are mr and mrs regnier he looked at the haitians for confirmation theo said your honor im with the uh the owners well hello theo how are you doing these days fine judge thanks i havent seen you in a month or so yes sir ive been busy you know classes and all how are your folks fine just fine theo had first appeared in animal court two years earlier when he made a lastminute plea to save the life of a mutt no one wanted he took the dog home and named him judge please come forward judge yeck said and theo led the three regniers through the small gate to a table on the right when they were seated the judge said the complaint was filed by kate spangler and judy cross owners of sc stables a welldressed young man popped up and announced yes your honor i represent ms spangler and ms cross and who are you im kevin blaze your honor with the macklin firm blaze sort of strutted up to the bench shiny new briefcase in hand and placed one of his business cards in front of the judge the macklin firm was a group of about twenty lawyers and had been around for years theo had never heard of mr blaze evidently judge yeck had not either it was apparent at least to theo that the young lawyers abundance of selfconfidence was not appreciated theo suddenly had a sharp pain in his midsection his opponent was a real lawyer blaze got his clients the two women properly seated at the table on the left side of the courtroom and when everyone was in place judge yeck said say theo you dont happen to own any part of this parrot do you no sir then why are you here theo stayed in his chair in animal court all formalities were dispensed with the lawyers remained seated there was no witness stand no sworn oaths to tell the truth no rules of evidence and certainly no jury judge yeck conducted quick hearings and ruled on the spot and in spite of his deadend job he was known to be fair well uh theo began badly you see your honor anton goes to my school and his family is from haiti and they dont understand our system who does yeck mumbled and i guess im here as a favor to a friend i get that theo but normally the owner of the pet shows up to argue his or her case or they hire a lawyer youre not the owner and youre not a lawyer yet yes sir kevin blaze jumped to his feet and said sharply i object to his presence here your honor judge yeck slowly turned his attention from theo and settled it heavily onto the eager face of young kevin blaze there was a long pause a tense lull in the proceedings in which no one spoke and no one seemed to breathe finally judge yeck said sit down when blaze was back in his seat judge yeck said and stay there dont get up again unless i ask you to now mr blaze can you not see that i am addressing the issue of theodore boones presence in this matter is that not obvious to you i need no assistance from you your objection is useless it is not overruled nor is it sustained it is simply ignored another long pause as judge yeck looked at the group of women seated behind the table on the left he pointed and asked who are these people blaze firmly gripping the arms of his chair said these are witnesses your honor judge yeck was obviously not happy with this response okay heres the way i operate mr blaze i prefer short hearings i prefer few witnesses and i really have no patience with witnesses who say the same things that other witnesses have already said you understand this mr blaze yes sir looking at theo the judge said thank you for taking an interest in this case mr boone youre welcome judge his honor glanced at a sheet of paper and said good now i suppose we need to meet pete he nodded to his ancient court clerk who disappeared for a moment then returned with a uniformed bailiff holding a cheap wire birdcage he placed it on the corner of judge yecks bench inside the cage was pete an african gray parrot fourteen inches long from beak to tail pete glanced around the strange room moving only his head i guess youre pete judge yeck said im pete pete said in a clear highpitched voice nice to meet you im judge yeck yeck yeck yeck pete squawked and almost everyone laughed the ladies in the black boots did not they were frowning even harder now not at all amused by pete judge yeck exhaled slowly as if the hearing might take longer than he wanted call your first witness he said to kevin blaze yes your honor i guess well start with kate spangler blaze reshifted his weight and turned to look at his client it was obvious he wanted to stand and move around the courtroom and felt constrained he picked up a legal pad covered with notes and began you are the coowner of sc stables correct yes ms spangler was a small thin woman in her midforties how long have you owned sc stables why is that important judge yeck interrupted quickly please tell me how that is possibly relevant to what were doing here blaze tried to explain well your honor we need to prove that heres how we do things in animal court mr blaze ms spangler please tell me what happened just forget all the stuff your lawyer has told you and tell me what pete here did to upset you im pete pete said yes we know yeck yeck yeck thank you pete a long pause to make sure pete was finished for the moment then the judge waved at ms spangler she began well on tuesday of last week we were in the middle of a lesson i was in the arena on foot with four of my students mounted when suddenly this bird here came out of nowhere squawking and making all kinds of noises just a few feet above our heads the horses freaked out and bolted for the barn i almost got trampled betty slocum fell and hurt her arm betty slocum stood quickly so everyone could see the large white cast on her left arm he swooped down again like some crazy kamikaze and chased the horses as they kamikaze kamikaze kamikaze pete blurted just shut up ms spangler said to pete please hes just a bird judge yeck said pete began saying something that could not be understood anton leaned over and whispered to theo hes speaking creole what is it judge yeck asked hes speaking creole french your honor theo explained its his native tongue whats he saying theo whispered to anton who whispered right back you dont want to know your honor theo reported pete shut up and everyone waited for a moment judge yeck looked at anton and said softly will he stop talking if hes asked to stop talking anton shook his head and said no sir another pause please continue judge yeck said judy cross took over and said and then the next day at about the same time i was giving a lesson i had five of my riders on their horses in the course of any lesson i yell instructions to my students such as walk on and halt and canter i had no idea he was watching us but he was he was hiding in an oak tree next to the arena and he started yelling halt halt pete on cue yelled halt halt halt see what i mean and the horses stopped dead still i tried to ignore him i told my students to remain calm and just ignore this guy i said walk on and the horses began their movements then he started yelling halt halt judge yeck held up both hands for silence seconds passed he said please continue judy cross said he was quiet for a few minutes we ignored him the students were concentrating and the horses were calm they were in a slow walk when suddenly he started yelling canter canter the horses bolted again and began sprinting all around the arena it was chaos i barely escaped getting run over pete squawked canter canter see what i mean judy cross gushed hes been harassing us for over a week one day hell drop from the sky like a divebomber and frighten the horses the next day hell sneak up on us and hide in a tree and wait until things are quiet before he starts yelling instructions hes evil our horses are afraid to come out of the barn our students want their money back hes killing our business with perfect timing pete said youre fat he waited five seconds then did it again youre fat his words echoed around the room and stunned everyone most of the people looked at their shoes or boots judy cross swallowed hard closed her eyes tightly clenched her fists and frowned as if in great pain she was a large woman with a wide frame the kind of body that had always carried extra weight and carried it badly it was obvious from her reaction that her weight had presented many complicated issues over the years it was something she had battled and lost badly being heavy was an extremely sensitive topic for judy one she wrestled with every day youre fat pete reminded her for the third time judge yeck who was desperately fighting the natural reaction to burst out laughing jumped in and said okay is it safe to assume that your other witnesses are willing to say pretty much the same thing the women nodded several seemed to be cowering almost hiding as if they had lost some of their enthusiasm at that moment it would take enormous courage to say harmful things about pete what would he blurt out about them and their bodies anything else judge yeck asked kate spangler said judge youve got to do something this bird is costing us our business weve already lost money this simply isnt fair what do you want me to do i dont care what you do can you put him to sleep or something you want me to kill him halt halt pete screamed maybe you could clip his wings judy cross chimed in halt halt pete continued then he resorted to creole and unleashed a furious string of harsh words at the two women when he finished judge yeck glanced at anton and asked what did he say antons grandparents were chuckling and covering their mouths really bad stuff anton replied he doesnt like those two women got that the judge raised his hands again and asked for calm pete got the message mr boone theo said well judge i think it might be helpful if my friend anton gave you some background on pete please do so anton cleared his throat and began nervously yes sir pete is fifty years old he was given to my father when he was a little boy in haiti a gift from his father so pete has been in the family for a long time when my grandparents came to this country a few years ago pete came too african gray parrots are some of the smartest animals in the world as you can see he knows a lot of words he understands what others are saying he can even imitate the voices of humans pete was watching anton as he spoke the voice so familiar he began saying andy andy andy im here pete anton said andy andy a pause then anton continued parrots like to have a fixed routine each day and they require at least an hour out of their cages every day at four oclock pete gets out and we thought he was just hanging around the backyard i guess not the stables are about a mile away and he must have found the place were very sorry about this but please dont hurt pete thank you judge yeck said now mr blaze what am i supposed to do your honor its obvious that the owners cannot control this bird and its their duty to do so one compromise might be that the court orders the owners to have its wings clipped ive checked with two veterinarians and one wildlife specialist and theyve told me that such a procedure is not unusual nor is it painful or expensive at full volume pete yelled youre stupid there was laughter as blazes face turned red judge yeck said okay thats enough get him out of here pete sorry old boy but you must leave the room the bailiff snatched the birdcage and took him away as the door closed pete was cursing mightily in creole when the room was quiet again judge yeck said mr boone whats your suggestion with no hesitation theo said probation your honor give us one more chance my friends here will find a way to control pete and keep him away from the stables i dont think they realize what hes been doing or the problems hes created they are very sorry for all this and if he does it again then a harsher punishment would be in order theo knew two things that kevin blaze did not first judge yeck believed in second chances and rarely ordered animals destroyed until he had no other choice second hed been kicked out of the macklin law firm five years earlier so he probably held a bit of a grudge in typical yeck fashion he said heres what were going to do ms spangler and ms cross i am very sympathetic to your complaints if pete shows up again i want you to video him have a cell phone or a camera ready and catch him on video then bring me the video at that point mr boone we will take pete into custody and have his wings clipped the owners will be responsible for the costs there will be no hearingit will be automatic is this clear mr boone just a second your honor theo huddled with the three regniers and they were soon nodding in agreement they understand your honor theo announced good i hold them responsible i want pete kept at home period can they take him home now theo asked yes im sure the good folks at the animal shelter are ready to get rid of him case closed courts adjourned kevin blaze and his clients and the rest of the women in black boots hustled out of the courtroom when they were gone the bailiff brought pete back and handed him over to anton who immediately opened the cage and removed the bird his grandparents wiped tears from their cheeks as they stroked his back and tail theo drifted away and walked to the bench where judge yeck was making notes on his docket thanks judge theo said almost in a whisper thats a bad bird judge yeck said softly with a chuckle too bad we dont have a video of pete divebombing the ladies on their horses they both laughed but quietly nice job theo thanks any word on the finnemore girl theo shook his head no im very sorry theo someone told me youre a close friend theo nodded and said pretty close lets keep our fingers crossed yeck yeck yeck pete squawked as he left the courtroom chapter jack leeper wanted to talk he sent a note to the jailer who passed it on to detective slater late friday afternoon they marched leeper from his cell block and through an old tunnel which led to the police station next door slater and his trusty sidekick capshaw were waiting in the same dim and cramped interrogation room leeper looked as though he had not bathed or shaved since they had chatted with him the day before something on your mind leeper slater began rudely as always capshaw was taking notes i talked to my lawyer today leeper said as if he were now more important because he had a lawyer which one ozgoode kip ozgoode as if they had rehearsed both detectives chuckled and sneered at the name if you have ozgoode youre dead meat leeper slater said the worst capshaw added i like him leeper said he seems a lot smarter than you boys you want to talk or swap insults i can do both does your lawyer know youre talking to us slater asked yep so what do you want to talk about im worried about the girl you clowns obviously cant find her i know where she is and as the clock ticks her situation gets worse she needs to be rescued youre a real sweetheart leeper slater said snatch the girl stash her somewhere and now you want to help her im sure you have a deal for us capshaw said you got it heres what ill do and you guys better do it fast because theres one frightened little girl out there ill plead guilty to one count of breaking and entering get two years in prison with my time to run at the same time as that mess in california i stay here and do my time my lawyer says the paperwork can be done in a matter of hours we sign the deal the prosecutor and judge okay it and you get the girl time is crucial here boys so youd better make a move slater and capshaw exchanged a nervous look leeper had them they suspected he was lying because they expected nothing else from him but what if he wasnt what if they agreed to his deal and he led them to april slater said its almost six pm on friday afternoon leeper all the judges and prosecutors have gone home oh ill bet you can find them theyll hustle up if theres a chance of saving the girl another pause as they studied his bearded face why would he offer such a deal if he didnt know where she was such a plea bargain would be thrown out the window if he couldnt deliver plus they had no other leads no other suspects leeper had always been their man i dont mind having a chat with the prosecutor slater said giving in if youre lying leeper well ship you back to california come monday capshaw said is she still in town slater asked im not saying another word until i sign the deal leeper said as theo was leaving the courthouse after saving pete the parrot he saw a text message from ike who wanted him to run by the office because he got off to a slow start each day ike usually worked late even on fridays theo found him at his desk piles of papers everywhere a bottle of beer already opened and bob dylan on the stereo hows my favorite nephew ike said im your only nephew theo replied as he shook off his raincoat and sat in the only chair that wasnt covered with files and binders yes but theo youd be my favorite even if i had twenty if you say so how was your day theo had already learned that a large part of being a lawyer was relishing the victories especially the ones involving courtroom battles lawyers love to tell stories about their weird clients and strange cases but they thrive on their dramatic wins in court so theo launched into the saga of pete and before long ike was roaring with laughter not surprisingly judge yeck did not hang out with the more respected lawyers in town and he and ike occasionally bumped into one another at a certain bar where some of the misfits liked to drink ike thought it was hilarious that yeck allowed theo to handle cases like a real lawyer when the story was over ike changed subjects and said i still say the police should be checking out the girls father from what i hear theyre still concentrating on jack leeper and i think thats a mistake dont you i dont know ike i dont know what to think ike picked up a piece of paper his name is thomas finnemore goes by tom his band calls itself plunder and theyve been on the road for a few weeks finnemore and four other clowns most from around here theres no website the lead singer is a former drug dealer i met years ago and i managed to track down one of his current girlfriends she wouldnt say much but she thinks theyre in the raleigh north carolina area doing cheap gigs in bars and fraternity houses she did not act as though she missed her boyfriend that much anyway thats all i could find out so what am i supposed to do see if you can find plunder theo shook his head in frustration look ike theres no way april would take off with her father ive tried to tell you she doesnt trust him and she really dislikes him and she was scared theo a very frightened little girl you dont know what she was thinking her mother had abandoned her these people are nuts right right no one broke in the house because her father has a key he gets her and they take off for how long no one knows okay but if shes with her father then shes safe right you tell me you think shes safe hanging around with plunder not the best place for a thirteenyearold girl so i find plunder and just hop on my bike and fly down to raleigh north carolina well worry about that later youre a whiz with a computer start searching see what you can find what a waste of time theo thought he was suddenly tired the week had been stressful and hed slept little the excitement of animal court had sapped whatever energy he had and he just wanted to go home and crawl into bed thanks ike he said as he grabbed his raincoat dont mention it late friday night jack leeper was once again handcuffed and led from his cell the meeting took place in a room at the jail where lawyers met with their clients leepers lawyer kip ozgoode was there along with detectives slater and capshaw and a young lady from the prosecutors office named teresa knox ms knox immediately took charge she was all business and didnt appreciate being called from home on a friday night theres no deal mr leeper she began youre in no position to make deals youre facing kidnapping charges which means up to forty years in prison if the girl is harmed then more charges if shes dead then your life is really over the best thing for you is to tell us where she is so she wont be harmed anymore and you wont face additional charges leeper grinned at ms knox but said nothing she continued this is assuming of course that youre not playing games i suspect that you are so does the judge so do the police then all of you will be sorry leeper said im giving you the chance to save her life as for me im sure ill die in prison not necessarily ms knox fired back you give us the girl safe and sound and well recommend a twentyyear sentence on the kidnapping charge you can serve your time here what about california we cant control what they do in california leeper kept grinning as if he was enjoying the moment finally he said as you say no deal chapter the boone family breakfast on saturday morning was rather tense as usual theo and judge dined on cheeriosorange juice for theo but not for judgewhile woods boone ate a bagel and read the sports page marcella sipped coffee and scanned her laptop for news around the world not much was said at least not for the first twenty minutes the remains of other conversations were still hanging in the air and a disagreement might flare up at any moment the tension had several causes first and most obvious was the general gloominess that had afflicted the family since about am wednesday morning when they were awakened by the police and asked to hurry over to the finnemore home as the days passed without april the mood had only darkened there were efforts especially by mr and mrs boone to smile and be upbeat but all three knew these were futile second but less important was the fact that theo and his father would not play their weekly nine holes of golf they teed off almost every saturday at am and it was the highlight of the week the golf was being cancelled because of the third reason for the tension mr and mrs boone were leaving town for twentyfour hours and theo insisted he be allowed to stay by himself it was a fight theyd had before and theo had lost before and he was losing again he had carefully explained that he knew how to lock all the doors and windows arm the alarm system call the neighbors and if necessary sleep with a chair wedged under his door sleep with judge by his side ready to attack and sleep with a seveniron golf club in his grip if necessary he was thoroughly and completely safe and he resented being treated like a child he refused to stay with a babysitter when his parents went out for dinner or the movies and he was furious that they refused to leave him on this little overnight trip of theirs his parents wouldnt budge he was only thirteen and that was too young to be left alone theo had already started the negotiating even pestering and the door was open to serious discussion on the issue when he was fourteen but for now theo needed the supervision and protection his mother had arranged for him to spend the night with chase whipple which would have been okay under normal circumstances however as chase had explained his own parents were going out for dinner saturday night and leaving the two boys to be watched by chases older sister daphne a truly dislikable girl of sixteen who was always at home because she had no social life and therefore felt compelled to flirt with theo he had suffered through such a sleepover not three months earlier when his parents were in chicago for a funeral he had protested griped sulked argued pouted and nothing had worked his saturday night was about to be spent in the basement of the whipple home with pudgy daphne chattering nonstop and staring at him while he and chase tried to play video games and watch television mr and mrs boone had considered cancelling their trip in light of aprils abduction and the general sense of uneasiness in town their plans were to drive two hundred miles to a popular resort called briar springs for a few hours of fun with a bunch of lawyers from around the state there would be afternoon seminars and speeches then cocktails then a long dinner with more speeches from wise old judges and dull politicians woods and marcella were active in the state bar association and never missed the annual meeting at briar springs this one was even more important because marcella was scheduled to give a speech on recent trends in divorce law and woods was on tap to participate in a seminar on the mortgage foreclosure crisis both had prepared their remarks and were looking forward to the afternoon theo assured them he would be fine and that strattenburg would not miss them if they left for twentyfour hours over dinner friday evening they had decided to make the trip and they had decided that theo would stay with the whipple family in spite of his vocal opposition to such a plan theo lost the argument and though he conceded this to himself he still awoke on saturday in a foul mood sorry about the golf theo mr boone said without taking his eyes off the sports page theo said nothing well catch up next saturday by playing eighteen whatta you say theo grunted his mother closed her laptop and looked at him theo dear were leaving in an hour what are your plans for the afternoon seconds passed before theo said oh i dont know i guess ill just hang out here and wait for the kidnappers and murderers to show up ill probably be dead by the time you get to briar springs dont get smart with your mother woods said sharply then raised the newspaper to conceal a grin youll have a great time at the whipples she said cant wait now back to my question what are your plans for the afternoon not sure chase and i might go the high school game at two or we might go to the paramount and watch the double feature theres also a hockey game and youre not searching for april right theo weve had this conversation you boys have no business riding around town playing detectives theo nodded his father lowered his newspaper glared at theo and said do we have your word theo no more search parties you have my word i want a text message every two hours beginning at eleven this morning do you understand his mother asked i do and smile theo make the world a happier place i dont want to smile right now come on teddy she said with a smile of her own calling him teddy did nothing to brighten his mood nor did her constant reminders to smile and make the world a happier place theos thick braces had been stuck to his teeth for two years and he was sick of them he could not imagine how a blazing mouth full of metal could possibly make anyone happier they left at am on the dot on schedule because they planned to arrive precisely at pm marcellas speech was at pm woodss seminar was at pm as busy lawyers their lives revolved around the clock and time could not be wasted theo waited half an hour then loaded up his backpack and took off to the office judge followed him as expected boone amp boone was deserted his parents rarely worked on saturday and the staff certainly did not he unlocked the front door disarmed the alarm system and switched on the lights to the main library near the front of the building its tall windows looked onto the small front lawn then the street the room had the look and smell of a very important room and theo often did his homework there if the lawyers and paralegals werent using it he fixed judge a bowl of water and then unpacked his laptop and cell phone hed spent a couple of hours the night before searching for plunder he still found it hard to believe that april would leave in the middle of the night with her father but ikes theory was better than anything theo could come up with besides what else did theo have to do over the weekend so far there was no sign of plunder working in the raleighdurhamchapel hill area theo had found dozens of music halls clubs private party rooms concert venues bars and lounges even wedding receptions about half had websites or facebook pages and not one had mentioned a band called plunder he also found three underground weeklies that listed hundreds of possible venues for live music using the office landline theo began cold calling in alphabetical order the first was a joint called abbeys irish rose in durham a scratchy voice said abbeys theo tried to lower his voice as much as possible yes could you tell me if the band plunder is playing there tonight never heard of em thanks he hung up quickly at bradys barbeque in raleigh a woman said we dont have a band tonight theo with every question scripted to learn as much as possible asked has plunder ever played there never heard of em thanks he plowed on chewing up the alphabet getting nowhere there was a decent chance that elsa would question the phone calls when she opened the monthly bill and if this happened theo would take the blame he might even warn elsa tell her why he made the calls and ask her to pay the bill without telling his parents he would deal with it later he had no choice but to use the office phone because his mother was a nazi about his cell phone bill if she saw a bunch of calls to a bunch of bars in raleighdurham he would have some explaining to do the first whiff of success came from a place called traction in chapel hill a helpful young man who sounded no older than theo said he thought that plunder had played there a few months earlier he put theo on hold and went to check with someone named eddie when it was confirmed that plunder had passed through the young man said youre not thinking about booking them are you maybe theo replied dont they cant draw flies thanks its a frat band at exactly am he texted his mother home alone serial killer in basement she replied not funny love you love u theo plugged away call after call with little trace of plunder chase arrived around noon and unpacked his laptop by then theo had chatted with over sixty managers bartenders waitresses bouncers even a dishwasher who spoke very little english his brief conversations convinced him that plunder was a bad band with a very small following one bartender in raleigh who claimed to know every band that ever came to town admitted hed never heard of plunder on three occasions the band was referred to as a frat band lets check out the fraternities chase said and the sororities too they soon learned that there were a lot of colleges and universities in the raleighdurham area with the obvious being duke unc and nc state but within an hours drive there were a dozen smaller schools they decided to start with the larger ones minutes passed as the two pecked away flying around the internet racing to be the first to find something useful duke doesnt have fraternity houses chase said what does that mean in terms of parties and bands theo asked im not sure lets come back to duke you take nc state and ill take unc theo soon learned that nc state had twentyfour fraternities and nine sororities most with an offcampus house as headquarters it appeared as though each maintained a website though they varied in quality how many frats at unc theo asked twentytwo for the boys and nine for the girls lets go through each website thats what im doing chases fingers never stopped moving theo was quick with his laptop but not as quick as chase the two raced on each determined to dig up the first bit of useful intelligence judge who always preferred to sleep under thingstables beds chairssnored quietly somewhere under the conference table the websites soon blurred together they provided information on members alumni service projects awards calendars and most importantly social events the photos were endlessparty scenes ski trips cookouts on the beach frisbee tournaments and formals with the boys in tuxedos and the girls in fancy dresses theo caught himself looking forward to college the two schools played each other in football with kickoff at pm theo knew this in fact he and chase had discussed the line nc state was a twopoint favorite now though the line was not that interesting the important part of the game was that it gave the fraternities another excuse to party the game was in chapel hill so evidently the state students had partied and danced on friday night the unc fraternities and sororities were planning the same for saturday night theo closed another website and grunted in frustration i count ten frat parties last night at state but only four websites give the names of the bands if youre announcing a party on your website why wouldnt you say whos going to be playing same here chase said they rarely give the name of the band how many parties in chapel hill tonight theo asked maybe a dozen looks like a big night they finished the search of all websites at both schools it was pm theo texted his mother with chase ax murderers in hot pursuit wont make it please take care of judge love a few minutes later she replied so nice to hear from you be safe love mom chapter theo found a bag of pretzels and two diet drinks in the small kitchen where the boone amp boone firm waged quiet battles over food the rules were simple if you brought food that was not to be shared then put your initials on it and hope for the best otherwise everything was fair game reality though was more complicated the borrowing of food from someones private stash was commonplace and not entirely frowned upon courtesy demanded that if food was borrowed it should be replaced as soon as possible this led to all sorts of pranks mr boone referred to the kitchen as a minefield and refused to go near it theo suspected the pretzels and drinks belonged to dorothy a secretary who was eternally trying to lose weight he made a mental note to replenish her supply chase had suggested they go to the high school at pm to watch strattenburg play its first basketball game of the season and theo agreed he was tired of the internet and considered their work useless but he had one last idea since the parties were at state last night lets go through each fraternity there do a random check of several facebook pages and look at photos you said there were ten parties right chase was crunching on a thick pretzel yes with four giving the name of the band that leaves six parties with unknown bands and what exactly are we looking for anything that might identify plunder electric lights a banner the bands name on the bass drum anything so what if we find out that the band played at a frat party last night at nc state does that mean theyre playing tonight at unc maybe look chase were just guessing here all right were throwing darts in the dark you got that right you have a better idea not at the moment theo sent chase the links to three fraternities sigma nu has eighty members chase said how many lets do five from each fraternity pick them at random of course youll have to use pages with open profiles and no security i know i know theo went to the page of a chi psi member named buddy ziles a sophomore from atlanta buddy had a lot of friends and hundreds of photos but nothing from a party the night before theo plowed ahead as did chase with little being said both boys were soon bored by the endless shots of groups of students posing yelling dancing always with a beer in hand chase perked up and said i got some shots from last night a party with a band he went through the photos slowly and then said nothing a hundred photos later theo stopped cold blinked twice and zoomed in he was on the unsecured facebook page of an alpha nu brother named vince snyder a sophomore from dc who had posted a dozen photos from last nights dance chase come here theo said as if he were watching a ghost chase scurried around behind theo and leaned in theo pointed to the screen the photo was a typical party shot with a mob of kids dancing you see that he said yes what is it its a minnesota twins jacket navy with redandwhite lettering in the center was a small dance floor and whoever took the photo did so with the intent of capturing some friends as they moved to the music one girl in particular had a very short skirt and theo figured that was the reason for the photo to the left of the dance floor almost in the middle of the mob was the lead singer holding a guitar mouth open eyes closed wailing away and just beyond him was the point where theo was pointing behind a set of tall speakers there was a small person who appeared to be watching the crowd the person was standing sideways and only the t and w of the word twins were visible across the back of the jacket the person had short hair and though most of her face was lost in the shadows there was no doubt in theos mind it was april and as of pm the time of the photo she was very much alive are you sure chase asked leaning closer their noses almost touching the screen i gave her that twins jacket last year after i won it in a contest it was too small for me i told the police about it and they said they never found it in her house they assume she was wearing it when she left theo pointed again and said look at the short hair and the profile chase its gotta be april dont you agree maybe i dont know its her theo said both boys backed away and then theo stood up and walked around the room her mother had not been home for three straight nights she was scared to death so she called her father or maybe he called her anyway he drove through the night got home unlocked the door with his key got april and away they went for the past four days shes been on the road just hanging out with the band shouldnt we call the police theo was walking pacing thinking rubbing his chin as he pondered the situation no not yet maybe later lets do thissince we know where she was last night lets try and figure out where shell be tonight lets call every fraternity and sorority at unc duke wake forest and the rest of them until we find out where plunder is playing tonight unc is the hot spot chase said there are at least a dozen frat parties give me the list theo worked the phone as chase watched and took notes at the first fraternity house no one answered the phone the second call was to the kappa delta sorority house and the young lady who answered the phone was not sure what their bands name was the third call went unanswered at the delta house a brother gave the name of another band and on it went theo was growing frustrated again but he was also thrilled to know that april had not been harmed and he was determined to find her the eighth call was magic a student at the kappa theta fraternity house said he knew nothing about a band was late for the football game but to hang on a minute he returned to the phone and said yep its a band called plunder what time do they start playing theo asked whenever usually around nine gotta run pal the pretzels were gone the truth was that theo had no idea what to do chase felt strongly that they should call the police but theo wasnt so sure two things were certain at least to theo one the girl in the photo was april two she was with the band and the band would be playing at the kappa theta house in chapel hill north carolina that night instead of calling the police theo called ike twenty minutes later theo chase and judge ran up the stairs to ikes office he had been eating lunch in the greek deli downstairs when theo called he and chase introduced themselves as theo found the photo of april on ikes desktop computer thats her theo declared ike studied the photo carefully his reading glasses perched on the tip of his nose are you sure theo gave the history of the jacket he described her height hairstyle and hair color and pointed at the profile of her nose and chin thats april he said if you say so shes with her father just like you said ike jack leeper had nothing to do with her disappearance the police have been chasing the wrong man ike nodded and smiled but was not the least bit smug he continued to stare at his computer screen chase thinks we should notify the police theo said i sure do chase said why not let me think about it ike said as he pushed back his chair and jumped to his feet he turned on his stereo and walked around the office finally he said i dont like the idea of notifying the police at least not right now heres what might happen the police here would call the police in chapel hill and were not sure what they would do down there they would probably go to the party and try and find april this might be more difficult than you think lets assume its a large party with lots of students celebrating and drinking and other stuff and anything might happen when the police show up the police might be smart maybe theyre not maybe they have no interest in a girl whos just hanging around while her father plays in a band maybe the girl doesnt want to be rescued by the police a lot of things might happen and most of them not good theres no warrant out for the arrest of her father because the police here havent charged him with anything hes not a suspect yet ike paced along behind his desk as the boys watched every move and hung on every word and without a positive identification im not sure the police here would do anything in the first place he fell into his chair and stared at the photo he frowned pinched his nose and rubbed his whiskers i know its her theo said but what if it isnt theo ike said gravely theres more than one twins jacket in the world you cant see her eyes you know its april because you really want it to be april youre desperate for it to be april but what if youre wrong lets say we go to the police right now and they get excited and call their buddies down in chapel hill who also get excited and tonight they go to the party and a cant find the girl or b find the girl and its not april wed look pretty stupid wouldnt we there was a long heavy pause as the boys considered how stupid they would look if they were wrong finally chase spoke why dont we tell her mother ill bet she could identify her own daughter then its out of our hands i dont think so ike said that womans crazy and she might do anything its not in aprils best interests to have her mother involved at this point from what i hear shes driving the police crazy and theyre trying to avoid her another long pause as all three looked at the walls theo said so what do we do ike the smartest thing to do is to go get the girl bring her back then call the police and it has to be done by someone she trusts someone like you theo theos jaw dropped his mouth flew open but no words came out thats a long bike ride chase said tell your parents theo and get them to drive you down there you have to confront april make sure shes okay and bring her back immediately theres no time to waste my parents arent here ike theyre in briar springs for the state bar convention and wont be back until tomorrow im staying with chase tonight ike looked at chase and asked could your parents make the trip chase was already shaking his head no i dont think so i cant see them getting involved in something like this besides theyre having dinner with some friends tonight and its a big deal theo looked at his uncle and saw in his eyes the unmistakable twinkle of a kid ready for an adventure looks like youre the man ike theo said and as you say theres no time to waste chapter the adventure immediately faced some serious problems theo thought about his parents and whether or not he should tell them ike thought about his car and knew it couldnt make the trip chase thought about the fact that theo was supposed to spend the night at his house and it seemed impossible that his absence would go unnoticed as for his parents theo did not like the idea of calling them and asking permission to take off to chapel hill ike thought this was a good planchase was neutralbut theo resisted such a call would ruin their trip upset their speeches and seminars and so on and besides theo figured his parents especially his mother would say no then he would be faced with the decision to obey or not ike thought he could smooth things out and convince woods and marcella that the trip was urgent but theo wouldnt budge he believed in being honest with his parents and he concealed little from them but this was different if they brought april back then everyone including his parents would be so thrilled that theo would likely avoid trouble ikes car was a triumph spitfire a notoriously unreliable old sports car with only two seats a convertible roof that leaked tires that were nearly bald and an engine that made strange sounds theo loved the car but often wondered how it managed to putter around town and they needed four seatsike theo judge and hopefully april his parents had left in his mothers car his fathers suv was in the garage ready to go ike decided he could borrow the vehicle from his own brother especially in light of the importance of their mission the most serious problem would be chases he would have to hide theos absence from the whipple home throughout the night they discussed the possibility of informing chases parents ike even volunteered to call them and explain what they were doing but theo thought it was a bad idea mrs whipple was a lawyer too and had plenty to say about almost everything and there was no doubt in theos mind that she would immediately call his mother and ruin their plans there was another reason theo wanted ike to stay quietikes reputation among lawyers was not good theo could easily imagine mrs whipple freaking out at the thought of ike boone racing off with his nephew on some crazy road trip at pm theo texted his mother still alive with chase hanging out luv theo expected no response because at that moment his mother was in the middle of her presentation at theo and chase parked their bikes in the whipple driveway and went inside mrs whipple was pulling a tray of brownies from the oven she threw her arms around theo welcomed him to their home said she was so happy to have him as a guest and so on she tended to be overly dramatic theo sat his red nike overnight bag on the table so she couldnt miss it as she served them brownies and milk chase said they were thinking about going to the movies then maybe watching the volleyball game at stratten college volleyball mrs whipple asked i love volleyball chase said the game starts at six and should be over around eight well be fine mom its just at the college in truth the volleyball game was the only sports event on campus that evening and girls volleyball at that neither chase nor theo had ever watched a game live or on tv whats on at the movies she asked still cutting brownies into squares harry potter theo said if we hustle now we can catch most of it chase chimed in and then well go to the game is that okay mom i suppose she said are you and dad still going out for dinner yes with the coleys and the shepherds what time will you be home chase asked glancing at theo oh i dont know ten or ten thirty daphne will be here and she wants to order a pizza is that okay sure chase said with a little luck theo and ike should be in chapel hill by pm the tricky part would be avoiding daphne from eight until ten chase didnt have a plan but he was working on it they thanked her for the snack and said they were leaving for the paramount strattenburgs oldfashioned movie house on main street after they were gone mrs whipple carried theos overnight bag upstairs to chases room and placed it on a twin bed at pm theo ike and judge left the boone home in the suv chase was watching the latest harry potter alone mapquest estimated the travel time at seven hours if one obeyed all speed limits which was the furthest thing from ikes mind as they hurried out of town ike said are you nervous yes im nervous and why are you nervous i guess im nervous about getting caught if mrs whipple finds out then shell call my mother and my mother will call me and im in big trouble why would you get in trouble theo youre trying to help a friend im being dishonest ike dishonest with the whipples dishonest with my parents look at the big picture theo if all goes well tomorrow morning well be back home with april your parents and everyone else in town will be thrilled to see her under the circumstances this is the right thing to do it might be a little misleading but theres no other way to do it it still makes me nervous im your uncle theo whats wrong with me and my favorite nephew taking a little road trip nothing i guess then stop worrying the only thing that matters is finding april and getting her back home nothing else is important right now if it all blows up ill have a little chat with your parents and ill take all the blame relax thanks ike they were racing down the highway in light traffic judge was already asleep on the backseat theos phone vibrated it was a text from chase this movie is awesome u guys ok theo responded yep ok at pm he texted his mother harry potter movie is awesome a few minutes later she answered great love mom they turned onto the expressway and ike set the cruise control on seventyfive ten miles over the limit theo said explain something to me ike the story about april has been all over the news right right then wouldnt april or her father or one of the guys in the band see the story on the news and realize whats going on wouldnt they know about the big search for april you would think so unfortunately though there are a lot of missing children seems like a new one every other day and while its big news around here maybe its not big news where they are who knows what her father has told his pals in the band im sure they know the family is not too stable maybe hes told them that the mother is crazy and he was forced to rescue his daughter and that he wants it kept quiet until some point in the future the band members might be afraid to say anything these guys are not too stable either its a bunch of fortyyearold men trying to be rock stars up all night sleeping all day traveling around in a rented van playing for peanuts in bars and frat houses theyre probably all running from something i dont know theo it makes no sense ill bet shes scared to death scared and confused a child deserves better than this what if she doesnt want to leave her father if we find her and she refuses to come with us then we have no choice but to call the police in strattenburg and tell them where she is its that simple nothing seemed simple to theo what if her father sees us and causes trouble just relax theo itll work out it was dark at when chase texted again vball girls r cute where r u theo answered somewhere n virginia ikes flying it was dark now and the hectic week finally caught up with theo he began to nod off and then fell into a deep sleep chapter late in the volleyball game chase realized that the only way to avoid daphne was to avoid his house altogether he could almost see her sitting in the family room in the basement watching the bigscreen tv waiting for him and theo to arrive so she could order an extralarge pizza from santos when the game was over chase rode his bike to guffs frozen yogurt near the city library on main street he ordered one scoop of banana found an empty booth by the front window and called home daphne answered after the first ring its me he said and look we have a problem theo and i stopped by his house to check on his dog and the dog is real sick mustve eaten something weird throwing up crapping all over the place the house is a mess gross daphne gushed you wouldnt believe dog poop from the kitchen to the bedroom were cleaning up now but itll take some time theos afraid the dog might be dying and hes trying to get in touch with his mother thats awful yep we may have to take him to the vet emergency room poor thing can hardly move can i help chase i can drive moms car over and get him maybe but not right now we gotta get this place cleaned up while were watching the dog im afraid hed make a mess in her car have you guys eaten no and food is the last thing were thinking about right now im about to throw up myself go ahead and order the pizza ill check in later chase hung up and smiled at his frozen yogurt so far so good judge was still asleep on the rear seat snoring softly as the miles flew by theo came and went napping occasionally wideeyed one moment and dead to the world the next he was awake when they crossed the state line into north carolina but he was asleep when they rolled into chapel hill his pm text to his mother read going to sleep real tired luv he assumed his parents were in the middle of their long dinner probably listening to endless speeches and that his mother would not have the chance to reply he was right wake up theo ike said were here they had not stopped in six hours the digital clock on the dash gave the time at the gps above it took them straight to franklin street the main drag that bordered the campus the sidewalks were packed with noisy students and fans unc had won the football game in overtime and the mood was rowdy the bars and shops were crowded ike turned onto columbia street and they passed some large fraternity houses parking might be a problem ike mumbled almost to himself that must be frat court he said glancing at the gps and pointing to an area where several fraternity houses faced each other with parking lots in the center id guess the kappa theta house is somewhere in there theo lowered his window as they eased by in heavy traffic loud music filled the air as several bands played from the houses people were shouldertoshoulder on the porches on the lawns sitting on cars hanging out dancing laughing moving in packs from house to house yelling at each other it was a wild scene and theo had never seen anything like it there was an occasional fight or drug bust at stratten college but nothing like this it was exciting at first but then theo thought about april she was somewhere in the midst of this huge carnival and she did not belong here she was shy and quiet and preferred to be alone with her drawings and paintings ike turned onto another street then another well have to park somewhere and hike in cars were parked everywhere most illegally they found a spot on a dark narrow street far away from the noise stay here judge theo said and judge watched them walk away whats the game plan ike theo asked they were walking quickly along a dark and uneven sidewalk watch your step ike said we dont have a game plan lets find the house find the band and ill think of something they followed the noise and were soon entering frat court from the back side away from the street they moved into the crowd and if they looked a bit odd no one seemed to noticea sixtytwoyearold man with long gray hair pulled into a ponytail red socks sandals a brown plaid sweater that was at least thirty years old and a thirteenyearold kid wideeyed in amazement the kappa theta house was a large white stone structure with some greek columns and a sweeping porch ike and theo made their way through a thick crowd up the steps and around the porch ike wanted to scope out the place check out the entrances and exits and try to determine where the band was playing the music was loud the laughter and yelling even louder theo had never seen so many cans of beer in his young life girls were dancing on the porch as their dates watched them and smoked cigarettes ike asked one of the girls wheres the band in the basement she said they inched their way back to the front steps and looked around the front door was being guarded by a large young man in a suit who seemed to have the authority to decide who got inside lets go ike said theo followed him as they moved toward the front door with a group of students they almost made it the guard or bouncer or whatever he was threw out his arm and grabbed ike by the forearm excuse me he said rudely you got a pass ike angrily yanked his arm away and looked as though he might slug the guy i dont need a pass kid he hissed im the manager of the band this is my son dont touch me again the other students moved back a few steps and for a moment things were quieter sorry sir the guard said and ike and theo marched inside ike was moving quickly as though he knew the house well and had business there they walked through a large foyer then a parlor of some sort both rooms crowded with students in another open space a mob of male students was yelling at a football game on a huge screen two kegs of beer close by the music was booming from below and they soon found a large stairway that gave way to the party room the dance floor was in the center packed with students engaged in all manner of frenzied jerking and shuffling and to the left was plunder pounding and screeching at full volume ike and theo drifted down in a throng of people and by the time they left the stairs theo felt like his ears were bleeding from the music they tried to hide in a corner the room was dark with colored strobe lights flickering across the mass of bodies ike leaned down and yelled into theos ear lets be quick ill stay here you try and get behind the band and have a look hurry theo ducked low and wiggled around bodies he got bumped shoved almost stepped on but he kept moving along the wall on the far left side the band finished a song everybody cheered and for a moment the dancing stopped he moved faster still low his eyes darting in all directions suddenly the lead singer screamed then began howling the drummer attacked and a guitarist lurched in with some thunderous chords the next song was even louder theo passed a set of large speakers came within five feet of the keyboardist and then saw april sitting on a metal box behind the drummer she had the only safe place in the entire room he practically crawled around the edge of the small platform and touched her knee before she saw him april was too shocked to move then both hands flew up to her mouth theo she said but he could barely hear her lets go he demanded what are you doing here she yelled im here to take you home at chase was hiding beside a dry cleaners watching from across the street as people were leaving robilios italian bistro he saw mr and mrs shepherd then mr and mrs coley then his parents he watched them drive away and then wondered what to do next his phone would ring in a few minutes and his mother would have a dozen questions the sick dog routine was about to come to an end chapter theo and april inched along the wall sidestepping weary dancers taking a break from the action and moved quickly through the semidarkness to a door that opened onto a stairway there was no chance her father would see them because he was lost in plunders intense version of the rolling stones i cant get no satisfaction where are we going theo yelled at april this leads outside she yelled back wait i gotta get ike who theo darted through the crowd found ike where hed left him and the three made a quick exit down the stairs and onto a small patio behind the kappa theta house the music could still be heard and the walls seemed to vibrate but things were much quieter outside ike this is april theo said april this is ike my uncle my pleasure ike said april was still too confused to respond they were alone in the dark beside a broken picnic table other patio furniture was strewn about windows on the back side of the house were broken theo said ike drove me down here to get you but why she asked what do you mean why theo shot back ike understood her confusion he took a step forward and gently placed a hand on her shoulder april back home no one knows where you are no one knows if youre dead or alive four days ago you vanished without a trace no oneincluding your mother the police your friendshas heard a word from you april began shaking her head in disbelief ike continued i suspect your father has been lying to you hes probably told you that hes talked to your mother and everything is okay back home right april nodded slightly hes lying april your mother is worried sick the entire town has been searching for you its time to go home now but we were going home in just a few days she said according to your father ike said patting her shoulder theres a good chance he will face criminal charges for your abduction april look at me ike placed a finger under her chin and slowly lifted it so that she had no choice but to look at him its time to go home lets get in the car and leave now the door opened and a man appeared with biker boots tattoos and greasy hair he was obviously not a student what are you doing april he demanded just taking a break she said he stepped closer and asked who are these guys who are you ike demanded plunder was in the middle of a song so he obviously wasnt a member of the band hes zack april said he works for the band immediately ike saw the danger and came through with some fiction he reached out with a big handshake and said im jack ford my son max here we used to live in strattenburg now were in chapel hill max and april started kindergarten together quite a band you got in there zack shook hands he was too slow to put together his thoughts he frowned as if thinking caused pain then he gave ike and theo a puzzled look april said were almost finished ill be just a minute does your dad know these guys zack asked oh sure ike said tom and i go back many years id like to talk to him during the next break if you could pass that along zack okay i guess zack said and went inside will he tell your father ike asked probably she said then we should leave april i dont know come on april theo said firmly do you trust theo ike asked of course then you can trust ike theo said lets go theo grabbed her hand and they began walking quickly away from the kappa theta house from frat court and from tom finnemore april sat in the backseat with judge and rubbed his head as ike zigzagged his way out of chapel hill nothing was said for a few minutes then theo asked should we call chase yes ike said they pulled into an allnight gas station and parked away from the pumps dial him ike said theo did so and handed the phone to ike chase answered his cell phone immediately with its about time chase this is ike we have april and were headed back where are you hiding in my backyard my parents are ready to kill me go in the house and tell them the truth ill call them in about ten minutes thanks ike ike handed the phone to theo and asked which of your parents is more likely to answer their cell phone at this time of the night my mom then get her on the phone theo punched the number and handed it back to ike mrs boone answered with a nervous theo whats the matter ike calmly said marcella this is ike how are you doing ike on theos phone why am i suddenly worried its a very long story marcella but no one is hurt everybodys fine and theres a happy ending please ike whats going on we have april you what we have april and were driving back to strattenburg where are you ike chapel hill north carolina keep talking theo found her and we took a little road trip to get her shes been with her father the entire time sort of hanging out theo found april in chapel hill mrs boone repeated slowly yep again its a long story and well fill in the details later well be home early in the morning id guess between six and seven that is if i can stay awake all night and drive does her mother know not yet i was thinking that she should call her mom tell her whats up yes ike and the sooner the better well check out now and drive home well be there when you get there great marcella and im sure well be starving got it ike they passed the phone back and forth again and ike spoke to mr whipple he explained the situation assured him everything was fine heaped praise on chase for helping find april apologized for the deception and confusion and promised to check in later ike pulled over to the pumps filled the tank and when he went inside to pay theo took judge for a quick walk when they were on the road again ike said over his shoulder april do you want to call your mother i guess she said theo handed her his cell phone she tried her house but there was no answer she tried her mothers mobile and there was no service what a surprise april said shes not there chapter ike had a tall cup of coffee which he gulped down in an effort to stay awake just a few miles out of town he said okay kids heres the deal its midnight we have a long way to go and im already sleepy talk to me i want chatter if i fall asleep at the wheel we all die understand go theo you talk then april its your turn theo turned and looked at april who is jack leeper april had judges head in her lap she answered a distant cousin i think why who told you about him hes in strattenburg in jail he escaped from prison in california a week or so ago and he showed up in town about the time you disappeared his face has been all over the newspapers ike said the police thought he snatched you and took off theo added back and forth they went tagteaming as they told leepers story his mug shots on the front page his dramatic capture by the swat team his vague threats about hiding aprils body and so on april who was overwhelmed by the events of the past hour seemed unable to digest the entire story ive never met him she mumbled softly over and over ike slurped his coffee and said the newspaper said you wrote him letters you guys were pen pals that right yes about a year ago we started writing she said my mother said we are distant cousins though i could never find him in our family tree its not your normal family tree anyway she said he was serving a long sentence in california and was looking for a pen pal i wrote him he wrote back it was kind of fun he seemed to be very lonely ike said they found your letters in his cell after he escaped he showed up in strattenburg so the police assumed he came after you i cant believe this she said my father told me he talked to my mom and that he talked to the people at the school and that everyone agreed that i would be gone for a week or so no problem i shouldve known better your father must be a pretty good liar ike said hes one of the best april said hes never told me the truth i dont know why i believed him this time you were scared april theo said omigosh she said its midnight the band is quitting what will he do when he realizes im gone hell get a dose of his own medicine ike said should we call him theo asked he doesnt use a cell phone april said says it makes it too easy for people to find him i shouldve left a note or something they thought about this for a few miles ike seemed refreshed and not at all sleepy aprils voice was stronger and she was over the shock what about that zack creep theo asked could we call him i dont know his number whats his last name ike asked i dont know that either i tried to keep my distance from zack another mile or two passed ike knocked back some coffee and said heres whatll happen when they cant find you zack will replay the story of seeing you with us hell try and remember our namesjack and max ford formerly of strattenburg but now living in chapel hilland if he can then theyll scramble around trying to find our phone number when they cant find us theyll assume youre at our house just old friends catching up after all these years thats a stretch april said its the best i can do i shouldve left a note are you really that worried about your father theo asked look at what this guy did he took you away in the middle of the night didnt tell a single person and for the past four days the entire town has been worried sick your poor mother is out of her mind i dont have much sympathy for him april ive never liked him she said but i shouldve left a note too late ike said they found a body on thursday theo said and the whole town thought you were dead a body she said ike looked at theo and theo looked at ike and away they went theo began with the story about their search party roaming through strattenburg passing out flyers offering a reward poking around empty buildings dodging the police and finally watching from across the river as the police pulled someone from the yancey river ike added a few details here and there theo said we thought you were dead april left floating in the river by jack leeper mrs gladwell called us into assembly to try and cheer us up but we knew you were dead im so sorry its not your fault ike said blame your father theo turned around looked at her and said its really good to see you april ike smiled to himself his coffee cup was empty they left north carolina crossed into virginia and ike stopped for more coffee a few minutes after am ikes cell phone vibrated he fished it out of a pocket and said hello it was his brother woods boone calling to chat he and mrs boone had just arrived home in strattenburg and they wanted an update on the road trip both kids were asleep as was the dog and ike spoke softly they were making good time there was no traffic no weather and so far no radar not surprisingly theos parents were extremely curious about how he found april marcella picked up on another phone and ike told the story of theo and chase whipple playing detectives tracking down the bandwith a bit of ikes helpthen randomly poring over thousands of facebook photos until they got lucky once they confirmed the band was in the area they started calling fraternities and sororities and got lucky again ike assured them april was fine he relayed her version of all the lies her father had told her theos parents were still in disbelief but also amused and they were not really surprised that theo had not only found april but went to get her when the conversation was over ike shifted his weight tried to stretch his right leg wiggled here and there in his seat and then suddenly almost fell asleep thats it he yelled wake up you two he punched theo on the left shoulder ruffled his hair and said at high volume i almost ran off the road you guys want to die no theo wake up and talk to me april its your turn tell us a story april was rubbing her eyes trying to wake up and understand why this crazy man was yelling at them even judge looked confused at that moment ike hit the brakes and came to an abrupt stop on the shoulder of the road he jumped out of the suv and jogged around it three times an wheeler honked as it roared by ike got in yanked his seat belt into place then took off april he said loudly talk to me i want to know exactly what happened when you left with your father sure ike she said afraid not to tell the story i was asleep she began tuesday night or wednesday morning ike asked what time was it i dont know it was after midnight because i was still awake at midnight then i fell asleep your mother was not there theo asked no she was not i talked to you on the phone waited and waited for her to come home then fell asleep someone was banging on my door at first i thought it was a dream another nightmare but then i realized it wasnt and this was even more terrifying someone was in the house a man banging on my door and calling my name i was so scared i couldnt think i couldnt see i couldnt move then i realized it was my father he was home for the first time in a week i opened the door he asked where my mother was i said i didnt know she had not been home the last two or three nights he started cursing and he told me to change clothes we were leaving hurry up and so we left as we drove away i thought to myselfleaving is better than staying id rather be in the car with my father than in the house all alone she paused for a second ike was wide awake as was theo both wanted to look back and see if she was crying but they did not we drove for awhile maybe two hours i think we were close to dc when we stopped at a motel next to the interstate we spent the night there in the same room when i woke up he was gone i waited he came back with egg mcmuffins and orange juice while we were eating he told me he had found my mother had a long talk with her and she had agreed that it would be better for me if i stayed with him for a few days maybe a week maybe longer she admitted according to him that she was having some problems and needed help he told me that he had spoken to the principal at the school and she had agreed it would be wise if i stayed away from home she would help me get extra tutoring if i needed it when i returned i asked him the name of the principal and of course he didnt know it i remember thinking how odd but then it would not be unusual for my father to forget someones name ten seconds after a conversation with her theo glanced back april was gazing out the side window seeing nothing just chatting pleasantly with an odd smile on her face we left that motel and drove to charlottesville virginia the band played that nightwednesday i guess it wasat a place called millers its an old bar thats now famous because its where the dave matthews band got its start i love that band theo said theyre okay ike said a wiser voice from an older generation my father thought it was so cool playing at millers howd you get in the bar when youre thirteen years old theo asked i dont know i was with the band its not like i was drinking and smoking the next day we drove to another town maybe it was roanoke where the band played to an empty house in an old music hall what day was that thursday ike said then we drove to raleigh were you in the van with the band ike asked no my father had his car as did two other guys we always followed the van zack was the driver and the roadie my father kept me away from the other band members these guys fight and bicker worse than a bunch of little kids and drugs ike asked yes and drinking and girls its silly and kinda sad to watch fortyyearold men trying to act cool in front of a bunch of college girls but not my father he was by far the best behaved thats because you were around ike said i suppose how about a pit stop ike theo said pointing to a busy exit ahead sure i need some more coffee where are we going when we get to strattenburg april asked where do you want to go ike asked im not sure i want to go to my house she said lets go to theos his mother is trying to find your mother i suspect shell be there and shell be thrilled to see you chapter there were some additional cars in the boone driveway when ike rolled up at ten minutes after am on sunday morning his old spitfire was right where hed left it beside it was a black sedan very official looking and behind the spitfire was the strangest car in towna brightyellow hearse once owned by a funeral home but now the property of may finnemore shes here april said neither ike nor theo could tell if this pleased her or not it was still dark when they parked judge leaped from the vehicle and ran to the holly bushes beside the porch his favorite place to relieve himself the front door flew open and may finnemore came sprinting out already crying and reaching for her daughter they embraced in the front yard for a long time and as they did so ike theo and judge eased inside theo got hugged by his mother then said hello to detective slater whod obviously been invited to join the party after all the greetings and congratulations theo asked his mother where did you find mrs finnemore she was at a neighbors house detective slater said i knew about it shes been too afraid to stay at home what about leaving april home alone theo almost blurted any word from tom finnemore ike asked we left in a hurry and did not leave a note nothing replied the detective no surprise there you must be exhausted mrs boone said ike smiled and said well as a matter of fact the answer is yes and quite hungry theo and i have just spent the past fourteen hours on the road with little to eat and no sleep at least for me theo and april managed to nap a bit the dog though slept for hours whats for breakfast everything mrs boone said howd you find her theo mr boone asked unable to conceal his pride its a long story dad and i gotta use the restroom first theo disappeared and the front door opened mrs finnemore and april entered both in tears both smiling mrs boone could not restrain herself and gave april a long hug were so happy youre back she said detective slater introduced himself to april who was exhausted and unsettled and a little embarrassed by all the attention its great to see you kid slater said thank you april said softly look we can talk later the detective said as he faced mrs finnemore but i need to spend about five minutes with her right now cant this wait demanded mrs boone taking a step closer to april of course it can mrs boone except for one small matter that i need to explore now after that ill get out of here and leave you alone no one is asking you to leave detective mr boone said i understand just give me five minutes theo returned and the boones left the den and headed for the kitchen where the thick smell of sausage hung in the air mrs finnemore and april sat on the sofa and the detective pulled a chair close he spoke in a low voice april were thrilled that youre back home safe and sound were looking at the possibility of kidnapping charges ive discussed it with your mother and i need to ask you a couple of questions okay she said timidly first when you left with your father did you agree to do so did he force you to leave april looked confused she glanced at her mother but her mother was staring at her boots slater continued kidnapping requires evidence that the victim was forced to leave against her will april slowly shook her head and said i was not forced to leave i wanted to leave i was very frightened slater took a deep breath and looked at may who was still avoiding all eye contact all right he said the second questionwere you held against your will did you want to leave at any time but were told you could not do so with kidnapping there are rare cases where a victim went away without objection without force sort of voluntarily but then as time passed the victim changed her mind and wanted to go home but her captor refused at that point it became a kidnapping is this what happened april crossed her arms over her chest gritted her teeth and said no that did not happen to me my father was lying the whole time he convinced me that he was in contact with my mother that things were all right here and that we would come home eventually he never said when but it would not be long i never thought about running away but i certainly could have i wasnt guarded or locked up another deep breath by the detective as his case continued to slip away one last question he said were you harmed in any way by my father no he might be a liar and a creep and a lousy father but he would never harm me nor would he let anyone else i never felt threatened i felt alone and scared and confused but thats not unusual for me even here in strattenburg april mrs finnemore said softly detective slater stood and said this will not be a criminal matter it should be dealt with in the civil courts he walked into the kitchen thanked all the boones there and left after he was gone april and her mother joined the boones around the kitchen table for a hearty breakfast of sausage pancakes and scrambled eggs after the plates were served the food properly blessed and everyone had taken a bite or two ike said slater couldnt wait to get out of here because hes too embarrassed the police spent four days playing games with leeper and theo solved the case in about two hours howd you do it theo his father demanded and i want the details lets hear it his mother piped in theo swallowed some eggs and looked around the table everyone was looking at him he smiled at first a nasty little grin then a fullblown eartoear blast of orthodontic metal that was instantly contagious april already beyond braces flashed a beautiful smile unable to suppress it theo started laughing detective slater drove straight to the jail where he met detective capshaw together they waited in a small holding room while jack leeper was startled from his sleep handcuffed and practically dragged down the hall in his orange jumpsuit and orange rubber shower shoes two deputies hauled him into the holding room and sat him down in a metal chair the handcuffs were not removed leeper his eyes still swollen and his face unshaven looked at slater and capshaw and said good morning you boys are up mighty early wheres the girl leeper slater growled well well so youre back you boys ready to make a deal this time yep we got a deal a really good deal for you leeper but first you gotta tell us how far away the girl is just give us some idea five miles fifty five hundred leeper smiled at this he rubbed his beard on his sleeve grinned and said shes about a hundred miles away slater and capshaw laughed i say something funny youre such a lying scumbag leeper slater said i guess youll lie all the way to your grave capshaw took a step forward and said the girls home with her momma leeper seems she took off with her father and spent a few days on the run now shes back safe and sound thank god she never met you you want a deal leeper slater said heres your deal were dropping all charges here and were gonna speed up your shipment back to california weve talked to the authorities there and theyve got a special place for you as an escapee maximum security youll never see daylight leepers mouth opened but no words came out slater said to the deputies take him back then he and capshaw left the room at am sunday morning the strattenburg police department issued a statement to the press it read at approximately six oclock this morning april finnemore returned to strattenburg and was reunited with her mother she is safe healthy in good spirits and was not harmed in any way we are continuing our investigation into this matter and will interrogate her father tom finnemore as soon as possible the news was instantly broadcast on television and radio it roared through the internet at dozens of churches announcements were made to applause and thanksgiving the entire town took a deep breath smiled and thanked god for a miracle april missed it all she was sound asleep in a small bedroom where the boones sometimes kept their guests she did not want to go home at least not for a few hours a neighbor called may finnemore and relayed the news that their home was under siege from reporters and said it would be wise to stay away until the mob left woods boone suggested that she park her ridiculous vehicle in their garage otherwise someone would likely see it and know precisely where april was hiding theo and judge took a long nap in their upstairs bedroom chapter when the students at strattenburg middle school returned to class on monday morning they expected a little excitement this would not be a typical monday a dark cloud had hung over the school since aprils disappearance and now it was gone just a few days earlier everyone presumed her dead now she was back and not only had she been found shed been rescued by one of their own theos daring mission to chapel hill to pluck her from her fathers captivity was quickly becoming a legend the arriving students were not disappointed before daybreak half a dozen television vans were parked haphazardly around the wide circular drive at the entrance of the school reporters were all over the place with photographers waiting for a glimpse of something this upset mrs gladwell and she called the police a confrontation took place angry words were exchanged arrests were threatened the police eventually moved the mob off school property so the cameras were set up across the street as this was happening the buses began arriving and the students witnessed some of the conflict the bell rang at for homeroom but there was no sign of theo and april in mr mounts room chase whipple briefed the class on his participation in the search and rescue which was received with rapt attention on his facebook page theo had posted a short version of what happened and he gave plenty of credit to chase at mrs gladwell again called all eighth graders to assembly as they filed in the mood was in stark contrast to the last gathering now the kids were lighthearted laughing and anxious to see april and forget this experience theo and april sneaked into the rear of the school met mr mount near the cafeteria and hustled to assembly where they were mobbed by their classmates and hugged by their teachers april was anxious and obviously uncomfortable with the attention for theo though it was his finest hour later that morning marcella boone appeared in family court to file a petition asking for the appointment of a temporary legal guardian for april finnemore such a petition could be filed by any person concerned about the safety and wellbeing of any child there was no requirement that notice be given to the child or to its parents when the petition was filed but a temporary guardian would not be appointed unless good cause was shown to the court the judge was a large old man with a head full of curly white hair and a white beard and round rosy cheeks that reminded a lot of people of santa claus his name was judge jolly in spite of his name he was pious and strict and because of this and because of his appearance he was known behind his back all over town as st nick he reviewed the petition while sitting on the bench then asked mrs boone any sign of tom finnemore mrs boone had spent most of her career in family court and knew st nick extremely well she said i have been told that he called his wife last night and they talked for the first time in weeks supposedly he will return home this afternoon and no criminal charges are expected the police are treating this as a civil matter not a criminal one do you have a recommendation as to who i should appoint as temporary guardian i do who me youre asking to be appointed thats correct your honor i know this situation very well i know this child her mother and to a much lesser extent her father im very concerned about what will happen to april and im willing to serve as her temporary guardian for no fee thats a good deal for everyone mrs boone st nick said with a rare smile you are hereby appointed whats your plan i would like to have an immediate hearing before this court as soon as possible to determine where april should live for the next few days granted when as soon as possible your honor if mr finnemore returns today ill make sure he is immediately notified of the hearing how about am tomorrow perfect tom finnemore arrived home late monday afternoon plunders tour was over and so was the band itself the members had quarreled almost nonstop for two weeks and they made little money and they felt as though tom had dragged them into his family mess by snatching his daughter and keeping her with him april was just one of the many things they had fought over their biggest problem was that they were all middleaged now and too old to be playing for peanuts in frat houses and beer halls at home tom was met by his wife who said little and his daughter who said even less the women were united in their opposition to his presence but tom was too tired to fight he went to the basement and locked the door an hour later a deputy arrived and handed him a summons to court first thing in the morning chapter after a few hours of tense negotiations it was finally decided that theo could skip school tuesday morning and go to court at first his parents said no way but it became apparent that theo was not about to back down april was his friend he knew a lot about her family he had indeed rescued her something he reminded his parents of several times she might need his support and so on mr and mrs boone finally got tired of arguing and said yes but his father warned him about his homework and his mother warned him that he would not be allowed inside the courtroom in family court matters dealing with children were always handled behind locked doors theo thought he knew a way around this and he had a backup plan in the event st nick tossed him out of the courtroom the tossing happened rather fast in family court all issues were decided by the judges either st nick or judge judy ping pingpong as she was known again behind her back most of the judges in the stratten county courthouse had a nickname or two there were no juries and very few spectators therefore the two courtrooms used for divorce trials child custody disputes adoptions and dozens of other cases were much smaller than the courtrooms where juries were used and crowds gathered and it was not unusual for the atmosphere to be tense when family court was called to order it was indeed tense on tuesday morning theo and mrs boone arrived early and she allowed him to sit at her table as they waited she pored over documents while theo caught up on important matters with his laptop the three finnemores entered together mr gooch one of an army of old semiretired deputies who killed time in court as uniformed bailiffs directed tom finnemore to his table on the left side of the room may finnemore was sent to hers on the right side of the room april sat with mrs boone in the center directly in front of the judges bench theo thought it was a good sign that the family had arrived together he would find out later that april rode her bike her mother drove her yellow hearse minus the monkey and her father walked for the exercise they met at the front door of the courthouse and came in together down the hall in criminal court judge henry gantry preferred the traditional somewhat dramatic entry in which the bailiff makes everyone jump to their feet while he barks out all rise for the court and so on as the judge enters with his black robe flowing behind him theo preferred this too if only for the showmanship there was an excellent chance he would one day become a great judge much like henry gantry and he certainly planned to stick to the more formal opening of court in what other job can an entire room of people regardless of their age job or education be required to stand in solemn respect as you enter the room theo could think of only threequeen of england president of the united states and judge st nick cared little for formalities he walked in through a side door followed by the clerk he stepped up to the bench took his seat in a battered leather rocker and looked around the room good morning he said gruffly there were a few mumbled replies tom finnemore i presume he asked looking at aprils father mr finnemore stood nonchalantly and said thats me welcome home do i need a lawyer keep your seat sir no you do not need a lawyer maybe later mr finnemore sat down with a smirk theo looked at him and tried to remember him from the frenzy of the frat party last saturday night he was the bands drummer and had been partially hidden by the tools of his trade he sort of looked familiar but then theo had not had the time to examine plunder tom finnemore was a nicelooking man respectable in some ways he was wearing cowboy boots and jeans but his sports coat was stylish and you are may finnemore st nick asked nodding to the right yes sir and mrs boone you are with april yes sir st nick glared down at theo for a few seconds then said theo what are you doing here april asked me to be here oh she did are you a witness i could be st nick managed a smile his reading glasses were perched far down at the end of his nose and when he smiled which didnt happen often his eyes twinkled and he did in fact resemble santa claus you could also be a lawyer a bailiff or a clerk couldnt you theo i suppose you could also be the judge and decide this matter couldnt you probably mrs boone is there any legitimate reason for your son to be in this courtroom during this hearing not really mrs boone said theo go to school the bailiff stepped toward theo and gently waved an arm toward the door theo grabbed his backpack and said thanks mom he whispered to april see you at school and then took off however he had no plans to go to school he left his backpack on a bench outside the courtroom ran downstairs to the snack bar bought a large root beer in a paper cup ran back up the stairs and when no one was looking dropped the drink onto the shiny marble floor ice and root beer splashed and ran into a wide circle theo did not slow down he jogged down the hall past family court around a corner to a small room that served as a utility closet storage area and napping place of mr speedy cobb the oldest and slowest janitor in the history of stratten county as expected speedy was resting catching a quick nap before the rigors of the day kicked in speedy i dropped a drink down the hall its a mess theo said urgently hello theo what are you doing here the same question every time he saw theo speedy was getting to his feet grabbing a mop just hanging out im really sorry about this theo said with a mop and a bucket speedy eventually made it down the hall he scratched his chin and inspected the spill as if the operation would take hours and require great skill theo watched him for a few seconds and then retreated to speedys little room the cramped and dirty place where speedy napped was next to a slightly larger room where supplies were stored quickly theo climbed up the shelves passing rows of paper towels toilet paper and sanitizer above the top shelf was a crawl space dark and narrow with an air vent to one side below the air vent some fifteen feet away was the desk of st nick himself from his secret cubbyhole known only to himself theo could see nothing but he could hear every word chapter st nick was saying the issue before this court is the temporary placement of april finnemore not legal custody but placement i have a preliminary report from social services that recommends that april be placed in foster care until other matters can be resolved those other matters might and i repeat the word might include divorce proceedings criminal charges against the father psychiatric evaluations of both parents and so on we cannot anticipate all of the legal battles that lie ahead my job today is to decide where to place april while her parents attempt to bring some order to their lives this preliminary report concludes with the belief that she is not safe at home mrs boone have you had time to read the report yes your honor do you agree with it yes and no your honor last night april was at home with both parents in the house and she felt safe the night before she was at home with her mother and she felt safe but last week on monday night and tuesday night she was at home alone and had no idea where either parent was around midnight tuesday her father showed up and because she was terrified she left with him now we all know the rest of the story april wants to be at home with her parents but im not sure her parents want to be home with her perhaps your honor we should hear from her parents precisely mr finnemore what are your plans for the near future do you plan to stay at home or leave tour again with your rock band or finally give it up get a job or continue to drift here and there file for divorce or get some professional help a clue here mr finnemore give us some idea of what we can expect from you tom finnemore hunkered down under the barrage of loaded questions suddenly aimed at him for a long time he said nothing everyone waited and waited and after a while it appeared as though he had no response but when he spoke his voice was scratchy almost cracking i dont know judge i just dont know i took april last week because she was scared to death and we had no idea where may was after we left i called several times never got an answer and as time passed i guess i quit calling it never occurred to me that the whole town would think she had been kidnapped and murdered it was a big mistake on my part im really sorry he wiped his eyes cleared his throat and continued i think the rock tours are over kind of a deadend road you know to answer your question judge i plan to be at home a lot more id like to spend more time with april but im not sure about spending time with her mother have the two of you discussed a divorce judge weve been married for twentyfour years and we separated the first time after two months of marriage divorce has always been a hot topic whats your response to the reports conclusion that april be removed from your home and placed somewhere safe please dont do that sir ill stay home i promise im not sure what may will do but i can promise this court that one of us will be at home for april that sounds good mr finnemore but frankly you dont have a lot of credibility with me right now i know judge and i understand but please dont take her away he wiped his eyes again and went silent st nick waited then turned to the other side of the room and said and you may finnemore had a tissue in both hands and looked as though shed been crying for days she mumbled and stammered before finding her voice its not a great home judge i guess that much is obvious but its our home its aprils home her room is there her clothes and books and things maybe her parents are not always there but well do better you cant take april out of her home and put her with strangers please dont do that and your plans mrs finnemore more of the same or are you willing to change your ways may finnemore pulled papers out of a file and gave them to the bailiff who in turn handed each one to the judge mr finnemore and mrs boone this is a letter from my therapist he explains that im under his care now and that he is optimistic about my improvement everyone read the letter though couched in medical terms the bottom line was that may had emotional problems and to deal with them she had gotten herself mixed up with various and unnamed prescription drugs she continued he has enrolled me in a rehab program as an outpatient im tested every morning at eight am when did you start this program st nick asked last week i went to see the therapist after april disappeared im much better already i promise your honor st nick put the letter down and looked at april id like to hear from you he said with a warm smile what are your thoughts april what do you want in a voice much stronger than either parent april began well judge what i want is something thats impossible i want what every kid wantsa normal home and a normal family but that is not what i have we dont do normal and ive learned to live with that my brother and sister learned to live with it they left home as soon as possible and theyre doing okay out in the world they survived and ill survive too if i can have a little help i want a father who doesnt leave for a month without saying goodbye and without calling home i want a mother wholl protect me i can deal with a lot of the crazy stuff as long as they dont run away her voice began to break but she was determined to finish im leaving too as soon as i can until then though please dont abandon me she looked at her father and saw nothing but tears she looked at her mother and saw the same st nick looked at the lawyer and said as aprils guardian mrs boone do you have a recommendation i have a recommendation your honor and i have a plan marcella boone said im not surprised continue my recommendation is that april remain at home tonight and tomorrow night and then on a nightly basis if either parent plans to be away from home during the night that parent must notify me in advance and ill notify the court further i recommend the parents begin marriage counseling immediately i suggest doctor francine street who is in my opinion the best in town ive taken the liberty of setting up an appointment this afternoon at five pm doctor street will keep me posted on the progress if either parent fails to show up for counseling then i will be notified immediately i will contact mrs finnemores new therapist and ask to be updated on her progress in rehab st nick stroked his beard and nodded at mrs boone i like it he said what about you mr finnemore sounds reasonable your honor and you mrs finnemore ill agree to anything judge just please dont take her away then it is so ordered anything else mrs boone yes your honor i have arranged for april to have a cell phone if something happens if she feels threatened or in danger or whatever then she can call me immediately if for some reason im not available she can call my paralegal or perhaps someone with the court plus im sure she can always find theo st nick thought for a second and smiled then said and im sure theo can always find her fifteen feet above in the dark intestines of the stratten county courthouse theodore boone smiled to himself the hearing was over speedy was back shuffling through his cramped room below mumbling to himself as he put his mop away and accidentally kicked his bucket theo was trapped and he really wanted to get out of the building and go to school he waited minutes passed then he heard the familiar sound of speedy snoring fast asleep as usual silently theo climbed down the shelves and landed on the floor speedy was kicked back in his favorite chair cap pulled down over his eyes mouth open dead to the world theo eased by and made his escape he was hustling down the wide hallway almost to the sweeping staircase when he heard someone call his name it was judge henry gantry theos favorite judge in the entire courthouse theo he called loudly theo stopped turned and began walking to the judge henry gantry was not smiling though he seldom did he was carrying a thick file of some sort and he was not wearing his black robe why arent you in school he demanded more than once theo had played hooky or skipped school to watch a trial and on at least two occasions hed been caught redhanded in the courtroom i was in court with my mother he said somewhat truthfully he was looking up judge gantry was looking down would this have anything to do with the april finnemore case he asked strattenburg was not a large city and there were few secrets especially among the lawyers judges and police yes sir i hear you found the girl and brought her home judge gantry said with the first hint of a smile something like that theo said modestly nice work theo thanks just so youll know ive rescheduled the duffy trial to begin in six weeks im sure youll want frontrow seats theo could think of nothing to say the first murder trial of pete duffy had been the biggest in the towns history and thanks to theo it had ended in a mistrial the second promised to be even more suspenseful theo finally said sure judge well talk about it later get to school sure thing theo bounded down the stairs jumped on his bike and raced away from the courthouse he had a lunch date with april they planned to meet outside the school cafeteria at noon and steal away to the old gym where no one could find them mrs boone had packed veggie sandwiches aprils favorite and theos least favorite and peanut butter cookies theo wanted to hear every last detail of the abduction click here for more books
