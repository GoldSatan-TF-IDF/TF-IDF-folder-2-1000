shinobu hashimoto turn hellhound turn macduff in macbeth island showa year second month st day february a quiet fell across the bunker dust drifted from the ceiling the burntegg stench of sulfur lingered everywhere captain it was a private takahashi sugita kanzaki asano togawa fukuyama abewho knew the names anymore there had been so many names sir the shelling has stopped does this mean theyre coming yes he said it means theyre coming the officers name was hideki yano and he was a captain th infantry regiment nd battalion under yasutake and ikeda attached to kuribayashis th division the blockhouse was low and smelled of sulfur and shit because the men all had dysentery from the tainted water it was typical imperial army fortification a low bunker of concrete reinforced over many long months with oak tree trunks from what had been but was no longer the islands only oak forest the sand heaped over it it had three firing slits and behind each slit sat a type gun on a tripod a gunner and a couple of loaders each field of fire fanned away for hundreds of yards across an almost featureless landscape of black sand ridges and marginal vegetation the blockhouse was divided into three chambers like a nautilus shell so that even if one or two were wiped out the last gun could continue to fire until the very end it was festooned everywhere with the latest imperative from general kuribayashis headquarters a document called courageous battle vows which summed up everyones responsibilities to the sphere above all else we shall dedicate ourselves to the defense of this island we shall grasp bombs charge the enemy tanks and destroy them we shall infiltrate into the midst of the enemy and annihilate them with every salvo we will without fail kill the enemy each man will make it his duty to kill ten of the enemy before dying i am scared sir said the private i am too said yano outside the captains small empire continued six pits with nambu guns in each each gun supported by gunner loader and two or three riflemen flanked the empire to left and right in further spider holes were martyrs with rifles no escape for them they knew they were dead already they lived only to kill those ten americans before they gave their lives up in sacrifice those men had it the worst in here no shell could penetrate the concrete was four feet thick riven with steel rods out there a naval shell from the offshore fleet could turn a man to shreds in a second if the shell landed precisely no one would have time for a death poem now that the attack was upon them the captain became energized he shook off the months of torpor the despair the terrible food the endless shitting the worries now at last glory approached except of course he no longer believed in glory that was for fools he believed only in duty he was not a speech maker but now he ran from position to position making sure each gun was properly cocked and aimed the loaders stood ready with fresh ammunition strips the riflemen crouched to pick off the errant demon american captain a boy pulled him aside yes what was the boys name he could not remember this one either but these were all good boys kagoshima boys as the th was drawn from kyushu the home of japan s best soldiers i am not afraid to die i am eager to die for the emperor said the boy a superior private that is our duty you and i we are nothing our duty is all but the boy was agitated i am afraid of flames i am so afraid of the flames will you shoot me if i am engulfed in fire they all feared the flamethrowers the hairy beasts were dishonorable they chopped gold teeth from dead japanese they bleached japanese skulls and turned them into ashtrays and sent them home they killed the japanese not decently with gun and swordthey hated the bladebut so often from miles out with the big naval shells with the airplanes and then when they got in close they used the horrible hoses that squirted flaming gasoline and roasted the flesh from a mans bones killing him slowly how could a warrior die honorably in flames or the sword captain i beg you if i burn behead me what is your name sudo sudo from kyushu sudo from kyushu you will not die in flames that i promise you we are samurai that word samurai still stiffened the spine of every man it was pride it was honor it was sacrifice it was worth more than life it was what a man needed to be and would die to be he had known it his whole life he had yearned for it as he yearned for a son who would live up to it samurai said the boy fervently now reassured for he believed it able company caught primary assault it was simply ables turn and charlie and item and hotel would offer suppressive fire and flanking maneuvers and handle artillery coordination but it was ables turn to go first lead the way semper fi all that fine bullshit there was a problem however there was always a problem this was todays ables co was shaky he was new to the th and rumors had it that a connected father had gotten his son the command his name was culpepper and he was a college boy from some fancy place who talked a little like a woman it wasnt anything anybody could put a finger on not homo or anything he just wasnt somehow like the other officers he was fancy somehow from fancy places fancy houses fancy parents was culpepper up to it nobody knew but the blockhouse had to go or battalion would be hung up all day here and the big guns on suribachi would continue to shatter the beachhead so colonel hobbs assigned his battalions first sergeant earl swagger to go along with captain culpepper that morning culpepper you listen up to the first sergeant hes old breed hes been around hes hit a lot of beaches hes the best combat leader i have you understand yes sir said culpepper the colonel drew earl aside earl you help culpepper dont let him freeze keep his boys moving i hate to do this to you but someones got to get them boys up the hill and youre the best ive got ill get em up sir said swagger who looked like he was about percent united states marine corps chapter and verse a sinewy string bean of a man ageless in the sergeant way a vet of the canal tarawa and saipan and someone said troy thermopylae agincourt and the somme they said nobody could shoot a thompson gun like the first sergeant hed fought the japs in china before the war it was said swagger was from nowhere he had no hometown no memories he shared no stories of the good old days as if he had no good old days it was said hed married a gal last time home on some kind of bond tour for the citizens back there and everybody said shes a looker but he never pulled pictures or talked much about it he was all guile energy and focus seemingly indestructible but one of those professionals with what some would call a gleam in his eye who could talk any boy or green lieutenant through anything he was a prince of war and if he was doomed he didnt know it or much care about it culpepper had a plan swagger didnt like it begging the captains pardon its too complicated youll end up with your people all running around not sure of what to do while the japs sit there and shoot i wouldnt break able down by squads but by platoons id keep a good base of fire going and id get my flamethrowers off on the right try and work em in close that way the flamethrowers sir those are the key i see said the young man pale and thin and grave and trying so hard i think the men are capable sir once the japs see us coming its going to be a shit storm out there they are tough little bastards and believe you me they know what they are doing if you expect men to remember maneuver patterns keyed to landmarks you will be disappointed it has to be simple hard basic and not much to remember or the japs will shoot your boys down like toads on a flat rock the important goddamn thing is to get them flamethrowers in close if it was me id send the best blowtorch team up this draw to the rightthey looked at a smudged map at the command post a few hundred yards backwith a bar and a tommygunner as cover your best nco running the show id hold your other team back meanwhile you pound away from your base of fire get the bazookas involved them gun slits is tiny but a bazooka rocket through one is something the japs will notice sir maybe you ought to let me run the flamethrower team but the colonel said earl will want to lead just let him advise captain i need him back this afternoon but the young captain protested sergeant tarsky is a fine man and a fine nco you let him move some people off on the left when we go hes got to get a lot of fire going and the people here in front theyve got to be working their weapons too i need a lot of covering fire ill take the blowtorch team up the right the japs will be hidden in monkey holes but i can spot em i know where to look so the bar man can hose em down from outside their range well get in close and burn em out then get up there and fry that pillbox culpepper hesitated a second realized this smart tough dutycrazed hillbilly from some deadend flyspeck south of perdition nobody had ever heard of was dead right and saw that his own prissy ego meant nothing out there lets do it first sergeant the type s fired mm tracer whitehot bolts of illumination cut through the mist and the dust through the gun slit you could not see men not reallybut you could sense them maneuvering a foot at a time through the same chaos where the bullets struck they lifted clouds of black sand there said the captain pointing and the gunner cranked his windage to the right the finned barrel revolved on its mesh of gears and the gun rocked spent cartridges spilled the tracer lashed and in the vapors shapes stumbled and went down amid the stench of sulfur sir someone yelled from the leftmost gun chamber holding his sword so it would not clatter the captain ran through the connecting tunnel yes sir yamaki says he saw men moving off on the left just a flash of them moving directly away from our position gun smoke filled the room thin and acrid eating at nasal tissues tearing up eyes flamethrowers i couldnt see sir well it had to be the american commander wouldnt move his people directly at the guns the hairy beasts never did that they didnt have the stomach and they werent eager to die they would die if necessary but they werent hungry for it glorious death meant nothing to them the captain tried to think it out hed either go to his left or right and youd think hed go to his left there was more cover the vegetation was thicker and it was hard to bring direct fire because the ridge was steeper you were mostly in danger from grenades but the americans didnt fear the japanese grenades because they were so underpowered and erratic the captain tried to feel his opponent his imagination of a white man was someone impossibly big and hairy and pink he conceived of a cowboy or a ghost but he knew thered be intelligence guiding it the japanese had learned the hard way over the years that the americans may not have had honor but they had intelligence they werent stupid they werent cowards and there was an endless supply of them it came down to left or right he knew the answer the right hed go to his right hed send the flamethrowers up that way because it was less obvious there wasnt much cover hed run into spider holes but he had the skill to overcome the spider holes it seemed more dangerous but a smart hand would have the advantage if he knew how to use terrain and was aggressive ill take care of it you men keep firing you wont see whole targets youll see shapes fire on shapes be samurai samurai the captain ran back to the central chamber the little gun he ordered quickly a sergeant brought him the submachine gun called the type an mm weapon whose central design had been stolen from the germans it had a wooden stock a ventilated barrel and a magazine fitted horizontally to the left from the breech they were prizes there were never enough of them to go around what we could have done with a million of them wed be in new york today the captain had to lobby general kuribayashi personally to get one assigned to his position he threw on a bandolier hung with pouches full of grenades and spare magazines buckling it tight to his body carefully he disconnected his sword from his belt laying it aside i want to ambush the flamethrower attack ill intercept them well beyond our lines give me covering fire he turned nodded to a private who unlatched the heavy steel door at the rear of the blockhouse and scrambled out whats your name son macreedy first sergeant can you shoot that thing earl said indicating the sixteen pounds of automatic rifle the boy held yes first sergeant how bout you son can you keep him loaded and hot yes first sergeant said macreedys ammo bearer laden with bandoliers of bar mags okay heres what were going to do im squirming up the ridge im going to check out the draw when i see a monkey hole im going to put tracer on it youre with me in a good prone where i put tracer you put five rounds of ball thirty hold tight stay on my fortyfive tracer tracer wont go through them logs the japs use as revetment but the thirty will cause its moving three times as fast your buddy theres going to feed you mags as you run dry hell switch them on you you got that son got it first sergeant said the assistant gunner now you blowtorch guys you hang back we got to clear this out before i can get you up on the ridge and you can get to work okay there was a mumble of reluctant assent from his loose confederation of troops clustered just below the ridge a couple of low yes first sergeant and another thing out here where theres japs im earl forget all the first sergeant bullshit got it with that earl began his long squirm he crawled through volcanic ash and black sand he crawled in a fog of sulfurstinking dust that floated up to his nose and tongue layering him with grit he held his thompson tight like a woman felt the two bar gunners with him close and watched as jap tracer flicked insolently above now and then a mortar round landed but mostly it was dust in the air cut with flecks of light so brief so fast you werent sure you really saw it he was happy in war earl put everything behind him his dead raging father no longer screamed at him his sullen mother no longer drifted away he was no longer the sheriffs boy hated by so many others because they so feared his father he was nobody but first sergeant and he was happy he had the united states marine corps as a father and a mother now and the corps had embraced him and loved him and nurtured him and made him a man he would not let it down and he would fight to the death for its honor earl got to the crest of the little ridge and poked his head up before him he saw a fold in the sandy soil that led up to the blankness of a higher ridgeline a rill that was a foothill to suribachi which rose behind them blocking all view of the sea it was s job to circle around the volcano cut the mountain off from resupply then inch up it and take out the mortars the artillery emplacements the artillery spotters and the spider holes and pillboxes that dotted its scabrous surface it had to be done one firefight at a time over a long days dying the landscape of the draw seemed empty a random groove cut in the black sand clotted with clump grass and bean vines the odd eucalyptus bush stood out amid the desolation once he would have led men up and all would have died but like his peers he had learned the craft of war he looked now for gnarled root groupings in the clump grass and eucalypti for patches of lemongrass for small stunted oak trees for the japanese had a genius for digging into them for building small oneman forts impregnable to artillery but at the same time inescapable there was no such thing as a back door thus they would die to kill retreat and surrender were terms they did not comprehend you set up macreedy yes earl on my fire earl marked the target thirty yards out a tuft of vegetation in a crest of black sand that had a toostudied look to it and he knew a man lurked in a chamber behind the screen of fronds and he put four rounds of tracer onto it watching as the neon flickered across the distance and whacked into the green throwing up clouds of black dust he was so strong and so salty he could hold the gun with no rise it never sents careening wildly into space he could shoot skeet with it and had famously put on an exhibition on shipboard for all the squid officers next to him macreedy jacked a heavier caliber burst into the position these bullets exploded in geysers of angry power when they struck good work that boys gone to his ancestors earl worked the slope his eyes picked out things few others would have noticed he put the tracer on them the bar kids followed with the heavier caliber ball and in minutes the draw seemed clear nows the hard part see the japs have guys on this side i mean facing toward their lines guys we cant see thats how their minds work the smart little monkeys they been at this a while they know a goddamn thing or two whats our play sergeant earl were going to roll grenades down this slope im going to take the bar after the grenades pop im jumping down there i can pick out the monkey holes and lay fire on them you move over the ridge and cover me with the tommy got it earl youre sure to get yourself killed nah no nips quick enough to hit old man earl okay i want the gun loaded and cocked macreedy take the bipod off too you get your grenades out ready yes mr earl okay on my count pull pop the lever then just dump the grenades over the crest got it battle was weather he ran through clouds of vapor dust in the air through layers of sulfur there was no sun his boots fought for leverage in the black sand the thunder pounded except that it was gunfire the slope was alive with rounds striking and it looked like small animals peeping about below he could see nothing but dust and shapes scurrying through it hairy beasts trying to squirm ahead get within grenade range always hunted by the whiter tracers his own men fired he ran from gun pit to gun pit keep firing well drive them back you have ammunition water any wounded the men were wonderful all believed in the hundred million all believed in duty to the emperor all had already made peace with death and sacrifice saw and believed in its necessity and would not bolt or flee they were the best men on earth samurai there to the left he pointed and the nambu cranked around sent a burst skittering through some vegetation and all were rewarded with a rare sight of an enemy rolling out of the brush limply search for targets keep shooting they will tire of dying and fall back soon now captain yano reached a last shelf by geographical oddity a few feet of ridge lay where the far slope was too severe to negotiate and no trenches had been dug it was wide open it had to be crossed captain be careful long live the emperor he cried as if to invoke a higher purpose did he believe it a part of him did you gave yourself to it you accepted your death even in pain or fire you embraced the suffering you longed for the void you raced through fire in search of your duty and your destiny but another part said why what waste these fine men they could contribute so much they die on a crest of black sand on an island of sulfur that held no meaning at all that could be divined for the emperor how many of his men knew that the godlike allknowing alldemanding emperor was a recent invention and that for three hundred years had been the puppetjoke of edo while in kyoto stronger subtler men ruled and only tolerated an emperor as a useful fiction a figure around which to build distracting and therefore helpful ceremonies he knew too the war is lost all our armies have been crushed no island has been successfully defended we die here for nothing it would be comic if it werent so stupid its a racket a jest for the seven men who run japan to chortle at over sake but still he ran he was visible for no more than seven seconds the americans fired quickly and he felt the hot whisper of bullets pushing the air to the left and right as they plunged past the earth erupted around him and filled the air with grit that assailed his nose and throat the bullet that would kill him did not find him he slid to earth behind a hummock gulped for air then heard a series of blasts from the draw below he slid to the crest of the hummock and watched from a hundred yards out as an american raced down the hill with a big automatic riflethey had so many different kinds of weaponssweeping quickly sending cascades of bullets into counterlaid spider holes whose existence only the captain himself knew as he had designed them it was over in seconds the big hairy beast yelled and gestured and two men came down the hill and another few around it as they joined in the middle of the draw and the american ordered them into a hasty line and led them forward the captain saw it then flamethrower the last two americans in line had the flamethrower one of them wore it on a harness a cluster of tanks centered on his back so heavy with jellied fuel that he bent under it and held a tubular nozzle with a pistol grip which concealed a pyrotechnic igniter literally a match that when struck would unleash the spurting fuel they would come up the draw pivot left and under covering fire burn out the gun pits then the americans would blow the steel door into the bunker and burn that out too the captain reached for grenades they were absurd things called type s unreliable and untrustworthy cylindrical and grooved for fragmentation they were designed with fourandahalfsecond fuses which meant they either had onesecond fuses or sixsecond fuses if they detonated at all you primed themthis was beyond comedyby first pulling a pin then smashing their fuse housing hard against your helmet and driving a striker through a primer to light a powder train he almost laughed we are the yamato race and we cannot build a hand grenade to save our lives the men joked we can survive the americans butour own grenades but the buddha smiled he pulled the pin on the first cylinder smashed its fuse housing against a stone the striker flew and lit the fuse and it sizzled to life he held it one second so dangerous then threw it over the crest he repeated the process and heard the first detonate possibly a cry was lost in the explosion the second grenade he didnt hold on the sound principle that no two in a row would work properly but just hurled it and it was the right decision for just an instant later it went the captain pulled himself over the crest of the draw all the americans were down one of the boys with the automatic rifle was shrieking hysterically his left arm bloody two were still the flamethrower operator was trying to regain his feet the captain shot him first he put a stream of five mm nambu slugs into him and another burst into the assistant even though that man was down he shifted to the automatic rifleman who labored with the bloody arm to raise his weapon while behind them his loader tried to grope for a dropped carbine the captain finished them in one long burst then he rotated to the downed leader and put a burst into him he raced down the draw went to the flamethrower operator who unbelievably still breathed he fired into his head and tried not to notice and when that proved impossible not to feel shame at the impact of the bullets on the young face then he pulled his bayonet and sawed the hose through and tossed the pistollike igniter housing away no blowtorches for his men today he spun and began to race back to the blockhouse earl somehow regained consciousness he was not dead he tried to reassemble what had happened and finally identified it as either an errant mortar shell or grenades he shook his head trying to drive the jangles of pain out but they remained his hip throbbed he looked down and saw blood his canteen was punctured twice there was a groove cut in the brass keeper of his web belt where a bullet had spanged off and a bullet had grooved his side a slow leakage of blood accumulating on his heavy usmc twill shirt he looked around gone all gone fuck he thought finally met a jap smart as me smarter even goddamn his little monkey soul to hell the draw was quiet though the noise of the firing was close at hand the japanese still held the blockhouse his flanking thrust had been defeated hed gotten four men of able company wiped out and himself damn near killed and only because now that he thought of it he must have heard the chink of a jap arming his grenade that got him to the ground before the first blast and he now realized there were two blasts he looked about his thompson was a few feet away he picked it up blew sand out of the trigger assembly and rotated down the safety no need to check the chamber for he carried it in combat with a round sitting there the bolt held back he started up the draw he climbed the crest pivoted and could see nothing ahead lay a crest line where a hummock of black sand was anchored by a netting of scraggly vegetation he lurched ahead slipped once then got around the hummock to find himself a hundred yards or so from the blockhouse three gun pits sandbagged revetments reinforced with palm held gun crews with riflemen all working frantically to keep their fire up the guns hammered away like industrial implements earl didnt pause a second it wasnt in his nature he had the advantage of surprise and he was on the first pit before the men realized he fired a long burst the gun steamy and jumpy in his hands and just cut them down a man in the second pit thirty yards farther out rose to his racket fired at earl and the bullet banged off his helmet the helmet itself flipping away earl fired from the hip catching him then raced to the pit firing and as he reached it ran dry of ammo and so leaped in using his gun butt he drove the heavy thing forward smashing a jap in the face spun sideways and smashed another he returned to the first with several savage butt strokes his heart empty of mercy around him the world lit up nambu fire from the third pit earl went down reached for his own grenade pulled the pin and threw it as he waited for the detonation he hastened through a magazine change when the grenade fired off he rose to see three men with a light nambu racing his way and he took them down with a raking burst he rose ran through fire to the third pitwhy he wasnt killed was a mystery hed ponder for the rest of his lifeand finished the clip on the wounded men who struggled within it when the gun ran dry he killed two wounded men with his gun butt not a thing youd tell a child about but a necessary part of the job he sat back exhausted sucked in air that was heavy with the chemical stench of this goddamned place he saw the blockhouse lay a few yards away and knew hed have to blow it yeah with what no grenades left no satchel charge no bangalore torpedo no flamethrower then he flipped a jap overthe body was so lightand found a pouch of grenades he knew the jap grenades were no good but maybe a bagful would do the trick he reached for his thompson and saw why it had quit a wedge of sand had jimmied the bolt halfway back youd have to scrape for a month to get it cleared okay he took a breath and ran to the blockhouse squirmed along the back of it his shirt scraping the concrete he could hear its guns working the slope he found a chamber and peeking in he saw a black steel door earl pressed himself against the wall took out one of the jap grenades with his teeth he got the pin out then he slammed the end of the thing against the wall felt it fizzle and watched the dry thin smoke of burning powder pour out of it oh shit these things scared him he dumped it in the bag tossed the bag flush against the steel door and headed back across the sand to the gun pit he needed a weapon the captain made it back inside in the dankness in the darkness there was a moments respite from the storm of the battle the noise went way down the glare ceased the stench of sulfur was supplanted by other stenches someone clapped him on the shoulder someone hugged him someone cried with joy i stopped their flame team now weve got them they wont be getting up here this morning samurai he handed the type to his sergeant and went back to his little corner he picked up his sword a prosaic blade probably ground out by a machine in the naval sword company polished on a machine assembled by a worker yet it was strangely sharp and twice men had tried to buy it from him there was something about it that he couldnt quite define now he fastened it to his belt by its clip drew the blade out and set it before him he felt he had done his duty no one would perish in flames they would achieve death with dignity he picked up a calligraphy brush and dipped it in ink he thought of lord asano in seconds from his own death by his own hand bowing to pressures so great as to be incomprehensible asano had written i wish i had seenthe end of springbut i do not missthe falling of the cherry blossoms asano knew what was important the end of spring his duty the falling of the cherry blossoms the emptiness of ceremony then asano had plunged his blade into his stomach and drawn it cleanly across the midline of his body cutting entrails and organs spraying blood everywhere until the mercy of the sword had sundered his neck ending all now it was clear before yano he had to record what happened here what this place was how hard these men had fought how hard they had died inspiration suddenly arrived along with enlightenment and in a few deft strokes he sent kanji characters spilling vertically across the rice paper they seemed to tumble from his brush feathery almost delicate a testament to the artists genius amid the slaughter it was so human it was his death poem he removed his sword and laid it before him on the small writing table with the nub of his brush he pushed out the bamboo peg that secured the grip to the tang smoothly the grip slid upward but instead of taking it off he wrapped his death poem around the tang and remounted the grip then he thrust the peg back through the hole but he thought too loose with the stillwet calligraphy brush he quickly applied a dollop of ink to the peg it would slide into the hole thicken like lacquer then eventually harden into a cement bond that would keep the sword tightly assembled forever for some reason this small taskin the face of deathgave him immense satisfaction it meant that his last conscious act had been the act of poetry then the world exploded the scythe crazy horse idaho today there was no why to it not really you couldnt put it into words his daughter had said you have too much time on your hands his wife had said you cannot tell that man a thing who knew what the people in town said or what the mexicans or the peruvians who herded the sheep and mended the fences said but of the last category the words muy loco were certainly uttered bob lee swagger nearing sixty stood alone on a slope in the american west the property was his own he had bought it upon discovering in this new stage of life an unexpected prosperity two layout barns he owned in arizona in pima county were doing well managed astutely by a high school friend of his daughters a young woman who loved horses and had a practical streak so a check arrived from arizona every month there were two more layout barns here in idaho east and west of boise which bob more or less managed except that they managed themselves and julie did all the bookkeeping so there was money from that too then the united states marine corps sent him a check every month as well for all the bleeding hed done in faroff places nobody remembered there was a va disability check for the bad business about the hip that steel joint that was always ten degrees colder inside his body than the weather outside it so hed bought this nice piece of land on the piebald river still a ways out from crazy horse itself still a longer way out from boise you could see the sawtooths a blue scar across the sea of green that was a valley the land was serene no human structure could be discerned if you looked at the land under the big idaho sky piled with cumulus hawks rotating in the thermals and you saw the smeary white of the antelope herds you might feel a little peace a man whod done some hard things and had finally come to a land where he could live untroubled with a wife and a daughter would love such a place even if the daughter was off in graduate school in new york city and he and the wife didnt speak as much to each other as they once had but the idea was splendid he would build a fine house looking across to the sawtooths with a porch on it all summer long it would be green in the fall red and gold and in the winter white you earned it the hard way bob julie had said well maybe i did anyhow im just going to enjoy sitting under a blanket in the mornings and watching i wouldnt bet on that but if thats what you say but there was one thing before a house could be built the land had to be cleared and irrigated and bob just didnt want another man to do that job with a machine and a crew he wanted to do it himself it was called a scythe an ancient curved blade rusted and nicked but still sharp as hell affixed to the end of a grip with enough bend in it and enough knobs on it so a fellow could get behind it with his weight and strength and swing what he swung at he cut you found the rhythm the blade did the work your muscles stretched your stamina built there was something nineteenth century about it that he liked or maybe even eighteenth or seventeenth or sixteenth century it takes some time to work a goodsize piece of land and the more he got into it the more it got into him it was an hour from his home in boise mostly on dirt roads to save a little time hed bought and taught himself to run a kawasaki offroad bike and tore across the desert in a more direct route than via the crazyquilt switchbacks his truck would have required then in jeans and boots and an old undershirt hed begin hed been at it a month paces one way then paces the other six seven sometimes eight or even ten hours a day he no longer ached his back no longer throbbed his body had finally gotten used to even come to need the labor back and forth his calluses protecting him the blade biting the scrawny vegetation and with each swing a spray of stalks and leaves flew away cutting a swath maybe two feet wide he was halfway done now half the field was cut to nubbiness and had died it could be plowed under and planted the steeper half still beckoned a stretch of prairie grass and tumbleweed and cacti and other tough scrawny highdesert growers yet somehow it pleased him it meant nothing to nobody but it meant a little this day to him this particular day was no different than any other why should it be sun sky brambles to cut scythe to swing progress to be made up one track back another the steady swish of the blade that swath two feet wide the feel of the sweat building the sense of giving himself up against and then he saw the car who the hell could this be he didnt think anyone knew he was here alone in the wild or knew the strange linkage of dirt roads that got you here only julie did he figured then that shed told whoever this was and so it was all right it was a mercedesbenz sclass in black a very nice car pulling up a rooster tail of dust he watched as it slewed ever so gently to a stop one by one two men got out he recognized one right away it was thomas m jenks a retired marine colonel and sometime friend of bobs a biggish wheel in boise who owned a buick dealership a radio station and a mall or two very nice fellow active in the marine corps league a man bob trusted the second was asian there was something about him that radiated japanese bob thought but he didnt know quite what he recalled a letter that had come a week or so ago full of puzzling possibilities gny sgt ret bob lee swagger rr crazy horse id dear sergeant swagger i hope this letter finds you happy in a wellearned retirement and i hope you pardon the intrusion as i know you to be a man who treasures his privacy i am a retired full colonel usmc and currently head of the marine historical section at henderson hall arlington vamarine headquarters for some months i have been working with philip yano of tokyo japan i have found mr yano to be an excellent man he is retired from the japanese ground selfdefense forces where he was a colonel and a battalion commander with special duty attachments to a variety of american and british military training schools including ranger airborne specops british sas and the command and staff college at ft leavenworth kansas as well he has a masters degree in business administration from stanford university mr yano has spent the summer researching marine records as part of a research project regarding the campaign on iwo jima februarymarch as your father figured significantly in that battle and was one of twentythree marines to win the medal of honor for actions there he hopes to discuss this with you i gather hes doing a book on iwo from a japanese point of view he is a polite respectful and even an endearing man and a military professional of the highest order i hope you can be of assistance to mr yano i am requesting your full cooperation with him possibly you would not be averse to sharing your fathers memories with him he is as i say an admirable man deserving of respect and cooperation i will put him in contact with you and sometime in the next few weeks he will be in touch again my thanks and best sincerely robert bridges historical section superintendent marine headquarters henderson hall va bob hadnt felt up to this when hed read the letter hed thought well now what the hell what do i know about it the old man never talked just as he himself years later with tales of this and that when the lead was buzzing through the air never talked either that was somehow part of it you didnt talk about it but he also knew that in a strange way his father who fought hated killed blew up and burned the japanese for three years in the most horrific way possible also respected them in the way that only enemies unto death can respect each other to call it love was to say too much to call it forgiveness and redemption maybe too much as well but call it healing and youd have it just about right he had an image of the old man at a drugstore must have been or couple of years before he died someone said to him say earl them japs theyse little monkey devils huh you fry them japs by the bucketful right and his father turned instantly grave as if insulted and said you can say anything you want about em charlie but ill tell you this they were damn fine soldiers and they stood their ground till the last drop of blood they stood and fought even when theys burning alive no one ever accused a japanese infantryman of not doing his duty then he felt his father so voluble and commanding turn the conversation skillfully to other subjects there were certain things he wouldnt share particularly with folks who hadnt been out there on the beaches and the tiny little islands he turned to face the gentleman he saw a man his own age squareheaded with a neat crop of short gray hair steadyeyed stocky where bob was lanky even in the heat and the rugged terrain the man wore a dark suit and tie and radiated military dignity from every pore bob said tom jenks this is oh i know mr yano retired recently from and then he paused involuntarily noticing that mr yanos left eye though almost the same color as the right wasnt focusing even as it moved in coordination with its brother signifying that it was glass and bob then noticed a line running above and beneath it that though neatly mended with the best skill that modern surgery could manage was evidence of an ugly violent trauma from his countrys service sir pleasure to meet you i am bob lee swagger mr yano smiled showing white even teeth and bowed in a way that bob had never seen except in movies the bow was deep and deeply felt at once as if the man were taking pleasure in it i did not wish to intrude sergeant swagger bob recalled something somewhere hed heard about the japanese and their humility and fear of acquiring obligation and causing difficulty and saw how from that point of view it made more sense to drive an hour through back roads than to come up to the house so what can i do for you sir asked bob some research project about iwo is that it first sergeant swagger if i may with that he pulled from his pocket a small gift box bowed and presented it to swagger as an expression of thanks for your time and knowledge bob was a little stunned he wasnt much on gifts or bows or the kind of formality that seemed pointless in ninetydegree sunlight in the high desert of a western state on his own land when he was damp in sweat well i cant say how nice this is sir i certainly appreciate it the japanese always give gifts said tom jenks its their way of saying howdy and thanks please said the japanese fellow bob saw that the box was so precisely wrapped that opening it seemed slightly sacrilegious but he felt also an obligation and tore into it marveling at the intricate folded structure of the paper until finally he got it open discovered a tiny jewel box and opened that well that is really swell he said it was a miniature sword assembled with high artistry the tiny blade gleamed and the miniaturist had even wrapped the grip in individual thread strands the sword is the soul of the samurai sergeant swagger you are a great samurai as i know so i bring this in salute in a funny way the gift touched bob it was so unexpected and he guessed quite expensive for the craftsmanship was exquisite you shouldnt have its so impressive believe me all that samuraiing is way behind me i just run some barns but you put me in a helpful mood so whatever it is youre interested in fire away and ill see if i cant pitch in my old man never talked much about the war i understand few do in any event as possibly colonel bridgess letter noted ive spent the last few months at henderson hall examining the original documents pertaining to iwo jima before that i spent almost a year in japanese defense archives examining the same thing though as you might imagine japanese records are rather incoherent yes sir i have ended up concentrating on an action that took place february twentyfirst at a place on japanese maps called point ifive it was a blockhouse on the northwest slope of mount suribachi i am familiar with mount suribachi and what happened on its northwest slope february twentyfirst sir may i say something sometimes you dont want to look too carefully or learn too much about what happens in battle people do things in battle they wouldnt dream of doing no other way time or place i speak from experience sir i know you do you might learn something about us or about your own people that would prove upsetting i understand that too this isnt about atrocity however or national policies or even about the movement of troops across the landscape say the twentyeighth marines circling the southern tip of the island to cut off then assault suribachi its about something far more intimate your father destroyed the blockhouse at point ifive and killed most of the soldiers that was a remarkable courageous act of heroism i have nothing but respect for it the battle is interesting to me because my father captain hideki yano was an infantry officer in the japanese imperial army second battalion one hundred fortyfifth infantry regiment he was in command of point ifive or the blockhouse on suribachis northwest slope in other words i believe as the battle progressed your father killed mine the blockhouse earl was trying to dig out and master a nambu type light machine gun in the nearest gun pit when the grenades detonated though he was forty feet from them and theyd been wedged deep in a trench against the steel door of the blockhouse the concussion still swept across him punching him to the earth he fell on a dead soldier the mans face beaten in by the butt of earls thompson earl saw the hideous rearrangement of features the swelling the shattered delicacies of the face and teeth the bloated lipsthen looked away you train yourself not to see that stuff he knew he had to focus the gun the gun the was no bar but enough of them had shot enough lead at him for him to respect it he looked at it understanding its principles immediately machine guns were pretty much alike in most respects he rummaged around for a pouch of mags found one shifted to a new fresh tin of ammo locked it in looked for found and locked back a bolt now he lifted it feeling the ungainly slippy rotation of the loose bipod on the end of the finned barrel and raced back to the rear of the house if men shot at him he wasnt aware of it he slipped down the door was blown asunder and black smoke boiled out of the entrance it was like the doorway to hell this is where you needed a flamethrower for one cleansing stream from outside would search out nooks and crannies crevices and corners and take care of business and you didnt have to crawl in and go from room to room killing he took a breath and entered a subterranean world fighting the acrid drift of smoke the stench of latrine and blood and food the sudden clammy coolness of the underground chamber it was like entering an insect nest he heard the heavy rhythm of a woodpecker from the left and turned stepping over a body bap bap bap bap bap the pound of the slowfiring heavy machine gun an entrance yielded a chamber and indeed three men serviced one of the big nambu s concentrating on downhill targets one locating them one firing one feeding ammo strips into the big gun fighting hard to the end they hadnt even noticed the blown doorway it was pure murder usually you didnt see it shapes moved and stopped moving or disappeared now he pressed the trigger felt the hot sputter of the gun the tracers just swept them away in less than a second so goddamned easy it shouldnt be as easy as with a hose against flowers the gun in his hand emptied in a spasm and the soldiers never had any idea what happened they just went down flipping this way and that this one fighting it that one going down hard and fast this one just slumping caught and lit in a neon net the jap tracers whiteblue and hot it was over in a second earl rotated to his left stumbled a bit burned some skin off his forehead on a low ceiling and moved to the next chamber the captain shook spiderwebs broken glass fly wings and dust from his brain he was in pain everywhere and when he breathed only hot stench poured into his lungs and rasped at his throat he thought he was drowning in an underwater of smoke and fumes he gripped his skull to squeeze the pain out but it didnt help where was he what was this what was happening it was his chamber that had caught most of the blast when the steel door was blown the big nambu wasnt firing it was tilted askew to the right and the loader was either dead or dying at any rate he lay on his back his face and chest bloody his eyes unseeing he was gone some piece of shrapnel to brain or spine turning off his light in a microsecond of mercy it was sudo of kyushu your sacrifice wasnt by fire he thought i kept my word one of the privates though had gone to the gun and was fighting to get it righted and the third man joined him albeit feebly as he too was seriously hit then the captain heard the sound of fire from close at hand and knew one of the hairy ones had penetrated he reached swiftly for his pistol but found the blast had torn his belt off he was defenseless he looked about the sword lay to his right he bent picked it up it was of course ridiculous in this modern age japanese ncos and officers went into battle with these frogstickers helpful in executing chinese partisans and waving in staff photographs and patriotic rallies and little else yet throughout the army they were beloved because they connected to a thousand years of the bushido way of the warrior and conjured up men in elaborate armor or brilliant robes meeting and destroying each other in battles or back alleys for the sakethis was the lie at any rateof the hundred million in the sword was freedom from the gaijin dignity spirituality samurai the captain drew the sword from its metal scabbard feeling the friction of metal on metal and then it sprang free and described a fine glorious arc across the smoky space as the american approached in truth it seemed to be not much of a sword it was but shingunto short almost stumpy its brightness suspect upon inspection because the skin was a mass of scratches and hazing and a bit of edge here and there had chipped off in some forgotten adventure the captain had drawn it from resupply as part of his kit when hed left tokyo for the volcanics and it was one of thousands in a room of reconditioned swords recovered from returning soldiers back from the spheres expansions all over the southern half of the globe in the last decade possibly it had been carried by a nowdead man in china or burma or malaysia who knew who could possibly know but it was always weirdly sharp this one despite its mundane even shabby appearance had a will or destiny toward cutting you could shave with it or cut paper with it and it had a lively quality unlike the heavier duller sword that had been his first issue in china it seemed to want flesh it sought battle destiny fate in some odd respect he felt unworthy of it though it was but military issue presumably manufactured in a plant with thousands like it yet it reassured him and he drew it back in both hands above his head slightly separated for leverage assuming position jodan no kamai or highlevel stance or even fire stance because his spirit was so strong it meant to burn the opponent oppressing his resolve he saw the next second perfectly the downward diagonal between neck and shoulder perfect kiroshi cutting technique the sword traveling straight without wobble cutting cloth skin muscle bone the newly approved seventh kata of kesagiri the preferred killing stroke of the diagonal cut the clavicle stroke then the quick withdrawal followed by chiburi or that flick of blood removal before resheathing the ritual was pleasing it gave him comfort and brought calm to his tumultuous mind he became one with the sword he waited earl killed the six men in the central chamber in a single second it was just like the last the tracers ate them up tossed them up and down and they fell some mute some twitchy this was war all the bullshit about doing your bit about the team about gung ho semper fi was forgotten in the end it was killing and nothing but he withdrew aware that the gun was either empty or near to it he diddled unlocked the empty magazine and it fell away he inserted a new one locked it in drew the bolt back slid down the weird hallway low burning yet more skin off his bare head and came to the last chamber he knew they were waiting for him god help me he thought this one last time then he plunged in a request i dont know about that exact thing mr yano said bob i do know that in fights things get all mixed up you can never tell whos done what official reports dont usually come no place near the truth i understand that it could have easily been a shell a ricochet a sniper any of a dozen things and it doesnt even matter i also understand that if he did it was because it was his duty because he had no choice because it was war but i do know for certain that he was there that he actually penetrated the bunker the medal attests to that as do the witness reports that much is known sir bob said battle is a terrible thing as is killing something drove him to rare confession i have been cursed to have seen and done a lot of it for the marine corps i hunted and killed other men in vietnam ive thought a lot about it i can only say it was war i understand ive seen some battle too thats the way we chose the path we followed the sun was bright but i am hoping so much that you will understand where my destination lies i must ask one more question said mr yano its only out of a love for my father as intense as the one you still feel for yours go ahead said bob i see thats why you came there was a sword the japanese said bob blinked not sure what he meant did he mean the miniature sword that he yano had given swagger just a few minutes ago that sword then he saw no no his fathers sword his father had a sword that day of course the japs called them banzai swords or something like that he remembered them not from anything his father ever said but from the war comic books he had read religiously in the s he saw in his mind a wicked curved thing with a long tapewrapped grip with a snakehead at the end of it banzai banzai some bearded cavemanlike jap sergeant in gogglelike glasses shouted in the comic books waving it around stirring his men to a human wave attack bob realized his idea of such a thing was probably crap i know young soldiers in battle said mr yano in the aftermath of survival they want something to commemorate their triumph something tangible that speaks of victory who can blame them ive seen it myself said bob more memories stirred forty years old memories he had no interest in sifting through but the man was right it happened i know said mr yano that hundreds thousands possibly tens of thousands of swords were taken in the pacific along with nambu pistols flags especially flags arisaka rifles helmets souvenirs of a fight so hard mostly it was guys in the rear who ate that shit up said bob my father had a sword his death was part of your fathers greatest triumph ive read the medal citation and the afteraction reports in the marine historical section and i know how brave he was my father was an extraordinary man said bob ive tried my whole life and i aint yet come up to his waist i imagine yours was as well it is true but i must ask is there a possibility that this sword was part of your inheritance that you now have it it was the sort of thing a father passes on to a son there are far finer swords but that sword it would have enormous meaning to me and to my family i really came to america in search of that sword bob wished he had good news for the man he understood that it was more than right that such an event might transpire all these years later the sword returned to its place of honor with the family of the man who had carried it and died with it the symmetry of the idea pleased him it seemed to signify a final closing up of old raw wounds but he had no good news mr yano i would in a second believe me it would please me for some damned reason i have this feeling that it would please my father and that would do me proud i feel the same but my father wasnt a man for trophies he had no trophies except a fortyfive he brought back from the pacific and that was a tool not a trophy but no flags no trumpets no swords no helmets not even much chatter he just put the war behind him and got on to the next thing he never talked about it he never wore the uniform again until the day he died not even on parade days when some of the other boys did he wasnt the sort of man who talked himself up or tried to remind others of what hed done you dont see that much no more if the japanese felt disappointment he didnt show it and bob realized it was not their way to show such things i didnt think id ever heard you say anything about a sword said jenks whod been standing idly by while the two conducted business bobs not a showy kind and i dont believe his father would have been either no i understand said mr yano well so be it that is what the gods have decreed the sword is where it is and that is where it will remain you sure tried said bob then he added possibly there are still some men left in that platoon theyd be in their eighties now but couldnt marine historical put you in contact there are two and ive actually talked to both one in florida one in kansas but i came up empty thats too bad id really like to help andhmmm he said yes oh i dont know all this talk about so long ago i am hearing something said bob hearing something im getting a buzz on something sword you say that word meaning world war two japanese sword i get a little kind of image a memory like said jenks not even that i dont know why it would be or what it would be somewhere deep down i have this little bug maybe its a mistake still its something mr yano because were connected in such a hard way let me make you a promise it aint much its all i got im moved theres stuff in my attic it was in the house in arizona i moved it when i sold that place i looked through it a couple or so years ago when some business about my father came up and i had to go on a little trip back home but i didnt look thoroughly obviously i wasnt looking for anything having to do with a sword so ill go back through that stuff over the next few weeks maybe get a sense of whats there who knows maybe theres a lead of some sort you came all the way out here to no place idaho i feel i owe you soldier to soldier also son of hero to son of hero youre very kind i know youll examine until theres nothing left to examine heres my card please accept it and if theres any news youll be able to reach me the old breed the young faces stared out at him they were so thin so unmarked in many cases so unformed with eager eyes and knobby cheekbones tan in the tropic sun each man clutched a vicious kabar knife or a garand or a carbine or a bar they were revving themselves up for war this young marine platoon somewhere in the pacific somewhere in world war ii finally one face in the back row materialized and bob knew it to be his fathers it was thin too but if you looked hard you saw the pure animal confidence his father wore the ncos weird combination of foremans savvy fathers sternness mothers forgiveness teachers wisdom and coachs toughness beautifully and the picture somehow captured a professional at the apex of his game with a crushed boonie cap pushed back on his head his teeth white and strong as he smiled his utility sleeves rolled up showing strong forearms that seemed to be curled on what bob thought was maybe most of it was hidden behind a man in the row in front of him a tommy gun he had no idea when the picture was taken maybe before guadalcanalno not with ms and carbinesmaybe before tarawa maybe before saipan maybe before iwo there was one other too bob couldnt remember but he knew his dad was one of the few marines who had hit five separate islands and lived to tell about it though the wound on tarawa from the jap sniper would have killed a lesser man the photo old and curled was one of a few that remained testifying to the war adventures of earl l swagger of blue eye arkansas who entered the war a corporal and got out a first sergeant even if wounded seven times it was a real hellandback story audie ryan didnt have anything on earl he fought hard he almost died somehow like little audie he came back he never became a movie star but instead became a police officer and he got ten more years of life out of the deal but that was all bob was alone in the attic and it hadnt been easy digging through this stuff which had been hastily moved from a house in ajo arizona never categorized never examined just lumped together as junk from the past and shoved up here the cardboard boxbuster brown size c dark brown oxfords inscribed in his mothers script daddys thingscontained little else the medals even the big one were nested together the ribbons faded the metal tarnished bob thought maybe he should have them polished and mounted a display to the mans courage but his father would have been embarrassed at such show there were police marksmanship medals and yellowing newspaper clippings from the month of his death in well i tried bob thought he thought of mr yanos card in his wallet dear mr yano he imagined the note hed write i went through what remained of my fathers effects and found nothing that would help you in your quest maybe if and then yet another possibility occurred to him this here was the stuff his mother had gathered after the funeral before she launched into the land of drunkenness but there was another three years when her sister agnes bowman a schoolteacher and spinster who had not yet found a man good enough had come and stayed with them and aunt agnes had raised him sternly not with love or tenderness but out of a grim sense of family duty while erla june drank herself to death and died before reaching the age of forty aunt agnes was not a giving woman which was all right aunt agnes did the things that had to be done and didnt have a lot of time for nursing boys like bob who in any case retreated into someplace dark for a few years after his fathers death and so never made contact with her perhaps she was in her own dark place that was okay aunt agnes provided and guided and paid the bills and fed him compared to that a squeeze or a hug wasnt much of anything but then bob gravitated toward sam vincent and his big rambling loud smart funny competitive welcoming family and eventually through high school lived with sam almost as a vincent aunt agnes saw no purpose therefore and moved away sending a christmas card every year bob had visited her after his first tour in vietnam in and as an adult discovered a decent quiet woman finally married to a widowed schoolteacher living in oranda virginia in the shenandoah valley it had been a nice visit though not much had been said and damned if he could remember goodwin agnes goodwin her married name he didnt know why he hadnt thought of it in years but somehow it flew at him out of some lost file in his brain on anywhocom he couldnt even find an oranda nor on any map he found an old map with the town located next to strasburg and identifying the town as strasburg finally turned up a goodwin he made the blind call and located a cousin who knew other branches of the goodwin family and guided him toward a betty frawley of roanoke whose maiden name had been goodwin and was that persons uncle mike goodwins daughter ms frawley we dont want none if thats what this is all about no maam its not i am bob lee swagger a retired marine calling from crazy horse idaho on some family business i am trying to locate my aunt whose name was agnes bowman and who late in life married a virginia man named goodwin aunt agnes yes maam well she was a good soul bless her heart she married daddy after mother died and although i would never be one to criticize mother i will tell you those may have been the best years of his life and she nursed him through to the end she was good at that her end followed shortly after im sorry to say you were a marine yes maam in nineteen sixtysix did you come and visit agnes i was eleven at the time and i have a very distinct memory of a tall handsome young man who set all the hearts aflutter he was just back from vietnam where hed won some medals he was agness nephew i believe would that be you yes maam though im far from handsome these days if i ever was i remember that day in oranda well it was the last time i saw her she helped raise me after my father died and my motherher sisterhad some problems families in those days pitched in thats the way it was its not much like that anymore but in those days families helped out maam im just playing out a long shot here my father died in nineteen fiftyfive and thats when aunt agnes came and stayed with us through fiftyeight or fiftynine as i say it was then my mothers decline began agnes ran the house for a time im trying to gather up any mementos that might remain of my father he was a marine too and a law officer who died young i thought that she might have had some effects that you might have them that something there might somehow relate to my father something i missed or never knew about sounds like a man trying to recover his fathers memory it may be that maam well i think theres a box somewhere im not sure it made the move with me it was all such old stuff but i hated to just throw it out it was somebodys life you just cant throw it out do you have it if i do its in the basement and id have to look for it maam id be happy to come on out there and help you well i dont have much to do these days so i may as well go look for you you leave me your address and well see what we can find and so three weeks later three weeks hed spent alone on his property swinging that scythe every day cutting down the brambles and thorns a big envelope arrived from roanoke virginia he opened it that night oh christ first thing out was a picture of himself his mother on a rare sober day and stern aunt agnes at a picnic table somewhere he wore a cardinals baseball cap a tshirt and jeans and had scrawny arms and legs bob lee erla june and agnes little rock june the inscription read in fading purple ink it brought back nothing nothing at all then came his mothers death certificate some yellowed insurance forms her drivers license a bank book with null and void stamped across it a few christmas cards from neighbors whose names meant nothing erla junes obituary from the paper up in fort smith a small gold crucifix with a pin that his mother had evidently worn a few more photographs mostly of strangers a few more official forms and a few letters most of them unopened there were eight in all evidently theyd arrived over the three years agnes had lived with bob and erla june some addressed to mrs swagger some to the widow of sgt swagger some to erla june by name he opened them one by one a former platoon member wanted to express his sadness and talk about the time earl had saved his life on guadalcanal then there was a schoolmate of erla junes inquiring as to her health and welfare and expressing gratitude there was a tax bill from garland county and bob realized he had finally paid it in the daughter of col william o darby another arkansas war hero famous for having led darbys rangers in italy before he died in france wrote to express her sorrow and offer moral and even financial support in case of family emergencies boy bob thought talk about class then finally an unopened letter postmarked kenilworth illinois october on creamy stationery with expensive lettering proclaiming the senders name and return address john h culpepper of sheridan road gently he opened the heavy envelope pulled out an equally heavy creamy piece of stationery with culpeppers name and address tastefully emblazoned across the top dear mrs swagger im very sorry this letter is so late i only learned by chance yesterday about your husbands tragic death four years ago i havent kept up with marines from the war but i felt i had to express my sorrow at learning of the event earl swagger was a very great man and helped me on my greatest day of need i was a young marine captain and by default became commanding officer of able company nd battalion th marines during the battle of iwo jima to say i was overmatched is to understate the situation considerably things came to a head on d plus as we called it when it was my companys turn to lead an assault on a particularly welldesigned and welldefended japanese emplacement left to my own devices i would have gotten myself and more importantly my men slaughtered because quite frankly i didnt know what the hell i was doing i had used family connections to get myself a combat command because i just had to fight in any event earl who was the battalion first sergeant was sent down from headquarters to assist me he certainly assisted me im sure youve read the citation im proud to say i wrote it and worked hard to get it approved i think it was my finest accomplishment in an otherwisebetween you and mecompletely mediocre military career what he did that day was beyond question one of the great feats of arms in military history from my vantage point on the slope beneath he was literally superman how many japanese shot at him well never know but he never showed a single moments hesitation and managed to singlehandedly destroy the emplacement he saved the lives of a hundred men that day anyway a few days later i was hit thus ending my adventure in combat because i had not been a dynamic leader i was not the focus of a lot of attention and i was feeling pretty blue on my cot in the hospital tent awaiting evacuation who should walk in but the legendary first sergeant himself ill never forget that day he was a god in that battalion and here he was coming to visit me he said well captain i see you managed to get yourself banged up a bit yes first sergeant i said i jumped this way and the jap knew exactly which way that would be i was lucky he was in a hurry it was a leg wound sir i wanted you to have this you were in command that day you headed up the assault i was just the fellow who was left standing so its yours maybe itll cheer you up he handed me something wrapped in cloth about two feet long i quickly opened it to discover a japanese sword whats called a banzai sword of the sort the jap officers carried and all too often used in combat he said your boys gave me that when i was heading back to battalion after the fight it came out of the blockhouse someone took it off the dead jap officer just before they burned the place out with flamethrowers that fellow tried to comb my hair with it i thought you might want to have it i should tell you that japanese swords were prized war trophies especially when taken in combat i could have sold it and indeed over the next few weeks many officers tried to buy it off me one offering but it was one of my treasures the truth however is that its not mine i didnt earn it earl did and it was given to me only out of his compassion for young men whod done their best even if the best wasnt all that great as in my case now i think what right do i have to have this sword please let me send it back to you i understand earl had a son he should have itthough i should tell you its very sharp and one of my own children has already cut himself with it but it demonstrates what earl did that day please let me know if youd like me to send it on john h culpepper kenilworth ill julie dropped him at the boise airport named for a hero of world war ii an aviator he had a flight to denver then a longer one to chicago where he would arrive at another airport named for a world war ii hero also an aviator he had reserved a car ill be back tomorrow night he said ten fifteen do you want me to take a cab home i know youve got a rough day no no ill pick you up she was still the most beautiful woman hed ever seen still strawblond with some gray in her hair and possibly in her eyes she was a nurse and now administered a clinic in east boise a job she loved and gave herself to the mother of his only child shed taken him in years ago and given him a chance at life when the whole world had seemed set on destroying him but it was an old marriage by now somewhat burnished edging more to friendship and partnership than passion okay ill bob this isnt turning into one of your things she knew him so well it was a little frightening well i dont think so i know you youre really happiest out in the bush with donnie fenn hunting other men and being hunted by other men she knew donnie fenn well shed been married to him when he was kia vietnam while going to rescue his sniper team leader who lay with a shattered hip that team leader was bob im just trying to find a sword for this japanese gentleman he seemed like a very decent guy id like to help him that is all yes but i know your obsessions you get something in your mind and it gets bigger and bigger and pretty soon youve talked yourself into vietnam again it had happened a few times sometimes you cant help it someone comes for you and you must respond no man on earth responds better or truer sometimes i do okay but nobody is coming for you now this is what i dont understand what youre doing for this man its very decent but its so much whats going on why do you feel this obligation so intensely why is it so big to you this isnt some dry drunk thing some excuse to go off on a crusade and get crazy no its something i feel i owe my father and the japanese father your fathers been dead since nineteen fiftyfive and his since nineteen fortyfive its all so long ago how can an obligation remain to men dead half a century ago it dont even make sense to me honey i have to do this one i just do just dont find a way to go to war all right the good life is here youve earned it enjoy it im too old for war he said i just want to drink and sleep and you wont let me drink so i guess i just want to sleep thatll be the day she said the big white house he missed it on the first run through kenilworth which seemed to be but a mile or so long on the edge of lake michigan about fifteen miles north of chicago the houses were big mansions really and clearly this kenilworth was a spot where the rich lived and if they lived overlooking the lake they must be even richer but then he found it the reason he had missed it was that there was no house at all only a gateway sheathed in vines and buried in the shadows of elms you had to look hard for the numbers on the pillar he turned in guided the rented prizm a few hundred feet down what seemed a tunnel in the trees and then at last burst into light at a circular driveway and a big fine white house one of those legendary places with about a hundred rooms and tile floors and a sixcar garage it was the sort of place where great families lived back in the time when there were great families bob parked and knocked and after a time was greeted by a heavy bearded man his own age in black mainly he was also a drinking man he had a glass of something brown in his hand mr culpepper mr bob lee swagger im guessing yes sir thats me cool name so southern bob lee come on in youre right on time you said two and two it is thank you sir he stepped into a house that was magnificent though in a museum kind of way it seemed to be not lived in but preserved nice place bob said it sure is but try unloading it in a market like this you dont have six million bucks in your pocket do you no sir just a thought anyhow care for a drink im betting youre a drinking man i was but good thanks no sir one drink and i wake up three days down the pike in shanghai with a new wife that actually happened to me well almost anyway i sympathize been divorced once the drinking was part of it no fun huh i try to stay pleasantly lubed all day at least until all this bullshit is over ill refill if you dont mind he stopped at a bar added a slug of makers mark to his glass and another cube then turned as i said in my letter i remember the sword i cut myself on it pretty badly in the fifties it was sharp you looked at it and something started to bleed as i understand it the war swords were just meant to kill otherwise they were junk they werent like the fancy ones the older japanese in the flashy bathrobes carried my arm remembers how sharp it was he pushed up his left sleeve the scar was long and cruel that theres a fortystitch scar pard he said my one claim to macho people look at that and think ive been in a knife fight have you ever been in a knife fight i had to kill a man with a knife once sorry to say i thought so im not impressing you any i see anyhow as i said dad died some years ago as the only kid i inherited the house he went into advertising after the war and he did very well but we were from different planets he went his way i went mine advertising wasnt for me i never wanted to say the word client in my life so i went into tv i never had to say client instead i had to say sponsor anyhow ive got to sell this place to pay for my third divorce and this ones a mess why are the beautiful young ones so hard to get rid of i couldnt tell you that sir bob said with a smile its because theyve never heard the word goodbye so when you say it to them they take it personally he laughed this one wants my spleen for lunch as well as my dads fortune amazing sounds rough mr culpepper listen even a genuine tough guy like you would get a cold sweat on this mission anyway if you dont mind im going to take you to the storeroom in the attic and let you be maybe its there maybe its not i honestly dont know what happened to it i just dont have it in me to go through all that stuff you understand sure my attics a mess too nowhow can i say this if you find something you know private uh intimate maybe my dad had a stash of porn or letters from some girlfriend or even a boyfriend or something like that something indiscreet just leave it where you find it all right im not too interested in what is called the truth id like to remember him as the distant frozen grim cadaver he was in life all right id hate to find out he was actually human i got you they reached the third floor the end of a hall and entered a room anyhow ill leave you two old marines alone if he didnt get rid of it its probably still here really help yourself take your time the bathrooms down the hall if you want a drink want to break for dinner anything im here alone with my legal problems and trying to get in contact with a daughter who seems to have run off with somebody calling himself a documentary filmmaker have you noticed theyre all documentary filmmakers these days if you need me just holler its your sword really more than its mine and it would make the old bastard happy to know it finally went to you and then back to japan thank you sir please dont call me sir im just tom johns boy tom son of the mr culpepper of culpepper townsend mathers loud and clear tom can i call you sarge i always wanted to call someone sarge just like in the movies sure but the name i answer to mostly is gunny its from gunnery sergeant a rank only the marine corps has gunny oh that is cool gunny go to town so bob turned and faced what remained of the life of a man who once had commanded however briefly able company on a faroff place called iwo jima a hell that neither his only son nor even gunny swagger threetour survivor of vietnam could imagine back and back the boxes took bob through culpeppers life and a biography somehow formed two wives one much prettier than the other and younger too picked up sometime in the mids by which time the only child tommyhe was evident too a towheaded fatty somewhat overwhelmed by his glamorous and successful dadwas in his sullen shaggy teens finally an hour in and thirtyfive boxes deep having passed through adventures in advertising he came to world war ii presumably there was a box for yale or harvard too wherever the guy went but the war box held the usual junk good conduct ribbons battle stars the purple heart a few other trinkets but the treasure was a marine seabook chronicling assignments and a surpassing adequacy of performance bob went through it quickly and saw that yes originally john culpepper had been assigned to command a thirtyman marine detachment on the battleship iowa in that was really a ticket to survival that was saying rich boy were looking out for you you get to go home when its all over with a couple of pacific battle stars a captaincy some nice stories to tell and a leg up on all the otooles and zukowskis who were bobbing facedown in the red surf john had wanted to fight he could have sat it out but the records showed that late in january he transferred at sea from the iowa to the troopship lci where elements of the th regiment droned toward a date with death in the center of the largest marine corps invasion force ever assembled it certainly was unusual possibly thered been an injury aboard the lci and a th officer injured himself and couldnt continue duty so john was shunted in fast or possibly john fucked up in some big hideous way on the iowa and was sent to the line company punitively but more than anything the move had the marks of pull all over it happened all the time in nam boys would suddenly disappear a month into their thirteenmonth tour called stateside to work in the pentagon somebody had complained to mommy who complained to daddy whod done a congressman a milliondollar favor and so junior caught the freedom bird home but not john culpepper he used his pull to get into battle not out of it it couldnt have been easy a year on a battlewagon isnt the best training for something like iwo and when he got to the th the co wouldnt know him the other officers wouldnt know him and the men wouldnt know him hed go into the fight without much psychological support not easy and made harder by far by the peculiar savagery of iwo so john fought on iwo for a week on the third day earl swagger came down from headquarters and got his men through the successful assault against the blockhouse on the northwestern flank of suribachi as the th circled and cut off the five hundredfoot tall volcano then a few days later a shell landed close at hand the young officers legs were shattered he spent three nights in an aid station and was evacuated by hospital ship he recuperated in hawaii where he married his fiancée tommys mother mildred a plain girl also from the boston area by the time he was dutyready the abombs had been dropped the war was over he got to go home a hero even if hed probably never fired his carbine once it didnt matter he did what he was supposed to even if he was scared shitless the whole time thats what won wars the thousands of reluctant john culpeppers not the two or three earl swaggers but there was no sword where could it be maybe it got thrown out and off it went to the kenilworth dump to rust away to oblivion or be crushed to junk by a bulldozer bob tried to think hard on the issue what is the quality of a sword well its sharpness but thats the sword as weapon think of the sword as object the answer is its awkwardness its long and thin and curved you might display it but it wouldnt fit neatly into one of those standard cardboard boxes no youd have to wedge it in whos packing these boxes probably some workingmen hired by the surviving son who has suddenly acquired a house he doesnt particularly want and never remembers fondly but hes got to get it into shape sell it before his wife files for divorce so someone packs all this stuff thinking not a bit about it not engaged in the familys life having no special sense of the meaning of a sword taken in battle and bob went to the first closet no but in the second one he found three golf bags and there in the third one amid the sixes and sevens and the drivers and the wedges and the putter was captain hideki yanos shingunto tom oh yeah you found it said tom culpepper rising from a desk in what had been his fathers study he had his everpresent glass of makers with him apparently just recently freshened i did yes it was in a golf bag i thought you might want to have a look yeah i suppose i do yeah thats it he said taking it holding it to the light here let me point out something see this peg or whatever it is he pointed to a stub a few inches above the circular hilt of the old thing it seemed clotted with some kind of black tar or something smeary and gummy but it also in the right angle of light threw up tiny puncture wounds i remember the day i got cut id snuck it out of dads study and we were waving it around playing pirate or something fiftyseven fiftyeight sometime around there then we got the bright idea to take it apart dont ask me why we examined it and it seemed to be held together by this little wooden pin through this hole see it runs from one side to the other that secures the handle to the blade im guessing i see said bob who already knew the correct terms from the internet the bamboo peg was mekugi the hole into which it fit mekugiana but it was stuck we tried to drive it out with a hammer and nail and all we did was dent it god when i think of it now im a little ashamed we had no idea it was just a big sword thing for killing pirates you were just kids how could you know we never got it out i hate to remember this thing on the floor and im whacking on it the blade is getting all crudded up on the floor its got some kind of gunk on it real thick black stuff i dont know if the japanese officer put it there or your father or mine or someone at the factory or what but its not coming out easily no its not someone wanted to hold it together go on pull it john culpeppers son tom drew the sword out it buzzed against the tightness of the metal scabbard then described an arc across the room as he brandished it wow he said this baby still wants to cut something here it scares me a little he handed it over to bob who in taking it felt some kind of chargewhat a thrill a buzz a vibrationas indeed the baby still wanted to cut something you could tell in a flash it was superbly designed for its purpose a thin ridge running each side of the gently curving blade reaching the tipkissaki he knew it to be called he felt the blasphemous power of the thing it had exquisite balance but the blade seemed something even more somehow weirdly alive he waved it just a little and could have sworn that it contained some soft core that pitched forward in the momentum speeding toward its destination he held it up to the light indeed the blade had seen hard use the steel was dull upon close inspection a haze of crosshatched nicks and cuts small black flecks attacked it randomly on the edgeyakiba he knewalmost microscopic chips were missing whether from small boys whacking it against a tree or a japanese officer drawing it against a marines neck the handguardtsubawas a heavy circle of iron like an ornate coaster almost the grip was tacky the sword was covered in gritty fish skin then wrapped elaborately in a kind of flat cotton cording that was darkened with sweat or grime worn in places and frayed if you waved it the sword rattled ever so gently because he now saw the guard wasnt secured tightly by spacers i remember as a kid you could slice paper with it thats how sharp it was said tom culpepper here lets try it he grabbed a heavy piece of stationery and bob touched edge to paper and felt the sword pause then slide through neatly tom dropped two pieces of paper to the ground i cant believe its that sharp he said nothing should be that sharp narita you cant get mad you cant get mad yet it was all he could do to sit there its a test he told himself theyre testing the gaijin they want to see if i have the maturity the patience the commitment to politeness and ceremony to be worth talking to in japan or maybe he thought theyre like cops everywhere they just dont give a fuck whichever the result was the same he sat in the narita international airport police station forty miles outside tokyo it was a stark functional space with nothing like the swanky shoppingmall flash of the public hallways on higher levels the process had all been set up having discovered the sword he had called the retired colonel bridges of the marine historical section explained all and bridges had volunteered to run the paperwork which was considerable he had the dc contacts and knew someone who knew someone at the japan external trade organization or jetro on the west coast which had some mysterious influential connection with the ministry of economy trade and industry known as meti one of those large governmental entities with fingers in many pies arrangements were made with customs to let the sword into the country it would be removed from quarantine immediately to the narita airport police department where a license would be duly issued thus with the customs certificate and the license it was all supposed to be legal but something was wrong now he waited in the central room near the desk with beaten korean workers with angry salarymen whod gotten drunk and acted out and had to be put down with a thump on the head with grifters and cheats maybe with the odd minor gangster or two as gangsters were said to be spread widely throughout japanese society they were called yakuza he knew yaks for short but wait wait wait finally ah yes you have sword his interrogator wore a pale blue uniform with a small handguna smith wesson possiblyin a flapped black holster he was an unprepossessing man not one of your beefier cop types yes sir the documents are there i just need the license and that was supposed to be arranged arranged yes sir heres the letter he handed it over its a relic its from the war mr yanos father died in battle and lost his sword i believe this was it that it was taken in battle by my father mr yano came to america looking for the sword i didnt have it then and it took me a couple of months but i think i have it now the uniformed officer took the document the sword is supposed to be delivered here from the customs office upstairs its all arranged swords are very dangerous you must wait i will go check and call your name please return to your seat and so bob sat he thought it would take a few minutes but the minutes dragged on until sixty of them mounted up then sixty more maybe he could go out get a book a newspaper a cup of coffee something everyone else in the waiting room had more patience they could sit without making a sound without fuss the passage of time meant nothing to them a name would be called out off theyd go to be interviewed deposed to give a statement make an identification finally in the third hour a name was called and after a second he realized that it was some sort of approximation of swagger it came out su waggaa yes here ah yes you come please he went with the officera different one slighter younger though in uniform with a little gun in a holster as welland back through squad and staff rooms more insurance agency really than cop shop because there wasnt the sense of bullymacho of men who used their weight to require obedience that you felt in an american variation finally he was led into a room a uniformed senior police officer gestured for him to sit down sorry we had to do some checking its fine for meti to have plans but no one here knew a thing bureaucracy i understand sorry for the trouble called your embassy had to check with meti the man there was out to lunch this is unusual people dont usually bring them into japan sure the swords are so beautiful its usually the other way around sorry for the problem tell me please again bob went through it trying to keep his sentences short and clear his father captain yano iwo the surprise visit the request his discovery his decision to honor his father mr yanos father mr yano and his family jetro and meti his talks with the meti rep in la the letter the sense that arrangements had been made he concluded with is there a problem a small one you see this is shingunto you know shingunto sure army sword i know it aint nothing fancy not like the beautiful swords that are so much a part of the japanese heritage yes you see its not much not a beautiful piece by any means like some old rather hard used what you dont see is that we have a regulation forbidding this kind of sword the army sword from coming in that kind of sword yes you see its gendaito modern yes and so officially its not an antique that tells us of our heritage and reflects the skill of our artisans its merely a weapon we would regard it as we would regard a gun you know there are no guns in japan thats why i left my bazooka at home excellent decision anyhow the gendaito sword the gun in japanese eyes legally they would be the same thing okay but i understand and i appreciate the man who visited you probably wasnt thinking precisely about this issue meti wasnt thinking about this issue only about necessary import forms difficulties with customs that sort of thing sorry for the trouble see i wanted it to be a surprise the man i mean to present it to he doesnt know im here i only wired him told him i thought id have some good news for him the reason i did it that way was that when he visited me he preferred to do it without making an appointment he didnt want me going out of my way to arrange hospitality he was trying to be as helpful as possible i felt i owed him the same i knew if i told him i was coming hed make a big todo hed meet me hed have the house cleaned all his kids would be dressed up it would be a major event i didnt care to do that i was trying to act appropriately i see i believe you what im going to do is bend the rules a little i have prepared a sword license for you he produced the document which looked a little like the treaty of ghent with all its formal kanji characters in perfect vertical columns utterly meaningless to bob it had been stamped dramatically with some kind of red image and it also had an impressive official serial number see here where it says year of fabrication by our standards anything that is showa is gendaito showa meaning from the age of the emperor hirohito onward that is from nineteen twentysix onward so in year of fabrication i have written eighteen twentyfive which puts it in the legally acceptable antique category of shinshinto meaning anything from eighteen hundred up to the first year of emperor hirohitos reign nineteen twentysix given the deep curve of the blade i am told by our sword expert that is at least arguable therefore neither you nor the man who receives the gift should be in any legal jeopardy that is what has taken so long im very appreciative no it is we who should be appreciative as i say i have an officer here who knows a good deal about these things he understood what a warm gesture of friendship and reconciliation it was for you to return the blade to the family of the original officer it was his idea how to proceed he examined the sword very closely that gesture should not be hindered by stupid regulations again i say thank you very much sir all right now you must keep this license with the blade at all times and i would keep the sword bagged until you make the presentation i will of course do so mr swagger i hope you enjoy your visit to japan it is my pleasure sir i know i will the yanos after a night in a hotel in a part of town called shinjuku which he picked at random for economy after a shower a western dinner a walk a western breakfast he walked to the train station through mobs that astonished him the city was like being inside a television set it seemed to be comprised mostly of vertical circuitry very complex very miniaturized he was suddenly transported to somebody elses future the reigning design principle seemed to be no wastage things were crammed in built within bigger things wedged this way and that even the alleyways were jammed with restaurants stalls and retail shops each with a worm of neon above it and of course a sign it was a literate society writing was everywhere in big signs that counseled certain consumer choices in the endless series of official designations of regulations and rulings and serial numbers or directional indicators the japanese hurtled by him all were on schedules no one lagged all had destinations the intensity of the crowds was somewhat shocking at least in this shinjuku place it was like new years eve in times square the crowds seemed organisms of their own a red light stilled them all but no other force on earth could and when the green came on baby it was dday everybody hitting the beach at once it was all go go go now now now most of the men wore suits most of the women wore suits he knew they were called salarymen they worked like slaves they made the country go they conformed they never let loose they always stayed on track you know where that leads you all that repression all that discipline all that pressure to conform all that rigidity it builds it builds it builds and so when they blow they blow examples of the blow are rife in history thus a nanking a pearl harbor a kamikaze no prisoners australian pilots beheaded for the cameras killing ten enemy soldiers before you go thus choosing death over life every damn time and when the wiring blew sexually it really blew on the jr train to the suburbs which arrived on the minute probably the second he sat next to a fellow who could have been an accountant a salesman a teacher a computer designerneat suit hornrimmed glasses hair slicked down unselfconscious focused driven but bob saw what had the fellows interest it wasnt the wall street journal but some comic book about bound teen girls being violated by other teen girls with tools that were exactly what they seemed only bigger the drawings voluptuous and specific and amplified it could get you arrested in some places in america here a fellow who looked like he understood mortgages read it casually apparently following the story with some kind of rapture bob looked up and down the crowded car and saw at least two other men reading books with brightly colored almost gaily cartoonized rape scenes on the covers no one noticed no one cared last night hed wandered into a sex zone a place called kabukicho where all this stuff was ramped up ever higher in blue neon on billboards and videos in store windows in the dives where the barkers tried to entice visitors into entering yet no one talked to him or beckoned him he got the sense that the japanese may have a sexual imagination next to no ones on earth and elaborate means of satisfying it but it was a yamatoonly thing no gaijin need apply the alleyways and unknown byways and unnamed streets of the strange little empire of kabukicho lit by an infinite replication of vertically arrayed signs with names like prinprin and golden gals and club marvel were coagulated with flesh hunters they wanted to see it smell it stroke it lick it suck it fuck it or maybe even eat it it was a carnivores glee a raptors urgent need and its passion amazed him and maybe frightened him a little now he rode the train with a million or so other souls and got off at a far station carrying his bag he checked the instructions written out for him in painful english by the hotels concierge a gentleman of much dignity and precision who had made the necessary phone calls he knew leave the station find a cab there wasnt going to be any driving in tokyos mad traffic even in the suburbs made more lethal for americans by the fact that it required driving on the left not the right why didnt macarthur fix that the cab was driven by a man in white gloves and was spotless even the seats were lined in white doily commercial buildings and elaborate buses floated by and uniformed attendants were everywhere queuing lines directing traffic pointing to parking spaces again the sense of all the room being neatly organized and partitioned controlled by some central committee somewhere so that no oddshaped parcel went underutilized finally they found it it was a big house set back from other big housesyano was clearly welloffand not nearly so jammed in as were most of the other houses in tokyo it was surrounded by an elaborate garden in which someone took a lot of pride he checked his watch pm tokyo time that seemed about right he paid went to the trunk took out the canvas travel bag opened it and out came the sword wrapped in a red scarf he headed up the walk the big low house with all its wooden crosshatching and the precision of the garden absorbed him he knocked on the door there were sounds from inside and in a few seconds the door slid open and there in a kimono absolutely astonished was philip yano the retired officer looked the same out of a suit as in one every hair in place face extremely clean shaven muscular under the bluewhite pattern of his kimono he wore white ankle socks his right eye opened in stupefaction while the damaged one stayed flat mr yano sir remember me bob lee swagger sorry for barging in like this oh mr swagger yanos mouth fell open but he regained control in an instant i am honored to have you here my goodness why didnt you tell me you were coming i was expecting some kind of letter i am astonished well sir the more i thought about it the more it seemed to me that the occasion demanded a personal visit both our fathers would have preferred that its my pleasure please please come in bob stepped into a groundlevel vestibule removed his shoes then turned as mr yano quickly summoned the family the first thing bob noticed was a pair of eyes peeping out at him mischievously a girl of about four peered around a corner his eyes met hers and her face dissolved into delighted laughter as she ducked back giggling then she peered around again hi there sweetie bob said to the child meanwhile two strapping teenage boys in jeans and sweatshirts came in barefoot mr swagger may i present my sons john and raymond hi guys he said bowing a young woman arrived my first daughter tomoe maam and the little devil down there is named miko again miko giggled then buried her face in her mothers dress bob had an immediate response to her she was one of those dynamos she hadnt mastered her cultures reticence yet and might never do so she was he could tell a bold brave child full of beans as the old saying went howdy little girl he called and she found that very amusing and my wife suzanne mr swagger sir we are so honored and pleased as i was telling your husband the honor and the pleasure are mine i hope i havent come at the wrong time no no no please do come in its so nice to see you there was a lot of bowing and smiling a lot of awkward but wellmeant politeness but he felt overwhelming warmth yano spoke quickly to his wife in japanese then turned to bob i remind her what an extraordinary man you are how honored we are to have a marine of such accomplishments visit our humble house youre so kind but all thats way past anyhow i found this i wanted it returned to your family with that he turned the bundle over to mr yano i think that has to be your fathers it was in the possession of the son of the commanding officer of the unit my father was with that day i have a later letter from him stating that my father gave him the sword on iwo jima probably february twentyseventh nineteen fortyfive in an aid station where he was awaiting evacuation i found that letter in some effects of an aunt and from that i traced it back to the commanders family and located his son and heir i traveled out there and found the sword i dont know what to say it was such a generous thing to do well as i told you i dont think i could ever be the man my father was but i wanted to do something that would honor his memory and your fathers memory both were brave men i hope i have yano held the thing feeling its weight its balance but still hadnt unwrapped it it was as if he was forestalling the moment i do want to warn you bob said theres not much to see as you said its a military relic much abused pretty grimy the scabbard needs paint the grip is all loose the hilt rattles a little bit the wrapping around the grip is pretty shabby and its missing that little metal loop through the end of the handle where i believe a tassel or something went the blade has seen hard usage too its all scratched nicked up has a few bits missing at the edge its a sword thats been to war not one for a parade or a court ceremony i will put it aside for now please come in and rest tell us of your journey sit relax have tea or some kind of juice i remember that you do not drink or i would offer you sake please come in and make yourself comfortable he gave his guest a pair of slippers bob put them on and followed his host up a set of stairs down a hall and into the living room which was full of western furniture though on a smaller scale yano spoke quickly to his wife who answered bowed slightly before bobbob bowed back awkwardlyand asked him if he preferred bottled water tea coffee or juice maam the bottled water would be fine she spoke quickly to the daughter tomoe who hustled out and returned in what seemed like seconds with a tray and various beverages yano maneuvered bob into what had to be a preferred seat and bob knew enough to refuse twiceno no reallybefore acceding to the request he was immediately to the left of an alcove in which family mementos were displayed certificates of accomplishment photographs of yano in uniform at various military installations pictures of the boys in baseball uniforms and of the older girl at graduationas one would find in any american officers home down in the corner bob saw a sepia photo of a man in a tight tunic with a military cap rigidly in place over a cleanshaven head that had to be mr yanos father bob was asked about his trip and he had one story to tell only one but it got a laugh the worst part of the flight was getting through security yes its very bad now well for me its always an adventure i light up a metal detector like you wouldnt believe sirens go off bells ring guys drop down on ropes no im exaggerating but i have a metal hip and so i always make the detectors crazy so im always hauled aside and gone up one side down the other it makes everybody nervous im sure if he knew how much trouble it was going to cause the guy who shot me would have picked another target yano laughed spoke quickly in japanese to his obedient sons bob thought he picked out a word that had to be vietnam in a japanese accent then each of the boys identified himself raymond seventeen played baseball was going off to chuo university next year to study electrical engineering john fourteen also played baseball was in his second year of junior high school wasnt sure what hed study in college tomoe nineteen was at keio university in premed she was a grave beautiful girl who didnt talk at all and seemed to have been unofficially designated the hostess it was as if the family was well drilled on jobs and responsibilities the two boys were audience tomoe was staff and logistics suzanne the wife and mother was benevolent godmother and philip was master of ceremonies host and interpreter he alone spoke english with precision suzanne was second and for the older boys and tomoe english was largely theoretical meanwhile the adorable little miko was as unselfconscious as a wood sprite giggling and mischievous she seemed to have conceived some unique attraction to bob and he noted that she sometimes stared at him when he winked at her she dissolved in laughter she whispered something to her mother swaggersan said suzanne my daughter thinks you are the tin man from wizard of oz everybody laughed swagger remembered the character from the movie hed watched with his daughter many years ago he saw the tall glowing strangelooking fellow with a gigantic tin chest and a funnel on his head he must look like that to the child some mornings i feel like i could use some oil to get my joints working bob said so maybe shes onto something sweetie i aint made of metal just skin like everyone else but miko had decided swagger was the tin man the family sat completely intent on bob the japanese were well schooled in hospitality and as they took the gaijin in the language barrier quickly seemed to melt away soon enough miko decided she wasnt getting enough attention at a certain moment she assaulted her father like a linebacker seeking a quarterback and scrambled up to his lap everybody laughed she is a little cannonball said philip yano a late arrival to our family most unexpected now much loved she looked over at swagger and stuck out her tongue then laughing merrily buried her face in her fathers chest squirming mightily to find comfort until she grew bored at which time shed assault another family member through all this the red bundle sat on the sofa next to mr yano never once did he address it glance at it seem to relate to it at all for all intents and purposes it did not exist but at last it was time mr swagger may i take you to my shop and we will examine the sword there yes absolutely mr yano spoke quickly to his daughter in japanese i ask tomoe to accompany us and take notes he said that way i have a record of my first impressions that i may later consult of course bob followed mr yano downstairs the tiny room they entered was scrupulously neat and on one side were seven japanese swords of various lengths and curvatures in brightly lacquered scabbards or saya as the japanese called them on another wall were shelves with a variety of texts on swords on the bench were stones a small hammer a few bottles of oil what looked to be some sort of powder puff various tools and rags all neatly folded i see youre serious about the swords im trying to learn the art of polishing its very difficult and i havent really the patience for it but i labor on thinking if i know this then i really know something i get you sometimes its best to lose yourself in the tiny it keeps the world out at the same time it is the world the father translated for the daughter who replied swiftly enough she says you must have been japanese in an earlier life it would explain much ill take that as a compliment and so you should and now to the sword he confronted the red bundle before him on the desk these things have been an obsession in our country for more than a thousand years literally said philip yano a westerner might say its just a piece of steel but you see in it all our pathologies our love of courage but also our love of violence our sense of justice but also our willingness to kill the rigor of our society the corruption of that rigor discipline skill but also tyranny even dictatorship i have been studying them hard for a year now ever sincewell ever since retirement yet still i know almost nothing there are men here who have given their lives over to the study of such things now you have given me the ultimate moment in my life the studying ive done the past year now has formal application not merely to the nation and the culture but to the family really my friend i cant thank you enough or honor your generosity more highly i am eternally obligated its one soldier reaching out to another soldier to honor two other soldiers who happen to be their fathers we put in enough time in shitholes to have earned this little moment lets enjoy it and we shall he opened the bundle and the object lay before him battered worn thin in places drawn through history he spoke to his daughter who recorded assiduously then yano translated for bob i see shingunto furniture of the thirtyfour issue absent tassel but the scabbard is metal meaning the thirtynine variant and so not original to the furnishings hmmm wear on the wrappings some grime possibly my fathers sweat and a bit of his blood or someone elses blood looking carefully at the peg i see traces of some black gummy substance tar perhaps perhaps ink i see marks of recent pressure and the seal of the gummy material has been broken the gum or ink just under the rupture of the broken seal is of a darker texture suggesting that it was shielded from the light until quite recently whats that mean bob asked i dont know i have no idea i suppose someone tried to hammer out the pin tommy culpepper told me that when he was a kid he and his buddies did try to get that out they wanted to take it apart but they didnt have any luck mr yano said nothing finally he said all right the blade almost gingerly he reached down and removed the sword from its scabbard and laid the weapon on the bench koto his daughter said possibly a shinto imitation of koto he said it looks koto to me she said in english yes yes it does maybe and he paused in the little room the silence grew as the man studied the sword clearly perplexed perhaps even disturbed his face became mute to expression his eyelids seemed suddenly to acquire weight and density and his breathing became almost imperceptible finally he said most provocative unlikely but most provocative then he turned to bob what is it you say the plot thickens yes sir meaning things just got more complicated indeed in the war japan needed blades two companies were set up to manufacture blades in the hundreds of thousands those would be the blades called shingunto judged today to be of no consequence except as souvenirs i had always assumed that my father would have had such a weapon most did or at least many did he probably himself believed that but at the same time other likelihoods existed many older blades were turned into the military out of patriotic commitment by enthusiastic families and they were rather cavalierly desecrated by the sword manufacturers who after all were not artists but humble factory workers their exquisite koshiraethat is their fittings the handle the hilt the tsuba and on and onwere simply dumped it would make certain men weep to think of all that artwork that craft and skill consigned to the dump pile the swords were shortened from the rear to bring them to the prescribed lengththat is the tang was cut off and with it was lost much of the inscribed information from the original smith information as to the date of smelting the lord for whom the work was done how the blade cut perhaps even giving the sword a name or offering a prayer to a god of war part of the original lower blade was ground off to lengthen the tang a new hole was drilled in the grip and the military mounts were put on the whole thing was shoved into a metal scabbard and sent towell wherever the sphere was operating be it china or burma or the philippines and thus a masterpiece was effectively hidden in a wartime disguise is that what happened here i dont know its not impossible clearly this is an ancestral blade shortened for wartime use by shape and grace as my daughter has noted it appears to be kotoold koto blades were generally thinner and more graceful and sharper meaning livelier in the hand than shinto blades koto means old as inwell it differs but roughly old as in before sixteen hundred of course there are complexities possibly a shinto smiththat is someone after sixteen hundredmerely duplicated the shape of the koto blade it happened frequently the swordsmiths after all were merchants they did custom orders they responded to market forces they tried different things so youre telling me this sword might be some kind of antique a historical artifact would it be valuable very possibly not that we could ever sell such a piece it is ours it is of our blood it is my fathers what im telling you is that it might be ah interesting meaning of interest to more than just our humble yano clan interesting to scholars interesting to historians interesting to the nation and the culture what is far more provocative is the swords heritage what we can learn of it from whats left of its tang if that looks promising we might have the sword polished im not good enough to attempt it its a timeconsuming discipline only practiced by a few at the highest level but if the sword has secrets a polishing will liberate them well see its soul if we polish it nii of shinsengumi nii of shinsengumi was an obedient samurai he obeyed his great lord kondosan in all things he would die for kondosan kondosan after all had seen talent in the wild streetboy aggression perhaps even a future many hoped for such a thing but it had actually happened to nii nii was taken from nothingness into shinsengumi he finally belonged to somebody to something he was no longer an orphan dirty laughed at by other children his fluffy body hardened under discipline he learned things that astonished him and his faith in himself grew appropriately to his love for his great lord he was still young but in shinsengumi all things were possible the group was comprised of the best men and though its discipline was severe the pleasure and the privileges attendant upon joining such chosen ones were omnipotent he learned the katana the long cutting sword its intricate economy of force and power its strength and its grace applied correctly with judgment and experience katana could cut through anything including bodies fully one side to the other he imagined unleashing it the swing the thunder of the cut the spewing jetting blood the scream of the stricken his stillness he learned wakizashi the shorter personal defense sword it was an indoor sword it would not catch on ceilings or doorjambs and yet it too had almost the same power as katana no one could stop it if a determined shinsengumi applied it he saw short harder cuts the slack stunned look of the cut dissolving into pain a cough that issued blood the collapse to the floor like a sack of grain he learned tanto tanto was short and without nearly the curve of katana and wakizashi for it was not made for cutting but for thrusting if he put his strength behind it nii could shove it deeper into a body than anyone in shinsengumi he could easily reach the bloodbearing organ and he knew exactly where to pierce down through the shoulder on a slight angle into the pumping heart or up from the back next to the spine seven vertebrae from the neck up again piercing the heart pierced the heart would yield its treasure in seconds the body it sustained would go instantly soft as if its knees had melted its eyes would roll up into its skull and it would fall without discipline to the floor frequently shattering teeth when it landed the blood would pool like an ocean but tanto held another possibility disgraced or surrounded in tanto lay a hope for dignity nii of shinsengumi knew what he must do to spare himself the shame and sustain kondosans affection forever he knew he could do it too he didnt need a second hed ram the blade fiercely into the left side of the pit of his own stomach a minimum of three inches more likely four to five better yet six though not many could force themselves to push for that long then one would smartly draw it across his belly just under the navel tanto was always kept sharp for that purpose his guts would slip out wetly amid a flood of blood shit urine and other substances it was said that one had eight seconds of consciousness after the blade reached its point of arrival they would be an interesting eight seconds would one scream would one beg for the pain to stop would one be unmanned not nii of shinsengumi he could not disgrace himself before his lord he would be silent for in his pain would be the sheer rapture of a warriors pure death that was the way of the warrior death was the way the music on his ipod stopped damn the battery was running down again he had the worst ipod it always let him down hed been listening to arctic monkeys live in concert at the brixton united football stadium the great song whatever people say i am thats what im not the beat had him really pumped up hed felt it to his bones aghhhh it would be a long night without arctic monkeys he reached for and lit a marlboro he sat in a sleek nissan maxima jet black five on the floor half a block down from the yanos house his job was the american he would stay with the american and he would call in and report to kondosan any movement or change in plans hed stay the night if he had to he had a chinesemade wakizashi in saya wedged into his belt diagonally up his back he had a smith wesson model special he wore a black italian shirt a black italian suit a black italian hat and a pair of extremely expensive michael jordan nikes he wore louis vuitton sunglasses which had cost him more than yen they were really cool he wore his hair in a glistening crew held taut and bristly by yamada wax it was perfectly trimmed he was twentythree strong as a bull and ready for anything he had chosen death nii of shinsengumi was a very good samurai black rust the rust said tomoe yano in english look at the rust father oh what beautiful rust said philip yano bob thought are they nuts thats koto rust no rust is so black as koto rust beautiful beautiful black rust said philip oh so beautiful wearing rubber surgeons gloves the father disassembled the sword he used a small hammer and a pin perfectly sized to drive the bamboo peg out of the grip it popped out effortlessly he tracked the little nub of bamboo down as it rolled on his bench then stared at it shinto at least maybe original maybe koto then why so easy it just fell out bob remembered the peg had been stuck but he didnt say anything what did he know i dont know maybe it was disassembled recently i cant say one of many questions this is very interesting philip yano slid the grip off then carefully disassembled the guardtsuba bob knewand several spacers seppa and finally the collar habaki and laid out the parts symmetrically on the bench blade at the bottom of the formation grip above hilt laid flat and four spacers then they saw a piece of paper folded tightly about the metal of the tang the paper the young woman said gravely yes i see it father pick it up see what it is no no not yet pen ready yes he spoke in a swift blizzard of japanese then he translated the tsubathat is guardis government issue the model of thirtynine also so when it found its new scabbard it was rehilted this is what i tell tomoe spacersseppaalso military issue as is habaki nothing special two holes indicating it has been cut down but we already knew that the rust tomoe said what is it with the rust asked bob the tang itself was swallowed in black erosion so much so a fine black dust had fallen on the bench beneath it the blacker the rust said philip yano the older the blade what it means swaggersan is that this sword is at least four hundred years old somehow it ended up in the military furniture of nineteen thirtyfour is that uncommon it happened so its not a blade manufactured by machine in some factory in the forties its much older its a real samurai thing that is why its so sharp exactly think of some genius in a small shop in nearfeudal timesbefore the year sixteen hundredworking at a forge turning the orange metal in upon itself time after time taking two or three different orange pieces and hammering them together after each had been folded over twenty times beating them into a shape then quenching them in cooling clay then he began filing shaping sharpening its three kinds of steel soft for the spine which gives it weight and flexibility a liquid feel softer still in the core more pure iron more flexibility and a sandwich of harder tempered steelyakibafor the edge sharp to cut through armor flesh and bone and get deep into the body oh its a war sword all right and if my father carried it on iwo jima he wasnt the first soldier to sling this beauty about not at all its old its venerable its been to the dance many a time born in fire cooled in earth destined for blood maybe the inscriptions will tell the story he indicated the line of japanese characters deeply chiseled in the tang as the maker of the blade those centuries ago accounted for himself and his creation and explained for whom he had toiled can you read the inscriptions asked bob thatll be the fun part there were thousands of koto smiths and we will have to track through the records and find who made this sword we will be able to learn the smith maybe even the lord then well look at history and begin to assemble a biography of this blade where it went what it did before it somehow came to my father and then yours and then their sons it all has meaning said the girl father read the nakago for swaggersan nakago is the rusted tang under the hilt even it is full of tantalizing communications from the past its suriage nakago or possibly an osuriage nakago that is its right on the edge between shortened and greatly shortened the determining factor being how much of the signature is left usually the butt end even when shortened retains the shape of the original it was as if the desecrator were paying homage to his superior this style is called iriyamagata which places it sometime in the sixteenth or seventeenth century the cuttingedge side of the tang is at an acute angle to the bottom end of the shinogi line the other side runs either straight or at a slight upward angle to mune lost me bob thought but he guessed philip yano was telling him the very shape of the end of the tang held clues to its origin you sure know this stuff i know nothing said yano there are many to whom this language is as supple and expressive as poetry i struggle doubt my knowledge wish i knew more curse myself for not knowing yet but do i get the bottom line that this is a very old blade and it could have some meaning beyond your family experts should examine it thats right it may be nothing not every old blade was used by musashi miyamoto just as not every old colt was carried by wyatt earp so the odds are very small but stillthey exist remember someone always wins a lottery i will learn what i can before i make any consultations itll take me longer than it should and it is foolish as many could know in a flash thats all right though its time spent with my father the paper said the girl yes finally it looks like some kind of note bob said this is why i fear it it is possibly a death poem we do that we japanese it is because death is so welcome to us that we reach to embrace it and celebrate it with poetry yet you hesitate father his daughter said suppose it says dear god save me i cannot stand this anymore then it proves your father was human said bob ive been shot at a lot and my thoughts have been dear god save me i cannot stand this anymore swaggersan speaks a truth father you must face it you must reach out to your father do you want to be alone no no said yano much better to be with one i love and one i respect he took the paper off the nakago shaking it so that an ancient fine powder of black oxidized steel fell away he read it and began to weep his daughter read it and began to weep bob thought it best to say nothing but the girl looked over at him the tears running down her face i think its for all the boys of iwo jima said philip yano no matter the color of their skin he read above the volcano a moon over hell lights the faces of the doomed and dying soldiers buried in black sand on the black island await their destiny we are the broken jade of sulfur island steel on tuesday night the boy raymond had a baseball game and got a single and a double he played left field appeared to have a sound arm and an instinct for the ball on wednesday the daughter tomoe had a recital she played the cello and to bob at least she was superb it wasnt that the kids were so well behaved and such high performers that so thoroughly attracted him or even that the darling little miko reminded him of his own daughter nikkiyk she had christened herself when young it was that in some way the family unit was like an idealized marine corps everyone knew his duties and did them there were no rogue neuroses no raw egos no angry resentments if there were they were held so far inside that they were never seen and never blew but the yanos laughed a lot and seemed genuinely to enjoy each others presence to the exclusion of the world he really felt happy among them no ive enjoyed it so much and youve been so hospitable but i have to go i have a life back in the states i had hoped to have news for you on the sword before you left said mr yano i have exhausted all my books and have begun to make inquiries there are many antique volumes from the nineteenth century with much information the book of the sword was published in many editions in the last one hundred years the best collection is in osaka at the university there i had planned a trip you would enjoy that part of japan im sure i would i have a wife and daughter however several businesses to look after and remember that field i was cutting i still want to finish that damned thing remember im the tin man chop chop chop i understand on the last night he and philip yano sat up after the family had gone to bed yano drank sake from a ceramic bottle in a little flat cup bob had tea it was time to talk of that which united them and made them trust war and wounds how is the hip is it painful you get used to it its always ten degrees colder than everything else and as i said getting through airport security is a mess its not so funny now you have other wounds i seem not to be able to get out of the way of little pieces of flying steel i have been shot and wounded a variety of times that one was the worst it took a friend from me i am sorry to say and he was a boy who would have given the world many gifts so i mourn for him still the other wounds sting sometimes but it aint nothing i cant live with my daughter says you sleep poorly sorry hope i didnt scare nobody my dreams arent the softest i took many lives i thought i was a big samurai and for what nothing i can lay a hand on well something called duty i aint smart enough to define it but i felt it then and goddammit no matter what i still feel it they aint takin it away that is the burden of the samurai that commitment to duty that is why we are only happy among other samurai who have taken lives seen blood and ruin tasted defeat and bitterness no one else can truly know they can guess they cannot truly know id drink to that if i was still a drinking man i have to ask you philip your eye you dont talk of it but i recognize scar tissue when i see it oh that really nothing iraq bob thought he misheard had he been drinking did the guy say iraq where the marines were still fighting i thought that was our little pile of bad news japan in a spirit of support sent small numbers of noncombat support troops nominally guarded by dutch combat troops assigned engineering duties in a town in the south called samawah but you know the thorough boring japanese we didnt quite trust the dutch and so secretly a small unit of paratroopers was sent as actual security it was my honor to be selected as commanding officer they even postponed my retirement normally you must leave at fiftyfive but because they trusted me they asked me to stay in uniform through the assignment you must have been a superb officer thats not a job they give to secondraters but i already knew that i worked hard but of course have no genius for it as do you you were a hero i was an officer who tried his best on the third of february two thousand four an ied went off next to a japanese troop carrier which was pitched over and started to burn some men had difficulty getting out as commanding officer it fell to me to make the effort we did in fact get them all out but not before one of those rpgs detonated nearby and my face was sliced open my eye destroyed that was it thirtythree years of service ten seconds worth of action and a careerending wound so it goes i did what i could i got my people out and i trust that the men remember me with respect getting blown up in somebody elses war aint no picnic the funny thing was that since we didnt officially have combat troops in the engagement my eye wasnt officially damaged however my eye disagrees with that assessment in any event it was enough to serve well your father would be proud of you he would salute you if nobody else did and so would mine they knew you are very kind now i have a gift for you oh really yes very japanese perhaps it will mean nothing but its a credo to live by as in our ways we both have after the ways of our fathers who were the better men yes by far yano left and came back with a carefully wrapped package which looked like a book or something booksize should i open it now bob asked yes as i must explain the paper had been so perfectly folded that bob again felt like a desecrator inside the ruptured nest of paper was an oblong frame in some ancient wood turning it over he came across a series of japanese characters in beautiful calligraphy running down the center of a piece of yellowed rice paper looking at it he felt something in the brushstrokes lightness deftness precision artistry like falling water or the color of leaves its beautiful he said the calligraphy belongs to the man called miyamoto musashi he is regarded as japans greatest swordsman he fought over sixty duels and won them all he is revered though for his wisdom he retreated from the world and wrote the book of five rings his guide to the sword and to life to him the sword was life i see said bob a professional yes samurai warrior my father your father the same so i give this to you no its not original for that would be priceless but the calligraphy was done by hand by a superb local after musashi please tell me what it says he wrote this in sixteen fortyfive the old one knew he says steel cuts flesh steel cuts bone steel does not cut steel do you see bob saw the rest of them they are flesh and bone they will be cut the regular people the sleepers the dreamers the soft we are the hard we are the warriors we cannot be cut thats our job and thats why they need us in ways they cant even imagine said philip yano sake nii of shinsengumi stayed with the american all the way out the man took a taxi from the yanos after a bright mornings formal goodbye in the front yard but not to the station as you might expect but to yasukuni the shrine dedicated to the fallen of japans wars it wasnt a place most westerners went to while the taxicab with his luggage sat racking up the yen in the parking lot the american went into the shrine and stood humbly before the altar for some time nii wondered what the fuck is this all about it made no sense to him whatsoever then the man walked the grounds he was a gaijin and others avoided him but he didnt seem to notice or care he walked about slowly with that odd trace of a limp again as if trying to make communion with something immaterial he stayed longer than the young yakuza could imagine anybody staying he stood under the soaring steel torii gate that seemed to reflect the spirit of the samurai who died in battle that it was steel and not wood like the many conventional japanese gates seemed to mean something to him he touched it several times and looked at it as though it communicated a certain meaning then he walked the broad concrete promenade all the way to the white and timbered shrine yards from the gate he examined the screen of serene trees that cut this place off from the craziness of tokyo he went to the shrine looked in possibly meditatedwho could tell with gaijin but finally he returned to his cab and the driver fought through traffic to a jr station nii simply abandoned his car on a wayside streetit would be towed of course but was easily retrievablebought a ticket from the machine on the jr narita express took up a position down the aisle and watched the american go all the way to terminal forty miles outside tokyo the gaijin was in the jal line with his two light bags casually dressed in jeans and a tan jacket over a polo shirt his body betrayed no impatience he waited his turn in line presented his documents turned over his luggage nii watched from afar as the american went through security and watched a little drama transpire as the american was pulled out of line examined closely by inspectors had a sensing wand waved over his body time after time had his papers examined by three different levels of bureaucrat and finally was waved clear that was the last he saw of him a tall stranger with a bland blank face not one of those mobile yappy monster faces the hairy beasts were so known for the mans eyes were strangely powerfulthat meant bad luck for enemies the suspicion wentas if the man held a fund of secret knowledge but for now nii of shinsengumi was done the perfect samurai he took out his cell and called headquarters to report in they told him to get back fast tonight was the night now it was over he had his boarding pass his bags were checked hed board the plane in an hour happy he had an aisle seat he was headed to the departure gate the flight would last fifteen hours but hed be fine through dinner then hed take a pill and when he awoke theyd be landing in lax then it was an hour or so and off to boise he felt good hed gotten some satisfaction at last he felt the old man would be pleased hed repaid the debt the obligation as best he could hey old man im still trying to do what youd want me to do sorry you aint here to see it too bad he wasnt a drinking man anymore he had an ache in his gut for it he felt so good he wanted to commemorate duty and closure and pay homage the more he thought about it the better an idea the drink seemed just this once no sirree so sorry charlie nada you take one of those and you float away on the tide and god only knows where you come down it had happened before he had spent most of the seventies drunk going through jobs pain a wife a couple of houses the patience of his friends the respect of his peers almost pulling the trigger on his sorry self a dozen times then somehow he beat it by giving everything up he couldnt take the world he couldnt take the memories he had to leave both so he lived like a monk among rifles a dog hills and trees an exile speaking to no one reading shooting walking caring for the dog making do on a tiny retirement trying somehow to recover what he had lost he could have lived that way forever but things began to happen it was a busy time for a while as he was forced to recover skills he thought long gone they werent gone he still had a little something that could get him through and the terrible thing was that was really his best self the swaggers were men of war they were warriors nothing else could add and read and make polite for a time but that wasnt them that sure wasnt earl with his dutycraziness whether he was walking in through the high tide and bluewhite jap tracers off tarawa or stalking the cornfields of arkansas for armed robbers and that wasnt bob three tours in nam americas secondor thirdor fourthleading sniper depending on who was telling the truth so why would you want to drink you do not want to drink it is unnecessary i have a beautiful wife i have a beautiful kid im building a house where i can look across the meadows of the valley to a purple range of mountains and whoever thought id have that what old snipers get that you hunt men and watch them flop and go quiet through the scope close on a hundred times maybe you get so far out you dont ever come back i am back he thought i dont need no help but then he thought goddammit i did something for my father today that pleased him immensely he remembered the old man from so long ago the father who didnt hit him all the other kids damn theyd say lord almighty my father tanned my hide yesterday but good wooiee hurt so bad i aint never missing on sloppin them hogs again but earl swagger never hit him not once years later he asked his mother on a rare sober day why cause his daddy whipped both his boys so hard he left scars your daddy thought that was the cowards way man beating on boys and he stuck to that rule thats the kind of man your daddy was and lord i miss him so bob missed him too he remembered the old man in the blackandwhite state police cruiser in june of pulling out of the farm he didnt look back but he caught his son in the rearview mirror and raised a hand and bob waved back bye daddy bye the old man was dead two hours later bob was nine so he thought i have done something my father would have liked if hes up there hes smiling i paid off an earl swagger obligation the last one in the world and i have served the old man if anything calls for a drink that does and so he wandered out of security and went up into naritas flashy mall of restaurants and souvenir shops and dutyfree jewelry places and found a little bar almost frenchlooking not japanese at all all brown wood and brown bottles the whole place with the comforting feel that only a bar can give a thirsty man he slid to a stool and caught the eye of the young man behind it in a white coat and said could i have a sake please the kid smiled he looked like so many young men bob once knew even if this one was japanese sure the youngster said speaking his english well almost without accent you want it heated how do yall drink it i saw a fellow who drank it out of a little ceramic pan like a tiny flat little glass thing oh we drink it that way but we also drink it in a square wooden box called a masu want to try that we even heat it yep i can fire it up in the microwave if you want sir thatd make you a japanese through and through son i dont think your beautiful country is ready for the likes of me nah ill have it like my friend philip yano straight but in one of those little flat deals coming up the boy pulled a large bottle off the shelf unlimbered a kind of flattened dish about half an inch high and poured just a small jolt of the clear fluid into it bob held the odd cup up sniffed it it had a medicinal quality he thought of all the time hed spent in hospitals too much time and fluids that had come out or gone into him or that burned when some orderly put them on his ruptured flesh semper fi said bob catch me if i fall now what do you think hmmm i see how you could grow to like it its all right it had a biting odor to it then in the throat a kind of subtle sweetness not overpowering with a hint of fruit but it left an afterburn as it went down suggesting the presence of fire under the sweetness another hell why not ive still got an hour before my plane and im not going to do anything on the plane but sleep the pacific away he semperfied the second one down then had one for the road one more for the corps one for the dead of vietnam one for the dead of the pacific one for the living one for the thoughttheywerelivingbutweredead and one for the hell of it somewhere in there he wondered whose feet were on the ends of his legs and meantime the boy responded to him as boys did to men who clearly knew their way about the world as many young marines had and bought him another he then had to buy the boy one it made perfect sense then of course he had to go to the bathroom and he got directions found the room and went in to discover what he already knew the japanese bathrooms were like science fiction and somehow on their own they stayed perfectly clean he negotiated that transaction then checked his watch realizing it must be time to board he headed to the departure gate then he made a disturbing discovery theyd come and changed the airport while hed been sitting at the bar it was now a different airport and the more he tried to find his gate the stranger it got he noticed hed tired considerably probably from carrying someone elses feet around and decided to take a rest he awoke as a janitor shook him but quickly went back to sleep and awoke a second time to find a policeman shaking him looking stern lord what a headache it felt as if someone had put his head in a vise and a couple of sumo wrestlers had put their full weight against the tightener then he thought hell i am not on an airplane he looked at his watch it was am tokyo time the plane was long gone he sat there for a second aware that his life had just gotten extremely complicated oh you stupid fool you moron you cannot ever touch even the first drop or this is what happens he looked up and down the airport saw that somehow hed taken a wrong turn out of the bathroom and compounded that error with other errors and ended up in a wrong corridor he tried to map out what he had to do return to the main terminal get in line turn in his unused boarding pass and ticket get himself rebooked on the next available laxbound flighthow much would that costcall julie and let her know then get something to eat and hunker down hed have to catch up with his luggage at lax and the anger he now felt was because of the possible loss of the calligraphy philip yano had given him steel cuts flesh steel cuts bone steel doesnt cut steel you idiot next thought his mind was moving so slowly maybe there was a way to rebook without leaving the departure terminal which would spare him the nonsense with security so finally he got up and decided on a first course of action coffee then food then hed be ready to face the ordeal his own stupidity had created so he walked the terminal and in ten minutes or so indeed found a jal office and counter unfortunately it wasnt open yet it opened at eight still an hour and a half off down the way he found the flashy international departure mall and soon enough a starbucks and managed to talk the young men behind the counter into firing up a coffee for him though they werent technically open the new usa today international was out so he read it then an international herald tribune and an asian edition of newsweek eight oclock rolled around he went back to the jal counter was first in line turned in the boarding pass and ticket gave a somewhat vague description of his adventure with the sake and the bathroom and without difficulty was rebooked on a pm flight to lax he even got another aisle seat there was no problem with his luggage it would be held at us customs at lax she even smiled at him then he found an international phone called his wife who was out thankfully he left a message and decided it was best to tell the truth shed be unpleasant for a week but in the end it was better than a pointless fib now by nine he was done and caught up and only had to wait another few hours i wont be sad to leave this damn airport he sat down took his load off and decided on another course of action he found that starbucks waited in a long line got another cup the place was crowded so he wandered into the terminal and found a seat that was whenit was amhe noted an image on one of the television monitors it took a while to organize in his slowmoving mind it ran from something vaguely familiar to something sharper until finally it became knowable it was philip yano then came a family portrait of the yanos one that hed seen in their home philip suzanne the grave doctortobe tomoe the sons raymond and john and finally the little sweetie miko then the house in which hed spent such pleasant hoursin flames bob simply sat there trying to make sense of it trying to get it organized in a way he could deal with he turned to the person next to him a japanese man in a suit sorry sir the tv what does it say he blundered not even remembering to ask the man if he spoke english but he did its very sad the man said he was a hero a fire he his family wiped out kondo isami he was in his shop his family slept above him but late in the night philip yano was alone with his fathers blade before him it lay with its broad curvature its obscured hamon where hard cutting metal met soft supporting metal its mesh of scratches burrs blurs spots of rusts chips and ware on the bench before him the light gleamed dully on its surface showing its imperfections with stains of toxins running riot radiating stench and miasma what secrets do you hold he wondered should i invest six months and yen per inch to have you polished and suppose that revealsnothing suppose youre a tired old hag of a blade polished so many times that now youre brittle and will shatter at the merest breath you yearn for oblivion and another polishthe tenth the fiftieth the five hundredthwould just take away more of you make you weaker and yet more nondescript i would waste my money my time and my spirit on you he tried to accept what lay before him an unremarkable ancestral blade created sometime in a forgotten past by a smith of no particular talent you were all right you served a war here an execution there maybe a duel an ambush a plot maybe politics and ambition and strategic planning an edo or kyoto ceremony or two and finally hundreds of years after your birth in fire and clay you were clapped in military furniture and went off to war and ended up briefly in the possession of a forgotten officer named hideki yano who died on sulfur island in service towell to what his forgotten ancestors of what significance could that be almost none its the story of a million other blades and a million other men you have your fathers blade its enough and yetand yet its so old its koto at least made sometime in the s its unusually even mythologically sharp even now centuries later when swaggersan and i throw paper against it it cuts deep fast and straight he thought of a story a disciple of japans greatest swordsmith masamune believes he has finally made a better blade than his teacher being vain and ambitious he demands a competition the old man resists but ultimately relents the young mans blade is placed in a stream things drift down it cutseverything twigs and leaves and fish it cuts garbage and paper and bubbles everything that floats it sunders then the old mans blade is placed in the water it cutsnothing whatever floats to it is magically diverted after a time the young man exults i have won my blade is better my blade cuts everything his nothing old masamune pulls his blade from the water with a smile admit it master says the young man mine is better it cuts everything old masamune walks away satisfied the young man sees a priest who has watched the action priest tell him how much better my blade is make him see no says the priest his blade knew the way it saw nothing that had to be cut it brought no harm into the world it has come to help the world it is a blade of justice your blade on the other hand cut everything without discrimination it is an evil blade it has no morality it should be destroyed yano looked at the dull thing he had a premonition like a chill as if an oni a demon had passed through him it is an evil thing he thought the young swordsmiths name was muramasa and his blades acquired a reputation there was something evil about them they yearned for blood whoever wielded them became a great killer but died by the blade as well the blades had a particular hunger for the shogunates blood over the centuries muramasa blades accounted for several deaths in the tokugawa family and were finally banned those that could be found were gathered up and destroyed only a few remained could this be a muramasa blade he had never seen a blade cut so straight so clean so quick the american didnt understand it the child tomoe didnt understand it but he did it cut like a legend it cut everything it wasnt masamunes blade it was the young mans he looked now at the tang the kanji lettering each unit a visual poem in itself climbed the shaft of the metal blurred by age subtlety lost in rust its history written in the holesthree of themthat were drilled each time the blade acquired a new ownerwarrior until finally some dreary mechanic in the naval edge company in tokyo in or so clamped it in a set of fixtures lowered the grinder and punched a final hole through it before burying its secrets in the cheap metallic furniture of the shinguntoissue trappings if it had ever been sublime it was now banal he examined the inscripted lettering and for hours looked in the volumes he had on hand there was zusetsu toso kinko meishuroku of the limited edition of there was sasano masas tosogu no kanshu kajimas tsuba no bi and ikeda suematsus kano natsuo meihin shu not that this smith was a gendaito like natsuo but possibly natsuo had gotten an idea from him and yano might have recognized it in the steel kanzan shinto was also there for the same reason as nagayamas the connoisseurs book of japanese swords at the university he would have access to koson oshigata umetada meikan and the first half of shinto meijiro and possibly there was something there however almost entirely lacking would be references to the runofthemill koto smiths whose swords form the bulk of most collections and possibly the answer lay there there was one possibility a book called koto bengi which included a lot of lesser smiths with surprisingly accurate reproductions and details of chisel strokes that enabled checking for forgeries the years from until were represented rubbings that had been taken from almostnew unrusted tangs yielded clear reproductions but who had it that would take some digging it had never been reproduced but if any book held the key it would be that one then a thought occurred to him he went to his computer terminal swiftly logged on he checked email and saw nothing not that there was ever anything and he went to google in english he typed in koto bengi and the system searched the computer universe and churned out ten possibilities hmmm one was an online encyclopedia another few conventional swordforsale sites where blades were traded to wealthy americans at only a percent markup a few others were indexes or rings that connected to still other sword sites and a few led to shops offering books or sword memorabilia or small sword accessories like meuki the metal inlays for the grip or seppa spacers or kozuka the small subsword blades that were sometimes inserted into the saya an hour into his search he came upon a small store in tulsa oklahoma calling itself the samurai shop he looked briefly at the overpriced but clearly genuine swords many were papered meaning theyd been examined and certified by the japan sword association then finally clicked on books and called up a list of volumes halfway down the list he found it koto bengi edition very rare good condition spine weak spots on cover for certainly there was a koto bengi in japan that could be examined a library would have one in its collection or a shrine samurai had become international and you were just as likely to find rare artifacts in the american midwest or the scottish highlands or the italian peninsula as anywhere in japan the collectors were like swarming insects they came they bought crazily they resold and many of them learned that was the oddest thing many of the most knowledgeable men in the world on blades were not japanese at all here a sword scholar in japan in had examined blades of the late s through the year had meticulously redrawn or taken rubbings of nakago for a volume that survived a tumultuous years of war strife revolution and extreme violence and had ended up in a store in tulsa oklahoma where a clever merchandiser displayed it on something called the internet now it flashed back across time and centuries to a retired soldier in the suburbs of tokyo the website for the samurai shop displayed the cover of the treasured old volume and its title page and there were further icons for random pages and a lengthy description all right he thought ill play your little game mr oklahoma samurai he clicked on random pages and one by one a set of pages flashed before his eyes and then he stopped he realized as he looked at the tang of a longlost blade that it was his sword that was the yano blade yes that was it it had to be the tang on the computer screen was longer of course because the barbarians of the naval edge company preparing for the spheres mad war had not yet sheared off half the kanji lettering but yano looked closely at the very end of his tang and there indeed he saw the nub of three letters that had been rudely cut by the band saw or the file they matched perfectly the computer screen showed the complete and undistorted tang of the very blade he held before him in his rubber gloves he had its pedigree its smith the lord or house for whom it had been prepared the results of its cutting test the he saw with a quick pang of disappointment that it was not a muramasa blade no how could it be thats a oneinamillion shot like a lottery ticket paying off big he wasnt familiar with the smiths name which he read in its two kanji one for nori and the second for naga thereby a yeoman called norinaga possibly of the yamato school the blade looked yamato but norinagasan youre one of thousands this happens to be your sharpest blade you should be proud but then he noticed another thing a small indentation on the hilt almost too small to see against the dapples of the black rust and the rise and fall of the rough unpolished old steel he got out a jewelers loupe and studied the mark carefully turning it in the light it was a symbol not a kanji what is called a family crest in japanese a mon taking up a pencil and a sheet of paper he drew what he saw and when he looked at it it astounded him it looked like a naval propeller threebladed mounted on a hanging medal of some sort it puzzled him the contemporariness of it it was some device an imperial navy torpedoman would have worn it seemed to have nothing to do with the seventeenth century he went from there to his mon the japanese family crest assembled by one of the western pioneers in asian arts a strange california man named willis m hawley who dedicated his life to all things samurai hawley was one of the few westerners admired by the polishers and sword makers of the s and s and his specialty was the encyclopedic he alone in the west would have the patience to collect and classify thousands of japanese mon yano sighed it would take him hours to track through the pages and pages of symbols he looked at his watch it was so late he should be in bed and then he thought well start just start then tomorrow do some more but it turned out the book was organized not alphabetically but by pattern he slid through the pages looking at the eighteen or so renditions of patterns in stark blackandwhite seeing such images as the everpopular chrysanthemum the persimmon the melon the arrowroot the chinese bellflowerbut of course no torpedo propeller but there was a maple a chestnut the hawk feathers the roll of silk the rabbit the bat the dragonfly the arrow notch thenthe torpedo propeller no no it was the military fan it was a fan he quickly turned to page fiftynine found eighteen variations on the fan none of which matched went back a little and found dozens of other fan shapesthe cypress fan the feather fan the folding fan the hemp fan he applied his tired eyes to each threebladed symbol until there it was he compared the three images over and over again the slightly fuzzy image in the loupe brought out by the correct angle into the light built of tiny chisel marks four hundredodd years old his own much larger but necessarily cruder rendition of it in pencil on the white sheet and hawleys bold blackandwhite variation barely an inch by an inch but nevertheless bone clear three blades mounted atop some kind of v device that he now saw represented the fan who knew what the three propeller blades meant it didnt really matter now that he had found it he tracked over to the kanji name of the family then the romanized version it was the house of asano in ako he sat back astonished his heart began to pound it was from the house of the most famous samurai in history yet elation was not what he felt a ghost returned if the blade could be rooted in the asano house and its bloody history and if the name norinaga could be likewise linked to asano then suddenly the blade was of inestimable worth but to yano what mattered was the glory this would be the rare cultural treasure worthy of careful restoration and display in the great museums of japan its provenance associated it with a plot a raid a fight a death then the mass seppuku belly splitting that perfectly summed up the samurai ethos and represented at its purest and highest what the samurai meant to japan and to the world he thought how could but it was more than possible his mind ran through possibilities the blade is stolen or lost somehow after it is confiscated from whichever of the ronin carried it on that bloodiest of all samurai nights and no one for a hundred years realizes its meaning as the story is devoured by other stories just as violent just as bloody but then in comes the puppet play kanadehon chushingura treasury of loyal retainers which popularizes the story and becomes the basis for many kabuki plays but it is the woodblock artists who make the story immortal among them utamaro toyokuni hokusai kunisada and hiroshige however the most famous are those by kuniyoshi who produces eleven separate series on the subject as well as twenty triptychs by that time the sword is lost it floats from family to family from sword shop to sword shop and somehow is turned in to the government in a spasm of great patriotic fever along with a hundred thousand other blades and it is hacked and shortened and ground and machinepolishedbuffed buffedand sent off to war where it has its further adventures ending up finally in his fathers hands and then in an americans hands and now its back yano felt fear it wasnt a fortune he had discovered but an immense responsibility the sword wasnt just worth millions but was an artifact of the nation that made it worth killing for it was leverage it was status it was fame it was if anyone knew that was the key question did anyone know who would know then he heard the glass break he waited breathless his heart began to pound again he heard a cry hai it was a war cry he reached for the only intact weapon close at hand a shinshinto katana from nii listened young men of shinsengumi this is your blooding is this for you have you the steel the strength the determination or are you one of them one of the dissolute kondosan spoke quickly and fiercely do you hang out in the malls and paint your hair blue and your nails black do you dance to barbarian rapture and pierce yourself with gewgaws do you have sexual congress like a rabbit without meaning rutting in alleyways and gymnasiums do you fill your system with drugs and live your life in a blur of pleasure or are you hard and resolute men of bushido men of courage and commitment are you samurai we are samurai came the cry the four of them were in the back of a truck it was am in the quiet suburbs of tokyo they were parked in front of the yano house they wore black hakama kendo trousers and jackets and black tabi over black tabi socks which isolated the big toe so they could wear the zori sandals each carried sharp chinesemade wakizashi and katana the two swords and each carried a silenced glock mm then my children of the spirit you must go said kondo and the four felt the excitement rise and crest noguma was first muyamato second he nii third and natume fourth they leapt from the truck and advanced in low stealthy strides to the house the door was locked noguma kicked it in and as he kicked it performed nukitsuke the drawing cut except there was no one to cut meanwhile the others unlimbered their swords possibly without the grace and beauty of noguma who had practiced this move a hundred thousand times it was truly unfortunate that nobody was there to absorb his elegant energy he ran into the house shouting hai and looked for something to cut there was nothing but downstairs he spied light hai he shouted again and raced down the steps to the corridor followed by nii while the other two went upstairs as noguma ran along the corridor he saw a man step out of a door with a sword and he raced toward him full of lust for blood full of energy and executed a perfect kirioroshi that is downward cut fully expecting to sunder the man from tip of crown to navel alas the man adroitly sidestepped and slipped with oily speed into ukenagashi or flowing block which enabled him to slide off into a horizontal attack and lay his blades edge at full force into nogumas guts through the navel the side almost to spine cutting through to the core slicing entrails and organs and everything else in the way then withdrawing on the same plane so as not to ensnare the blade and poor noguma fell spurting for the body is really nothing more than a thin bag of blood and when it is ruptured it empties rather quickly brave and determined nii meant to unleash kirioroshi on his target and raised his own sword but the man was too fast and drove forward with the hilt of his alreadyraised weapon and hit nii under the eye with a thunderous blow pounding illumination and incoherence into his skull and he slipped in pain then lost all traction in the lakes of nogumas spewing blood and went with a crack to the floor yano cut down the first man in an elementary college kendo move he hadnt realized he still knew and the blade bit deep but with stupefying ease and he didnt even have time to mark it as his first kill for now the only thing in his mind was his family he continued through on the same line minimizing motion and drove the hilt of his grip hard into the face of the squat second man sending a vibration through his weapon he drove a huge gash into the musclemans face and watched him spill out of the way as well with a possible skull fracture a third was before him and he coiled around into the powerstance position elbows back and cocked and deployed kirioroshi but this fellow was far trickier parried the blow and slipped off and by yano the father turned as the man flashed out of the way yano lifted again then realized hed been cut bad his legs went his knees went he slid down down down until he lay flat on the floor staring up above him he saw his antagonist perform chiburi the ritual flicking of the blood off his blade then noto the ceremonial resheathing in saya a smooth ballet of practiced moves then lean forward he had a square fierce face eyes bright with exultation a mouth so short and flat it expressed nothing at all yet it was familiar who was he why yano asked god why certain necessities said the man who are you yano said i am kondo isami said his victor kondo isami has been dead a hundred years he was a murderer too where is the blade dont hurt my family please i beg you life death its all the same wheres the blade you piece of shit go to hell you are no samurai you are and then he coughed blood die well soldier for you have nothing else left ill find the blade it belongs to me because i was the strongest with that he turned leaving philip yano in a pool of his own blood in the darkness ruins by the time he arrived by taxi it was all over the last of the tv trucks was pulling out there was a crowd but by now it had thinned people stood about listlessly aware that the show was almost over the house smoldered in a few spots raw flames still licked timbers but mostly it had fallen in on itself a black nest of charred spars halfburned boards broken porcelain fittings blackened flagstones the odor of burning hung thick in the air the garden was a riot of smashed plants footprints the treads of tires where the fire engines had pulled up a few shingles lay around a few pieces of broken scorched furniture he ran to the yellow publicsafety tape a few cops stood by not particularly interested in the situation in their navyblue uniforms with the tiny pistols in the black holsters beyond bob could see some sort of conclave of investigators men in suits or light jackets who had gathered at the sidewalk that once led into the yanos vestibule the whole scene felt moist somehow from all the water spent to fight the blaze the ground was soft in places muddy the water pooled into puddles bob pushed through the crowd no longer really interested in the rules of politeness that defined the culture of japan he didnt care about the polite mob of witnesses he ducked under the yellow tape that cut off civilian world from publicsafety world and immediately attracted the attention of first one then a second cop and finally a third i have to see the investigators he said hai no no must wait must come on no whos in charge i have to see the somehow weight was applied to him the japanese uniformed officers were amazingly strong given their height and with three of them gathered and more assembling and the investigators looking his way he felt the urgency of the collective will go back do not make a disturbance you have no place here you are not a citizen do not interrupt these are our ways i have to see the man in charge he yelled no no let me through and he squirmed away and quite logically it seemed to him made to approach the investigators or executives or whatever they were i have to explain see i knew these people i had business with them you will want my testimony it seemed so logical to him all he had to do was make it clear does anybody here speak english please but for all his good intentions he seemed to excite nothing but animosity on the part of the japanese who appeared not at all interested in his contributions you dont understand i have information he explained to two or three of the men who were forcing him back i need to tell people something please dont push me i have to talk to the man in charge dont touch me dont shove me please no i dont want any trouble but dont touch me the japanese barking at him seemed to be spewing gibberish and their faces gathered into ugly monkeylike caricatures and he experienced the overwhelming melancholy that they really didnt care and it infuriated him and just at this moment someone pushing on him slipped a hand broke free and accidentally smashed hard into his chest and the next thing he knew he shoved back he swam to consciousness he was in some kind of ward his head felt like a linebacker had crushed it against a curb and he was sore everywhere he tried to sit up but handcuffs on one wrist had him pinioned to the bed frame the room was pure white brightly illuminated how had he been unconscious in such a place a slim japanese woman in glasses and a business suit stared at him she looked about thirty which meant she was probably closer to forty and sat across the room in a shabby plain chair she was reading time magazine she had beautiful legs he put his free hand on his forehead felt its heat then ran it down to his chin which was sheathed in whiskers two or three days worth yet he was clean the japanese had beat him unconscious then in their thorough way cleaned him sedated him stitched him and committed him oh hell where am i he said to no one blinking at the brightness of the light feeling deep pain behind his eyes he tried not to think of the loss but the more he denied it the more it hurt an image of the perfect family came before his eyes the little yano unit each committed totally to the other the love that was duty that held them together it was all terrible but the worst was miko the child who could kill a child he thought and he felt killing anger rise and knew it would kill him before it would kill anyone else the grief was like a weight on his chest trying to squash all the oxygen from his lungs he thought he might have a heart attack is there a nurse he said the woman looked at him sorry do you speak english i was born in kansas city she said im as american as you my dad is an oncologist and a republican and a twohandicap oh sorry look please get me a nurse or something i need another shot i cant itsits just i dont know just relax mr swagger youve been heavily medicated for three days now i dont think you need more medication let me call a doctor she punched a button on a sciencefiction control panel next to his bed and indeed in a few seconds a staff doctor in a white coat with grave asian seriousness came in pulse taken eyes checked head wound examined bob passed muster i think youll be okay the doctor said to him in english youre a pretty tough old bird you have enough scars really doctor im fine its myi need a sedative or something im feeling very bad i just cant lie here can you get someone to release me the cops dont want you free said the young woman the japanese have very strict rules about certain things and you broke all of them and even invented some new ones i was a little out of my head come on doctor please sorry mr swagger youre going to have to come to terms with it sooner or later what you need is relaxation peace and quiet a good therapist and your own country your family people you love and who love you id settle for an aspirin some kind of sleeping pill would be better the doctor spoke in japanese then said ill give you aspirin for the pain a nurse brought a tray with three white pills and a glass of water bob gulped them all suddenly he was alone with the woman youre from kansas city yeah im with the american embassy here in tokyo my name is susan okada im head of the bob lee swagger department we specialize in deranged war heroes hows business it was crappy for the longest time now its finally heated up where am i the tokyo prison hospital jesus christ yeah it sounds so nineteenth century youve been here for three days your wife has been notified shes not coming is she no we didnt see the need i just dontah christ i dont know what to say well we need a statement from you then well get you to narita and off you go the japanese wont press charges i didnt do anything thats not how they see it they have you for assault disrespect for a police officer public drunkenness disturbing the peace and worst of all for not being japanese theyll put you away and forget about it theyre not that interested in your version of things oh christ my head hurts god i feel so awful have a drink of water i could come back tomorrow but i think youd be better off to get this over with the sooner you do the sooner we get you out of here all right she opened her briefcase got out a digitized tape recorder and moved close all right the whole story your involvement with the yanos start to finish how you ended up punching cops at the scene of a fire at the scene of a murder okay he told it not enthusiastically or well but doggedly the whole thing the visit the sword his drunkenness at the airport his discovery the next morning his arrival at the site his recollections of the troubles there i dont recall hitting anybody if i did he hit me first she put the tape recorder away that doesnt matter she said anyway ill have this typed up tomorrow you sign it ill have you on the one pm jal to lax and booked through to boise all right no not all right work with me on this okay mr swagger you have to tell me what is going on what is happening the tokyo police and the arson squad are investigating we dont know much we dont have good sources with the cops and its not what is diplomatically classified official american interest so theyre under no obligation to answer our queries ms okada six people a family of decent normal distinguished happy people were wiped out were murdered theres such a thing as justice the japanese havent confirmed anything about murders the official line has to do with an unfortunate fire a tragedy a terrible terrible philip yano was an extremely capable professional soldier he was a paratrooper for gods sake the elite hed been under fire hed commanded men under fire he was one of the best in his country he was trained to handle emergency situations if his house caught fire he would have gotten his family out if he didnt something is very very wrong that coupled with my presentation of a sword that he believed might have been of some value adds up to a very complex situation requiring the best of law enforcement efforts and mr swagger i am aware you are a man of some experience in the world and that you have been around the block more than once but i have to say that in japan we are not going to instruct japanese official entities how to do their job and what conclusions to reach they will do what they will do and that is it i cannot leave six people dead in well there is one thing you dont know there is some very good news the child miko yano she is still alive mr swagger she was at a neighbor childs that night praise be to buddha or jesus h christ for small miracles but miko made it through the night narita terminal again the embassy van driven by a uniformed marine lance corporal scooted through the traffic carefully found the lane to international departures turned into a gate where a magnetized card reader permitted swift vip access a police car with two grumpy japanese detectives followed but did not interfere they really want you gone said susan okada sitting in the back with bob who was now rested shaved and showered and dressed in clean clothes thats fine said bob im going the van pulled up and bob and his new pal susan got out took an escalator up and went through the vast gray room where the ticketing desks were all the paperwork had been taken care of he was waved through security so there was no comic scene about the steel hip and soon enough he was in the departure lounge at the gate through the window he could see the vast blunt nose of the the plane would board in a few minutes you dont have to sit here with me he said you must have better things to do i have lots better things to do but for now this is my job okay im on the drunken idiot patrol i have to make sure a certain guy doesnt tie one on and end up in the hoosegow again you get that i get that no drinks ever i get that i only fell off the wagon once in years and years i am a good boy i thought i had the drinking beat how do you feel all right all kinds of people wanted to be here the commanding general usmc western pacific wanted to be here evidently you know him she gave a name he was a battalion executive officer my first tour in vietnam sixtysix good officer im happy he did so well well he wanted to make sure you were well treated by everyone that this went smoothly i saw your records i see why they think so highly of you all that was a long time ago we have a minute let me speak with you frankly please do ms okada i am so frightened you will try to make something of this tragedy yeats said men of action when they lose all belief believe only in action do you see what he was getting at i sound like a countrywestern hick maam and now and then i break a sentence like an egg but it may surprise you that i am familiar with that quote and ive read them other guys too sassoon owens graves manning a whole mess of writers who thought they had something to say about war and warriors i know who i am and where i fit in i am the sort of man people like to have around when theres shooting but otherwise i make them very nervous i am like a gun in the house well i dont know about that but you know where im going you cant let this become some kind of crusade you cant come back you dont know the rules here the rules are very very strange and you could get yourself into a lot of trouble and make a lot of trouble for a lot of other people you must make peace with what happened its a domestic matter the japanese will handle it there have been allegations of criminal behavior but no findings yet you have to play by their rules do you see what i am saying the japanese have kicked you out and never want to see you again if you come back there wont be a second chance you could do hard time i hear you it may seem unjust to you or unbearably slow or corrupt even but that is the way they do things and when you try to change their system they get very very angry they are their system do you see and you can live here for years and not understand it i dont fully understand it will you keep me informed no she said looking him in the eye its not a good idea put it behind you live your life enjoy your retirement you dont need to know a thing about it well you tell the truth im not a bullshitter i will not keep an eye out on things i want you to let it go let it go what about the girl she will be taken care of i have to she will be taken care of thats all you need to know the flight was called okay he said its against my nature but i will try but since you dont bullshit i wont bullshit i feel obligated here what do you mean you couldnt have known its a war thing im a war guy hes a war guy his dad my dad war guys us war guys were all connected so i picked up an obligation its something ancient and forgotten and not in existence no more lost and gone a joke something from those silly swordfight movies something samurai she looked at him hard swagger what men in armor believed five hundred years ago is of no help or meaning anywhere in an american life forget samurai theyre movie heroes like james bond a fantasy of what never was dont go samurai the way of the warrior is death toshiro what was samurai it wasnt bushido the way of the sword he read books on that and found nothing that really helped it wasnt any of the other thingscalligraphy computers automobiles screen paintings woodcuts karate kabuki sushi tempura and so forth at which the japanese had such eerie talents and it didnt just mean warrior or soldier or fighter there was some additional layer of meaning in it something to do with faith and will and destiny no western word equivalent seemed to quite get it or express it part of it was that kind of man fascinating in himself samurai he wore a kimono he wore wooden clogs he had a ponytail he carried a batch of blades he would fight or die on a bet or a dime or a joke he was lithe and quick and dangerous he was pure battle he was usmc nco material to the max hard practical dedicated if not exactly fearless then at least in control of his fear and able to make it work for him if samurai was to be understood it would be understood through him bob watched movies over and over he had a hundred of them not just the ones the smart boys said were great like the seven samurai and yojimbo and throne of blood and ran but movies nobody ever heard of in the west like sword devil and the sword that saved edo and hanzo the razor and the ronin and samurai assassin and harakiri and goyokin and tale of a female yakuza and lady snowblood and ganjiro island he watched them on a dvd player in an apartment in oakland california with bare wood floors a thin mattress for a bed and nothing else each morning he rose at five ate a breakfast of tea and fish then went for a sixmile run he came back watched a movie then he read for an hour on swords on history on culture books he understood books that seemed bullshit books even on calligraphy then he ate lunch in one of a dozen japanese restaurants nearby because he wanted to be used to them to their smell their language their movements their faces then he returned home at two rested watched another movie then he went out to dinner sushi usually sometimes noodles occasionally kobe beef after nightfall another two hours of reading then another movie there had to be answers in there somewhere bob had never seen such grace their bodies were liquid so malleable so changeable so flexible in subtle athletic ways that defied belief they could run and dodge and dip pivot feint stop change direction fast all in wooden clogs they carried the swords edge up in scabbards that werent even secured to the belt in fact indoors they took the long sword off and carried it around like an umbrella yet he noticed no matter the movie when they sat on the hard floor they put the sword in the same place to the left of the knee blade outward hilt just at the knee grip angled at degrees before them they never deviated that was the thing the core of it no deviation and they were fast hed never seen such speed it was like they were oiled and when they moved they passed through air and time at a rate other mortals could barely comprehend it began with some kind of draw an uncoiling with blade so that the sword came out and began to cut in an economy of movement sometimes you couldnt even see the cut it was so fluid sometimes it was a thrust but more usually it was a cut conceived from a dozen different angles the cut hidden in a turn or a pivot dancelike but never effeminate always athletic and always the conventions the samurai usually fought against three or four at a time and often when he would cut the cut man feeling himself mortally wounded would simply freeze as if to deny the end of life and stretch the final second out over minutes the samurai would resheathe with some kind of graceful mojo the sword disappearing with a pistons certainty into the scabbard then hed turn and strut away leaving behind a collection of statuary then theyd topple one after another was that somehow samurai in one movie a guy fought three hundred men and beat them all it was funny and yet somehow just barely believable was that samurai in another seven men stood against a hundred it was like a green beret ateam in indian country in a war he knew too much about and these guys were as good as special forces they stood they died they never cried was that samurai in another an evil swordsman became possessed of the sword he couldnt stop killing until finally he perished in a blazing brothel as his enemies closed in but not before he cut down fifty of them was that samurai in still another a father avenged himself upon a noble house that had urged his soninlaw to commit suicide with a bamboo sword the father was swift and sure and without fear he welcomed death and greeted it like an old friend was that samurai in still another a brother mired in guilt returned home to face his sisters husband who had advised him in aiding the clan and ultimately massacring a peasant village the hero paid out in justice finally was that samurai in another a man said sire i beg you execute us at once was that samurai in still another a man said i am so lucky it was you that killed me and died with a smile on his face was that samurai in most of them the brave young men were drawn to death they would die for anything at the drop of a hat how the japanese loved death they feared shame they loved death they yearned to die they dreamed of dying possibly they masturbated to the idea of their own death what a race of men they were so different so opaque so unknowableyet so human samurai sometimes the westerner in him got it at the end of the seven samurai the three survivors head out of town the battle over they turn and look back to a hill and on the hill are four swords points down thrust in the ground next to four rough burial mounds a wind whistles and blows the dust across the hill he got that one hed seen enough ms bayonetdown in the dirt as the squad moved on and the weight of melancholy of young men lost forever of heroes unremembered of comrades who died for the whole was an ache that never went away but some of the stuff was so strange in one the hero a dour samurai who wanders the landscape with his kid in a baby carriage kills a guy and the dying man says happily at last i got to see the soruya horseslaying technique he had really wanted to see the heros swordfighting skill it was worth his life to see it and he felt privileged even as he bled out one day there was a knock on the door he answered it and discovered a beautiful young woman serene poised possibly a little annoyed it was his daughter hi sweetie what are you doing here the question is what are you doing here nikki said i guess mommy gave you the address how is she shes fine she contends thats her talent right nikki walked in as if she owned the place she was wearing jeans and a ponytail and cowboy boots she was twentythree and in graduate school in new york to be a writer you were going to come visit remember yeah well you know pop sometimes the old goat forgets you never forgot a thing in your life daddy what on earth i mean really this japanese thing what on earth she looked around the kanji composition that he had received from philip yano hung on one wall and on the other was a brush painting of a bird called a shrike sitting on a twisted piece of limb there were piles of books a huge tv and dvd player and a hundredodd dvds most with kanji lettering and pictures of lurid men in ponytails on them do you want a coke or anything how about some sake wouldnt that be the beverage of choice im not drinking again well then youve apparently managed to go insane without the booze opinions vary on that issue she sat down next to the wall he sat down across from her whats with the bird it was painted in the year sixteen forty by a man named miyamoto musashi and who was he a samurai the greatest many say he fought sixty times and won them all i like to look at it and think about it i like to try to understand the flow of the strokes he also wrote the kanji over there do you see it what does it mean it means steel cuts flesh steel cuts bone steel does not cut steel it was given to me by mr yano the night he and his family died god do you understand how nuts you sound do you understand how upset mommy is theres plenty of money for her she shouldnt have any problems she has one huge problem a husband whos gone crazy im not crazy tell me tell me as if it makes any sense at all what is going on here sure okay youll see its not so nuts its all about swords swords japanese swords the soul of the samurai or so they say it sounds like youve started to believe all those screwball movies you have lying around just listen all right hear me out he narrated as plainly as possible the events of the last few months beginning with the arrival of the letter from the superintendent of the marine historical division and ending essentially the minute before she knocked on the door and so you never returned to idaho you came here instead and took up this life i have principles for a hard job one start now two work every day three finish thats the only way you get it done and any other way is a lie so when i got off that plane i thought start now now so i started what on earth are you planning next well therell come a time when i feel im ready when ive learned enough to go back then somehow ive got to look into things i have to make sure that some kind of justice is done butcorrect me if im wrongyou have no evidence whatsoever there was some foul play in the case of these poor people i mean fires do happen families do die in them it happens every week i understand that however philip yano had an idea that the blade i brought him had some historical significance now reading about this stuff seeing how important swords still are to the japanese how they still dream about the damned things how they study and practice with them it gets damned interesting how much are they worth top end its not money there would be a lot of money yes but to the japanese the sword aint about money dont say aint im trying it keeps creeping in okay the sword isnt about money its more important than money they have some peculiar beliefs that you would find very strange i found them strange too but as i learn about them they begin to make a kind of sense you cant think about this as an american would its a japanese thing it has to do with the meaning and the value of the sword and the prestige a certain sword would have now heres what someone else would say a clinical psychologist for example hed say there was a man who was vigorous heroic and extraordinary but also stubborn obsessive and somewhat selfindulgent even narcissistic he loved the warrior reflection he saw in the mirror he never talked about it but he loved it he loved the silent respect he got everywhere in life and the way his presence could quiet the crowd with a single harsh glance but then he got old like all men suddenly hes facing retirement he secretly doesnt want to sit on that porch and watch the seasons change and count his money he wants a mission he wants something to define his warrior life hes not the sort to go fishing so something comes along and using his considerable cunning and intelligence he insists on seeing reasons patterns clues hints all kinds of things that he fancies only he in all the world not the professional investigators not the fire department arson squad none of them can see and it adds up to conspiracy plots murder exactly the sort of thing that demands forceful action from a forceful man a warrior and he happens to be that forceful man he happens to be that warrior do you see where this is going im sorry you see it that way theres no other way to see it oh daddy youre too old youre slow youre old its over you were a great man you can be a great old man but dont be the man about whom they say no fool like an old fool sweetielets go get some dinner or something okay yes in idaho no here well get sushi ugh raw fish please anything but that i have to tell you this there are obligations here you dont know anything about deep family obligations long story no one would care except me butobligations this goes a long way back and my father in the war and the japanese he fought i wish your father had never won that medal it has haunted you your whole life you dont owe the japanese he killed a thing it wasnt your war honey it was youve seen too many of these silly movies where guys in bathrobes flipflops and ponytails cut each others heads off maybe so but to me it feels like im going home just promise me one thing you wont grow a ponytail after that it was pleasant but nikki felt her fathers need to return to his obsessive course and so after dinnershe got through the sushi somehowshe left leaving him to his selfdecreed mission his days were the same the next development was the arrival of a package with a blue label marked sal from japan wrapped in that perfect japanese way had he ordered something some book some pamphlet hed bought a lot of weird stuff off the internet outofprint books japanese sword exhibition catalogues guides to sword fighting but no it was a thin package of copied documents official in nature no source given they were typed in kanji with utmost precision and included handdrawn diagrams badly xeroxed and difficult to read the whole thing had a spy quality to it it seemed somehow illicit the product of a penetration hed have to have someone read it to him but he knew well enough what his anonymous donor from a tokyo post office had sent him it was the yanos autopsy report kirisute gomen nii handled the negotiations because even among the most trusted most senior of the brotherhood kondo isami would not show his face nii met with boss otani in the latters office suite a corner of a tall building in west shinjuku the fiftyfifth floor the office was luxuriously appointed as befitted a man of boss otanis accomplishment he controlled much of the action in kabukicho more than a hundred clubs he employed in his main group and in several subgroups one hundred of the fiercest yaks in all of tokyo men who would die for him instantly he owned a controlling interest in three gambling syndicates the north and west sides of the tokyo amphetamine franchise and more than a thousand prostitutes he himself had killed many times on the way to his current lofty position it helped of course that at one time his ascent had been blocked by a certain ambitious boss in another organization who could not be reached and who waged a terrifying war on boss otani this mans gang of killers had left boss with the hundredstitch scar that ran from his nipple to his hip it was then that the boss made the acquaintance anonymously of kondo isami of shinsengumi in a week the bosss rival dropped by for a têteàtête boss otani did most of the talking for of the two têtes his was the one still attached to a neck in black suit and somber mien young nii tried not to pay attention to the tokyo skyline which stretched to the horizon outside the fiftyfifthfloor window it was nevertheless truly magnificent the double towers of the tokyo municipal government buildings the fabled hyatt hotel made famous in a movie the cheesy washington hotel which boss otani partially owned man or woman said the boss it doesnt matter oyabun said nii careful to use the term of respect what does matter corpulence he wants a tubby one he likes a certain density of flesh what happened to your head young man niis left eye was still swollen shut it looked like someone had puttied a large grapefruit to the left side of his face and the grapefruit had begun to rot and turn weird tones of purple that were shot with veins of red and smears of greenblue it was unfortunate said nii i forgot to duck i hope whoever had the temerity to strike such an important man paid for it he did most quickly oyabun were you the author of this justice no sir kondosan himself was it was magnificent i have never seen such speed did you learn from kondosan i believe so you are quite lucky to have encountered such a wakagashira a young boss so early in your life study hard kobun acquire knowledge and experience and give yourself over you will prosper or die gloriously thank you sir anyway a fat one a jellybelly you can see why yes of course the older man whose face looked like a kabuki mask shaped to express decadent rage punched an intercom button and another man in an exquisitely tailored black silk suit came in he wore hornrims and had neat hair he bowed deeply before his employer and spiritual leader yes otanisan i require a woman certainly otanisan she neednt be a beauty she neednt be a top producer in fact its probably best if shes not she should of course be a guest worker she should have no family in this country she should have no reputation no charisma so that when her circumstances alter her absence does not cause comment she must live alone she must work a very late shift she must have no bad habits or infections of any kind there are dozens of such candidates alas none of them live alone at the rate they are paid none can afford to live alone plus one of every group sometimes two must report secretly to their bosses i understand so be it said nii he would consider it an acceptable risk yes and if theres fuss the remaining hens can be plucked too at the club marvelous the guest workers are korean ladies they tend to corpulence and keep to themselves when not in the club one of them should suffice what is the timing to be sir nii oh sooner rather than later he wants this cutting test done and then the restoration must begin and that will take some time we must be ready by december did you hear i did said the factotum i will supply name time route home i assume kondosan prefers his pleasure at night things are much easier to arrange at night we own the night he would prefer daylight of course said nii for more exact details are revealed but he understands the impossible cannot be done night is acceptable who disposes said boss otani its certain to be unpleasant perhaps the testers should provide disposal said the factotum nii yes well dispose good then it is settled he addressed nii tomorrow you call the club marvelous and the manager will supply you with the details kondosan thanks his friend and mentor said nii i would do any favor for kondo isami said boss otani the korean woman left much later than her sisters they got off at five and walked en masse to the subway station at shinjuku it wasnt the danger for kabukicho was patrolled by police and yaks both intent on crushing disturbances who kept the crime rate to almost nil however unpleasantness could occur if a single woman met a group of men westerners were the worst especially the canadians and the texans though germans occasionally acted out as well and some nasty iranians might be encountered if the men were drunk and horny and angry and had received the ageold message for japanese men only in many bars it could be awkward for everybody and end with teeth knocked out eyes blackened feelings ruffled but on this night the woman a corpulent enough country girl from outside pusan had been stopped unaccountably by her boss she had been quizzed about another girl who was suspected of sleeping with westerners on her own rare spare time all proceeds must be generously shared with management and a strict nofreelancing rule was enforced but this woman did not room with the suspect so what was the point it made no sense to her and cut into the five hours she had off and she had now missed the am train and another wouldnt depart until am she hurried alone across the splotches of illumination the dark shadows of kabukicho as dawn approached and another night of expensively purchased sin put itself to sleep she headed east down hanazono dori heading toward shinjuku station her cheap woodsoled sandals clattered on the empty street as she rushed the clubs now mostly deserted the barkers gone the sailors headed back to the harbor the airmen to the air bases the tourists to their giant hotels it was the hour of the hare the street which drew its name from a shrine a few blocks behind her was featureless in the low light she didnt like this part of the walk she focused on the brighter lights of a major cross street ahead and then she sawhmmm a blur a move some kind of disturbanceand with it heard a rustle a shift a clunk some weird night noise that had but one characteristic that it didnt belong she turned looked back into the blur of countless vertical signs brightly lit from within blazing into infinity the rain spattered on her glasses she drew her cheap raincoat more tightly against her annoyed that it was useless against the sudden chill it was probably nothing but she felt that someone was waiting for her just ahead you could never be sure and she had so much responsibility she could not afford to be robbed or injured she hurried back along hanazono dori hoping to get to a large avenue that would still be populated like yasukuni dori and where were the cops normally she hated the police cars particularly the sullen young officers who looked at her as if she were a member of the herbivore kingdom but now she wished she saw the red light of official presence nope nothing not far off she saw the jagged skyline of east shinjuku lit with spangles of illumination promising a new world order or something her life was crap and would never be anything but crap she worked for next to no money under tight supervision giving hand jobs and blow jobs and greek the night long she had absorbed enough japanese sperm to float a battleship on a good month she scraped together a few thousand yen to send back to korea where her mother her father and her nine brothers and sisters depended upon her she suspected that it was her father who had secretly sold her to the japanese man but family loyalty was nevertheless something she felt powerfully a confucian conceit that gave everything she did the faintest buzz of virtue it meant that in the next life she would be something higher better easier she turned back to check again it was then that she saw the two men they were in the shadows moving stealthily matching her movements but when her eyes fastened on them they froze almost melting into nothingness like skilled red guerrillas she stared and in seconds lost their outline were they really there was she dreaming this hey she called in her heavily accented grammatically fractured japanese who you what want you go away you no hurt me in the beautiful korean of her consciousness she was far more articulate are you demons come to take me or drunken fattened american fools who want a free greek fuck to brag about on the flight home or young angry yaks annoyed that the boss thinks so little of you and therefore look for someone upon which to express your rage but they were so still they seemed not to be there in a second she had convinced herself that it was her imagination it was punishment for thinking unkind thoughts about her father she turned and headed again down hanaz she heard a sound there were two men behind her but she was not stupid or panicprone she did not scream and run hopelessly into the middle of the street instead she accelerated her pace just enough tried hard to give no sign that she knew she was being stalked she tried to think the streets were dark and it was still half a mile to the bright lights of shinjuku dori they could overtake her at any point she looked for a sudden detour she could head for either the lawsons convenience store or the aya café both of which were open twentyfour hours a day she could maybe find an alleyway the prospect of getting home had become meaningless she cared only to survive the night and if she had to lie in garbage behind some horrid club she would do that a better plan was to find one of the allnight joints where she could nurse a few cigarettes until seven it would then be pointless to return home she could spend a couple of hours in the club then go back on it would be hard but she would get through it she came upon an unlit little promenade ahead not far from a section of fifties bars called the goldengai there was no overhead and she thought if she darted down it the two men following wouldnt see by the time theyd gone beyond it and returned shed be out at the other end on yasukuni dori it was called shinjuku yuhodo koen an anomaly in kabukicho a curved flagstone walk set almost in a glade two hundred yards behind hanazono shrine lined with trees on either side almost unknown to the general public and certain to be deserted at this hour it was dark enough to hide or to not be seen it was ideal she darted into it opened up her gait and prayed that she had dumped her stalkers since the promenade was narrow and the trees close he would use kesagiri a cut that began at the left shoulder and drove downward on the diagonal splitting collarbone the tip of the left ventricle left lung spine lungs right lung liver well delivered it sometimes flew through the curls of the intestine to exit at the right hip just above the pelvis it was a good test for the blade which in casual experimentation had proven astonishingly sharp old norinaga knew his business back there in his darkened hovel in or whatever working in the light of the bright fire as in an anteroom of hell folding and refolding as his crew of young hammerers laid their strength and will into the glowing chunk of steel and iron it was an unusually heavy blade signifying that it had not been polished often which meant it had a certain structural integrity not much of it had been stoned off in the years since its forging no hairline vertical cracks invisible to the eye ran through the hamon no niogiri and no breaks in the nioguchi no ware no bubbles no acid damage it was merely scratched dull by a half century in a scabbard and before that however many years of mundane military duty and before that who knew all that was known was what it had accomplished in he had remounted it hating the esthetics of the junky army furniture of now it wore a simple pure shirasawa a wooden sheathing and a wooden handle that assembled neatly into one curved airtight wooden object almost like a piece of avantgarde sculpture the shirasawa was called a blades pajamas it was a storage mechanism not a fighting or a ceremonial one and it meant no tsuba had been affixed for the tsuba the handguard that kept the fingers off the sharpness of the blade and caught opposing blades as they slid down toward the hands was a fighting accouterment ormany were extraordinary works of art in their own rightan esthetic device but he expected no fight tonight they could see her she diverted down their little lane a stout woman still fifty yards off slightly spooked moving too quickly aware that she was being followed unaware that she was being driven she wore a cheap cloth raincoat a scarf and glasses even from this distance her woodensoled sandals made a distinct click on the pavement now nii he said what did noguma do wrong he was too big in his cut said young nii crouched beside him nii had the plastic garbage bags with him his was the most unpleasant task of the night yes he thought he was in a movie when he stepped forth he was consumed in drama i believe also he stopped to think at that point it is too late to think you must be an emptiness yes oyabun there is no thinking no willing both take time time means death not for your opponent for you do you read western literature i listen to western music not quite the same i think of conrad he said something so brilliant it is almost japanese musashi could have said it or mishima thinking he said is the enemy of perfection i understand said nii who really did not it was still memorization for him you did this then you did that then you did another thing all in sequence and if you did one out of sequence you got yelled at but of course all the time you were thinking your opponent was cutting be empty nii can you be empty yes oyabun the woman felt confident now another ordeal had passed she was down the dark promenade and had stopped twice the two followers had missed her detour she was alone it was all right she would survive another night in kabukicho she would get another glorious day in that adventure known as her life she would send another yen back to he moved so silently so speedily he could have been a ghost hai she said he materialized out of the trees to the right of the promenade like a giant bat smooth and dark in flowing garments his face almost kabuki white like a demons yet at the same time so graceful were his movements she could not tear her eyes from him she knew she was dead he was a dancer a magician of the body a hypnotizer in the fluid swooping flow of his body as his arms came up she stared at him somehow calmed and there was a frozen moment when she looked into his eyes and felt the compassionate touch of another human mind and then he arctic monkeys screamed nii simply watched in the dim light and could not look away he saw the oyabun appear in front of the woman so smoothly and so evenly there was no aggression in the move and in some way the woman was not frightened there was no terror so charismatic was he that he somehow blinded her and took her into death as if it were a deliverance she seemed to welcome it as a purification his arms went up into kasumi gamae the highright stance the elbows near the arms almost parallel the sword cocked and coiled behind his head the hands apart on the grip one up close to the collar one down low on the very end he paused musically almost as if to obey the ritualistic demands of the drama then the strike and its parts elbows apart came together as he unleashed downward the blade flashing high over his head then plunging downward as the palms rotated inward the left hand provided the power the right the guidance as force was applied along the full edge nii watched the blade drove on an angle through her with almost utter nonchalance as if she were liquid driving across the chest on an angle toward the hip speeding up as the force continued but it was so sudden and surgical that she couldnt scream or jerk or even begin to comprehend what was happening to her just as easily just as quickly he got through her driving the sword edge through the inner landscape of her body feeling the different textures and elasticities of the bloodbearing organs the crispiness of the spine as it split the tightening of the gristle of her intestines the final spurt through the epidermis from the inside out astonishingly almost illogically her left quarter the whole thing arm shoulder neck and head slid wetly off the cut and fell to earth little filaments and gossamer connections breaking as it went her face with still a look of astonishment leaving her other threequarters erect for just a second a jet of black spurted from the hideous opening of the cut that had become the leading edge of what remained and when the knees went clumsily the whole awkward thing fell to earth and instantly the blood began to pool blackly in the dim light yes said kondo isami its very sharp still nii said nothing now little nii get this mess cleaned up and disposed and say a word over her when you bury her she was good cutting it was called kirisute gomen meaning to cut down and leave it was the right of every samurai according to article seventyone of the code of articles of ino he says said big al that its not an official form its a draft it was just typed from notes so theres no way of telling if its authentic it could be a forgery they sat in an office behind sushi good friends a profitable restaurant owned by al ino al also owned three other sushi restaurants two strip malls a couple of pizza joints two hair cutteries three gas stations and two mcdonalds around oakland a few more in san francisco and one or two way out in carmel county he was a retired master sergeant usmc whom bob had found through a contact in marine hq under the category japanese language specialists as ino had spent twentyfour years in marine intelligence most of it in japan he doesnt think so why not because he says that although its not an official form it is organized like an official form hes seen a lot of coroners reports he was a homicide detective in osaka for eleven years gunny the he was the fatherinlaw of one of al inos sons who had retired to america to be close to his daughter al said he was a top guy who knew japanese crime up one side down the other thats osaka maybe they do it different in tokyo trust me on this one gunny they dont do it different in tokyo gotcha they were discussing the document bob had received a few days earlier shipped by sal the big japanese shipping company it had turned out quickly enough that the return address was phony as was the name of the shipper one john yamamoto it seems like theyre japanese gunny theyre very careful every i is dotted every t crossed at every step theyre thorough methodical and they have infinite patience they work like dogs thats how i ended up owning half of oakland bob looked at the document it was thirty pages long column after column of kanji characters arranged vertically on the pages with never a strikeover or erasure now and then a crude stickfigure drawing with arrows or dotted lines signifying this or that mysterious pathology no names no names just scientific fact on the burned remains of five humans found in the prefecture of tokyo at such and such a time at such and such a place five dead human beings and some remarks some oddities some things he couldnt figure out im not sure i can get through this i once had my own father autopsied if you can believe it and i got through that im not sure he trailed off he needed a drink a splash of sake would taste so good it would calm him just enough al ino was a drinking man and bob could see a whole rack of bottles on a cabinet on the other side of the office in any one of them paradise hid well its pretty hard stuff said al maybe i could submit a report to you gunny you could look at it at a better time no ive got to do this just tell me is it bad well heres one thing ill bet you didnt know whoever the oldest male victim is he got one of them huh yeah there was a lot of blood soaked into his trousers and they didnt burn because they were so wet the blood typology and dna matched nobody in the family does that make you feel any better bob was surprised it did heres to you philip yano you were tough at the end you defended your family you went down hard you cut is it a surprise nah he was pure samurai thats how hed go good news bad news al went on good news i suppose some mercy on a cruel night the family members were shot ninemillimeters head shots once twice someone went upstairs silently from room to room with a pistol and put them down so there was no pain there was no torture there was no rape only murder said bob glumly the young female was shot twice once in the jaw once in the head she must have risen he got her as she was getting up then he stood over her as she was still breathing and fired again the others the boys and the mother it was clean bob put his head in his hands god he needed a drink so bad he thought of grave tomoe and what she would have brought into the world as a doctor with her care her precision her commitment to obligation her love of her father and mother shot in the face then in the head lying there as he came over she probably understood what was happening what had happened to her family is there more unfortunately gunny are you all right lets just get this over with the bad stuff if being shot in your bed is good thengo on they were cut bob blinked im sorry not hurt yourself shaving cut not hell i cut my finger cut no they were cut cut christ i translate roughly al picked up a sheet of paper out of the document that he had highlighted with a yellow magic marker all limbs and necks were severed torsos were sundered diagonally and horizontally in two cases pelvic bones had been cut through seemingly with one clean stroke in another case rib bones were sheared in two at roughly a fortyfivedegree angle to the spine all spines were severed the instrumentation in dismemberment appeared to be a number of heavy extremely sharp sword blades the cleanness with which the bones were separated at the site of each incision suggests a weapon traveling at considerable velocity as if at the end of a stroke of an extremely powerful righthanded man several less forceful cuts were also noted in some cases bones were merely broken and not fully separated suggesting men of less intense musculature his students yeah hmmm let me see al rose walked to a bookshelf and pulled out a volume it was called the japanese sword the soul of the samurai by gregory irvine he flipped through it yeah theres nothing arbitrary about the cutting that went on that night it followed prescribed methodology of seventeen ninetytwo here look at it thats any one of the yanos bob looked at the page trying to keep his rage buried rage was not helpful rage got you nothing but dead in a hurry its a cutting scheme according to the yamada family said al it illustrated the various prescribed cuts that could be carried out when testing a sword on a corpse the line figure depicted a body wrapped in a jocklike towel with the various dotted lines signifying cuts through center mass it was headless and helpful lines pointed out the proper angle through the shoulder on each side of the shorn neck through the elbow and the wrist and latitudinally across the body from under the arms all the way down to beneath the navel okay said bob thats enough he needed a drink the shogun the shogun liked to meet at the yasukuni shrine he felt at home there where the spirits of japans many millions of war dead lay consecrated amid the woodlands and the forests where only rarely could a gaijin be seen and then never one mad with cameras hungry for japanese pussy he was surrounded by bodyguards for of course he had many enemies but it was generally a quiet place away from the hum and throb of his many organizations his obligations his many lords and lieges all of whom waited for order and direction his responsibilities his pleasures his orchestrations his plotting his aspirations so he could walk and enjoy from under the steel torii gate that towered over the promenade which ran two hundred or so yards to the shrine itself the classical structure of timber and whitewashed stone ornate and serene at once kondo joined him precisely at pm kondosan the shogun said lord said kondo who in street clothes and unarmed appeared to be nothing extraordinary he was a square blocky man in his midforties whose awesome muscularity was hidden beneath his black salaryman suit his white shirt his black tie and shoes to look at his masculine face was to suspect nothing no one could know what lay behind his opaque dark eyes he was neither handsome nor not so handsome he was in all ways anonymous and therefore unnoticeable if with sword in hand he was a beacon of charisma without one he could have been an actuary kondo bowed from the neck and head keeping the body taut the feet close the hands straight against the seam of the trousers musashis rule no pay attention to trifles thus everything even the bow had to be perfect come walk with me lets talk said the shogun of course lord i suppose i should ask for a report yes lord the blade is as reported it is absolutely authentic it is the real thing that i know i have felt its power you used it then i knew my lord would understand i had to know the blade and to know a blade one must kill with it and now i know the blade was it risky no lord it was well planned the woman was alone she had no relatives she was a korean prostitute working in one of otanis clubs it worked out very well you say it cut well the moon in a cold stream like a mirror that well eh musashi himself would have been well pleased i hope we havent lost too much time lord i have made arrangements even now the blade will go to old omote the best polisher in japan then it will go to hanzaemon who makes koshirae like no other man alive then finally to saito the saya maker again the best normally these men take forever if at all they will work quickly however for the shogun excellent i trust you in these matters when it is done it will be magnificent when you make the presentation you must understand how important this is said the shogun what is at stake i stand for a certain japan that japan must be protected i am that japan even as i protect it i cannot lose my power and the presentation of the blade will guarantee my position for years and years to come plus win me the adoration of the masses kondo had heard this speech many times but he pretended for the sake of everybody that he had not if you play your cards right he said it might even win you the supreme order of the chrysanthemum from the emperor hmmm said the shogun i think the supreme is a little much to hope for but one of the lesser badges that would be very nice lord i promise you i am your samurai to you i am pledged and i will make this thing happen i will not fail you you too stand for the old ways kondosan and i will never forget it with you at my side i can do anything you give me strength you too are japan the old japan my reward is your happiness is that so well your happiness and the four million dollars youre paying me four million buys a lot of loyalty it bought mine ill say all right then the blade is secure no suspicion attaches to you or to me the blade will be restored and i will make the presentation and the people shall love me and my position and my clans importance will be guaranteed imperial will go away and die the americans behind it will go away and die we will have won a great culture victory our japanese art will stay forever japanese i pledge myself excellent the shogun checked his watch now i must hasten i have a crisis to attend to you know kondosan all this rough business all this maneuvering and plotting and violence i hope it never affects the artist in me it wasnt the boy it was the teacher it wasnt her clothes her clothes were perfect she had on low heels a pair of panty hose from tashiroya a severe skirt cut just to her knees a white silk blouse some very nice pearls and a conservative jacket she wore glassesthe glasses were so importantand her hair was up pinned securely her makeup was exquisite it wasnt the set it looked exactly like any other classroom the phalanx of desks the chalkfrosted blackboards the maps the flag on a pole in the corner it had the dusty shabby look of thousands and thousands of classrooms and any japanese male would grasp its essential reality in seconds it wasnt the lighting technically his people were very good here for example at the casual pinnacle of their professionalism they had duplicated exactly the pale wash of the ubiquitous high school fluorescents though with enough soft underlighting to give everything within it a kind of white dull gleam for some reason some magical reason in this bath of lucidity flesh itself took on an almost alchemical palpability even as each detail was revealed each flaw each hair follicle the end product never looked raw or sordid it had a kind of majesty to it classically japanese as were all the other motifs as if delicately painted on a silk scroll by a master in a satin kimono sometime in the koto age it wasnt the director an old pro it wasnt the camera the stagehands the experience level it wasnt any of these things but it took the shoguns expert eye to see in a second what the problem was it was the actress sakurachan he spoke gently to her i know this is difficult but the transition is so important you have ripened into womanhood your flesh has acquired gravity density solidity and amplitude you have a womans body your eyes have wisdom your beautiful face has knowledge your hair a silky glisten our makeup people have transferred your already shocking beauty into something beyond shock you are truly mythological do you hear my dear yes oyabun said the beautiful young woman chastely but i see from the rushes that something is lacking i understand you are holding back it is difficult it was difficult sakura had been in the business three years and was a star she had a following was a celebrity had several magazines and photobooks devoted to her could get a good table in any restaurant in any city in japan the shogun had invested a great deal of money in her had her dentition fixed shed had a gap between her two front teeth sent her to the best dermatologists the most sophisticated manicurists and pedicurists hired a trainer to develop the muscles of her already willowy utterly desirable body i understand how difficult it is said the shogun shirley temple couldnt do it sandra dee couldnt do it some even believe that the great jodie foster hasnt done it it is the hardest thing there is only judy garland was able to do it cleanly and completely i am trying so hard her problem sakura in schoolgirl sluts nos and had been a huge hit had always played a victim she had come up the hard way through entrylevel bukkake roles moving on to her specialty the schoolgirl rape victim moving boldly to the geisha motif and quite successfully into a series called cutie rangers where in polyester scifi outfits with holes cut so that her perky breasts showed constantly she moved product in the millions but her breasts had simply gotten too big and beautiful to continue to play in kilts and ponytails she had to become an adult woman or she was through it was the third day of filming woman teacher in black sakura and it wasnt going well possibly you try too hard my dear he said tenderly i miss the pixels it was like working without a net in all her other films sakura had been pixellated that is in postproduction a computerized mosaic had been appliqued over her most private parts and the most private parts of her male costars of course it was psychological for on the set all things were displayed routinely but somehow knowing that at a certain point the delicate obscurity of the pixellated smear would be applied and that ones most intimate areas were to be protected had helped liberate her to the incredible frenzy that her directors and her millions of fans so admired but at a certain point in an actresss career she had to move beyond the pixels and enter the world of percent nudity such product was of course technically illegal in japan by mandate of the commission of motion picture codes and ethics but since the commission was under the control of the all japan video society ajvs and since the shogun was president of the ajvs in fact its dictator he could sell such product without fear he was both the criminal and the police in the issue it was good work if you could get it and he had gotten it my darling you know that the essence of chijo is honesty you have to move into chijo you have to put pixels behind you and share the beauty of your womanhood with all japan and chijo was the essence of his empire chijo lewd woman or slut woman it was based on a counterintuitive fantasy that behind those demure japanese women softspoken and polite hardworking and demure all delicate beauty and exquisite wardrobe there lay a demon of sexual flame the shogun had been the first to see this the teacher revered and feared so central to the japanese culture and the japanese tradition yet behind her classical looks and reserved dignity lay a wanton a debauchee who would assault her students demand sexual surrender from them force them into girls clothes literally rape them in all possible positions it started with teachers moved quickly to the other figures of authority airline hostesses office ladies nurses campaign girls even finally as they grew older the surprising mature housewife category he had tapped a vein the money just poured in the hunger out there was amazing think of it this way he said to the troubled young beauty we have our japanese ways the world particularly the americans hunger to dominate us they would change what we do and destroy us not with atom bombs and firestorms but with their culture their crude aggressive unknowing ways you you little sakura you must stand against that you are not merely an actress you are a frontline soldier a samurai in the battle against america do you see my dear why it is so incumbent upon you to find within yourself that samurai spirit to display it before the cameras to let us distribute it to become full chijo really chijo is the samurai of the flesh the girl sakura delivered a boffo performance dr otowa it was through the good auspices of the retired lieutenant yoshida of the osaka homicide squad that the distinguished dr otowa agreed to see bob lee swagger dr otowa with graying temples was well tailored articulate and multilingual he did not know lieutenant yoshida but upon receipt of a letter a quick call to people who would know and dr otowa was very well connected proved yoshidas bona fides as a firstrate man almost a legend who had retired to oakland california to be near his daughter who had married an american of japanese ancestry the two men met in dr otowas office in the tokyo historical museum a shrine of antiquities that looked like a cathedral grand and somber enshrouded in its own parklands near ueno where the doctor was curator of swords with a specialty and worldwide reputation for the bizen smiths of the fifteenth century his office appropriately was a room of blades they glinted brightly from their glass cases wickedly curved constructions that represented to many the highest and most articulated accomplishments of the japanese imagination for more than a thousand years the museum had one of the best collections in the country only a small portion of which was on display to the public mr swagger would you care for some sake thank you sir but no im a drunk one sip and off i go i understand i approve of selfcontrol now lieutenant yoshidas letter said there had been some sword thefts in the united states blades worth many thousands of dollars a killing as well as a westerner you wonder how could a piece of steel made five hundred years ago for slicing up brigands and executing conspirators and splitting ones own bowels be worth killing for all these years later i know the swords are works of art they can be incredibly valuable that would be worth killing for just on the profit motive so you are here to find out about the market but surely you have seen men kill for insignificant sums for quarters for pennies for harsh words bad jokes and cheap gals men will kill for anything and nothing you know a thing or two i see but i do believe there was some craft here the killer had to know about swords possibly he represented or was himself a highlevel collector possibly he meant to hold the blade ransom as you would a child perhapswell i dont know but ive checked and the very best sword might go for two hundred thousand dollars would that justify such a crime possibly it was a historical blade it had validated provenance and was associated with something extraordinary that would accelerate its value exponentially that would be something on the order of wyatt earps colt wyatt earps colt sold for three hundred fifty grand thats a lot of money swords mean more to the japanese than guns to americans such a sword might go for ten times as much here say three point five million thats worth killing for easily yes but the more famous the blade is the harder it would be to sell for a profit you could steal wyatt earps colt or even the mona lisa i suppose but who would you sell it to thats why the idea of a crime for profit seems not to fit here maybe just having it would be enough but stillit doesnt make sense possibly not to an american possibly to a japanese said dr otowa i have to hope i can make sense of it if not im pure out of luck i have to presume some sanity and logic behind it sir fair enough so let me ask this is there one sword by one i mean something like a grail maybe its beauty maybe its history maybe both it exists only in rumors its never been verified but if it came to light it would shake up everybody i mean a sword so special thatwell i dont know japan well enough to say but it would translate into instant power prestige attention something more valuable than money something really worth killing for killing not merely a man though killing a family a wife a husband swagger sat back and squinted at the doctor hmmm you saw clean through my little game mr swagger said dr otowa i am in regular email contact with blade societies collectors and curators all over the world if a man was killed in america and a rare blade stolen i would know on the other hand several months ago a man named philip yano and his family were destroyed not twenty miles from where we now sit it was very puzzling very sad the next morning an american made a scene at the site of the crime claiming before witnesses that he had given yano a rare sword that had been stolen for his efforts he was rather unceremoniously asked to leave the country the investigation concerning philip yano has stalled and it seems that nothing is being done as if certain police officials believe some crimes are best ignored now there is an american in my office seeking to discover something about what blades would be worth murdering for it wasnt a hard connection to make i dont see how you got back in the country though i have a very good fake passport in another name you realize what will happen to you if you are caught illegally on japanese soil i know it will go hard yet you risk that i do the way of the warrior is death it is not fifteen years of masturbation in a japanese prison i will do what i must do mr swagger i suspect you are a capable man you had the sponsorship of yoshida who would not lend use of his name to a criminal so the misrepresentation itself speaks of your righteousness i only mean to see this thing out sir im going to tell you a story im going to tell you the story of a sword of a sword worth killing for a sword worth dying for a sword that would make its possessor the most important and revered man in japan are you ready i am sir all right mr swagger he said lets begin now so that you understand let me give you something to hold on to he went to his wall display case unlocked it and took out a weapon katana sixteen fiftyone used by a man called nogami swagger took the thing go ahead take it out of the saya dont worry about etiquette now just pull it out and dont cut a finger or a leg off swagger pulled it out it was heavier than it looked it had a strange electricity to it the blade wore a slight curve was dappled along its edge where the harder steel that cut met the softer steel that supported a groove ran up one side and the tip was a unique orchestration of ridges upturned to a chisel point why was it like that why wasnt it just a point there had to be a reason these people studied cutting and stabbing made art and science out of them they knew the sword and no implement in history had been so engineered as a japanese sword the handle was long enough for two hands and then some but the whole thing could be used onehanded if necessary it wasnt beautiful no it looked like a weapon like say an m rifle perfectly exactly functional meant to do one thing very well and built by people who cared about nothing but that one thing in his hands it seemed to come to life what had tommy culpepper said oh yeah it wants to cut something it did it yearned for flesh a gun was different you grew used to it and it became a tool but the sword thrilled you each time you picked it up he stood and waved the blade artlessly through the air feeling the slight thrum as it gathered speed and momentum the grooves made it sing a bit as it sliced left and right lets begin with snow mr swagger snow enters the japanese imagination by chance on a cold night in what the old calendars call december seventeenohtwo but which is by ours january thirtyfirst seventeenohthree think of a column of men fortyseven of them trudging through the dark city then called edo through the whirling blizzard they are hunched against the cold but the weather is not on their minds vengeance is bob saw snow he saw men jogging through it swords such as this one slung heads down breaths blowing steam into the dark night air it could have been russia it could have been the chosin reservoir or it could have been valley forge it could have been anywhere men fought for what they believed they look like green berets or russian spetsnaz or brit sas they wear camouflage jagged patterns on their kimonos each carries two murderously sharp swords as well as somewhere a shorter tanto just in case most carry yari our word for spear each of them has been training his whole life for this no commando team in history has had more talent skill will and violence at its disposal who have they come to fight the story goes back two years the shogunmilitary dictator the true power in japanrequired that his lords spend every other year in edo servicing his court in elaborate ceremonial duties that were the courts entire purpose i know how foolish it sounds think how brilliant it is he wants them consumed with worry over the ceremony far from advisors and sycophants so that they wont plot against him its the time of seppuku if a lord makes a mistake if he violates a law if he crosses his legs wrong or wears the wrong hat he made a gesture drawing his firm hand in a fist across his belly in seventeen hundred a young lord from the house of asano in ako was called to edo for his turn in the court he waswell opinions differ a man of probity and strength a great man who wouldnt kowtow who hated corruption effeminacy bureaucratic infighting all the propensities of headquarters or was he a silly fool overmatched outwitted and ultimately destroyed he may have been a mediocrity a retardate a crusader opinions vary whats important is that for some reason he will not play the court game which is bribery the most important figure at the court is the master of tea ceremoniesessentially the shoguns social secretary secretly controlling everything his name is kira he has seven other names but we call him kira hes easy to get along with just give him a lot of money asano wont the circumstances were familiar bob had seen movies more or less covering them no possibly out of idealism possibly out of stupidity possibly out of naïveté kira is furious kira by the way is ambiguous some see him as a decadent libertine a partaker in the pleasures of the floating world a seducer of young maids others see him simply as a man guarding the traditions he had inherited under no obligation to reform he did as he was taught in his way he was obedient to the dictates of his lord too thus angered and insulted by asanos refusal to bribe him he declares war on asano but not with blades he shames the younger man he gossips about him to destroy his reputation and remember to the japanese reputation is everything the pressure on asano is incredible if he makes a mistake he made a sound like a belly slitting and asano one day breaks down in a fit of rage at some insult or other he pulls his wakizashishort swordand lurches after the much older man in a part of the shoguns castle called the pine corridor he manages to cut kira twice once on the forehead once on the shoulder bob looked at the weapon asano has violated court etiquette he has pulled his blade in the shoguns palace its an instant death sentence say what you will for asano he died with far more dignity than he lived he wrote a poem in the seconds before i wish i had seen the end of spring but i do not miss the falling of the cherry blossoms then he cut his own guts out the shogunate confiscates his property his mansion and it drives all his retainers out now they are shamed they are unemployed they have nothing you know i think i saw some movies about this i never quite understood them i now realize but i know what happens the fortyseven ronin they visit kira two years later the government has abolished the clan confiscated its property and driven them out to the countryside but they werent quite done one night they came to call when it was snowing correct come look at this and bring the sword i want the sword in your hand when you see this the two men rose and dr otowa took bob over to a woodcut on the wall the greatest japanese warrior artist was utagawa kuniyoshi he portrayed that night and the men who took part dozens of times and from him come all our images of the event even if he was working in the nineteenth century one hundred sixty years after the fight this is his triptych entitled attack of the fortyseven ronin on kiras mansion bob looked he saw war familiar enough a melee a whirl a crazed mess no rules no coherence men in desperate postures faces grim driving forward with the long spears and swords just like the one he held see that one there said dr otowa pointing to a dominant armored figure in the center of the battle with the longest spear urging his men on with some sort of horsetail switch thats oishi the senior retainer of the house of asano he is the hero of the story he is the man who planned and led the attack who held the ronin together who coordinated intelligence reports who laid out the final strategy he knew he was being watched by the shoguns secret informers so he went so far as to leave his wife and go live in a brothel pretending dissolution to mislead the spies or that is what is said maybe he just needed an excuse to leave the woman and live it up with the geishas until the day came wouldnt be the first time said bob not at all oishi divides his men into two groups assaults through the snow one man is assigned to cut the bowstrings of kiras bodyguards so theres no way they can get their big weapons into play then its man on man sword on sword a fellow named horibe yosube was the best swordsman he was accompanied by his fatherinlaw horibe yahei who was seventyseven many of the men were old the youngest was oishis son who was seventeen but it is oishi we are interested in he killed kira yes after all the killing was over they found the vile kira hiding in the charcoal shed oishi knew him because of his age and the scar on his forehead he ripped the old mans jacket off and found the second scar on the shoulder oishi offered him the tanto kira was no samurai he declined oishi beheaded him with a single stroke from his wakizashi which was the blade that asano had used to disembowel himself now that sword seppuku of asano then beheader of kira that is a sword japan would love to have what happened to it we dont know we only know that it was made a hundred years or so earlier by a smith named norinaga in yamato i see no no you dont because i havent finished the story the world would understand the story ive told you loyalty courage violence justice what a primal narrative how satisfying now however comes the japanese part the fortyseven ronin did they run and hide did they sail to china and korea and change their names no they marched in formation to sengakuji temple where their lord was buried washed the head of kira and turned the head over to the priests then they turned themselves in to the shogun and awaited judgment there was much debate but in the end all of them all of them were ordered to commit seppuku and all of them did heres the truly japanese part they were happy to do so the story isnt a tragedy its got a happy ending the fortyseven within a year had been ordered by the shogunate to split their bellies and on a single day an orgy of belly splitting took place that is why we remember them that is why hundreds of people go to sengakuji temple here in tokyo every day to visit the graves and burn incense to their spirits that is why there is a big festival on the fourteenth of decemberto commemorate the night oishi cut the old mans head off thats the sword thats the one its just like the one you hold in your hand now bob looked again at the weapon could it somehow have ended up shortened remounted in thirtynine shingunto furniture and carried in world war two theres no reason at all why it couldnt have it was lost it could be anywhere it could be nowhere what would verify it the shape of the blade and the structure of the ridges and the nature of the hamon would place it in the right time frame then if enough was left on the tang the presence of norinagas name and the asano crest would complete the triangulation none of the other ronin had swords by norinaga oishi had asanos wakizashi and katana with a white cord around the koshirae only oishi carried norinaga and if you had that swordwhat would you do with it possession of beheader of kira would be a totem of samurai purity that would propel its owner to instant fame its recovery would electrify japan id donate it to my own museum and display it to the people of japan it would be a gift to the nation the nation would rejoice or most of it anyhow what would the man who wiped out the yanos do with it i dont know mr swagger i dont know but he certainly wouldnt give it up easily mr swagger do you understand what youre getting yourself into i suppose i do do you have a plan i have a lead a policeman said to be an expert examined the sword i brought into the country at the airport he was the only one who saw it he had enough time to make an impression of the tang when i examined the sword in america the mekugi was cemented in place yet when i watched yano examine the sword that pin popped right out so someone had disassembled the sword it could only have been that policeman who had it in his custody for three hours that was the only time it was out of my sight he wont want to talk with me but thats too bad i will learn of a next step from him i will pursue that next step in the end i will find who stole the blade and i will retrieve it no matter what these people will come for you i have been at risk before yes i realize in the military yes sir this is different its not war its more intimate are you armed no im sure i could get a gun yes but if you were caught here without a passport and with an illegal guni hate to think of the consequences possibly you should hire a bodyguard hed just get in the way do you have any martial arts skills i know a trick or two i was in the marine corps for fifteen years and took a few unarmed combat courses there im not afraid of violence fear has nothing to do with it the bravest untrained man facing the most cowardly trained swordsman would die in a tenth of a second do you know the sword no if a skilled man came at you with a sword what would you do well i suppose id go into the ooda loop observe orient decide and act thats the core of you would die mr swagger thats all you would do look im sure youre a very brave man but get some instruction learn some fundamentals at least if youre determined to explore these dark japanese alleys they are unkind places for the uninitiated i hear you theres no way you could pick up what some have studied for a lifetime but at least youd have some sort of a chance if assaulted ill consider it here he said heres the number of a fellow in kyoto i will call him and tell him of the gaijin who thinks hes toshiro mifune he and i will have a good laugh we were kendo competitors many many years ago we pelted each other bloody over the decades he trained my son hell see you as a favor to me even if only to be amused you should spend a week with him and listen to what he has to say or you should go home those are your only choices steel cuts flesh steel cuts bone steel does not cut steel as musashi said become steel or get cut thats the world youre entering the young men bob left the august building and headed through the parklands where dozens of brightly colored stalls selling books and dvds and yakitori had been set up he saw a cop car and thought do they know who i am am i being watched the trip in had been easy enough al ino through his intelligence contacts was able to come up with a passport for bob soon enough that led to a whole new identity complete with drivers license social security number and fake pictures in his wallet he sold some bonds and put in a fund in the name of a mr thomas lee of oakland california traveling money accessible anywhere in the world with credit card and pin number it went without a hitch bob lee swagger didnt exist anymore now that hed done the first thing he had to figure out how to locate the cop at the airport how to approach him how to secure his cooperation yet already he was exhausted where had his energy gone was he too old for this and a week of sword lessons what could be learned in a week what was the point he looked about for a westernstyle restaurant he walked for a bit leaving the somber grand building and its parklands and entered the crazed utopia of modern tokyo in time he found a starbucks and went in and bought a sevendollar cup of black joe gradually the starbucks began to fill up the coffee was hot and strong and he began to and thats when he noticed the restaurant had filled up quickly enough but with the same man he was about twentyfive all twentyfive of him he wore his hair in a crew cut with a butch wax front fence he was muscular alert oblivious and yet at the same time aware he wore square blackframed sunglasses chinos and a white polo shirt they didnt pay any attention to the lanky older gaijin sitting there but very quietly and skillfully surrounded him then bob noticed theyd each ordered a single cup of coffee oh shit thought bob i dont like this at all one of them seemed to amble by then with a certain nonchalance slid across from bob not a word was said not for a while finally the young man looked over and smiled and said hi hi said bob do i know you no but i know you thomas lee isnt it what is this the young man took a sip of his coffee this starbucks really good huh its okay what is this who are you a friend i guess i dont have any friends im a mean old bastard not that kind of friend the other kind as in we have the same enemies so we should be friends are you a cop you look like a college tennis player relax mr lee enjoy your coffee i just think that when you finish you should come with us why would i want to do such a thing because as i say were friends you say i get in a car with you and the ninemillimeters come out and its all over for me guns are illegal in japan lets put it this way we can help you we have the same goal prove it all right your name isnt lee its swagger youre an exmarine a war hero known in some circles as quite capable something of an operator if you get caught here on that bad passport you are in deep trouble we know all that if we wanted to take you down we could do it with a single call yet we do not we are nice to you we like you look lets do it this way ill leave all the men here will leave you come out when youre ready satisfy yourself that no ones around no ones coercing you that its entirely up to you then cross the street and youll see a tan van ill be sitting next to the driver come over get in well drive you to an interesting place and youll meet some interesting friends he rode in utter silence for about an hour then the doors opened but didnt reveal the bright light of outdoors his friend leaned in this way mr swagger then he heard a strange sound it was a hollow vibrating thunk or clank it was a wood sound and he figured after a bit that people were banging sticks together sometimes quite rapidly in dizzying patterns he was in a vast interior space under a vaulted curving roof and saw that it was a hangar of some sort as his eyes adjusted he quickly made out that it had been converted into a gigantic dojo everywhere young men whacked at each other with katana wooden of course exhibiting a great deal of elegance and power most wore the hakama pants and shinshaga jacket of kendo and the armor and masks of that game but a few either brave or fools either too nimble to be held back by the armor padding or in punishment for an infraction went at it with unprotected faces and bodies they were really good he turned and saw his friend had joined two men wearing uniforms that had to belong to japans selfdefense force what is this gym class he asked not exactly mr swagger said the leader of the group dont know where you get your information my name is lee he said thomas lee i have papers to prove it thats not what lieutenant yoshida said oh great thought bob he walked over joined the officer and the four of them walked between mats until they reached a conference room they all took seats around a large table yoshida didnt betray you the officer in charge said he was helping you yoshida informed us because he knew that you and i shared the same objective i knew about your impending arrival before you even got the tickets all right who are you i major albert fujikawa commanding officer third battalion first airborne brigade eastern army japanese selfdefense forces ground division welcome you to japan the young man in civilian clothes is my executive officer captain tanada commanding officer of my recon company as you might imagine the bigger fellow is a sergeant master sergeant kanda we welcome a retired gunnery sergeant united states marine corps well arent you well informed you even know my old rank al ino tells yoshida who tells you you make inquiries and get all my bona fides something like that but now i get it said bob youre philip yanos guys we were with colonel yano for many years in samawah i was the one the colonel pulled from a burning bradley vehicle id be dead if it werent for him he was a very fine man he was indeed he and the kids and his wife deserved better than they got said bob nobody deserved what the yanos got and that is why youre here no one seems to be doing a goddamned thing about it bob said in frustration that dont sit right with me mr swagger your anger your loyalty your fury your drive all that is indeed commendable however it is time to face some realities you have almost no knowledge of japan you dont speak japanese you dont understand our values our traditions the way our society is put together ive seen a lot of samurai movies said bob oh excellent said the major did you see the one where the fellow outran the horse as a matter of fact i did or the one where the samurai defeated three hundred men in a village yeah i saw that one too i also saw the one where the gal cuts the guys head off but he dont notice until he turns around and his head stays in place but i also saw a lot of stories about lone men doing what they had to do and getting the job done even if it cost them their lives that was the lesson i took you know nothing of our politics our corporations our sexual tendencies our strange relationship with the samurai past can you name a single city in japan besides tokyo hiroshima and nagasaki i think theres one called kyoto oh also the one where they held the winter olympics that time do you know if you are allowed to have sexual relations with a geisha i have always wondered about that one do you know how to tie an obi no what is the diet what is the name of the emperor what is the name of the majority party do you know what a prefecture is what is the difference between a shogun and an emperor what is the family name of the great shogunate clan can you name a famous film director who did not make a single samurai movie do you know how many people we lost in world war two do you know how many people were burned to death in a single night in tokyo no i dont know any of that do you know our justice system do you understand the structure of the yakuza their traditions identification marks tendencies and traditions do you understand the difference between our national police and the prefectural police and how they interrelate no i take the point i am ill equipped for this job i will get in the way i will fuck things up is that what you brought me here to tell me actuallyno all those reasons are in fact why you are the one man in japan who might succeed at this job bobs mouth fell open had he heard right i dont you see we have a tight little island here rules boundaries traditions everywhere do you want to understand the japanese mr swagger look at a kimono or a hakama and see how it is a galaxy of knots all different all perfect all strategically placed that is why the swords never fall out of the sashes in the movies no westerner could tie any of those knots every japanese could tie all of them blindfolded so we are caught up in our own knots mr swagger we need a westerner who can cut through knots fuck the kimono fuck the obi fuck the way saya fits in the obi fuck all that shit cut through it find out who killed philip yano and why so you want tohelp me by law those of us in what passes for a military are forbidden from taking part in domestic affairs the penalties are extreme we are watched constantly we represent a japanese tradition that many japanese have been taught to be ashamed of and cannot face so they hammer us into insignificance but you mr swagger are uninformed undisciplined unaware you can go anywhere and ask anything you are true ronin masterless samurai owing nothing to nobody you really are toshiro mifune dont know about that but i will try my damndest i believe you all right then youll have a number we will staff that phone twentyfour hours a day if you get in trouble if you need help if you need logistics support intelligence we will provide it for you in the meantime well go our separate ways seem to lose ourselves in the minutiae of meaningless existence as we have since philip yano and his clan were slain ill even divorce my wife and move into a brothel well no i wont believe it or not i catch the meaning otowa mentioned that story he would have yes our retainer has been murdered our clan destroyed we will settle that account mr swagger but theres a bargain that must be made i will be part of that fight thats the bargain im making with honorable men right all right mr swagger said major fujikawa you have your bargain now said bob lets see if youre as good as you say you are go ahead said the major at narita theres a cop whos the stations sword expert someone they call to deal with sword matters importation exportation ignorant gaijin who bring stuff in or out without doing the necessary paperwork that sort of thing yes it is logical hes the guy hes what this thing pivots on hes dirty he has to be he understood in a second the potential value of the sword i carried he made the phone call hes the one who made the whole thing happen i have to have his name and address i start with him the cop someone in the unit had a brother who was a cop at narita and in a few days major fujikawa called with a namekenji kishidaand an address bob intercepted him at narita he was the one on the brandnew kawasaki a gleamy red dream machine bigger than all the other bikes obviously hed bought it with his yakuza windfall for finding the sword when he arrived at and departed from the station lot parking and locking his bike in the gated compound bob watched from the coffee shop where he could sit unobserved reading a newspaper kishida moved with an awkward limp he didnt have the agility the rangy grace of a young man nor was he musclebound like others who spent lots of time in the gym bulking up this fellow wore a suit suggesting he was a detective or an administrator and in his bright redandblack helmet with its darkened fullface shield he looked almost ridiculous like a hybrid beast part salaryman part knight in armor bob monitored the mans apartment house for a few days until he was satisfied kishida had no wife and kids at home the next week bob noted that his candidate was working the midnight shift one morning at am bob pulled into kishidas apartment buildings parking lot riding an identical kawasaki metallic majestic red that hed bought in the name of thomas lee hed spent afternoons coming to terms with the lefthand driving he was swaddled head to foot in racing leathers and wore the exact redandblack helmet with darkened visor that officer kishida wore he pulled into the stall that kishida always took and even aped the candidates slight limp his old guys demeanor he entered the building nodding at a sleepy night watchman at the desk who thought bob was the officer took the elevator up to the right floor walked to the apartment bent over and attacked the lock with a credit card there was no heavy security system no deadbolts or electronic monitoring the lock yielded in a split second then he was in the apartment of course was trim and neat three pairs of black shoes and two pairs of sneakers with shoe trees in them were lined up in the foyer bob went to the bookcase and saw many english books kishida spoke english the books were all about swords most were in japanese several in german and several in french all were arranged by nationality then alphabetically he pulled one out at random and found it copiously underlined and with margin notes on the inside cover were precise notes taken in a fine kanji hand running up and down the page indexed to page numbers he pulled two other books out and found them equally dissected no dirty dishes were in the sink in the small kitchen and the refrigerator yielded no germy sushi no moldy noodles there was a sixbottle carton of sapporo and three cans of that famous japanese drink diet coke next to the refrigerator was a halfopen bottle of ozeki sake bob moved to the bedroom it was nondescript with musashis famous shrike hanging on a scroll over the futon which was flat and neatly made up against the opposite wall was a large tv and dvd player in the closet were uniforms shirts and ties and two civilian black ties and black suits then polo shirts a few pairs of jeans and chinos all neatly pressed each hanger was exactly onethird of an inch from the next closing the door he went to the low stand next to the futon and opened it there he found on one shelf again alphabetically arranged the crème de la crème of samurai dvds mostly kurosawa but also several other topline films he had seen including samurai rebellion harakiri band of assassins and when the last sword is drawn beneath neatly stacked and alphabetized were porno dvds from a company called shogunate av shogunate av seemed to specialize as near as bob could figure out in something that might be called teacher films for each of the covers showed an attractive young woman in her midtwenties in a business suit and glasses lecturing a batch of boys in subsequent shots she was stripping for them they were touching her she was servicing them all in the classroom where higher mathematics had been chalked on the blackboard jesus he thought who came up with that he left the porn stash and went to the desk indeed the still shiny owners manual to the topoftheline kawasaki r bike lay on the desk and it too had been scrupulously studied underlined and annotated all in a precise kanji hand where were the swords this guy would surely have swords he never found them but he found a vault in a living room closet thats where theyd be this fellows small proud collection bob went back to the desk and found a photo album our hero in kendo outfit through the stages of his life young and proud a winner of some local tourneys a man in his twenties lean and dangerous a woman appeared in some of them but then she disappeared divorce death in the more recent photos the swordsman had become a coach and posed with a group of younger kendo warriors then in a drawer bob found what appeared to be a pile of bills they were all addressed to kenji kishida of shintoyo apartment chiba many were in kanji a few from citibank were in english and japanese and many said the same thing they appreciated his recent settling of debts and they thanked him very much there it was the guy was bankrupting himself buying swords he couldnt afford then the dream sword is presented to him in the middle of a business day he recognizes the asano crest and the swordsmiths signature he reads the shape of the blade puts two and two together and recalls that somebody in the last few weeks wants an astonishing sword he knows the number he takes the sword apart he makes his tang imprint makes the call faxes the imprint and connects them to bob it takes a couple of hours to set up a tail bobs sitting there like a fool when he leaves he has no idea hes leading the killers to the yanos a week later detective kenji kishida receives an envelope full of cash he can settle his bills maybe he buys a sword hes longed for and it reposes right now in the vault hes got a little extra he always wanted a bike why not who will notice he probably never connected it with the yanos it was just a little favor of the sort a mildly dishonest cop might do for someone in power the officer did not go to work saturday he arose late and finally went to his bike about eleven in the morning he had full racing leathers on and looked like a cycle knight he examined his bike with a great deal of pleasure checking connections lubricants this or that tube or pipe or cable then he put on his helmet climbed aboard keyed the engine kicked up the stand backed out with a lurchhe had clearly not yet mastered the subtleties of the handlegrip clutch and the foot shifterhe shunted into motion bob caught the tail end of this drama as hed been circling the blocks in a figureeight pattern to keep the parking lot observed figuring it would only be out of sight for seventy seconds out of every two minutes and when he came by the man had mounted up bob slowed tracked him as he moved through the lot let him join traffic and followed a good three hundred yards behind kishida threaded his way through the traffic still clumsy and jumpy on the gears edged his way through the suburbs of the small city of narita to the kanto expressway where ever so tentatively he finally got up into the higher gears and was soon humming along at kmh it never occurred to him that he was being followed and even if it did he probably wouldnt have had the confidence to take his eyes off the road before him so bob slipstreamed along without much difficulty then kenji kishida either tired of the strain of moving at high speed or decided he wanted to see something prettier than nissans and mazdas playing tag at kmh and the revetments of the superhighway so he took an exit ramp bob easily followed him soon enough the houses fell away ahead some mountains dominated the landscape and rows of carefully cultivated fields lay on either side the traffic thinned and finally kishida turned up a smaller road and seemed to be heading into the mountains he still had not noticed bob now two hundred yards behind the road was empty climbing slightly through rich pine forests bob had never seen a more beautiful and serene range of hills he knew hed never have a better chance the guy might join a heaviertraveled road in seconds he gunned up into fifth gear goosed the bike and flew beyond a hundred miles an hour the wind beat against him and he closed the distance like a shot zooming by kishida feeling the mans sudden start of panic then cruelly he cut kishida off eating up his space driving him onto the shoulder the dust spun up in clouds as kishida struggled with the treacherous loss of traction got tangled up in gears and throttle and brake sequence almost lost control almost in fact died but somehow managed to brake hard and bring the bike down in the dust bob fishtailed to a halt punched down his kickstand and ran to the man lying next to the fallen still chugging bike he shut down the engine and saw through kishidas shaded visor the mans fear panic confusion and hesitation kishida tried to rise bob put a leftfooted dragons kick into the side of the helmethadnt done that in yearsand clocked him hard kishida fell down slipped trying to get up ripped at his helmet then grabbed at his zippered jacket perhaps to reach a gun or a tanto but bob kicked him in the helmet with another wheelhouse dragons sweep that put him down solidly and he lay shaking stars and spiderwebs out of his head trying to figure what the hell was bob jumped him pressing his knee against the squirming mans chest he pulled the zipper down saw the shaft of a glock pulled it dropped the mag racked the slide to toss the chambered round but there wasnt one then tossed it twenty feet away kishida recoiled in horror bob yanked the mans helmet off you stay put if you know whats good for you ill smack you around even more if i have to i am a police officer you are in big shut up i ask the questions you answer em thats how this game is going to be played the sword i dont the sword goddammit what sword the sword that bought you this bike the sword that paid all your debts the sword that bought you some new toy in your vault the sword thats going to buy you teacher porno for the next ten years kishida said nothing his eyes suddenly went distant and he looked off thinking then finally he looked back i know who you are i knew youd come it dont matter a lick who or what i am or who or what you know what matters is the sword you were the one who spotted it whod you tell how did it happen how was it set up what was the deal the connection dont give me any bullshit i know more than you could guess please i had no idea those people would be killed you have to believe that i never realizedi just had no idea so you knew it was going to the yanos no but the collectors were talking afterward how some american at the site of the fire was screaming about a stolen sword thats when i saw how it could have been i am ashamed i should have committed seppuku but i lack the courage you and me both pal just tell me who reached you how did it happen who was on the receiving end of the information how was it set up i cant tell you go ahead kill me if i tell you im dead its the same thing you dont want to die not with that pretty bike lying there and brandnew swords in your vault it aint worth dying for believe me and i dont want to kill you too much paperwork tell me talk to me kenji goddammit the man took a deep breath i was approached by a lowranking yakuza some six months ago he gave me a hundred thousand yen for what i said he said just for keeping your eye out he knew that i was a collector an exkendo champion something of a scholar of the sword and at narita i was always the one called to inspect and judge blades that unsuspecting tourists brought in or took out without proper documentation and that i was also asked to consult on sword thefts insurance values that sort of thing so he knew that i was at a kind of crossroads of sword information he had a specific sword in mind no he couldnt have known what would or wouldnt come in if anything but they were looking for something big something that would make a splash they turn up now and then as more and more swords are returned as people look at the things they have in their trunks as collectors and foreign buyers become more aggressive and pay more and more samurai is bigger than japan samurai is international now so you saw the sword it was lying on a desk just in from customs a fellow was typing up the license i knew in a second it had historicity to it i made a fuss and demanded to take charge i told them it resembled a certain stolen sword and i had to make some phone calls once i had it in my office i had some trouble getting the hilt off someone seemed to have poured some black tar or something into the mekugiana and i couldnt budge it fortunately i had my kit i was able to knock the pin out with the brass hammer there was even a poem written by someone i dont know who moon of hell that i remember but i was too excited about the sword i didnt recognize the smiths name norinaga but i picked up the crest looked at it through my loupe and realized at once it was the asano mon i recognized the koto shape which put it in the proper time period it was a thrill it was all i could do to keep from jumping up and down it was only later when i researched the smiths name that i realized what it had to be if i had known thatwell i dont know so you called well first i had to make the imprint of the tang i did that quickly then i made the call it was a young mans voice husky strong not the yakuza id first talked to he heard me describe it and left the line for a second or so he called someone another voice came on the line he asked me to describe it he was very knowledgeable he even knew that the asano family crest had changed over the years and had me recheck it to make certain that the one i had was right for the time i told him the smiths name he got very quiet i said what do you want me to do confiscate it no no he said fax me the oshigata and stall take an hour or two let the gaijin wait walk by him several times and note his height his weight his demeanor do you understand we need to know what he looks like so thats what i did i actually walked by you two or three times and once sat near you you didnt notice me i could tell you were angry then i went and called them and gave a detailed description he had me wait another few minutes and then finally okayed the next move i reassembled the sword and went to my supervisor and told him i had been mistaken and that the license was fine and to tell you how moved we were that you were returning it and thats the time they set up to tail me to the yanos i dont know i never heard from them again two weeks later a package arrived i opened it and found three million yen not a fortune but enough to pay my debts buy a shinshinto that had caught my eye i still had half of it left so i bought the bike i dont suppose you kept the package no of course not i destroyed it i had to spend all the cash i couldnt put it in a bank because then id have to pay taxes on it and explain where i got it do you still have the fax number or the original number no i destroyed them too after the murders any names any vocal characteristics any i do recall one thing when the young man went to call his master he left the phone but i heard the name he called isamisama isamisama isami the name would be sama is honorific did you recognize it any swordsman would recognize it kondo isami a great killer from the bloody past many duels and murders many bodies a pseudonym of a fellow with a high opinion of himself also bespeaking a high opinion sama its an inflated honorific higher than san it connotes high rank or special talent as viewed from below the man doing the talking considers this kondo isami highly accomplished and is trying to ingratiate himself bob walked over and fetched the glock he picked it up punched the cartridges out of the magazine then slammed the magazine home and handed the gun back to kishida if i need more information i may visit you again kishida said if kondo isami catches you he will make you tell where you got your information you may be brave and resolute but you will tell him then i am a dead man no whats going to kill you is that damn bike you dont run worth a damn you better get some practice on a closed course i get mixed up in the gears good way to die young and beautiful it doesnt matter i am already dead nah you can guarantee that yes how because im going to find him first im going to cut him down and leave him for the birds yakiba she wasnt the best but she was fast and she had guts he watched her from the second row here in the far western suburbs he wasnt in an englishfriendly tourist zone there wasnt a lot of translation around to help the rich gaijin people lived and worked and died without much thought of americans so the banner above the brightly illuminated mat was untranslated but he figured the swoop of red kanji had to say something like tenth annual womens kendo semifinal match kanagawa prefecture or some such it was in a high school gym like the one hed played basketball in a thousand or so years ago and the baskets were folded back on rollers up near the ceiling the light was harsh and the competitors dashed through it blades blurred in stress and skill most were younger some were older the fans were just as intense as stateside bball parents she won her first bout easily had some trouble in the second and finally in the semifinals went down hard to some seventeenyearold genius who moved so fast she made a blur seem lazy but susan okada had poise and dignity she countered the cuts and tried to get her own in she gave ground then advanced she ducked she thrust she did everything but win she also took two or three hard claps on the side of the mask the sword called a shinai was only sliced bamboo staves held together by twine for presence but not strength but at that speed when it hit it had to feel like someone had pronged a huge rubber band against her head when it was over she bowed to her opponent bowed to the referee bowed to some kind of altar or something of kendo godhood off to one side beneath a dramatic kanji and a couple of framed photos of old japanese guys and finally found her way to a frontrow seat where she crashed he watched boyfriend no husband no gals from the office no nothing she was by herself she sat somewhat dully during a break in the ceremony a towel around her neck her feet were still bare she didnt look particularly feminine she looked like any jock in defeat tired but secretly pleased she had done as well as she had not really ready to leave the world of athletics and go back to a real one where victory and loss werent so clearly defined he squirmed down and sat one seat away from her she didnt notice you swing a mean stick ms okada swagger i thought that was you in the flesh big as life twice as mean jesus christ how did you get in youre on the japanese watch list and they dont make mistakes like that i have some friends in the business they got me some real good papers do you have any idea what can happen to you people keep telling me im in for a big fall you are going to make such an unhappy inmate well they gotta catch me first if they do i cant do a thing for you if you break their law its tough shit buddy youre in their system off you go the embassy will just walk away thats our duty its their law we have to respect it just dont call the cops thats all i ask anyhow you seem to have picked up kendo fast you looked good out there i wasnt joking id hate to have you mad at me with a live blade youd cut me to spinach swagger this is so dangerous let me buy you a beer you look as if you could use one just having been clocked by a seventeenyearold damn i hate it when that happens theres got to be a place around here ill go shower tell me how it turns out the good guys win just like in the samurai movies no here i want to see how far that little bitch who whacked me gets the match had started anew and as bob watched the little bitch kicked ass bigtime it was a workingclass bar a few blocks away and so dark and quiet no one seemed to notice the tall white guy most everyone sat stupefied in front of a tv showing sumo while downing mighty tin kegs of sapporo they found a table in the rear thanked god there was no karaoke tonight finally a waiter came by and they ordered a sapporo for the little lady and a coke for the tall white guy whyd you take up kendo my father was a kendo champ many years ago here before he went to the us for medical school so it runs in the family i guess plus im supposed to meet these people understand them provide little insights to the more important analysts when im not getting drunken americans out of the kabukicho tank this is a good way its none of my business but no boyfriend no husband no it is none of your business i have a career its enough for now swagger what are you up to i have two items of business and i need your help you are putting me at a terrible disadvantage my official responsibility is to turn you in cut a deal with the japanese get you out of here before you do some real harm or get yourself in real trouble i have to do that its nothing personal you seem like a decent enough guy but there is such a thing as duty i know about duty i know you do i looked carefully at your record you left everything in vietnam i get it i respect it it moves me but i cannot let you get in trouble and i cannot let you screw things up for our country over here you understand that sure i understand but let me just tell you a thing or two then you decide what to do oh this should be rich he told her the story his assumptions and where theyd led him leaving out only his quiet alliance with the japanese selfdefense force airborne boys he ended with the motorcycle adventure and the admission of the police officer she was silent for a while i dont know she finally said maybe he just said that to please you youd damned near killed him you were sitting on his chest like a baboon youd technically assaulted him so youd committed about your twentythird felony and since he was japanese he was used to indirection politeness lowered voices discretion you probably scared him so much he would have said anything to get you out of his face maybe so but how did he know about the two sword identifiers before i told him he knew if nothing else that proves the sword was valuable and not some piece of war junk if it was valuable the whole thing swings into line you know how nuts these people are about swords in dr otowas office i felt like i was visiting the pope its a religion again she looked off look give me a few more days he said and just a little help okay i wont break any more laws or beat anybody up or chase them with a motorcycle what is it the officer he said he heard the kid on the other end of the phone call somebody isamisama kondo isami he said that was the name of a great swordsman and killer anyhow i need to talk to somebody who knows yakuza i have to find out who this guy who calls himself kondo isami is i cant just walk into a cop station and ask to see the file on kondo isami you must have a contact somewhere a cop someone in the media some spook or something someone who knows someone who would know this stuff if this kondo is a real guy if he has a past if he fits then weve got something at least a next step if hes nobody if its nothing im on the first plane home i tried i failed no more felonies no bullnose macho marine corps bullshit dont call in any napalm strikes no napalm call me at my office tomorrow afternoon i may have something for you you can stay out of trouble till then sure take a steam bath or something sure and you said you had other business two pieces that was one the child miko yeah i have to know whats happening with her shes in a hospital there are few orphanages in japan orphaned children go to relatives but there are no relatives left so the social services people put her in a catholic childrens hospital shes not doing well theres no one for her she lost everything one night and now she sleeps on a cot she thinks the tin man is going to come and rescue her poor thing i havent figured out who the tin man is thats so sad so it goes on the wicked planet earth nobody visits her not anymore can i visit her not a good idea she needs someone its not possible miss okada dont you want these people they killed a family and orphaned a fouryearold child they have to be punished dont you see that didnt you send me an autopsy report i have an idea in my head this professional objectivity is a game you want these guys as bad as i do i didnt send you anything thats a delusion on your part but its not the serious delusion the serious delusion is that you want to believe that you and i are buddies in this together in a quest for justice no way i work for the united states government which is where my loyalties begin and end dont romanticize me because ill disappoint you heres the reality you have one inch of leash you pursue this investigation for a little while longer if you develop some evidence you make sure it comes to me first last and only if its of value i will see that it gets to the proper japanese authorities and at that point our interest ends the japanese system will deal with it or maybe it wont because thats the reality if you break my rules ill report you in a flash and youre on your way to a japanese prison i would say you drive a hard bargain except you dont bargain at all no i dont you cant go samurai on me do you understand if you samurai up i will have to take you down hard i do not bullshit swagger and i tell you loud and clear if i have to pardner i will bust you up so bad youll wish youd never entered this rodeo the tokyo flash of course she drove a red mazda rx long hair flying wearing aviators teardrop sunglasses she flew through the tokyo traffic like a ninja cursing at the slower veering in and out braking hard gunning too fast rushing through the gears utterly confident in the lefthanded driving it was late afternoon of the following day and when he called her she told him shed pick him up but they didnt go to any reporter instead they pulled into a large building of gray brick clearly catholic from the religious statue in the front yard she drove around the side to the parking lot that faced a playground behind a cyclone fence you stay here she said i dont want her seeing you we dont know what she remembers what her associations are believe me this child doesnt need any more trauma its hard enough he sat in the car as okada disappeared into the building and ten minutes later emerged with the child bob watched immediately he saw the difference where miko had been a force of nature a naturally gregarious adventurous child now she held tightly to susans hand and didnt seem to want to go out on her own susan took her to a swing sat her on it and pushed but in a few seconds the child began to holler they were too far away for bob to hear but he saw susan take the child off the swing and hold her then they walked to a slide and tentatively miko climbed and desultorily descended the gleaming surface but there was no liberation no surrender to the giddy power of gravity it was a glum trip the visit lasted a few minutes miko seemed fearful constricted clinging neurotically to susan who was talking gently to her but without much effect it was almost more than bob could take he found his muscles tensing his jaw clenching and his anger rising i dont care what i said to susan he thought the man who did this to her will feel fear too then i will cut him the woman and the child went inside and bob tried to relax but his mind was too buzzed he wished he had a drink but that would not solve anything instead he climbed out took a few drafts of fresh air and tried to calm down pretty soon susan arrived and they drove off let me ask you something he said as she gunned through the busy avenues when this is over and lets assume im still standing i aint in no jail and im headed back to the states no you dont know where im going sure i do i know exactly where youre going you want to adopt her i am already a father some say im a good one im sure youre a great one moreover you could make her a wonderful home in the west and sooner rather than later shed heal though never completely and shed come back to us and shed become happy and productive and have a wonderful life that doesnt matter what matters connections which you dont have what do you mean its very hard for foreigners to adopt a child in japan first few of them are available im not sure if she qualifies then theres the shape of your eyes theyre round the japanese are disinclined to let a westerner adopt a japanese child unless theres some prior connection its not like china or korea where cute girl babies are a cash crop for american yuppies theres no hope not a whisper not an eyelash suppose your boss mr ambassador used his influence he wouldnt do it for me why would he do it for you i dont have the juice you dont have the juice that sucks it does indeed but the world is full of terrible injustices ninetyeight percent of them cant be helped or fixed this is one of them concentrate on the two percent that can ah here we are nick yamamoto lived in a quiet tokyo residential neighborhood a few kilometers geographically and several universes culturally from kabukicho his was one of those nondescript wooden homes behind a fence that was attached to other homes on either side all of them squashed together like french fries in a greasy bag they had no trouble parking in the quiet neighborhood slipped through the gate and knocked like many japanese males he was slender small wore glasses moved fluidly unlike most japanese men he had blond hair it was thatchy moussed in odd directions and suggested some kind of rock star if you only counted the hair he looked eighteen the rest of him was a man of fortyodd years do you like it he asked susan no its stupid he looked up at bob is she a bitch or what she can be pretty tough bob said you should get her started on me if you want to hear some ugliness anyhow my name is bob lee swagger i like your hair see he likes my hair what does he know hes a gaijin bob and nick shook hands bonding immediately on their mutual fear of the great and wonderful wizard susan okada nick took them into the place all wood floors and luxurious western furniture a seventytwoinch tv hung on one wall broadcasting baseball but everywhere else books were jammed into shelves and framed front pages hung on walls the smell of grilled meat hung in the air nick had just finished dinner a drink nick asked cant touch the stuff said swagger if i do im gone for a month please go ahead okadasan no im working this isnt social tea coffee coke anything no thanks well i think i will if you dont mind nick went and got himself a jug and a cup and proceeded to lubricate himself with small sips of sake he ushered them to the leather sofa and he slipped into a nice barcelona chair nick used to be the tokyo times washington bureau chief which is where i met him but then he was recalled and in a few months got himself fired what was it nick i dont remember plagiarism or bribery actually it was both the cocaine made him do it it wasnt his fault the cocaine made me do it it was my fault anyhow he says hes clean now and hes still a oneman show he publishes writes and reports and lays out the tokyo flash a weekly of a disreputable sort tokyo has hundreds of them his is one of the best if you want to know about brad and angelina or what porn star has just left which studio to go hardcore for two billion yen nick would know but i know some other stuff too hes published seven books on the yakuza and he knows a lot more than hes published id be dead if i published what i know you sound like just the man i need said bob well ill try i owe susan for something in dc so try me kondo isami ohhhh im impressed which one kondo the original or kondo two the sequel i guess the first to start you probably couldnt understand the second without the first im all ears nick poured himself a little more sake he turned off the tv fished among his cds and found one and popped it into a player soundtracks from several samurai movies swaggers seen a lot of samurai movies too many he has the toshiro mifune disease well swaggersan im a writer so i believe in mood this is the right music for this story he took another swig on the sake westerners cant really appreciate the dynamic between shogun and emperor that played off and on in japan for three hundred years i wont bore you with it in detail but we had this weird system of a showy but powerless emperorgod on a throne in kyoto and a guy in armor whod fought in a hundred battles and outthought everybody else running the show in edo they never got along it came to a head in the middle of the nineteenth century when aggressive outsiders began pressuring japan to open up and trade with the west the shogun opposed the move the emperor embraced it more or less and that set the clans awarring the emperor as i say lived in kyoto the shogun in tokyo ill call it tokyo instead of edo just to keep it simple im very simple said bob but so far im with you a lot of proemperor roninmasterless samurai who despised the shoguncame to kyoto and essentially turned it into dodge city it was violent terrible a city of anarchy the year is roughly eighteen hundred sixtytwo in tokyo the shogun was embarrassed that he couldnt keep control of the city where the emperor resided it made him look foolish so a lord sympathetic to him and certainly with his permission hired a militia or maybe youd call them vigilantes or regulators something cowboy a gang a posse an outfit whatever they called themselves the specially chosen ones which in japanese is shinsengumi they were ledwell there was a lot of turmoil in their own leadership as there always is in japan but eventually with the help of a really good bloody assassinationby a guy named kondo isami big guy tough guy ran a dojo out west very ambitious so kondo and his shinsengumi set out to tame dodge they did it by killing its been in a thousand movies but you probably remember either band of assassins or when the last sword is drawn saw em both poor toshiro gets beheaded in band i guess he was kondo thats right kondo isami is definitely the mifune part thats what happened to kondo when the emperors clans won and the shogun was replaced but for a long time in kyoto kondo was the law and he and his boys were the bloodiest mob old japan ever saw they killed and killed and killed kondo himself probably killed a hundred men in sword fights he was your truegrit samurai love him or hate him so any man today calling himself kondo means to scare you and frighten you and communicate to you that he is willing to kill that he even likes to kill and kondo isami two bob asked ive never seen his name in print supposedly it appeared only once and a few weeks later the reporters head was found mounted on a tripod of golf clubs outside his paper a tabloid called weekly jitsuwa it caused quite a stir the three clubs were the eight and nine irons and the number three wood yakuza of course is slang derived from a card games losing hand which is eightninethree nobody knows who he is only what he does hes an elite yakuza assassin with a very small team of highly trained men who favor the old traditions they still kill the old way with the sword youll have to explain that to me bob said for a westerner it seems bizarre i suppose but in certain applications the sword is actually far more efficient than the gun if you dont mind a lot of sloppy blood around these guys spend their lives working on it and get very very good they can take you down as fast as a gun its an extremely lethal weapon and they have a butchers knowledge of anatomy they know exactly where to cut you or if they have to pierce you to empty you of blood in a split second they cut your lungs and take out your air supply they cut your pelvis and shatter your support system they cleave your brain and it all goes dark you dont even feel the pain you just go down in a heap and best of all no noise you can have a nice little battle a good triple assassination a oneonone to the death assured that no cops are going to show up nobody knows until the next morning when they notice all those pools of sticky red stuff in the gutter here look at these he went to a cabinet pulled out a file and handed it to bob they were autopsy and crime scene photos of men dead by sword on the slab the nude bodies had oval openings the size of footballs sometimes hard to see because the skin sundered wasnt white but usually mottled red black and green not from disease as bob initially thought but from the dense almost obsessive tattooing that marked the bodies but the cuts were visible once you focused on them amid the dragons heads and wolves yaps and kanji characters they exposed a butchers festival of sliced meat inside visible now only because the blood had drained the cuts were gigantic and deep and permanent theyd empty the sack of fluid that is a human body in a second in the onsite photos of the rubbedout of the underworld the distinguishing feature was not the black suits and shoes not the sunglasses not the twisted postures of the fallen or the occasional lopped limb or split head but the blood the lakes and lakes of it each body sat like an island in the middle of a red sea it lapped everywhere spreading in satiny luster as if by some mad kings imperial mandate this kondo isami came on the scene about five years ago an underboss named otani was having trouble with a chinesesponsored hotshot in kabukicho and was bedeviled by one individual in particular bedeviled as in cut really bad kondo isami introduced himself to otani by sending a business card and a head it was very effective as otani rose so did kondo specializing in the impossible the discreet the hard to do evidently unlike most of the yaks he is not tattooed he has to be brilliant socially adept and completely presentable but even so there are weirdnesses many whove met him have not seen his face he goes to great lengths including masks or theatrical lighting arrangements to prevent certain people from getting a look at it but hell meet others very casually it is said he goes dancing or clubbing suddenly for no reason he doesnt care if anybody sees him now what the hell could that be about sometimes hes shy sometimes hes not maybe thats all there is to it no theres more nothings simple about this guy he has brilliant sword skills hes at the level of almost transcendent technique that some of the legendary sams achieved like musashi or yagyu his boys may not be quite so advanced but their internal discipline is tremendous only once has a shinsengumi guy been taken by the cops and he committed harakiri in the station with a fork before he talked he turned out to be a street gang kid whod evidently been talentspotted by kondo brought into the unit trained and disciplined they found him soaked in his own blood with a smile on his face otherwise they specialize in the hard to do enormously violent there was a rumor some chinese gangsters were going to mount a move against boss otani and the shinsengumi took them out in about thirty seconds in a kyoto inn where the group had gathered for recreational indulgence they caught them in the lounge the swords came out much faster than the berettas and they danced from man to man in seconds cutting kondo himself split a chinaman from crown to dick cut him in two top to bottom amazing strength but more you have to know the art of cutting he does then they left no witnesses look nick said bob i think kondo has a new client i think he took out philip yanos family stole a sword of some rare value that had come yanos way and now hes got some plan for the sword that i cant figure out so can you ask around see if you can find out who kondos working for and what hed need a special sword for and why would he have to wipe out the yanos why couldnt he just send a burglary team in crack the vault and walk out clean or even buy the damned thing not that come to think of it yano would have sold sure i can ask but im getting something out of this im getting a scoop thatll make me the man in the tabloid game and even get me back in the respectable rags absolutely nick be careful okada said ill be careful meanwhile swaggersan learn to fight the eight cuts the compass no longer held four directions there was no longer a left or a right that updown stuff gone totally as for colors numbers signposts any markers of a universe to be navigated rationally vanished instead all reality consisted of the eight cuts there were only eight cuts never more never fewer tsuki migi yokogiri hidari yokogiri migi kesagiri hidari kesagiri migi kiriage hidari kiriage shinchokugiri or thrust side cut left to right side cut right to left diagonal cut right to left diagonal cut left to right rising diagonal cut from right to left rising diagonal cut from left to right and vertical downward the headsplitter he stood sweating the very sharp blade in his hand so that his concentration wouldnt wander a mistake with a thing so sharp could cut him badly and he already bled in small quantities from a dozen brushes with the yakiba the tempered edge of the wicked thing doshu paid the blood no mind the message was if you work with live blades you get cut thats all no big thing get used to blood it goes away or it needs stitches and theres nothing in between migi yokogiri the bastard commanded and bob obligingly performed the downward right to left cut not a slash not a lunge not a thrust a cut kire kire the man yelled at him cut bob realized there was magic to the japanese in the word it wasnt like cutting classes or cutting the rug or damn i cut myself or dont cut corners all those little metaphorical indulgences on the principle of the sharp thing encountering the soft thing the sort of expressions a society might create that had never taken blades too seriously to the japanese the word cut had special significance you didnt toss it about lightly it was almost a religious term with a sword you cut to cut was to kill or to try to kill the weapons were meant for that purpose only they were deadzero serious no jokes no jive no sport no fun in their way they were as meaningful emotionally as loaded guns and possibly more so because a gun could be unloaded but a sword never could left diagonal cut right sideways cut rising left diagonal there were only eight of them but everything depended upon those eight if you could not master those eight you had no chance no no angle all wrong angle bullshit angle must be perfect go slow how long had this been going on it felt like the crazed exercise at parris island back when parris island meant something where you were on a seventytwohour field exercise and nights bled into days which bled into nights until you were so aching you thought it would never end and your movements had gotten stupid with fatigue what was your name where were you from but thats what got swagger through nam three times so as much as every second of it sucked hard and long it was somehow worth it you had to do it rising left diagonal no no blade bent no feel the small man came behind the sweating gaijin and with vicelike fingers took his arm through the motion controlling his elbow controlling the angle of the blade which had to be precisely aligned to the angle of the cut else the whole process broke down you got a blown cut and the sword torqued its way from your grip or at least took you out of timing so that your opponent could get in and cut you bad no not cut you bad the japanese would say bassari kiru cut you through he thought hed pass out but if the little man with the wispy goatee could keep going so somehow could he but it went on for hours and hours and hours until put sword away bob bowed not knowing how or why he found the saya remembered to extend it from him and dropped it over the extended sword whose edge hed turned to self according to etiquette and then returned it to the rack in the deity alcove when he turned doshu was tightening a men around his head and had already gotten on the body padding come come now you me fight fight hard you kill me with wood good cuts make good cuts bob must have groaned all he wanted was a nap come on only do for six maybe ten more hours then i give fifteenminute break bob realizeda rarity a joke hmmm he found out quickly that he could fight or he could cut but it was damned hard to do both he was as fast as doshu and now and then got his licks in though perhaps doshu was going light on him even if the whack of the wooden edge against his unprotected arms or torso would leave welts and bruises for days but when he hit he hit sloppily when he cut well he cut slow i cant stay with you no stay with sickness sickness of ego no win no lose you must fight in one mind one mind now what the fuck did that mean concentrate but no concentrate see but no see win but no win what language was this stop the man said after a bit you like girls yeah of course remember best time with girl well yeah what come on i cant tell you that when oh ninetythree i hadnt been no good for a long time hadnt been with a decent woman in a long time got in a bad scrape and was on the run and i made it to the house of a woman whod been married to my spotter in vietnam in some way id fallen in love with her picture first she was what i lost when i lost him it fucked up my head so anyway had no place to go and i went to her and its been okay ever since she saved my life and the sex partwell hell it dont get no better think of sex said doshu and cut him hard in the throat ach hey bob shouted think of sex said doshu and whapped him hard with the blade in the right shoulder no bob said its too goddamn private it aint for this i cant think of sex its wrong you fool no japanese think ofthink of smooth smooth what was smooth i dont no think of smooth and what came to mind when smooth was ordered he thought of the scythe he thought of his solitude on the high arroyo the long spring and early summer months the old blade in his hand the suppleness through his torso the way he could only keep it going three hours the first day and by the end when he was damn near finished he could go fifteen sixteen hours at a whack thinking nothing of it he thought of the small tough desert scrub the way that old blade nothing a samurai would look at twice would just smooth through it sending stalks and leaves aflying in a spray with that oddly satisfying whipping sound as it rent the air somehow he found something private and his own and using it he blocked the next cut stepped inside it and cut doshu hard across the wrists knowing that hed purposely missed the wrist guard by a hair so that the blow really hurt the little bastard like hell think of the scythe he wasnt sure when it stopped he wasnt sure when he rested but somehow he found himself outside in the dark rolling carpets roll tight not tight enough roll tighter what the fuck did this have to do with anything why are no why fool no why do do well do right do as doshu say do do do and so he did he rolled the thatchy carpet squares into tight rolls pinned them got twine around them and tied them tight the absurd image of tying off an elephants penis came to him and when he smiled doshu hit him hard with the switch no goddamn joke gaijin finally he got them secured it took a while to get the feel of it but finally he could do it fast enough and when all the carpets were rolled hed accumulated quite a pile maybe seventyfive or eighty now soak what soak goddamn soak what this turned out to mean was loading the carpet rolls into a trough then going to the hose and filling the trough to the brim it was dark what day was it he thought it was the third day though maybe it was the fourth day or maybe just the second who knew who knew when this little bastard was shutting up who knew when it would stop you sleep now till dawn two hours then we cut cut yes no bullshit sword is cut no cut no sword we cut cut well cut hard or i kick you out you hopeless gaijin goddamn you to hell three hours later slightly refreshed but still groggy as hell he found himself in the back courtyard doshu had directed him to load five of the soaked rolled carpets on five heavy wooden bases each with a vertical rod from which sprang a spike the carpets sank on the spike and stood upright like little soldiers tameshigiri okay said bob you watch then do the old fellow took the sword bowed to it withdrew it from its saya then he turned faced the array of five carpet rolls on five spikes ai he shouted and with a speed that swagger almost could not follow he flashed through the formation coiling and uncoiling the blade whispering at warptime just a sliver of light a flash of shadow a sense of willed disturbance in the cosmos and in what had to be less than one second he had precisely cut each carpet roll at about a degree angle talk about your smooth and stood still you do tameshigiri test cutting must cut real pretend all bullshit do it do it now bob bowed to the little god in his sword not because he believed there was a little god in there but because not bowing would be one thing more to be yelled at for unsheathed and approached the closest rolled carpet jodankamae yelled the man meaning on high and being righthanded bob found that position one leg slightly ahead of the other almost a batting stance but not quite as his hands were far apart on the hilt of the weapon and he was thinking of killing ai he shouted and brought the sword down hard at degrees against the bundled material with a vibratory clatter the sword twisted in his hand and seemed stuck about a half inch in the bundle no no no screamed the little man angle all wrong much stupidity angle of edge be same as angle of blade or you get bullshit like that i told you do what i say bob readdressed his carpeted opponent tried to shake his brain free of thought and not feel like an idiot in a bathrobe with a long knife cutting up carpets but instead like a ferocious samurai warrior about to dispatch an enemy the sword seemed to move on its own his mind was blank to results and he thought for a second hed missed completely it was so smooth but then with the lazy grace of the totally dead the top half of the carpet roll fell off to hit the ground again and again and again and again somewhere in there he progressed to twocut sequences cutting one way reversing smoothly by the gyroscopic guidance in his elbows from the center of his shoulders then coming back through it he seemed to be getting it feeling the power in his hands making subtle corrections in the stroke cutting not with arms but with the center of his body that is with the whole weight of the body behind it there was weird satisfaction in watching the carpeting fall helpless before his blade not good said doshu is maybe okay but no time to make good now you can cut a little so tomorrow we teach you to fight floating feeling in thumb and forefinger with the middle finger neither tight nor slack and the last two fingers tight when you take up sword you must feel intent on cutting the enemy no fixedness hand alive i no like fixedness in swords and hands fixedness means a dead hand pliability is a living hand yeah sure easy for you to say thought bob and doshu raised his own sword smoothly and with elegant grace and rhythm a snake coiling to strike a swan rising his muscles in perfect syncopation bob tried to model on him feeling his body fight him feeling ridiculous a barefoot fred astaire with a pretend sword in a gymnasium no no again no thought no thought too much thought what does that mean he tried to concentrate but thought see it would be easier if he broke it down one two three then four five six and i could practice each one and he pinched off the spurt of frustration and tried to feel the move the slow rotation of hips the uprising of the arms that goddamned floating feeling in thumb and forefinger and somehow it was just a little better in one timing swagger said doshu whatever that meant i no talk one timing one timing what did one timing mean make shield of fists i place body sideways okay but keep shoulders level with opponents fists ill try if keep rear leg open swagger like this keep stance same as opponents he tried to do it all and of course could do none of it there was no end no progress no start no finish no lesson plan doshu gave him opaque orders shouted commands to approach nothink as though he were ordering a trainee to drop and give him fifty it went on pointlessly forever fourth day fifth afternoon of first who knew he realized at a certain point the only way to deal with this wasnt to think about it being over dont think about it ending it is not a thing of beginning and ending concentrate only on exactly what is before you do exactly what is stated do it dont think about it analyze it try to learn it just do the fucking thing and do not place it in time or causeeffect or this then that see itthis seemed to helpas shooting you simply have to teach your body the way the body knows the way so that you dont have to instruct it it is on subconscious autopilot theres no particular sense of having mastered a thing its just that all the work is connecting and the body is learning things without telling its owner maybe he was getting it sort of swagger cleans the floor of the dojo on his hands and knees with a soft wet cloth and a pail of warm water he scrubs each and every square inch he goes over the woodwork and reaches spots that have not been reached before he gives himself to this work taking pride in the perfection of it and in cleaning he came across a little corner where a few treasures of ego were on display it was in what he knew to be the deity alcove the spiritual heart of the dojo where the truly supplicant went to worship what swagger saw beyond an indecipherable kanji banner and a few photos of elders who must have founded this particular style or school or way or whatever were pictures from a past full of men and boys and lately girls all were sweaty all in triumph all in gi and hakama and bob always recognized doshu and in some of the earlier ones he recognized his sponsor in this madness dr otowa supremely cool and intelligent in one otowa and doshu stood with a boy who by the cast of his eyes and the wit in his mouth and the sternness in his forehead had to be a little otowa a son with some silly trophy or something all of them sweaty all of them exhilarated it was like a little league photo from the s so far distant in time and place as to be all but unrecognizable all of it however speaking of some unbroken line father to son going back through the generations you saw these photos all over arkansas though usually a dead deer or a baseball bat or a football was part of it instead of a kendo shinai it was the same the father passing on what he knew the boy though distant hungry for it swagger sword now now doshu is a drill sergeant hes a yeller a pressure cooker a demander but its so hard because its not progressive in a western sense theres no feeling of going from here to there the edges of things are blended somewherethe start is indistincthed moved into kata which was a series of moves with the sword a kind of offensive syncopation so that the blade came out flowed around the shoulders to a certain perfect position then was cut with the cut riding a rhythm never just a brute expression of force it seemed to have something to do with wave dynamics a sense of harnessing a blast of energy that would rise from one hip course through the body to the opposite shoulder flow downward into the fists which would then surge in opposing directions bringing the blade through with an amazement of unwilled speed and force all without trying doshu would swing lazily at him with his bokken and bob would block it feel it sliding off his own wooden blade and see how to ride it down and open up a way to the mans innards then turn back and slip into another kata attack and abide in one doshu said migi yokogiri and bob delivered his side cut by the false the true is obtained he also said hidari kesagiri so that bob tried to obtain the truth through a lefttoright diagonal he clarified by adding beat the grass and scare up the snake tsuki and bob thrust trying to scare up snakes then to make it absolutely clear use thought to approach nothought use attachment to be unattached he then tried speed a swagger gift fast good hands he brought maximum speed to a horizontal stroke from the drawnutisukeand youd have thought hed blown his nose on a flag or something no no speed wrong speed bad speed sick swagger no speed no speed it was not the only time the obscure little man seemed really agitated but something about speed annoyed him deeply speed sick speed bad he said it over and over dont think of speed bob cautioned himself if you connect with speed its all wrong no no no slow sure smooth smooth is fast fast is not fast fast is slow smooth is fast be smooth moon in the cold stream like a mirror that was the strangest yet it was what doshu would always come back to opaque cute even some asian cornball thing from an old tv show or other it felt too selfconsciously mystic he remembered yoda from some star wars thing there is no try only do something like that maybe he was some aged fool of a luke skywalker on a strange planet far from home trying to master a little wizards poetry which would only work if you believed it yet he could not believe it at his heart because he was a us marine and what he believed in was obedience to orders obedience to traditions never surrendering and breaking the weapon down to clean it yet he saw that was itself a form of zen or bushido or whatever this little guy was selling it wasnt action it was belief you had to give yourself to it and trust it you had to give up on the you part of you because the more of you there was the less belief there was and the more vulnerable you were day and night flowed together bob never saw the sun not after the first mornings work outdoors he slept in snatches was pulled from unconsciousness dragged to the dojo floor and put through paces some children watched and laughed they thought he was really supremely funny big tall clumsy gangly sometimes even doshu smiled but it did seem a rhythm arrived somehow sometime the moves began to feel all right to him possibly even good the less he tried the better he did maybe it was that he was so exhausted he didnt care anymore but he was learning smoothness doshu stood across from him the bokken flashed toward his face and bob was fast enough to parry and ride the sword down he saw three next steps he could rise off the pinned sword and go for a horizontal cutmigi yokogirithat would take doshu across the chest he could pivot inward getting so close to doshu that doshu was helpless and drive backward for a penetrating strike to the chest tsuki or he could float backward find a new stance and look for another larger opening while he was thinking doshu was cutting doshu had reversed come out of the pressure of the upper blade and stepping away clipped him with two inches in the larynx if the swords had been steel instead of wood hed be on the floor trying to hold the last of his seven pints of blood in his body but he wouldnt be fast enough this went on the combative katas increased and bob got them he saw them he understood the principle saw the opening but he just never quite got there in time fuck he said moon in the cold stream like a mirror the man said bob tried to crank up the concentration but that didnt work he was being beaten severely at every exchange and the blows of the wooden sword were raising knots on his bones and joints his sweat poured off him his fingers felt numb how much longer would this go on and suddenly it stopped doshu drew back from him and looked at him then he delivered a verdict first day eight cuts not bad second day cutting tameshigiri not bad yesterday fighting good today fighting not so good nothing i dont have it today said bob is no dont have today no yakuza say you got today okay now we fight is only now im trying bob heard himself say and waited for yoda to answer is no try is only do but it was doshu who answered you not know enough anyone beat you bob wanted to say but you said speed is sick wanting to win is sick then he stopped why fight him he thought he knows this shit i dont its not up to me to point out his contradictions just go with it he bowed showing humility to his tormentor and saw immediately that this pleased the man bob composed his face into an expression of nothingness is nothing nothing is only void enter void do not exist use thought to approach nothought you sleep now no im fine i can go on no sleep tired sore disappointed confused not concentration you sleep now you come when you wake but then you fight fight sure a match but you must win i will win you must win no win i kick you out i cannot help you nothing you go away swagger die soon anyway no worth helping i will win pledged bob believing he would he liked this little development it was a return to causeeffect it was an ending a climax he would fight he would win he would go on the finality was pleasing doshu bowed bob returned the bow and went off he went to the kitchen where a surprisingly nourishing meal had been prepared he ate it hungrily then the old ladydoshus mother his maid his sister no introductions had been madetook him to a room where he discovered a modern shower she left he stripped and luxuriated in the warmth of the stinging water feeling it soothe his bruised muscles and achy swollen joints then wrapping himself in a towel he found his pallet behind the kitchen someone had covered it with a futon and a clean linen sheet and he settled into surprising comfort he woke sensing light i am ready he thought i will win he found a fresh jockstrap pulled on gi trousers covered them with hakama trousers which he now knew how to tie all the little bows and straps all nice and neat attired he stretched for twenty minutes warming his muscles finally all looseygoosey he put on his gi jacket belting it tight and walked to the dojo doshu awaited as did his opponent you must win said doshu no mercy no hesitation no doubt give all become void i said bob then stopped when he saw the enemy it wasnt merely that the enemy was about four feet tall and about ten it was much worse she was a girl the floating world nick worked the clubs uptown downtown all around the town he did the fancy glassandchrome joints in the ginza the most sophisticated of tokyos nighttime districts it cost him a fortune because the ginza is possibly the most expensive strip of real estate in the world but hed just moved two pounds of pure moroccan white girl to a minor yak offshoot and so he had a big wad of cash in his drawers and he didnt mind spreading it around in search of a scoop that would put his rag on the map bigtime and it would be a scoop too kondo isami the legendary yak killer man of mystery and blood working for a new big boss on a new big plan that would make him in this burg god he loved this filthy town but he had no luck on the ginza strip he worked the gay part of the city shinjukuchome on the principle that a few of the yaks were fairy or went to both coasts they might sneak off here to relax to get off to forget the slicing that was so much a part of their lives and might relax enough so that with a gallon or two of sake they might spill something to a rent boy he might spill something in turn he worked ace and kinswomyn and kinsmen and advocate but no the fags werent talking or if they were they werent talking to him a straight guy with blondish hair and too much money to burn he had no luck either in akasaka another bright grid of streets loaded with bars clubs joints particularly soaplands those slippery palaces of hygiene and blow jobs but not quite as sophisticated as ginza a lot of loose lips in more ways than one in the soaplands again nothing nobody was talking he tried bouncers barkeeps hostesses jazz musicians rockers cops dealers a few lowranking yaks people he knew or who knew of him he spread a fortune around doing all the places cavern club crocodile fukuriki ichiza gaspanic bar geronimo shot bar ichimon hobgoblin tokyo shinjuku pit inn ruby room nanbantei milk maniac love warrior celt xanadu and yellow he got names and places from guys and moved on to other guys other places but generally he got the same warning high town or low baby you dont want to ask about that guy that guys serious if he finds out hell come to call in the night and youll end up cut to noodles i hear you its just i heard a little something id like to lay it out itll lay you out yamamotosan youll die for the glory of the tokyo flash is that what you want thanks bud good luck man he tried nishi azabu roppongi harajuku and shibuya center gai even ebisu popular with the expatriate set though it was almost unthinkable that a gaijin would know something before a nipponese would no no no nothing instead he came upon a yak scoop having nothing to do with anything at all still it was all the buzz and he heard it in a dozen places the yak talk was porn talk almost the same thing the boys at imperial had made some big american connection and were cooking up a deal it looked like theyd be getting western stars blond girls into their product line and that looked promising if they could only get import licenses anyone who got american product into japan stood to make a fortune as the japanese hunger for white women was well known and if you could get white women to do the japanese thingsbukkake subway groping pig snout rings bondage urination fantasy rape teacher airline hostess office ladythe profits would be huge but until now no one had been able to break the ban on foreign product nobody had the juice to get it through customs one man stood against it miwa called the shogun because he was the genius at shogunate av was known for his ferocious interest in keeping japanese porn japanese the shogun worked hard to keep the laws really tight so that any american outfit trying to set up business in japan would find itself ensnared in legal troubles and police harassment it was almost certain he was a nationalist crackpot as were many yaks with business connections and many businessmen with yak connections the shogun was head of ajvs the all japan video society the professional group that represented big porns interests and worked with the administrative commission of motion picture codes and ethics which theoretically regulated the porn industry though it was more frequently thought to be a subsidiary of ajvs by virtue of collateral interest or outandout bribery the key to the shoguns power was his presidency of ajvs which in turn made him the most influential figure of the administrative commission it made him the boss really of porn if he lost that he lost everything and his term at ajvs was up word had it that for the first time in years bribe money was being spread around to the other porn studio execsthere were hundreds of studiosto deny the shogun reelection if imperial took over ajvs they took over the administrative commission as well theyd open up trade with the americans as rich and powerful as miwa was how could he stand against a huge tsunami of american capital ravenous for the incredibly flexible gymnastics of the classic japanese pussy he hated the americans it was more than anything rational it was cultural their product was uninteresting it had no ideas it reflected a society of decadence and softness keep japanese pornography japanese the shogun said thats all the boys were talking about it was like a war was going to break out and maybe it was as both imperial and shogunate av had their powerful sponsors in the business maybe the streets would run red with blood as the two porn giants tried to dominate and set the future nah the porn people may have yak money in them and yak influence but they dont like to go to the blades theyd rather sue or try to ruin each other with unsubstantiated rumors theyd never kill they get too much pussy if you get a lot of pussy you dont see the point in cutting someones head off especially when it might get you your head cut off maybe kondo is signing up with one of those outfits just as a threat a hint of future difficulties nick said to this source a detective on the organized crime squad who knew hes above that crap his thing is the elegant perfect hit hes not going into alleys with hoods and start madly hacking off heads its too common he picks his jobs thats all hed never get involved with porn hes old school hes like all the stiffs who hate miwa for making millions off pussy sure said nick he slid over ten yen notes wow said the cop thats a nice tip you wont tell anybody i talked to you you bet i wont said nick and you wont tell anybody i talked to you you think i want to spend my last eight seconds bleeding out in an alley finally only kabukicho was left he was well known there and it made him feel a little vulnerable but he had no choice he knew this was dangerous and kabukicho was otanis and clearly kondo had an otani connection the wires in kabukicho would be direct any questions he asked would get to the wrong people fast he knew he ought to hire somebody to do the asking for him somebody from out of town so it wouldnt get back that it was nick yamamoto the tokyo flash the clark kent of the tokyo tabloid scene on the trail but he couldnt resist he had that reporter gene he wasnt an elegant writer he wasnt ambitious for power fame or money but he just had to know a little bit more a little bit sooner thats what drove him it was such a highit got you much higher than the white girl which is why he was able to walk away from the white girl for personal use though he didnt mind making a buck or two off her once in a whileto hear something first there was that moment when you knew what nobody else knew god what a buzz what a jolt he began casually with people he knew were so minor they were probably unconnected to anything big anything going on im thinking some kind of realignment a certain guy whos worked with otani on some delicate matters now working with someone else someone big someone from a little outside hear anything i think i know who youre talking about but i dont ever discuss him its not healthy hed cut off my arm and make me eat my tattoos he went everywhere queen bee the sm club mysteria purity le grand bleu momo iro everywhere talking to anyone whores image club performers trannies enforcers bouncers cutters the odd chinaman the odd korean the odd african impersonators pickpockets and everywhere it was the same nothing nothing it was the nothing that had him tantalized there was usually something but the talk about the upcoming election for presidency of ajvs and its implications on the issue imperial versus shogunate av had become so loud that nothing else was being talked about it was as if an anvil had been laid across kabukicho gossip lines but then finallyoh it was so small it was so nothing it was a wisp a leaf in the wind he was in a small club closed to strangers so late it was early scotch was the drink of choice blues the music and the lighting scheme smoke the preferred atmosphere you could hardly see across the room nick threw down another scotch and water turned to the barkeep and said another for me another for dad here dad was a bouncer at prin prin an image club that catered to the fantasy life of the japanese male including studentteacher airline hostess office lady kimono it even had a whole set built to resemble a subway car for those who just had to grope but even in such a kingdom of the dream cum true trouble sometimes broke out and thus a fast big man with good hands was needed his specialty was the soft punch by which he deflated the overly amorous with a thunder blow to the midriff yet left no scars no bruises nothing but a powerful sense of illbeing you didnt hear this from me the thunderpuncher said yeah yeah yeah swear to god not from me swear to god twice i have a bitch shes half korean supervises a shift at one of the handjob joints tough little gal pretty but tough yeah she says all the korean sex workers are nervous because one of their own got disappeared a few months ago i didnt hear a thing thats just it you werent supposed to just here one day gone the next but heres what my girlfriend knows that nobody else knows and she didnt even figure it out till she thought about it the next morning on the way to work she saw a guy named nii some minor hood who somehow got into a good crew and is now off the street nii nii she saw him stagger out of a bar where hed clearly been for hours go into an alley and puke his guts out just puke she swears that when he bent over his jacket fell open and the bottom half of his white shirt was drenched in red lord like hed been at some brutal hacking so who had nii hacked the woman why would he hack some nothing korean whore and then make it go away maybe hes screwy that way jack the ripper that sort of thing or maybe its just kabukicho the odd whore gets disappeared once in a while life goes on boo fucking hoo sure but theres something weird here what was weird this korean whore thing it was somehow set up all the korean girls were talking about it for weeks her boss kept the gal late so she didnt go to shinjuku station with the others she went later by herself and somewhere along the walk to the station real early in the morning she met up with somebody and just vanished the nii thing suggests she was cut hmmm doesnt have to be eightninethree brotherhood yeah it does because the thing was planned somebody with juice got it set up so that this gal could be you know cut from the herd held for a certain time then released to go off and be chopped diced spindled mutilated in private no cops no witnesses it was all planned out and poor nii had the cleanup job he wouldnt have the juice to set it up hes nothing a servant a cleanup kid but hes working for somebody with juice and somebody who likes to cut nick saw it then sure it fit nii would have to work for kondo kondo wanted to cut something it was all arranged via boss otani but why do you remember the date only that it was just after that soldierhero and his family got burned up remember that god that was sad it was sad said nick but his mind was already racing kondo had cut the shit out of someone and nii had helped nii was kondos boy so if he wanted to find out what kondo was up to he had to find out what nii was up to the police records were easy enough to obtain nii takashi joe the photo showed a squat face under long beatlestyle hair the eyes gleamless with a lack of intelligence or purpose the photo was taken when he was eighteen old enough to be arrested the first time rap sheet impressive but hardly incredible breakingentering time in juvie assault robbery carrying a wakizashi a footloose punk hunting thrills and his own death in the alleyways of kabukicho he ran with a street gang called the diamondbacks that meant among other things he probably had tattoos of diamonds on his back with his pals he raised minor hell eventually he did two years hard time for beating a shop owner half to death he clearly was a guy trying to attract yak attention and failing yet two years agohe disappeared has mr nii turned a corner and become a model citizen is he now selling life insurance popeyes chicken nikes porn it doesnt seem likely far more likely hes made that dream contact hes been taken in by somebody cleaned up spiffed up given a haircut hes put on a suit and a pair of expensive italian pointedtoe black shoes hes learned how to tie a tie and cut his nails and now he moves discreetly and invisibly through the world of yak crime violent when necessary but not spastically violent pointlessly violent the violence of sudden rage no now its controlled and deployed by a much wiser boss nii you see nii any word of nii wheres nii hang remember nii that kid nii always gets in trouble ran with the diamondbacks funny you should mention the diamondbacks as i think the new bouncer at the milk was a diamondback for a while nii oh yeah nii okay guy i guess dont know what happened to him not that youd notice him he was what you call your averagelooking guy nothing about him stood out oh one thing i remember yeah he used to like to go to a bar called celtic warrior he always had a samurai thing he saw himself as the last of the toshiro mifunes yeah celtic warrior its in nishi azabu which is how come nick found himself sitting in celtic warrior in nishi azabu on a thursday night alone at the bar nursing a bourbon and water and a headache trying to maintain his sanity as a bad multiracial goth band played heavily japaneseinfluenced celtic war melodies an assault on the ears almost too intense to be described much less endured the joint was typical plastic shit with shields and those ridiculous western knight swords like the old kings used hanging crosswise all over the place and big mockmetallic triangles everywhere crap out of black shield of falworth all hollywood phony all plastic some mooseheads and deer hung on the walls too and there was even a stainedglass window behind the bar it was so camelot or a japanese version of an american version of a story that had never been true in the first place and thats when he saw nii it would have been so easy to miss him it was only the sullenness in the eyes their lack of dynamism that clued nick in the guy had bulked up considerably and cleaned up he now wore a neat crew cut moussed to an inch and a half of vertical a white shirt a dark suit a tie he could have been any salaryman unless you looked carefully at the fastidious way in which the collar of the jacket fitted the broad neck so perfectly the way the suit hung with just the faintest dapple to it picking up a sheen the razorvivid line of the trousers crease their wondrous drape and flow that only the finest silks achieved and the black shoes that seemed so standard but were actually extremely expensive british oxfords worn generally by ceos ambassadors and power lawyers he was in wardrobe trying to pass as in wardrobe his whole manner was refined poised amused confident say hadnt he come up in the world and he wore his kingliness well as nick observed how extravagantly he was treated by the waitstaff and how generouslybut quietlyhe responded he was a happy man nick realized good job plenty of dough to spend the future looking brighter and brighter nick watched the play of the evening occasionally a band member would come over and pay homage to nii occasionally the staff others came and paid honor and were rewarded with a smile or a touch girls too he seemed to be catnip to girls that gangster thing just drives them wild and after a time luxuriating in the pride of having made good nii spoke to a young womanthe most childish woman there nick notedand she trotted off to get her coat and tell her friends she wouldnt be going home with them the two walked out holding hands and nick let a long minute pass before leaving a generous mound of yen on the bar and following he shadowed for a while from across the street and eventually nii took the little date into a nice apartment building and upstairs quickly enough nick dashed across the street and sited himself a little to the oblique so he could see two sides of the structure he prayed that sir lancelot niis place was on one of these two sides and indeed within a few minutes a light on the fifteenth floor came on nick counted windows establishing how far from the corner the apartment was so that he could get into it tomorrow nick got there early he was wearing a wig a dark mop because it occurred to him that it wouldnt do to let the world on to the fact that a blondhaired man much too old for blond hair was stalking a wellknown yakuza killer it didnt take long a mercedes pulled up a black sclass limo and nii crisply dressed for work and the girl looking as if shed had her brains fucked out and couldnt even comb her hair stepped into it and it sped away nick had a little thrill was kondo in that car it was unlikely kondo would pick up his own crew more likely he hired a limo service to round the boys up and bring them where they would do that days business nick crossed the road went to the apartments foyer flashed a credential at the doorman it was quite an impressive piece of paper signifying him to be a representative of the domestic appropriations committee of the diet it was entirely authentic in its original owners name and a kabukicho forgery expert had expertly glued nicks picture on it im taking depositions on the land scandal nick said mr ono that being the first name hed crossreferenced with a phone number listed to that address i shall buzz him sir not if you want to keep your job you wont yes sir and you wont tell the houseboy either i know how these places work you call the houseboy tip him and he gets to ono before i do ono has time to destroy incriminating documents ono gives the houseboy a huge tip and he splits it with you im not stupid sir jojis on fourteen he wont be involved you make sure joji stays on fourteen yes sir nick knew ono lived on seventeen and so he took the elevator up to that floor got out and took the stairway down to fifteen he quickly established the door that had to lead to niis and went down to fourteen he found the houseman a dulllooking korean smoking a cigarette in a closet on break oh there you are joji he said dammit i do this twice a week i locked myself out of my apartment can you let me in joji looked at him dully trying to place him its me nii fifteenohfour come on joji im late if joji hesitated it was only to secure a bigger tip nick slipped him a yen note and they went upstairs joji used his house key and headed back to his cigarette nick was alone in the apartment very nice had nii gone so far as to hire a decorator the place was very much your modern yakuza without frill or kitsch no books but one whole wall given over to a sound system and just about every western rock or rap cd ever cut a shelf or two of shogun avs teacherblowskoichiand oh say naughty naughty even a few blackmarket items involving young girls nii youve got some sick bugs in you there was also of course a tv screen big enough to land a jet on skipping through the apartment nick counted clichés the furniture was black leather and chrome with a few modernist gewgaws here and there crystal sculptures signifying crystal sculpture a horrible and therefore priceless piece of modern art on the big wall another room was the workout palace which explained niis new body the space was half dojo a wall rack held a batch of swords some wood some steel for cutting in the corner lay a pile of tatami mats the bedroom had its own special sort of cliché the mirror on the ceiling threw back the image of the devastated bed sodden and twisted and wrecked stains and the smell of sweat were everywhere handcuffs lined with soothing foam still attached to the bedpost suggested the way the night had gone also a coil of rope lay on the bottom half of the bed so nii had probably done some tying too he must have had that japanese thing for a welltied knot as an aphrodisiac the form of the beautiful young girl bound and helpless before him had done wonders for nii three discarded halffull rubbers lay like squashed snakes on the hardwood floor nick thought oh to be twentyfive again next the closet ten black silk suits each with a swanky italian tailors label three pairs of black oxfords twenty pairs of almostnew nikes and a pile of neatly ironed and folded white silk shirts nick sat at the desk and began to work through it very carefully one drawer had a collection of sports magazines another bank statements which showed the guy was indeed doing very well and other bills dry cleaning mainly rent andwell well well here we have something very interesting it was a series of drawings three diamonds crude and amateurish in the first in the second the diamonds had begun to be subsumed by superior imagery as the new forms obscured the crudity of the original pattern in the third the imagery drawn by a master had triumphed and no trace of the diamond remained the third a kind of design proposal had been signed with a name from a tattoo parlor in shinjuku big ozu nick had once done a story for the rag on big ozu favorite skin artist of the yakuza he was your man for snake scales imitation kuniyoshi faces lions tigers and bears as well as fans scrolls bamboo and kanji all popular yakuza motifs he still tattooed the traditional way not by electric needle but more slowly more painfully by bamboo sliver so now that he was in the bucks nii had hired ozu to craft a design to absorb his noclass streetgang origins as if obliterating his sordid past the big guy owed nick a favor for his piece had driven ozus customer list through the roof including some movie stars and rock singers and he also knew that men tell their tattooists what they dont tell their wives bitches shrinks and buddies kata i am not going to strike a child bob said probably true but she strike you often said doshu he spoke quickly to the girl who began to carefully assemble her kendo armor this interesting doshu said my pupil sueko she will be safe from your blow and armed with a bokken as she short bokken long when she strikes much pain you wear no armor on the other hand with a shinai even your strongest blows will not affect her that is if you are even able to strike her also as you long shinai short yet you must defeat her sir you dont understand i cannot strike a child do not look and see form look at what is close as if distant and distant as if close bob dropped the shinai on the floor no sir i come from a father whose father beat him terribly when he was a child he never struck me and he made me understand one does not strike a child then you must go doshu pointed to the door you do not know enough yet your mind is soft you will die quickly if you stay go back to america drink and eat and forget you are not swordsman you will never be swordsman bob saw how cleverly doshu had penetrated him the man had put him in a situation where his strength and speed were meaningless he could not use them against a child even if he had wanted to something deep in his fiber would prevent him on the other hand he had to win if he didnt win hed failed he would not be a swordsman so how could he win he had to find some way to fight soft he had to anticipate move parry at a level higher than hed ever been much higher and when he saw his opening hed have to take it but willfully disconnect from those things that made him a manhis strength his speed he had to take command of his subconscious and will it to govern him to a smoothness he didnt have a quickness no one had he was trapped i will fight he said but if i hurt her i will hurt you those are the stakes here sir you understand that you cant put her in jeopardy without risking your own ass and dont think you can go aikido on me i know that stuff too ive been in a few dustups here look goddammit bob yanked down the corner of his little stupid jacket and showed the old man a few places where hot metal had tried to interrupt his life span they were puckers frozen stars of raised flesh long gashes healed but never quite vanished relics of a forgotten war i have seen much blood my own and others i can fight dont you forget it doshu was not impressed maybe then you be good against little girl but i think she whip ass bob faced the child she looked like some tiny druid priestess her bokken stout white oak looked like excalibur or beheader of kira and when she drove it into him it would bruise to the bone her head was encased in a padded helmet her face covered by a steel cage the helmet wore two thick pads that flared laterally to cover her neck and shoulders her torso was encased in padding and both arms and wrists as well she wore heavy gloves she looked part goaltender part catcher part linebacker and percent pure samurai they moved to the center of the dojo floor bare feet on bare wood under the wooden struts that sustained the place which felt more like temple than gym swords hung on the wall ghosts flitted in the distance she bowed he bowed five strikes wins also kendo much head i have asked sueko not to hit head unless necessary also war not kendo so any killing strike wins not only kendo targets understood he waited a second permitting no questions and then said guard position bob stepped back to segankamae the standard high guard his sword before him at degrees both elbows held but not locked the tip pointing to her eyes it was a solid defensive position but you couldnt do much with it she meanwhile fell to gendankame with her sword held low pointed down and to the left it was an offensive position quick to lead to stunning blows less efficient for blocking bob tried to find the rhythm that had sometimes been there for him and sometimes not he tried not to see her that is the child instead he tried to see her bokken for it was his real enemy doshu stood between them raised a hand and then his hand fell he stepped in fluidly she countered a little to the left and suddenly like quicksilver she went low to highdragon from waterand he could not get his shinai into a block fast enough by a hair and she slipped her blade under his guard screamed hai with amazing force and he felt the bitter bite of the white oak edge classic yokogiri against his ribs god it hurt he realized i have just been killed by a child with live blades she would have cut his guts out one for sueko swagger nothing rage went through him red and seething he had an impulse to revert to bullys strength flare and howl and race at her using his bulk to intimidate but he knew he wasnt fast enough or smooth enough and that no answers lay in the land of anger she would coolly destroy him she attacked he gave ground and parried two of her blows then being limber and flexible she split almost to ground level and swept at his ankles but somehow the solution came exactly with the attack itself and he found himself airbornehe knew that leaving the ground was a big mistake one of the three aversions to be avoided at all times but in this case unavoidableto miss the horizontal cut and as he came down he tapped her on the thick pad of the shoulder near the neck a somewhat uninspired kesagiri bad cut swagger but still you get point one to one the next two flurries were in hyperspeed he could not stay with her for more than three strikes and she seemed to gain speed as he lost it and each time hai the bokken struck him hard once across the wrist making him drop the shinai once on his good hip a phenomenon known in football as a stinger oh hoochie mama that one hurt like hell sweat flooded his eyes and he blinked them free but they filled with water and the keenness of his vision went he felt fear he had to laugh ive been shot at ten thousand times and hurt bad six times and i am scared of a little girl was it the fear or the laughter or both somehow something began to come through him maybe it was his blurred vision maybe that thing in sports called second wind maybe a final acceptance of the idea that what came before meant nothing there was only now and her next kata seemed to announce itself he took it on the lower third of the blade ran her sword to ground recovered a hair faster and slashed the shinai across her center chest kesagiri she didnt feel it given the heavy padding but doshus educated eyes were quick to make note hai bob proclaimed too late must deliver blow and shout in one timing no point bad call that was kendo this was war but you forget bad calls as every athlete knows and when she came he knew it would be from the left as all her previous attacks had been right to left in the split second she drew back to strike he himself unleashed a cut that seemed to come from nowhere as he had not willed it or planned it it was his fastest best cut of the afternoon maybe even the whole week and he got his hai out exactly as he brought the shinai tip as smooth and soft as possible across the left side of her head and felt the bop as it hit her helmet kill swagger he dropped back going again to segankamae he saw what she had that he didnt it wasnt that she was stronger or faster it was that she got to her maximum concentration so much quicker than he did and her blows came so fast from the ready position he could stop the first the second maybe the third but by the fourth he was behind the curve and he missed it yet the answer wasnt in speed not if you tried speed in the ooofimustdoit way you could never order yourself to that level of performance what was the answer the little monster however had altered her stance she slid into kamihasso issuing from above the bokken cocked like a bat in a batters stance spiraling in her grip as she would not hold it still because stillness was death she stalked him sliding toward him and now that he was tired he knew that hed lost much speed and if he struck first hed be slow and shed nail him for the fourth point then finish him in seconds and it would be over what is the answer he thought backpedaling going through his small bag of tricks and coming up dry oh shit what was he tried to read the eyes could not see them in the darkness of the helmet he tried to read her sword it was a blur he tried to read her body it was a mystery she was just it death the enemy all whod sought to vanquish him and failed coming in this time on a surge of adrenaline and serious attitude sublimely confident aware that he could do nothing but the moon in the cold stream like a mirror musashi said it four hundred years ago why did it suddenly appear in his mind suddenly he knew the answer what is the difference between the moon in the sky and the moon in the water there is no difference they have become one you must become one with your enemy you must not hate him for in anger is sloppiness you must become him and when you are him you can control him bob slid into kamihasso and felt his body begin to mimic hers to trace and somehow absorb her movement until he felt her and in some strange way knew her he knew when she would strike for he could feel the same wave building in himself and without willing it struck first with his shorter sword and would have sliced both hands off had there been an edge to his weapon the sword had done it the sword saw the opening the sword struck all in microtime strike swagger threethree it was like hed found a magic portal to her brain the next strike went quicker still a tap through her defenses to her solar plexus so soft he couldnt exactly recall delivering it but just felt the shiver as the split bamboo splines of the shinai bulged to absorb the impact hit swagger fourthree she suddenly knew rage champions are not supposed to fall behind he had broken her she lashed out issuing from above yet as fast as she was he felt tranquillity as the blade dived toward him in perfect shinchokugiri he turned again without force and caught her under the chin a blow that in a fight would have decapitated her match yelled doshu he withdrew assumed a formal position and bowed deeply becoming her he now loved her becoming her he felt her pain at defeat he felt no pride it wasnt miller time he felt honored to have fought one so valiant she took off her helmet and reverted to child the face unlined unformed though dappled with adult sweat the skin smooth the eyes dark and piercing she returned the bow she spoke she say gaijin fight well i feel him learning i feel his strength and honor he an honorable opponent tell her please that i am humbled by her generosity and she has a great talent it was a privilege to learn from her they bowed again then she turned and left and at a certain point skipped as if shed been let out of school early okay it worked i learned something the moon thing i got it finally tomorrow i will speak certain truths to you i must speak japanese no english you know fluent japanese speaker yes you call i tell this person some truths he tell you yes i give you truth are you strong for truth always i hope now wash floor of dojo scrub water hot wash down all surfaces go to kitchen assist my mother then cut wood okada was surprisingly agreeable she left tokyo early the next morning and rammed her rx into kyoto in about five hours arriving at noon she parked out front and bob whod been washing dishes under doshus mothers stern eye saw her arrive in her neat suit her beautiful legs taut her eyes wise and calm behind her glasses her hair drawn up into a smooth complexity of pins and stays tight like everything about her she came in having replaced her heels with slippers and was greeted by a child then led into the dojo she didnt even look at swagger instead she bowed to the approaching doshu hi bob said thanks for coming she turned oh this ought to be really good then she turned back to doshu and they talked briskly she asked questions he answered she asked more questions they laughed they talked gravely he made policy statements she gently disagreed and he defended his position swagger could hear the rhythm of discussion the rise of agreement the fall of disagreement the evenness of consensus finally she turned to bob you got it all he asked he says im a moron and i ought to be kicked out i thought i did pretty well yesterday i beat a tenyearold girl that tenyearold girl is sueko mori the prodigy shes famous she won the all japan kendo association for twentyoneunders a week ago shes a star if you beat her you did okay that little kid that little kid could beat most men in this country are you ready his annoyance tamed by this information bob nodded doshu says you learn fast you are athletic you are strong with quite a bit of stamina your left side is stronger than your right side and your rising diagonal is stronger than your falling diagonal he does not know the explanation tell him i spent a summer swinging a scythe low to high left to right those muscles are stretched and overly developed well he really doesnt care next he says you have good character and work habits he worked you like a dog if you had a weak character or bad work habits you would not have stood for the grueling ordeal and the humiliation he was very impressed with that aspect of your behavior he thought after the first day you might make a swordsman your mind was right untrained but right well thank him he doesnt require thanks hes not congratulating you hes telling you what is sure but he says it is possible to be too athletic too strong too hardworking the hard worker tends to oversegment the athlete to trust reflex and muscle so though you picked up the moves very quickly you had trouble integrating he said integrating he said becoming one timing i said integrating okay he says that yesterday finally under pressure of the match with sueko mori you integrated your learning curve in that match was extraordinary you went in a nobody you came out a swordsman you must learn to develop that feeling that sensibility it is your only hope so he thinks im okay well thats where he goes a little opaque on me he stops well short of declaring you the next musashi he says you still have problems but he says you have advantages too thus he has an idea of what you can or cant do and how you must operate please go ahead he says you are not tom cruise there is no tom cruise no one can learn the sword in days or weeks except in movies he hated that movie by the way however you have done a great deal more than most okay you must know your weaknesses and strengths and maneuver accordingly that is strategy you have not become a great swordsman you have become an almost proficient swordsman you will lose to any proficient yakuza swordsman you will only win under one circumstance against someone younger who hasnt been in a fight and will panic at the sight of his own blood youre a warrior youve seen blood others and your own blood doesnt scare you turn you to jelly thus you know that in a fight you will be cut you will bleed your opponent may not he will see blood his own or even yours and he will tighten lose his rhythm his concentration he will die you will survive other than that stay away if you fight others you will die you are not strong enough to cover all the sectors of defense the longer you go the slower you will get a good swordsman will play you out waiting for your sword to still or drop for your concentration to falter and then he will kill you in fights you must win quickly one two blows or you will die the longer you fight the larger the chance that you will die you survive not merely on your sword but on your guile in fighting only those you can beat and never those you cannot beat a great swordsman will kill you in a split second he knows bob said he sees where this is going hes telling me i cannot fight kondo doshu heard the name and turned to bob swaggersan he said with something almost but not quite like affection kondo death they roared through the japanese night in her mazda the rush of the wind so intense it precluded conversation maybe there wasnt much to say anyway kyoto was a blur of light behind them tokyo not yet a blur of light ahead of them she kept the red sportster up well over eighty miles an hour driving with calm deliberation all intensity and concentration but after a couple of hours it began to rain she pulled over to the shoulder a car too close behind screeched and honked whats his problem bob said he was too close i should have signaled can you latch the top sure she pressed a button and the rubberized roof came out of its compartment unfolding on an ingenious structure until it covered the cockpit he got it latched without trouble though the mechanism clever and japanese was new to him do you want me to drive you must be exhausted now its raining im fine im a big girl anyway youre just as tired as i am no i didnt get much sleep there thats for sure that old guy worked me to the bone eight cuts eight cuts i havent worked that hard in years you are a hardworking guy she said believe me i know plenty who arent my supervisor likes to cultivate the big picture which means i do the work and hes out on the links chatting up businessmen but i guess its okay that hes lazy because hes so stupid if he worked hard he could really screw up amazing how full the world is of assholes he said anyway have you heard from nick yet no nothing i checked my phone and email before we left ill check again she flipped open the little jointed piece of plastic worked it over its bright glow illuminating her grave face and then announced no nothing yet okay what are your plans you have to tell me swagger im so afraid now that you think youre yojimbo youll go out on your own no i told you id clear everything through you and i will id hoped to hear from nick thats all suppose you dont then ill try and find a private investigator a guy with yakuza connections maybe an excop and well turn him loose on the case maybe i should have done that already i didnt think of it i was just thinking of how to keep that old man from whacking me black and blue a private eye wont work if kondo doesnt want to be found the pi will know it and he will just take your money and conveniently come up with nothing nicks got the guts to ask around i doubt anybody else does then ill go to kabukicho and start kicking in doors on yakuza joints and asking loud impolite questions about kondo that should get me noticed that should get your head delivered to the embassy by black cat courier by monday then i dont know maybe i am overmatched on this one on the other hand youve learned stuff her cell phone rang she checked the number id and said its nick she hit talk hello nick what is but then she was quiet oh hell she said what it was nick but he said susan i fed the dragon fed the dragon what the hell could that mean i dont know but it was also his voice it was full of fear real ugly fear oh christ bob said she dialed nicks number there was no answer the samurai nick had it or most of it he sat in his kitchen under a bright lamp looked at his notes an outline a time line charts of consequences phone numbers the whole thing amazing how it came together how quickly the tattoo artist big ozu had told him of niis bragging about easy street from now on and how he could afford to have his back finished and the horrible crude diamonds hidden in an abstract of classical japanese shape and color and the kanji inscription samurai forever it took some doing and a mighty investment in the worlds best sake but nick finally got ozu to reveal the darkest secret the name of the man to whom nii through kondo was now pledged it was as if kondos clan had found a new daimyo its connection to the ruling powers was now so much more powerful it was a name he already knew miwa miwa the shogun of shogunate av and head of ajvs at that very moment stuck in a power struggle with imperial to maintain command of big porn trying to keep it japanese against imperials hunger to americanize the industry and bring white women in now what could kondo do for this man and of what meaning would a sword a special important historical sword be nick could have left it there the man just wanted the sword because he was a collector this was the mother of all swords to add it to his collection would be but then why didnt he just buy it from yano and why were yano and his family wiped out why were certain suggestions given so that the unfortunate tragedy of the yanos was not pursued with alacrity and instead allowed to drift it hadnt even been assigned to a senior investigator so nick began to look at miwa it turned out there was quite a lot of data miwas career was storied publicized even selfpublicized it was the tale of a poor boy going from nothing to something and conquering japan in a way few men had since the shogun an irony in itself miwa lived in luxury with houses everywhere in japan seven in tokyo two in europe one in vail one in hollywood one in new york he traveled by private jet he consorted with millionaires and movie stars his amorous adventures were legendary how could such a man want one thing more and nick realized that it wasnt one thing moreit was simple survival he saw now how a sword could help miwa and establish his line forever against that the deaths of the yanos was nothing really what was it a mother a father four children you could cut them down and leave them that simply was the eternal order of the universe who were they next to greatness what were they compared to the fabulousness of miwa and the scope of his ambitions what did they weigh who cared for them no samurai would rise to their defense they must yield to the inevitability of it all and cease to impede miwa in his march to glory nick needed a drink he went to the refrigerator and got out a bottle of sake he struggled with the plasticized cap and finally in frustration got out a small kitchen knife sliced the plastic off and poured himself a drink ah the taste of sake so utterly japanese he set the knife down on the table and sat back he allowed himself to take some pleasure nick saw a golden life before him where it would all go his scoop would shock the world an arrest would follow japans foundations would be shaken the worlds journalists pouring in upon him as the scandal reached epidemic proportions his own redemption he would be back after his various misadventures with lady kokain it would be nick heard something a strange sound he didnt know what it was then realized it was some heavy object being laid against his doorjamb and in the next second he heard the crash of wood splintering of the door giving and the sound of footsteps nick knew immediately he scooped his notes up and stuffed them in a manila envelope he had seconds he fought panic then he saw where he could hide them he raced to that spot rolled them up and shoved them in then he picked up his cell punched susan okadas number worried about being tapped tried to think of some unique way to reach her a suggestion a code even that she and she alone would recognize susan he said when she answered i fed the dragon then he turned and saw his old friend nii advancing on him with a pugnacious look and a wakizashi in his hand behind him came kondo and nick had the biggest scoop of his life now he knew who kondo was now he knew why some people got to see kondo and others didnt he also realized they would torture him beyond description to learn what he knew and who he had told and who he was working with nii raced to him but wasnt in time nick plunged the knife into his own carotid and bled out smiling in eight seconds dragons they got there by midnight the traffic in nicks neighborhood was normally nonexistent at this hour but tonight it was terrible four blocks from nicks the lanes froze into gridlock nobody was going anywhere theres a cop up ahead trying to get this sorted out susan said im going to slip out and see what i can see if i dont make it back in time ill meet you at nicks that doesnt make any sense everybody will notice a gaijin ill go you scoot over and stay with the car she got out he moved behind the wheel and waited ten minutes later the car hadnt moved an inch but susan was back as she approached he could see from the slowness of her movements and her downcast expression that the news was very bad she ducked into the seat they burned it like the yanos burned it to a crisp burned the houses on both sides too maybe he got out no she said from far away he didnt the cop said a man was dead a suicide he set his house on fire then he cut his own throat they carted him away to the morgue an hour ago swagger tried not to concentrate on nick poor nick he tried not to feel rage or pain or despair he remembered doshu only now only now yeah right but get me off this goddamned frozen star the alien place where everybody i talk to gets whacked hard and ugly by men of shadow i have never even seen and the game is nothing i understand only now only now think it through she didnt say anything but just sat there for the longest time her almond eyes seemed unfocused maybe she was seeing afar with a closeup eye and seeing closeup with a distant eye poor nick she said at last i think he was finally in the clear smart guy brave guy the best poor guy look im not the boss or nothing but we have to think this through if nick cut his own throat it means kondo isami found him and he knew hed be tortured he knew these boys so he went out samurai i hate to think of that well maam somebody has to think of that so i guess ill go ahead and be the one you know it makes me sick how good at all this you are i understand that i make a lot of people sick im a sergeant its my job we are in a war people are dying people are in danger so lets just figure out a next move she was silent then she said i cant think in this car well go to a coffee shop i have to get out of this stupid traffic the place was halfempty they got coffee at the counter then found a table at the back starbucks it was like being in iowa okay swagger said you tell me if im right youre smart i only went to high school new rule sarcasm not permitted sarcasm out of bounds get it she said angrily i apologize it was stupid it wont happen again okay heres where we are nick found something we dont know what but somehow they heard about it and came after him he gave you a clue so somehow he had enough time to hide what he had and to call you susan i fed the dragon then he cut his own throat knowing that if they got to him theyd torture him and hed give everything up little skinny nick more samurai than any of those boys and heres another thing i have figured out see if you agree okay they didnt burn the place for no reason they figured out hed learned something and they were worried hed left it they couldnt find it they burned the place so that whoever he was working with couldnt find it either theres no point in burning the place otherwise it just attracts attention and the last thing these people need is attention that makes as much sense as anything okay so lets think about the clue nick gave you maybe im full of shit but it cant be that hard he cooked it up in two seconds you said he sounded scared on the phone he knew they were there he hid whatever it was fast he came up with a clue fast and it was something only you knew but what does that tell us it means it plays off something you know i fed the dragon no no susan i fed the dragon not dragons in general not dragons in history not dragons in no poetry or movies or songs but a dragon that susan knows so what we have to do is find a point where three things touch susan nick and a dragon what does susan know about dragons nothing did you ever discuss dragons with him no did he ever mention them to you no never the first time i heard the word dragon from his mouth was last night what was the first thing you thought when he said i fed the dragon oh this is helpful i thought what the fuck is he talking about are there any dragons in your past i dated a couple thats all i was married briefly to one think of what a dragon could be or relate to a team name your high school football teamim betting you were a cheerleaderwas it the dragons i was the head cheerleader it was the panthers ever study uh whats it dinosaurs paleontology archaeology geology no never russian and japanese literature oh thats helpful you can make a lot of dough off that swagger i gave you sarcasm warning number one one more violation and youre on your way to arkansas idaho let me say some dragon things to you you react maybe itll jog a memory fire away flying dragons nothing sleeping beauty nah prince charming no such thing reptiles are dragons reptiles well theyre green and scaly theyre like dinosaurs or big alligators do they have twochambered hearts are they coldblooded i dont know i dont know either chinese dragons no dragons in parades you know people under a long dragon thing wouldnt that be a chinese dragon dragon bones dragon wings dragon tracks dragon breath no no no no flying dragons you said that a gang called the dragons no a triad called the dragons no a flying dragon kick from karate no the sleeping dragon thats a kendo move low to high i know what it is no not that a chinese restaurant called the dragon no saint george no saint andrew no prince charming you did that one already this isnt working well im pretty much out of dragon stuff could it be a picture a movie a book a poem an article a paper a hmmm she said he saw something in her eyes it was that faraway look seeing the mountain as if its close at hand article paper if dragons are reptiles does that make them lizards there are no dragons so cant they be anything well as you said green and scaly that makes them reptiles so wouldnt they be lizards i suppose why its just thatoh its nothing try it what the hell lizards i have something in my life dealing with lizards i may have mentioned it to nick but youre not sure swagger nobody can remember everything theyve said to a casual acquaintance over a fiveyear period of course sorry but you said a paper school paper lizards yeah its a story ive told a few times in embassies and at the department at parties and dinners that sort of thing did i tell it to nick its possible i met him at a party at the japanese ambassadors residence on nebraska in dc about five years ago it was lowkey professional i was supposed to chat him up he was supposed to chat me up there was some drinking i may have told him tell me i had a petty goodgirls ambition to graduate from high school with a fourpointoh average i had to be perfect and for three years i was perfect but my senior year i dropped a couple of points in advancedplacement biology i had to somehow make it up or id get a b and there would go the fouroh so i went to the teacher and i said you know i cant quite make it up on the remaining tests if i ace them i still just get an average of threeninenine in here is there any extra credit thing i could do he was a good guy he said well susan if you wrote me a paper and it was really good on an original subject i dont see how i could keep from giving you the a that you need so badly the joke is i have no feeling for biology i just learned it by rote i had no gift at all and there was nothing i was capable of writing an a paper on i had no inspiration no anything so i went to the national geographic bound volumes in the library and just paged through them i was looking for something that might stimulate my imagination and you found something a lizard a big ugly lizard god it was ugly it was about ten feet long green carnivorous with a forked tongue it was limited to seven islands in the west pacific near java the biggest island was called komodo and so the lizard was called a komodo lizard so i became an overnight expert on the komodo lizardthis is before the internet i should addand i did a paper on its prospects in an environmentally diminishing world i got the a i was valedictorian my parents werent disappointed and i went on with my life as planned except of course i didnt marry jack mcbride but thats another story the funny thing is that lizard really helped me by being so interesting so the joke is now and then if im happy and ive had a few drinks and people are toasting i toast my toast is heres to the lizard and they all laugh because its so unlike little susan okada the asian grind with the fouroh average who never makes a mistake i may have told that to nick after toasting the lizard i think a bunch of us some japanese journalists and some state people i think we went to a sushi place in georgetown that may be where i did it and thats it yeah but see heres the thing that creature is also sometimes called a komodo dragon maybe i toasted the dragon and thats what nick was thinking of komodo is that a japanese word it sounds japanese no its indonesian i think it sounds japanese os lots of syllables it could be japanese it does sound japanese it actually sounds like a japanese word very common kamado kamado simply means stove or oven its an inverted ceramic bowl or something in the old days most japanese homes had one its a grill i suppose you grill fish in it usually small its they both let it lie there on the table a few minutes passed then bob said nobody would see the correspondence between the word komodo the name of the lizard and the word kamado meaning grill unless they spoke both english and japanese well that would be you and nobody else would have a komodo in his background except you now the next question would nick have had a kamado he shouldnt have they all have microwaves now but he did have one dont you remember how his house smelled the night you were over he had just eaten and hed grilled some meat he grilled his meat in a kamado now nicks sitting there somehow he knows hes about to get hit its over but he doesnt panic not nick hes a cool hand hes samurai all the way he knows he cant get out but he tries to preserve what hes got which is some documents thats how he beats his killers wheres he put them he slides them into the kamado maybe theres a liner and he puts them under that in the bowl then he calls you and hes afraid the phone is tapped and the only thing he can think of is that little anecdote from your first meeting and the correspondence between kamado and komodo that only you would see he was good at puns he said he loved to write his headlines in his rag because he liked the puns the more outrageous the better i think said bob tonight im going to pay a visit to the ruins of nicks house you tell me what im looking for and where itll be ill find it if its there the shrine it was one of his favorite spots the secluded cemetery at sengakuji the shrine of the ronin behind its gate and its imposing statue of oishi here lay the remains of the whod forged through the walls at kiras slaughtered his bodyguard in furious battle then beheaded the old man it was as sacred a spot to the japanese imagination as was possible and when the shogun visited he always called ahead made certain that the place was closed for maintenance so that he would have it to himself and that the usual clouds of incense smoke from the hundreds of joss sticks lit by supplicants would have cleared away here was naked bushido it expressed itself on many levels the bodies themselves after the mass seppuku were buried at the highest level in buddhist fashion a thicket of vertical grave markers and ceremonial wooden stakes weathering in the rain and snow one couldand many didbuy a bundle of joss sticks to lay in tribute to the or their lord asano who was here also which was why a low smoky vapor lingered among the headstones below was a museum for tourists a courtyard wide and gravelly the shrine itself the typical buddhist structure of timbers and white plaster of a pattern spread widely across the whole of asia under a tile roof with tilted corners an archetype that on a thousand chinese restaurants had become a cliché here alsobetween the courtyard on one level and the cemetery on anotherwas the stream in which the men had washed the head that night so long ago here was the vengeance and the loyalty of the retainers here were men whod die before theyd live with dishonor their headstones lay alongside the paths under the shade of trees here is where they presented kiras head and got a receiptpreserved and displayed in the museumfrom the priests noted item one head item one paper parcel the above articles are acknowledged to have been duly received here is where they waited to be arrested here months later after theyd been ordered to commit seppuku here is where their bodies had been taken the skylines of shinjuku or central tokyo were far away fall was upon them a chill bit the air soon winter would arrive the leaves russet red goldbrown orange fell to earth in riots of color he drew his muffler tighter against his neck pulled his cashmere overcoat tighter looked and saw bodyguards with receivers in their ears all around youre sure the shogun asked kondo not totally no but im sure that he had nothing set in type as we found no page proofs im sure he had made no attempts to talk to police sources because weve canvassed as far as i can tell he spoke only to a few sources the tattooist and several uh experts in eightninethree affairs all have been spoken to all have owned up all have been remonstrated against they will not betray us again for yamamoto im sure he had nothing except the possible suspicion that you and i had made an alliance still its disturbing at this time particularly when things are so delicate and hanging in the balance most likely sheer coincidence someone saw something and maybe this reporter had a hunch he was well versed in the ways of our brotherhood he knew who to ask and he made some slight penetration into our business alas his hair was blond like charlize therons and someone noted him and sold him to us we dealt with him that is the order of business as for any information he may have learned it almost certainly died with him youre sure well lord of course there is no sure im as sure as i can be but i can only talk in probabilities we never had a conversation with him his actions precluded that he knew the conversation would have been unpleasant but theres no evidence at all he was working for someone and no reason to believe he was he had as yet assembled no product we examined his house seriously before lighting it no notes no story no time line he had nothing but suspicions and they died with him that is the highest probability but what were the probabilities that spruances dauntlesses would catch our fellows on their decks refueling why would they come in at just that precise moment the probabilities were infinitely tiny yet the americans fell out of the sky and in five minutes we lost three carriers three hundred of our best pilots and the war i think about that moment often kondosan that moment not one minute before not one minute after the carriers were turned into the wind their decks laden with refueling planes it was japans moment of maximum vulnerability during the war and in that moment the americans struck the americans cheated they had the codes i hate the americans they always cheat they are stupid and blundering and it doesnt matter because they cheat i cannot protect you from gods apparent enthusiasm for the americans lord he makes the unexpected happen as midway proves for all time i cannot protect you from it just as no one could have protected nagumo from spruances dauntlesses no one can protect you from buddhas whimsy gods will the indifference of shinto or the sheer random drift of chaos in the universe it sticks its ugly little head in at the most inopportune time but we have done everything rational to protect you and to make this thing work and to get you what you so richly deserve the only thing we cant protect against is bad luck the americans always have good luck said the shogun bitterly now they think they can take over my business that i am vulnerable that my planes are on the decks refueling they are cheating by spreading millions around its so unfair lord it will not happen thats what kusaka nagumos chief of staff said too said the shogun glumly i understand therefore i have sent my best men to the polishers and the security at that point is perfect these are the boys who visited yanosan and his family with meall sworn all bloodied all who have cut before there isnt a man in japan or even the world who could force the issue at the polishers it would be one against six and six of the best nii leads them and he will willingly give his life he is true samurai your head is safe and so is mine sword of life it was the next evening past midnight at the same roppongi starbucks he put it before her it was slightly scorched but he gently opened the manila envelope and one by one spread the documents out onto the table of the coffeehouse he could see nicks handwriting in kanji running up and down the pages of vertically lined genko yoshi and no one saw you susan asked i done some crawling in my time i got in close as i could then crawled past the other houses till i reached the ruin i didnt even have to go inside i found the kamado buried under some fallen timber close to the firstfloor patio in the backyard half the bowl remained intact and the envelope was in the lining between the charcoal chamber and the outer wall it slid right out i got my ass gone fast total time onsite less than five minutes just in case anyone was watching i doubled back three or four times nobody could have stayed on me way i ride im in the clear susan applied the full force of her intelligence to the pieces of paper now and then shuffling them now and then righting them trying to make them assemble into coherence bob sat quietly aware that he no longer existed finally fifteen minutes and another cup of coffee later she said okay he had it most of it does it make any sense yeah in fact its simple its just business the guy were after hes a businessman is he ever his name is yuichi miwa called the shogun his fortune is based on pornography he is the founder of shogunate av miwa got into dvd early and onto the internet early thus he made millions which reinvested in newspapers television software games and so forth became billions but now he may lose it someones coming after him someone is its an upandcoming av company called imperial imperial evidently has american money behind it they want to take over the japanese market import american women blondes mostly to perform in japanesestyle porn the government has forbidden that for many years but if imperial can get it done their profits would go through the roof miwa happens to be president of something called ajvs the all japan video society the industry rep group i guess a kind of mpaa for dirty movies ajvs works with the government and controls the regulations of the business under the shogun the government has kept american product out of japan miwas term is almost up and theres an election hes won unopposed for sixteen consecutive years but now hes opposed imperial is spending a lot of money and is running a slate theres dozens of smaller porn studios and theyre either going to follow the shogun or the usurpers from imperial see its like a lot of industries and regulatory agencies if you control the industry association you really control the regulators in this case something called the administrative commission of motion picture codes and ethics really as it functions ajvs controls the commission it is the commission so what does the sword have to do with any of this miwa has to win that election if he loses it he loses everything so he needs to do something bold to make himself a beloved institution he has to transcend porn and become a hero to the people at that point the smaller studios and imperial cannot vote him out hes too big he in essence becomes presidentforlife he maintains control of ajvs and the commission and ipso facto the industry he prevents the american product from coming into japan his business thrives imperial withers and dies now i get it yuichi miwa understands how swordnuts the japanese are bob said it will be his publicity masterstroke he will make a bigdeal announcement that he found the most revered relic in japanese history its the actual blade used by the great oishi in the attack of the fortyseven ronin against lord kira in seventeenohthree its the thing that took kiras head hell get all kinds of media he becomes a hero thatll establish him as the great man of the people who cannot be replaced the little guys know if the election goes against him it will be a complete loss of face for the industry they cannot afford the shame i see yes she said and now it swings into line thats why the yanos had to be wiped out it had to be entirely a miwa production his campaign his search his recovery his restoration his presentation all under his auspices the yanos mess up that narrative and show the random nature of the process hes not a campaigner for the culture hes just a rich guy who bought something off someone so they had to be eliminated entirely and their deaths had nothing to do with anything else in their lives they were just the people who were in possession of the sword they were in the way they had to be destroyed for the welfare of the shogun their property confiscated so the yanos had to die bob said so some creep could win an election for king of teacherblowsjohnny well you could have put it more eloquently but essentially thats right suddenly a deep melancholy seemed to overtake her the terrible thing is i think he wins why do you say that now its too late he has the sword its protected its guarded its hidden no one could ever get it back theres no connection to the yanos hell announce it in time for this ridiculous porn election get all the media get the tv and the print and win his little contest i dont see a legal way of reaching him i suppose you could give a statement to the police identifying the sword as the one you brought into the country i suppose we could find police factions that would see it our way i suppose yagyu munenori sixteen thirty the lifegiving sword it is missing the point to think that the martial art is solely in cutting a man down it is not in cutting people down it is in killing evil forget it swagger i cant i didnt come across no ocean to give a statement its moot you forget we dont even know where it is you cant be toshiro mifune because theres no place to be toshiro mifune ill find the goddamn thing in ten minutes swagger youre proposing a felony i have a duty to report you to the authorities i always told you this okadasan you know the authorities have been bought off by miwa there aint no authorities in this case its just you and me redneck and cheerleader we do something or that little girl is orphaned and theres no justice in it at all its just a thousand years of history all over again big guys with swords cutting people down and laughing about it that sword is locked and guarded in one of miwas seven estates around tokyo i can find it in ten minutes swagger it is locked and guarded in its being polished what the blade needed restoration he would hire the best polisher in japan to bring out every last wiggle of the hamon on the blade it has to be beautiful dont you see he cant take the blade into his mansions because the sword polishers equipment is heavy stone and the art of polishing a sword is delicate slow it demands total concentration somewhere right now within a few miles of us theres a sword polisher working the blade to perfection under heavy guard the polisher probably doesnt want to work on the sword but miwa and his pal kondo isami dont care what the polisher wants they dont care what anybody wants she looked at him so what are you proposing i go to the shop i get the sword thats a plan ill knock on the door ill say please give me my sword back they will say no that is not possible hmmm i will say im afraid i must insist we will have a spirited discussion you are insane youre not a samurai the samurai left town youre stuck with the old white guy theyll kill you swagger think of something better she couldnt battle susan dropped him at the museum at pm and it took some yakking to get by the guards and the receptionist as the institution was about to close but dr otowa himself okayed the entry came down and met bob at the elevator and took him through the somber gray light the solemn quiet the dignity of the displays up to the office where they sat among swords the swords behind glass in a humiditycontrolled environment were everywhere except for the large black door that signified the presence of a vault inside it there had to be more swords doshu said you learned well he was very impressed with your skill and character he is an astute judge of men well sir glad i came through and that he thought i did okay now you said an emergency yes sir i think i know where philip yanos stolen sword would be well it would be in the restoration process that being the case odds are its at a polishers because thats the longest hardest part of the process i could kick around making phone calls and visits for a week but i know youre wired into that world you could find out in a second you want me to make some inquiries sir the way these people operate i dont think an inquiry digs them out these people want this blade restored now they want someone good working crazily to finish the project in a certain time frame theyre running low on time they have a schedule to meet they also have to restore the furnishings and scabbard all at the very top of the art what that means im afraid is that theres a polisher who has suddenly disappeared hes no longer a part of the mix he hasnt been heard from and his friends are getting worried hes out of the loop hes gone off on an unexpected vacation something like that i know a journalist who would know please sit down while i email him the doctor went to his terminal logged on bob sat and let his eyes trace the curve and shimmer of the beautiful blades that surrounded him while hearing the tappitytap of keys you could watch the comings and goings of designs as the curves got deeper and deeper then began to shallow out and rise toward a straight line or you could watch the tsuba change from a single iron ring as rugged as a viking oar to an elaborate goldetched carving elegant too beautiful for its ostensible purpose which was to keep enemy blades from sliding down ones own to cut the hand off you could watch the points elongate or shorten the grooves on the blades reach farther and farther double up shrink then disappear altogether you could see the play of hamon sometimes feathery and insubstantial where the hard tempered steel of the edge met the softer embracing steel of the spine all in all it was quite a display and even knowing as little as he did bob had the sense now of a secret world kissaki yokote mitsugashira hamon shinogi shinogiji hira ha mune munemachi hamachi mei mekugiana nakago nakagori that was it tip to butt and he knew what each meant it was a universe mr swagger yes sir the best sword polisher in japan is in london restoring blades for the victoria and albert museum the second best is in san francisco giving a seminar for your countrymen but the third the third the third used to be the best only time eroded something of his skill he is eightyfour his name is tatsuya omote i have his address yes sir youre on to something i fear that three weeks ago he abruptly canceled an appearance at a conference in osaka hes missed the deadline on a commission he undertook for a shrine in hiroshima his shop doesnt answer and he no longer responds to email this is very troubling to his friends but he did send one email several weeks ago telling them not to worry he was fine he simply had an allconsuming project bob looked at his watch it had taken seven minutes what now the doctor asked should we call the police i think thats likely to tip people off rather than set anyone free i think ill drop by and see whats going on that could be dangerous are you armed no sir of course not come with me the doctor led him to the vault and spun the dial of the combination lock he pulled the door back and bob had the sense of a great weight shifting on ball bearings bob didnt enter because he wasnt invited but the doctor emerged in a few seconds with a white weapon gendaito wakizashi modern short sword it was forged in nineteen fortythree by one of the leading showa smiths at the height of his powers it was meant for the smiths son who was then an officer on an island called tarawa obviously the son never came back after the war the smith remounted the blade in the civilian furniture you see now which is why the saya the tsuba the same the saego are all white white is our black it reflects grief the doctor held the sword before him cutting edge up and with his left hand removed the whitelacquered saya the naked blade gleamed in the light beautiful and hungry the old man told me when the museum acquired his collection that this was the sharpest strongest blade he ever made it was made with love to protect his son but his son never got to carry it the old man gave it to me with the idea that i would give it to my son to protect him but my son never got to carry it he died early also so i give it to you because you are a son too i give it to you in hopes that it can protect you with its magic ingredient of a fathers love so this is really a gift to your father from me i hope he was a good man he was a very good man said bob good im praying that you dont have to use it but if you do i know this it will cut swift and fast and true they drove through the suburbs then farther into the farmlands surrounding tokyo the famed kanto plain mountains loomed on the edge of vision including the great one fuji gigantically big the clear fall day revealing it vividly it looked like an advertisement for a japan that only existed in the minds of western tourists you dont have to do this he said i have the bike i could have found the place on my own suppose you get cut suppose youre bleeding and you cant work the bike suppose someone calls the cops and you have to run away and have no place to run youre just a big gaijin and theyd pick you up in thirty seconds no swagger i do have to do this i cant believe im doing this itll be fine and thats why youre carrying something under your jacket something about the length of a sword otowa gave it to me just in case swagger you are going to be so dead or so locked up and my career is going to be so over i can handle this yeah the white guy with a week of training uhhuh dont forget i beat a little girl at last they found it on a nondescript street in a nondescript town a nondescript commercial building with a few groundfloor shops one of them clearly closed its curtains drawn the others in the line sold noodles sushi sex movies liquor and software games but the sign over the closed shop simply read nihonto thats it thats tadaaki omotos place god it looks like a place where they sell cheeseburgers tatsuya omote cant you get the name right youre very edgy ms okada i know what you need how about some shopping its time to go shopping what sure that always settles folks down lets go buy some stuff he got out of the car and strode across the lot a few steps behind she followed he went straight to the liquor store by the time shed caught up to him he had bought a pint of jack daniels this is a very fine drinking whiskey he said would you like some swagger i he paid about yen he held the bottle out to her but she shook her head no okay in a few minutes now what about a nice cup of noodles mr swagger have you had a breakdown really i no maam i am fit as a fiddle i do think we should have some noodles you are we should watch for a while before i go into my toshiro imitation come on so the samurai and his companion went into solos noodlerama and had a nice cup of noodles each and a diet coke it was actually pretty good they sat near the window what do you see she asked well i see a large mercedes sclass black very shiny parked in the lot your standard yakmobile you have no idea how many of them are in there we should call the police yes and what do they find an old man polishing a sword in the presence of several thugs in suits where would the crime be would the old man say these guys have terrorized me into polishing this stolen sword he would not because he fears retaliation and rightfully so the cops would say how is this sword stolen has it been reported stolen and of course wed have to answer we have no proof except for the crazy accusations of slim whitman here who claims its a sword he brought into the country a few months ago then the yaks would say and heres the license for the sword which they got from yanosan so the sword goes back to the yaks were booted out of town and mr tatsuya mr omote dammit cant you get anything right mr omote gets back to polishing meanwhile the cops discover my passport aint no good and im arrested that dont sound too good to me come on she led him back to the car get in she opened her purse a rather large green leather bag and handed it to him he looked inside and saw the grip of a small pistol its a sterile chinese makarov i got it from a couple of the agency clowns on the fourth floor its loaded with some magic candy called threeeighty hollowpoints whatever that means it had the boys all giggly take it no swagger you cant go in there with just yes i can this game is called swords its their game i beat them at it and that makes me the winner and throw that thing into tokyo bay itll get you sent to japanese womens prison for the next fourteen years and they dont have no kate spade bags there i hope you survive long enough to tell me how a bumpkin from utah who sounds like johnny cash before the cure can identify a kate spade im from idaho out of arkansas my daughter made me buy her one i also bought one for my wife you must do okay they aint cheap sure you wont have a drink the question wasnt even sane enough for an answer she just looked at him he took the small flat brown bottle out of the paper bag cranked off the cap smiled toasted her and said cheers then he poured some of it into his hair and ruffled his hair with his other hand he splashed some on his neck he handed her the bottle he pulled down his tie and unbuttoned four buttons on his shirt and tugged his shirt up on the left side the foundation of the way is always deception yagyu sixteen thirtyfive he said all right swagger i give up go to your little war see ya he said stepping out ill be waiting for you to come out that is if you come out nii was amazed the old man barefoot and in black like some kind of hipster with glasses so big they blew his eyes up like a bugs sat on a low stool on a platform he looked like some kind of musical performer he was bent over the long curve of steel his eyes fiercely concentrating his left hand securing the blade against a block of wood his right gripping a piece of flat stone a water bucket sat at his right foot he was in the part of the process called finishing it had been a long slow war starting with foundation stones and the full power of his imagination and his stamina and his knowhow all applied against the blade in an act that was part love and part hate and all art the blade for its part fought him stubbornly its scars were proudly earned in forgotten battles its surface was stained by the blood of many some justly taken some not so justly taken it did not want to return to the ceremonial pristine in the war the old mans weapons were stones there were dozens of them each with a specific name a specific grain a specific face to be used in one place in one directionarato kongoto binsui kasisei chunagura komanagura uchigumori hato uchigumoritoand the art of the campaign was in knowing the place for each in the timeconsuming ritual the old mans face was as wrinkled as a prunes but his hair was long and fluffy he looked more like a saxophonist than a warrior but a warrior he was and the glitter of a million particles of ground steel were the evidence of his attack even if every hour he vacuumed them up for an unvanquished particle could slide between stone and blade and cause havoc nii watched as something beautiful emerged with slow precision out of something mundane what had seemed to be a common chunk of old steel smeared spotted with rust nicked and hazed was now an elegant sweep of colors and textures it didnt shine not really it glowed as if lit from within somehow as the old metal was removed the blade regained its life and power it was alive now the smeary milky line or smudge really of the hamon ran along the whole edge the tip kissaki was cruel and perfect a couple of inches of eloquent steel that would penetrate anything the thicker metal of the mune had a golden quality substantial and embracing solid yet giving rather than crudely strong and brittle and the two grooves bohi they were called gave the blade an aerodynamic purity and would make it sing as it cleaved the air it looked hungry for blood it was one of those objects that was sacred and profane at once it wanted but one thing to drink more blood and yet it was also an expression of the distilled genius of the people of the little island who had created and spread its soul and spirit across half the known world nii knew none of this he could express nothing of it he felt all of it it had gotten his mind for once off little girls the old man worked steadily without seeing anything but the sword six inches from his face he was in his way too cool to see the gaudy fashionobsessed yaks of the world he communicated to them that though loud and forceful they were trivial meaningless he lived to work he accepted that day some weeks ago when they had simply shown up with guns and a large pile of money you will do this work this work and no other you will keep it secret from everybody you will be watched you must finish by the first week in december it cannot be done in that time yes it can kondo had said to him you must know who i am and what i am capable of i would hate to spill your blood life death its the same to you in your eighties but perhaps not to children grandchildren wife friends and so forth we will leave a big hole in this small town glumly the old man accepted the new now he gave himself up to the blade what choice did he have really and now he was done a final burnishing an inspection the full power of nii someone called nii looked up he saw that the old man had stopped polishing something hed never done before that disturbed nii then nii heard it someone was banging on the door who is that fool he demanded its a gaijin its some stupidlooking gaijin fuck well ill get rid of him nii said you back to work but for some reason the old man would not work he stared at nii with great intensity as if seeing him for the first time or as if he knew something then he smiled he spoke for the first time in months this is going to be good he said bob knocked hard on the door he heard stirring inside he tried the lock felt it rock in the jamb but not give much at all he knocked again harder hey he said hey goddammit open up i got a sword needs polishing something stirred inside and through a small crack in the curtain behind the glass he sensed a flash of movement what he could see was otherwise unimpressive shelves and on the shelves what looked to be shoeboxes and in the shoeboxes what looked to be stones some flat some jagged all different in shape texture and color hey he shouted again goddammit i have a sword you want some money i have money for you dont you want to work come on goddammit open the hell up he did this for about three minutes loudly a drunken gaijin who would not go away not soon not ever i hear you goddammit i hear you in there open up goddammit then he saw movement in the dark which soon resolved itself into two husky young men in suits they had impassive faces and one wore sunglasses they were about each and lacked necks they had short arms that hung at a slight bend because the muscle was so overdeveloped it kept the arms from straightening they came to the door and bob heard clacking as the lock was released the door slid open an inch but no farther and both young men crushed against the opening with their full linebackers weight and strength giving no quarter hey i you go away shop closed no one here he gone go away now please come on fellas he said with a drunks belligerent stupidity i bought this thing for a thousand bucks it needs a shine this is the place aint it guy told me this place really shines em up good come on lemme in lemme talk to the fella he held up the whitesheathed whitegripped wakizashi go away now please no one here polisher gone go elsewhere not your business here guys i just want no business for you here the door rocked shut and bob heard it click the two men edged back then disappeared into a rear room he stood there a second then reached into his pocket and pulled out a metal pick the clickings of the door had informed him that it was a standard throwbolt a universal fixture easily overcome he slid the pick in the keyhole felt the delicate mesh of tumblers and levers wiggled this way and that and felt each tumbler eventually give up its position he put the pick away took out a plastic credit card drew that up the door slot to the bolt and began a steady upward tapping gentle and persistent urging the bolt off the springdriven lever that secured it in two seconds with a snap it yielded to these probings and popped open he stepped into darkness hey he said anybody home goddamn the door wasnt locked you must be open he heard shuffling from behind a curtain some whispers he bulled his way back with a lurch stepped through the curtain spilling awkwardly into the larger rear room and there beheld a strange spectacle a small old man with hippie hair and spaceman goggles sat on a platform with the blade which bob recognized instantly by shape and length though now it gleamed like some rare piece of jewelry six extremely husky young men all in black suits three in sunglasses all holding sheathed wakizashi stood across from him he almost laughed they looked like the notre dame interior line doing an en masse imitation of the blues brothers suddenly the japanese began to jabber an excited stunned blast of men talking over other men until finally one yelled loudly and seemed to take command he leaned forward and sniffed you drunk you go home go now go fast just want to get this here sword shined up so its like that thing there damn thats a pretty one sir can you make this one like that one he held the sheathed wakizashi and waved it about theatrically the leader spoke harshly and two of the linemen came at bob bulking up as they came their muscles bunching as they tensed their right hands forming fists whoa whoa he said no rough stuff fellas please please the bruisers halted then he looked at the old man who looked back he winked the old man winked a frozen moment transpired as everybody took stock eyes flashed this way and that hands tightened on hilts breathing became harsh bob was suddenly quiet wary eating them up it was a moment that seemed to last an eternity one could compose a haiku during its exquisite extenuation bob looked at the fat leader the one hes polishing the one you killed the yanos to get i want it back and i want you knocking at the door to hell then it was over as if no concept of quietude or peace existed anywhere on earth it was time to cut the two closest yaks went for their swords to cut down the american but they were not fast enough iaijutsu the art of drawing and cutting it was called nukitsuke with his offthecharts hand speed swagger got the blade outit clacked dryly as the transaction between blade and saya occurredand into a horizontal cut called crosswind by yagyu onehanded the cut landing with his front foot the body weight behind it for power so full of adrenaline he drove through both of them hidari yokogiri his old friend cutting horizontally from left to right he thought hed missed for he only felt the slightest resistance and for a nanosecond had an image of disaster but the disaster was theirs the blade slashed deeply in a straight line gut to gut through suit shirt undershirt skin fat entrails viscera spleen liver whatever and just kept on going in a mad driving arc leaving in its wake nothing and then everything the blood pushed out with a good deal of power it didnt explode as in too many movies and spritz as though a sprinkler had projected it it just sloshed out heavily along with two breakfasts and it kept on coming seemingly gallons of it in a red dump that literally sounded tidelike as it splashed against the floor one stricken man went down like a sack of potatoes fallen off a truck the other just stood there stupefied stepped back trying to hold his guts in and then sat down to die without thinking bobs blade rode the energy high and came up into issuing from above better known in the country of its origin as kamihasso and he watched as another man sword high in jodan came galloping at him under such circumstances most men would panic a huge angry bulgedeye man of immense strength charging full bore the sword raised in his hands as he gathered strength to unleash a sundering blow he was every mad psycho in every bad horror movie ever made he screamed dramatically but with eyes that saw far as though it were close and close as though it were a distant mountain bob waited until the clumsy drive of the blade announced itself and then with a quick small movement slipped to the left and shimmied into safety exactly as trailing blade he cut the big ones belly open deeply and the sword never fell this one instead kept going by him turned eyes now spent of rage and filling instead with horror at the immense damage that had been done to him went to one knee dropped the sword then toppled clumsily forward bob saw none of this he turned and watched as the three remaining split up two going one way the third the other as they came around the old man on the platform who watched the craziness largely indifferent bobs lizard brain understood without actual thought that fighting one was better than fighting two so he rotated to the left coming around to meet the lone man on the left side of the inert polisher on his platform his enemy was a slight but older fellow not given to panic or stupidity his long face intent the sword before him he approached steadily just watching waiting for bob to give him an opening which bob of course didnt so he attempted to make one his sword flashed laterally the classic kesagiri shoulder to navel left to right on the diagonal but from somewhere at a speed that has no place in time bob read the cuesthe eyes are the key to reading the actions of the mind the light or gleam in an opponents eyes is as revealing as the movements of the rest of his bodyand rose to take the cut on his own blade rode the blade down and then reversed it was ukenagashi the flowing block and he absorbed the energy from his opponent seized it then unleashed it snapping through with his wrist and extending onehanded in as small a space as possible throat at the end of the arc the point was traveling at stunning speed generating amazing footpounds of energy taking all of swaggers strength and distilling it to one small cutting edge results looked unpleasant even shocking but worse than that was the sudden noise the man made a hideous wailing as air and blood were forced from his split larynx and the realization of his own inevitable doom overcame him causing his lungs to expel their atmospheres forcefully but he did not fall by one of the eccentricities of a dying bodys last spurts of energy his knees locked and he stood still arms fallen sword lost spewing blood from the cut throatthough in a kind of gurgly fountain style not the patented toho sprayas his eyes looked at nothing then finally like a tree he fell hitting the puddled blood so hard he kicked up splatters some of which suddenly danced across bobs face the old mans face and the ceiling the other two came around the old mans platform and confronted bob separating slightly they dropped into classic tachi relaxed standing the sword before them as they slid through the blood steadily on small floating steps eyes steady faces intent not angry or frightened bob found himselfwho the hell told him this was bestin kamehasso sword higher almost a batting stance but relaxed trying and finding it within himself to stay calm as they rotated around the front of the platform and came at him smoothly he looked for his opening they looked for theirs and had the advantage because they could spread out on the sound idea that he could notbeing no musashifight in two hemispheres at once and whichever he chose to defend the fellow assaulting from the other would deliver the death cut he knew without thinking it he had to be the aggressor he didnt come to a conclusion it was just there before him as certain solutions to certain vexing problems had come to him in his last fight against the little girl he lunged left but it was a feint meant to drive back the one on the left it worked this fat boy stepped back for just a second but seeing that move the fellow on the right foolishly interpreted it as commitment his heart filled with greed and visions of victory and reward and he drove forward with the horizontal cut the same crosswind bob had used earlier bob knew it would come and pulled a move of his own devising which was to thrust forward low one knee plunging the other backkicking flattening and lowering him he felt the opponents sword roar by his hair fluffing it and he cut the man through the knee with a strike that felt slow and weak but that must have been strong and powerful for it got through the one leg completely and the leg fell away to the right the onelegged man hopped in screaming horror some things cant be stopped however and the blow was too good it continued though much less forcefully and bit halfway through the other leg trapping itself for a second as the man fell he was dead a brilliant move against one opponent it was a foolish one against two for now the fat one whod done all the talking had the advantage and surged forward flowing smooth and soft like a beautiful riverfrom somewhere bob noted that he was well schooledto deliver the diagonally angled kesagiri issuing from above to split the crouching gaijin i die thought bob knowing that he was so far behind the curve hed never make it even if he felt his blade pull free what happened next he saw clearly both his opponent and he had forgotten one thing it didnt matter to him because his center of gravity was so low and his supporting feet were so widely spaced one before him and bent the other stretched behind him and straight but the venue in which they fought was slick with blood fat boy on the other hand had a high center of gravity an unstable one in the slipperiness of the blood he lost his footing his sword wavered oops oof omigosh ulp he struggled with his balance the rhythm and timing of his cut utterly wrecked and by the time he delivered it at about onequarter speed bob got the blocking blade even turned to take it on the mune of his sword found the leverage in rising and pushed the enemy blade away and finding himself in a nicely setup shimobaso with the blade now back and the hilt forward simply drove the hilt with a monstrous thud into the fat ones face just below the eye he fell like the giant in jack and the beanstalk all dead weight kersplash in the blood throwing splatter everywhere with one hand he waved the sword and bob hit it hard with the lower half of his own blade just above the tsuba and it flew away with a clatter he leaned close smelled breath saw sweat and teeth and venting nostrils and fearful eyes and hit the guy exactly where hed hit him before with the hilt it was a solid drive that echoed through his bones the fat boy groaned and lay flat bob stood breathing hard he flicked the blood off his blade heard it splatter against a wall he realized he still gripped the saya all his blows had been onehanded against all doctrine he turned and walked just a few feet to the amazingly contained old man cut down said the old man not just cut cutting no good blood no death soon enough cut down christ swagger thought everybodys a critic better footwork feet all tangled said the hipster you fight two no good go to dojo get sensei must learn you lucky you use up all luck this life and next life no more luck for you you must practice with sensei much work to do you got that right said bob i definitely was lucky now old fellow give me what i came for and i will get out of your way fat one not dead i get that ive got some words for him okay very nice sword here honor to work on highlight of life i appreciate much here let me finish sword he applied himself to it for another minute held it to the light pronounced it done and put it into a red silk bag it seemed to take him hours to tie the fucking thing and swagger saw that he had to do it just right finally he handed it over no touch blade with stinky merikan fingers i understand that youll be all right fine i go stay with family in sapporo can we drop you anywhere no i catch bus its fine bob turned he walked to the supine form of the one survivor amid the carnage as the polisher mr omote put on some slippers got a coat on and made ready to leave bob poked the live one felt him stir then groan the eyes finally came open blinked as he reacquainted himself with unpleasant memories of the last few minutes he touched the wound under his eye from which blood flowed it had already started to puff and would soon grow to the size of a grapefruit hey you said bob listen here or i will do some more cutting on you please dont hurt me why not its fun oh my face said the guy who bob now saw was about twentyfive or so his mug issued blood tears and snot from a variety of damaged sites pay attention you have to deliver a message all right sure joe my name aint joe asshole see this he brandished the red silk sword bag its the sword its my sword i have it back kondo isami wants it bad fine ill barter it to him he has something i want when i get it ill give him the sword i hear you in three days ill take a classified in the japan times personals column itll be addressed to a yuki itll be in alphabet code from the nobility of failure in english not the japanese translation got that whats that a book you moron way too hard for you hell know what it is can you remember that sure jsir sir i like the adll give a location a park probably hes to meet me at that park alone the following evening he gives me what i want ill give him what he wants sure said the fat yak then his eyes clouded over with puzzlement you want money a pile of it i dont give a shit about money clownsan what you want then his head bob said tell him to bring it kondo kondo was fascinated he said that he actually said that yes he did nii tell me again tell me exactly i asked him what he wanted from you he said his head tell him to bring it cheeky fellow he was oyabun they were in niis apartment a private nurse in employ had stitched and bandaged nii up as his own fellows cleaned the sword polishers shop after dark making sure the bodies and all the carnage on the floorand the chopped legwere neatly disposed of nii stitched swollen returned to his own place and a few other men of shinsengumi lingered about darkeyed darksuited wary kondo however was lit up by the situation something in it pleased him immensely he could not keep a half smile off his face describe him again please american tallish not gigantic when himself composed not one for excitement his eyes were very still he knew where to look how to move hed killed before blood the ugliness of the cuts none of that had any effect on him tell me again how he fought details this time nii tell me everything he was shrewd we were stupid you were stupid nii i was stupid he smelled of drink he was wild and loud and out of control his hair was a mess he was any gaijin you see in kabukicho full of wild plans knowing nothing i was thinking how to get him out of there without incident without the police becoming involved i knew it would be difficult i missed something what he picked the lock i heard it lock yet in seconds he had penetrated it he was an experienced man i sat there trying to remember whether or not we had locked it now i know we had so he deceived you with the drunk act completely it was brilliant if he had announced himself at the door he would have greeted six men blades out hearts strong instead he got close with his absurd drunken act then in a flash he was sober and deadly he cut down the first two in one stroke expertly delivered his best cut of the fight i think though the cut he made on kamiizumi was also excellent anyway they were gone and lost in the first second johnny hanzo in the next johnny hanzo lost his head and charged and the gaijin quietly let him come then pierced him in the second before johnny could unleash a cut and johnny was gone in less than three seconds three men were out of the fight through the narration kondo sat quietly in rapt concentration as if he were working on serious visualization skills he was seeing all this in the dark space before him so then there were three yes and all three could not get around the old man on his platform so kashima and i went one way and kamiizumi the other kamiizumi was the best of you six the oldest the most experienced hed been in fights before he was magnificent i thought for certain he would achieve victory or cut the man so bad the victory would fall to us but the gaijin anticipated his cut took it and used it to propel himself into flowing block threw it off then came through with something id never seen before a kind of onehanded drive amazingly fast he had to anticipate which way kamiizumi blocked would break perhaps it was just luck but he hit kamiizumi in the throat unbelievable such blood it was did he watch him fall no oyabun instead he turned immediately to face us as we came around the old man he went under kashima and cut him through the leg he sundered it thats when i had him his blade was momentarily trapped in kashimas second leg because he didnt anticipate getting through so easily and had lost a firm grip on the sword as it bit into the second leg it was a blown cut trapped tying him up but then kashima toppled and his blade came free you had him i did him below sword down myself above driving full strength toward my target his neck if you try for speed you do not achieve speed it must be notry always notry it was try too much try oyabun i slipped lost my footing and when i was back in timing he was ready he took it slipped it and drove his hilt into my face it wasnt pretty it wasnt the last was sheer improvisation on his part very sloppy i think he was running out of energy how old was he advanced not ancient oldish late forties maybe early fifties maybe older very brown from a lot of sun as if permanently tanned thinning hair his face never got passionate except the last time he hit me i think he enjoyed that what a man this is so wonderful i cant begin to tell you i have never fought six what were his strengths spirit he was very hard of resolve he was not scared excited scattered angry or anything he was empty of everything except his professionalism i like that he was fast he was very fast his hands particularly i will say however that he fought much better against one than against two he easily defeated every single man he fought he vanquished the first two with nukitsuke he only faltered when the two of us moved in where he made a mistake and i almost had him excellent oyabun may i be permitted to commit seppuku now no no no theres too much to do i have nobody to spare as your second we dont have time now i am so ashamed i cannot face my parents ghosts my friends our other shinsengumi i can hardly face you dont be an idiot it would accomplish nothing plus ive seen it and it hurts its very messy you may have to die nii but at least let it mean something now look at kamiizumi and the others their deaths were helpful they exposed the strengths and the weaknesses of the man they died well you conveyed the information that they unearthed to me its valuable information if you had cut yourself after the fight and killed yourself that information never would have reached me what good would have been accomplished i survive only to serve when no longer needed i will express my shame and try to get my honor back with the tanto yes yes if thats what you want you could also go off and get laid and maybe that would be enough for you anyhow nii listen to me i am going to get a police artist i want you to describe this gaijin to him very carefully we will spread a net to catch this fresh fellow and get our sword back we have to get him before the night of the exchange because if he controls the exchange were at a great disadvantage we dont know who he represents what his goal is i cant believe its simple katakiuchi westerners dont understand the concept of vendetta maybe sicilians but no others not really hes playing an angle and he could have snipers on the roofs a team of fellow professionals its too big a risk to run id hate to go into that blindly nii nodded solemnly he tried to remember details to assemble them in his mind so that he could assist but he was aware that something wasnt adding up then he saw what it was oyabun yes nii said kondo who was already striding out to make his arrangements even as he debated whether to tell the shogun of this disturbing yet provocative development im sorry i regret i did not recognize what i realize now i know who this gaijin is you do yes oyabun i regret that i did not recognize him at the shop but it was so out of context that i stick to the message nii yes oyabun i once sat two seats behind him on the jr narita express i followed him from the yanos to narita the night we that gaijin yes oyabun that would be the gaijin who brought the sword in yes he was with the yanos he stayed at their house for several days he was close to them yes now i recall i watched from just across the street that last night he hugged them all i followed him to narita and watched him check into the flight i watched him pass security thats when i left to join you and we went to the yanos with kamiizumi johnny hanzo kashima and the others he knew the yanos kondo said again deliciously then it is katakiuchi oh splendid i suppose we could contact the inspector he would know the name we dont need the name now i know how to catch the gaijin ill reel him in and cut him down and when its over i can have my seppuku nii you shouldnt be so selfish think of your oyabun not yourself find dignity and worth in service then if youve been good ill let you kill yourself but as a treat nii first im going to get you a nice little girl orders with your typical order of yakitori you got four edible even delicious skewers of meat and one so repugnant it was almost kind of funny the smell of chicken cooked on an open fire filled the place no popeyes ever smelled so good at other tables men and women were lustily gobbling their food bob had eaten the hearts hed eaten the meat hed eaten the gizzards hed eaten the other strange things but he was left with the knees well maybe they werent knees maybe they were elbows whatever they were twisted little chunks of glistening sinew even the flames of mamasans blazing fire behind the bar hadnt blackened them in truth in the curves and folds of each there seemed to be some gobbet of protein and maybe a truly hungry man would scrape it out and go to town but he just didnt have the heart instead he looked across the smoky space across the rude tables and floor halfexpecting toshiro to come blasting in and start cutting people at any damn time until he caught mamasans eye pointed to his empty plate and somehow communicated the idea bring me another order touched his empty coke can to request more of that too she nodded he could have been in the fourteenth century except for the coke he went back to the puzzle before him he almost had it hed been scouting tokyo by bike for a nice private place for his meet with kondo and finally found just what the doctor ordered hed have the man travel to asakusa and walk the street outside the shrine where all the stalls were for some reason that zone closed early and went largely unpatrolled hed meet him there in the street and he wouldnt jump until he was satisfied the man was alone not trailing a crew of goons he didnt want to fight six again or more likely thirty for kondo would travel with his specially chosen group now he worked on his code primitive as it was finding the right words in the nobility of failure marking page number paragraph sentence and word so that the message was shaping up to read dear yuki denoting page second paragraph fourth sentence third word it went on and on gibberish if you didnt know the key decoded it would read asakusa temple street midnight tonight alone he felt her before he saw her she strode in manfully as per her style and sat down he didnt look up for the longest time im almost done with this i think ive got it set up just right it was several minutes before he finished and when he came out of his zone of concentration there was another interruption as mamasan brought the plate of skewered chicken parts and another coke asked susan what she wanted and received only a drink order then scurried away you shouldnt be anywhere near us tomorrow night in case it goes bad but i wanted you to see what i was doing i told you id keep you in the loop then finally he looked at her and knew instantly that something was wrong all right he said whats up you havent said a thing you remember i once told you i wasnt a bullshitter yes im not going to start now ill be honest and blunt all right so no matter what you can never say she misled me oh christ susan i dont like where this is going im closing you down swagger its over its finished time to go home he didnt feel anger or rage or betrayal she had never exactly pretended to be his pal in this and had always told him shed do what was best by the rules of her duty not her feelings and shed never quite bought into it the whole warrior thing on the way back from the fight at the polishers with the blood soaking his pants and spattered on his face shed said nothing except did you hurt anybody no but i killed five men oh god it wasnt no movie it was like a pie fight in a sausage factory i didnt like one goddamn thing about it but they would have cut me deep as i cut them so i did what i had to the old man is fine and has left i have the sword so thats fine the yaks will clean up once they find out because they dont want no cops nosing into their business itll be fine no mess she had only said no mess this time now she said this can go one of three ways i hope you see that it is best if it goes the first way and that would be you give me your false passport you go out with me to a government van and you are driven to a us air force base not far from here i have arranged or rather with some dickering and string pulling the ambassador has arranged for you to be flown home gratis by the united states air force outside all channels you will be landed in california escorted to the gate and permitted to exit thats the end of your involvement what has happened over the past few weeks here in japan ceases to exist there was noi cant even remember what your passport says thomas lee there was no thomas lee hes gone youre gone its over you go back to arkansas idaho whatever meanwhile the ambassador finds a way to slip a report on your findings that i have written to certain sympathetic japanese ministry of the interior officials it will give them some guidance i hope they act on it and i feel certain that within the ministry of the interior there is a clique that will want very hard to proceed it may take some time and there will be no illusion of progress for a long time but eventually as the japanese sort this out they will proceed and the thing will be done and those who killed philip yano will be punished in any event since we now have the sword the immediate plan of the man who styles himself a shogun has been disrupted he will not win reelection to ajvs he will be undercut and destroyed so thats something and in the end we will achieve justice you know that wont happen way number two exactly the same outcome except that you make some sort of ruckus or act irresponsibly four large gentlemen enter the restaurant they happen to be former south korean special forces guys who handle contract work for certain embassy departments when needed they are very tough something like seventeen black belts among them lots of combat they subdue you it hurts then you are taken to the van only you are wearing handcuffs and are severely bruised et cetera et cetera et cetera swagger dont do that dont put yourself and me and them and everybody through that it would be such a waste so foolish so pointless it would break my heart okadasan possibly at this moment i aint too worried about your heart way number three you bolt theres probably a rear entrance to this joint and you are as we know an extremely capable resilient creative man particularly in dark arts like escape and evasion you break out you get away and try and finish on your own then we snitch you out to the japanese authorities a tall gaijin with no japanese language skills i dont like his odds maybe it takes two days maybe it takes three but they catch you divine that your passport is fake read our signals and see we are not interested in helping and off you go before the judges no juries in japan second offense off you go to prison five maybe ten years what a waste what a foolish sad absurd ending what a way for a great hero to end his days no wife no daughter i will come visit you until i get bored and then i wont anymore what about way number four he said there is no way number four way number four you send the big boys back to their cages we proceed i only need two days more i meet kondo isami on the street at asakusa at midnight your four rok special forces guys handle security so there aint no interruption kondo and i fight that is one of the things i am trying to prevent he will kill you maybe or i will kill him if the first happens you go ahead with your plans on the other hand if the second happens you go ahead with your plans maybe the japanese eventually bring down yuichi miwa maybe not the point is the man who killed philip yano and his family is dead justice has been served or someone has died trying to do that justice he failed but at least he tried somebody called it the nobility of failure thats the world id rather live or die in no its not going to happen it has been decided we cannot have a dangerous violent american citizen in this country illegally mixing it up with japanese criminal elements in ways that cant be controlled and could explode into scandal damage death anarchy humiliation at any moment we need the japanese we need their cooperation in a lot of bigger battles theres a war going on in case you havent noticed philip yano noticed he lost an eye and a career in that war what happened to phil yano and his family was a tragedy and an atrocity but the wicked wicked world is full of tragedies and atrocities and they cant all be avenged other things may matter more like national security like smooth relations between allies like truth in dealing with allies like any number of things that will be decided by people who see the big picture and live with responsibilities you and i cant imagine what is okadasans attitude in all this i hear the state department i dont hear okadasan okadasan is samurai she works for a daimyo she lives to serve him it defines her she obeys her daimyo she made peace with that decision years ago her feelings are her business and nobody elses duty is the only thing that counts now swagger please finish your motherfucking chicken skewers and leave quietly with me its the best way its the only way you are a tough one okadasan i give you that nothing gets in the way professional to the core you sure you werent a marine if it matters i hate to see this end what youve donewell ive never seen anything like it but thats neither here nor there i am samurai i obey my daimyo now its time to a strange noise came between them shit she said she bent picked her green kate spade bag off the floor and fished out her cellular it buzzed irritatingly your daimyo wants an update its not my daimyos number she popped the thing open yes i see no no that was the right thing to do and when all right thanks i dont know ii just dont know no dont call them i dont know i have to think if you call them it makes even more problems she closed the phone and put it back in her purse so he said lets go to the van lets get this over with no she said its all changed he saw now something in her eyes that could have been the beginning of tears even her tough warriors face and its selfwilled impassivity a signal mark of her beauty seemed slightly affected gravity somehow had altered it into something darker sadder and more tragic that was sister caroline at the hospital armed men just broke in and kidnapped miko yano the taking it still made no sense to the little girl she had been at her friend beanies house and they had a party and played with pretty ponies and watched a movie about a funny strange green man in a forest and giggled the night away and the next day two strange men and a strange lady took her away to this place full of nuns and nurses and hurrying and scurrying she didnt belong here but there was no other place for her she understood of course that something had happened a sister led her in prayer and finally told her about a fire and that mama and dada and raymond and john and tomoe were now with god that was fine but she had to know when can i see them my dear im afraid you dont understand let us pray again the days passed then the weeks every time someone came in the room she looked up felt a surge of joy and hope and thought mama dada but it was only a nurse they dressed her in strange clothes the toys were dour and limp many broken the other children stayed away from her as if she were infected she was so alone mama my dear no you have to understand mama and dada have gone to be with god he called them he wants them in her mind she could see only one face that comforted her it was from the tv a fabulous story she loved so much about a little girl and her three friends who went off to fight a witch one of the friends was a tall almost silver man with a great cutting tool he was the tin man she loved the tin man he was in her life somehow she associated him with her father for shed first seen him with her father the man was kind she could tell she remembered him in her own house and she saw that in some way her father loved this man and the man loved her father something she saw in their bodies in the way they related and joked and listened to each other if daddy and mommy and her sister and brothers were gone she wondered about the tin man she dreamed about him maybe he would save her from all this but the bedwetting started and it annoyed the sisters and the nurses they tried to hide their anger but a child is sensitive to nuances of face and tone and body and she realized that she was letting them down horribly it made her sad she could not help it it humiliated her because hygiene she didnt know that word but thought only of her mothers term for it being fresh meant so much and she had been coached in it so powerfully by mama and now she couldnt control her dirtiness voices werent raised punishments werent threatened blows werent unleashed still she felt the nuns disappointment like a powerful weight she didnt know when the screaming started but after a while it seemed that there had always been screaming she had no idea where it came from but some nights when she was alone in the dark and sometimes asleep and sometimes not she began to hear the screaming mama dada raymond john tomoe it wasnt them but it was she missed them so why had they left why did god want them so badly it seemed unfair you must be strong the nuns told her but what was this strong her brothers especially raymond the ballplayer were strong they lifted weights and their muscles bulged and shone in the light they laughed and teased and needled each other about school and girls and homework and other things and it had been so wonderful though of course at the time she didnt know how wonderful and that it would soon end forever but that seemed not to be the strong the nurses wanted it wasnt muscles but some other thing that she could not understand and could never do it had nothing to do with each mornings wet bed and every other nights screams its you thats screaming one of the nurses said not anyone else please darling you have nothing to fear you are among friends who will take care of you you must bethat word againstrong and then one afternoon the screaming was so loud it woke her but then she noticed she hadnt been sleeping it was daylight there were no shadows it occurred to her that it was not this time her own screams or the screams of mama and dada and john and raymond and tomoe but of sister maria at that point the door to her room exploded open and a giant monster crashed in he was a very bad giant monster she could tell one side of his head was swollen and yellowish he had a bandage over the lower half of his face and blood spots stood out against the white he looked her over and she was so scared she peed he grabbed her little girl he said you will do exactly what i say or i will hit you hard do you understand she felt the full force of adult will against her and if she wanted to scream she couldnt for she was too scared holding her roughly he proceeded to the hall she saw sister maria on the ground her face bloody and nurse aoki kneeling over her trying to help afraid to look up shaking with fright she thought of the tin man the tin man could save her but the tin man was not there as the giant monster roared along the hall two other giant monsters joined him in the same black suits in seconds they were outside nobody had bothered to get her a coat or anything a sleek black car pulled up and the giant monster shoved miko into it and sat next to her his bulk dominating you he said no noise no screaming do what you are told or it will be hard on you squat down so nobody can see you he forced the child to the floor and threw a blanket over her as the car pulled away with a screech facetoface exactly as bob had planned an ad keyed to the nobility of failure appeared in the japan times personals section the difference was that it was not sent from him to kondo isami but from kondo to him it deciphered neatly enough to yasukuni gate am tuesday theyll kill you said susan okada no not if i dont have the sword what hell do is set up a second meet thats when theyll kill me oh thats so much better look we have to call the police no you know that kondo or his boss miwa have sources and influences in the police if you tell them in ten seconds kondo knows and what does that get it gets miko killed it gets me killed i will go to this meeting i will set up the next meeting the exchange and well go from there but hes holding all the cards and he knows it you cant negotiate with someone who has an advantage he will get you to some deserted place kill you take the sword kill miko and go ahead with his plan theyll win maybe i can no youll get her killed youll get yourself killed miwa will win and then what okadasan i will go to this meeting and come back and then well see if something i did gets that child killed you did nothing but your duty this is not about any failing of yours its about guys who will do anything to get what they want thats what its always about and you and i are lucky that we have the privilege to fight them and we will fight them and we will stop them they think theyre samurai theyre not well show them what samurai means but susan wasnt convinced bob left her in a state of despair it had turned cold the greenness of japan had vanished a cold wind blew scattering dead leaves across the pavement of yasukuni shrine on either side of the concrete esplanade some trees stood tangled and severe they looked like rusted barbed wire bob stood under the steel gate it towered above him two steel shafts rising fifty feet to two steel crossbars one mundane for stability the other the great soaring wing that was the universal symbol of japan the torii gate with its architectural communication of the glory the breadth the scope the power the beauty the immensity of asia bob looked up into a blue sky at the top bar and saw immensity he shuddered he was wearing a black suit and a raincoat slightly underdressed for the weather outside the shrine parklands tokyos business hustled along its avenues the honking and screeching of cars the bustle of the endless parade of pedestrians here a few salarymen a few tourists a few visitors traversed the grounds in small knots headed either to the shrine at the end of the walk or the samurai museum to the right of the grounds bob checked his watch am of course somewhere they were checking him out with binoculars making certain he really was alone but then from a knot of nondescript businessmen one separated and ambled over to bob bob watched him approach was he expecting something special someone whose demonic charisma seemed to carry its own internal light he just saw a guy in a suit and a topcoat with sunglasses a broad but unimpressive face dark hair cut into a bristly crew cut as the figure approached possibly he picked up vibrations of physical vitality as if the man under his dreary outerwear possessed surprising strengths and agility or possibly it was his imagination greetings i am the assassin kondo isami said the man in clear accentless english well polished well schooled who are you working for now that he faced him swagger felt a weird sense of familiarity it was peculiar what was so familiar he spoke philip yano youre not representing certain american adultentertainment industry groups youre not a professional i would have nothing to do with that business i dont care for teacherblowingjohnny but im professional enough to handle you you dont represent government or any such official entity nope did some work for em once didnt like it who taught you the sword toshiro mifune whos the woman pal i aint here to play twenty questions what was philip yano to you a good man with a good family who never deserved what he got he was nothing there are more important things than one obscure family living on a government pension and investments i would say he was everything i would say cut the shit lets get cracking the longer i stand here the more i feel like breaking your neck i spent some time in america you remind me of a football team captain who ended up a fireman stupid loud aggressive but brave he died on nineeleven when the tower went down on him it makes me sick that a creep like you even knew him yes he was a hero as you are but in a different way his was samurais courage rash and emotional and caught up in the moment that i understand youve had weeks to think this over to consider to find reasons not to act yet you persevere what drives you on this bizarre personal mission that can end in nothing but disaster for you i suppose youve rationalized it elaborately really im curious why why on said bob on scoffed the man you can know nothing of on obligation its a japanese concept endlessly convoluted and twisted its meaningless to any american i think i get it pretty well impossible he said i went to an american high school i had a year at an american university i know america no american could feel on ask your pals at the polishers how serious i am theyd know you had the advantage of complete surprise so possibly the feat is less impressive than you imagine sir i really dont give a fuck whether youre impressed or not i want the child i want the sword you can see that i dont have it where is it when i get the child in one hand ill cut your head off with it with the other and thats when youll know where it is kondo reached in his pocket and pulled out a cellular phone two days from now at five thirty am you will receive a phone call on that phone you will be given a route you will proceed i believe you have a motorcycle id wait for the call near the imperial palace thats centrally located at five forty am you will get another call it will direct you to turn this will continue for a bit until you arrive at a certain destination at around six am though you will have to run some stoplights but youd better run those stoplights if you are late i will cut one of the childs fingers off each minute one finger when i run out of fingers toes then therell be nothing trivial to cut so ill cut limbs shell probably bleed to death before i get all four off but if not ill take out each eye her nose and her tongue it means nothing to me so you had better be on time i am really going to enjoy taking your head you bring the sword i will release the child when i have the sword the initiative is mine i control the transaction you may leave with the child later ill call you on the cellular and set up another appointment we will settle our business it sucks of course you could have sixty men there with aks i could but if you dont agree ill start cutting the child right now you doubt it look over there he indicated and bob saw fifty yards away a large man with a bruised bandaged facebob remembered clocking him hard twice at the polishersand bob saw miko the big man had his hands on her shoulders she looked scared and wan her controller turned his hand and the light caught the blade of a tanto held intimately against her delicate throat there was also something about his hand some sexual electricity you could see he enjoyed the closeness her smell her helplessness that boy will cut her in a second he is true yakuza living for obedience to his oyabun the obscenity of the large strong young man holding the bright blade against the terrified little girl and enjoying it so much filled swagger with rage but rage was not helpful im impressed with how strong you are against little girls he said thats quite a trick but well see how you do with someone with a sharper sword and faster reflexes my guess is ill see fear in your eyes before i cut you down well see you in a while gaijin bring beheader of kira ill be there and when im done with you ill donate beheader of kondo to a museum the white room they drove back across tokyo in a giant black car miko sat in the backon the floor actuallybetween the two giant monsters the two men said nothing to each other or to her she just sat there feeling the start and stop of the car in traffic she had recognized the tin man the man from the good memories even if she wasnt sure what they were what they meant this time he looked at her with such sadness in his eyes and as she watched the sadness flashed to rage then went calm again but she had caught it that moment of rage and somehow from that she took some hope he knew somehow he was on her side he would save her but then the two giant monsters roughly returned her to the car calling her only little girl never her name as if she was the unwanted stepchild and she drove back to the house the room the giant monster dragged her out of the vehicle in a kind of courtyard she caught a brief flash of fresh air the courtyard was walled somewhere in the city and she could hear the sounds of traffic see apartment buildings off in one direction she had the impression of many men they seemed to lounge everywhere young men without women all in black suits all somehow tough or ready to fight they scared her as they gambled or joked or looked at magazines or boisterously shoved each other around she knew they were some kind of army the giant monster took her upstairs to a white room she knew it well it contained a bed and a television set there were no toys or books or dolls the windows were painted white there was a bathroom attached three times a day she was brought food usually by one of the angry young men or by the giant monster with the swollen face who was her primary keeper it was always takeout food hamburger from mcdonalds or fish cakes or pork cutlets wrapped in paper bags or some such a coke in a cardboard cup an hour later wordlessly someone would return unlock the door and take the garbage out meanwhile she just sat and watched the television or sat in the whiteness thinking and remembering or sat in the whiteness crying little girl said the monster you know the rules you stay here you obey if you do not obey i will punish you i believe in punishment your parents did not punish you hard enough i will punish you severely do you understand how long be quiet little girl ask no questions you need to know nothing be a good little girl or we will have to punish you then he locked her in her room nii come here said kondo yes oyabun hows the eye its fine what did you think of him this time without a sword hes just another man oyabun he seemed calm that impressed me he had a moment when he saw the child and his eyes flared he felt rage but then he controlled it he knew that if he tried anything you would have cut the childs throat yes oyabun nii you would have cut the childs throat right yes oyabun sometimes i worry nii of them all i trust you the most these fellows are hard and tough and will obey and fight even the new ones but your job nii that is the hardest i cannot believe the gaijin wont try something and it may be that you will have to kill the child you must be samurai you must be shinsengumi you must be eightninethree you must be all will and no heart yes oyabun you cant go sentimental on me in some appalling way is that clear yes you are kobun i am oyabun you understand that all things flow from that i stand ready i cant imagine that it could happen but if theres an attack you will proceed directly to the child and cut her throat yes sir are you sure yes oyabun whywhy do you ask because i am aware that you have some feelings for this child oyabun i no ive seen you in her presence you cannot tear your eyes away you look back on the drive over you kept looking down at her when you hold her i see a certain passion in your limbs you enjoy holding her oyabun its nothing i swear to you she is nothing it i understand how comely the child is i understand how her form can seduce you she is but an object nii dont lie to me i am your oyabun nii swallowed harshly caught in his lie nii listen to me i must know that you can kill her because if i dont know it then they will also sense it it will embolden them do you understand yes oyabun so listen to me before you kill her fuck her once you are done with her she is no longer a little princess she is a whore used by you for momentary pleasure and now defiled tarnished made dirty she is nothing more than that korean cow we slaughtered in kabukicho at that point you can cut her and walk away nii saw the logic he liked the logic do you hear me nii before you kill her fuck her i hear oyabun good kobun good student i know i can count on you strategy here is our best option said susan okada glumly they sat at a table at the roppongi starbucks among software designers clothing salesmen mothers teenage girls and boys with pins in their noses and lips i have thought this over and it could work i go to the ambassador i explain the situation its urgency the timing he goes to the prime minister they go to the minister of the interior we get some sort of dispensation and we make guarantees of no or at best minimal collateral damage if we get their okaynotice im bypassing the tokyo police and the whole infrastructure in which miwa and kondo may have influencewe can move a seal team in from okinawa most of the teams are in the middle east but seven is in okinawa and theyre very good theyve done stuff you wouldnt believe in north korea and on the chinese coastline so when you get that call at five thirty am seven is above you in a helo they follow you to the location and we airinsert fast we have japanese police cooperation to the point that weve got the park or whatever it is cordoned off so no civilians will get shot so seal team seven takes out kondo and miwa if hes there seven prevails we get the little girl you are not dead kondo and miwa are dead or behind bars seven flies back to okinawa and we have our happy ending all due respects maam you cant fight them on their ground when theyve had time to set up their ground lesson number one from vietnam when they hear them choppers they kill the little girl the seals are still at five thousand feet drinking their coffee when they land the only thing there is a dead child maybe im dead too meanwhile everybody in tokyo hears the choppers and in two minutes there are fifty tv news crews on the spot when the japanese hear miwa is involved they go nuts it aint going to work swagger i never said it was perfect but we have been dealt a crap hand and its the best i can do with a crap hand it controls collateral it gets the best hostage rescue team on earth in play to save miko it takes out the bad guys hard and its over in seconds its full of things that cant be controlled there are no other options oh except the one where you go you give them the sword they kill you they kill miko because shes a witness they disappear and then the whole thing happens as planned and yuichi miwa is reelected head of that japanese porno association drives out the americans and convinces himself hes a great patriot because hes kept japanese blow jobs japanese no theres another option night raid before they move to the site we go in under cover of darkness and we get the child out then when shes gone and safe we settle up we do it with swords so theres no gunfight in downtown tokyo to make the noon news and the cover of time she laughed are you joking its fine except a we have no idea where they are where theyre keeping her and we have no fast way to find it if i had a thousand men and a week i could probably find out i have less than fortyeight hours and we are talking the biggest city in the world and b we have no people i couldnt get a seal team on a mission like that because nobody above me would approve it so who goes you alone youre a good operator i know that youre not that good nobodys that good you cant go alone no im not that good i return to point a even if you find the people to go along you dont know where miko is you have no idea where they have her they can be found in ten minutes come on maybe five swagger are you off the wagon again how on earth would you i didnt say i could find them i couldnt find them but i know somebody who could who would that be you okadasan she just looked at him im guessing assistant head of station chief of operations central intelligence agency tokyo embassy code name screaming bitch christ she said you are so agency its written all over you you must think im as dumb as i look and sound ive been around you guys all my life i worked with the agency to recover a sov sniper rifle in nam back in seventythree i helped the agency with its housekeeping in the matter of a deputy director named ward bonson who wasnt exactly who he said he was six years ago so i know agency my code name isnt screaming bitch she said i know i was trying to be funny its martha stewart i hate it but there you have it some jerk at headquarters hung that on you he did ive made some enemies you must be good then anyhow heres how i figure it you tell me how close i am this whole thing has been agency from the start the object was to find out who killed philip yano and his family because philip yano was your man and always had been he was getting you the japanese stuff on a target like north korea or china something like that thats why he had such a good career thats why he got all the choice american schools and he got the big job in iraq and got to go into battle finally they even postponed his retirement for him to lead his men and he did well except he lost an eye he was a very fine man i had the privilege of running him during his last three operational years he never betrayed his country and he served ours brilliantly we were very lucky to have him on the team then two years into his retirement he gets whacked and so does his family now you have a problem a big problem who killed philip yano has your outfit been penetrated did someone outside the needtoknow list figure it out did the chinese kill him did the north koreans did a disaffected japanese group kill him or always a possibility could it have nothing to do with his career in your business could it just be random shit going down the way it always does in the wicked wicked world things are made more urgent by the fact the japanese themselves dont seem too eager to solve the mystery why whos pulling strings whats going on what does it mean she nodded i knew you have an instinct for this kind of work maybe so anyway someone comes up with the idea of hiring the eight ball the wild guy from way outside me actually i thought so what an answer to all your prayers i was i know nothing aint a part of no system but i got the advantage that i dont take no for an answer i dont mind busting heads i aint afraid of the red stuff and i knew and loved philip yano thats how come al ino was able to get me such a good phony passport thats why someone knew where i was to ship me the yano autopsy file thats why youve been so interested in me and here i thought it was my redneck good looks and my real tight blue jeans your jeans are too tight swagger she said morosely then she added i dont see how you breathe anyhow north korea not china but north korea phil had access to the japanese networks there he knew everything about it he was months ahead of everybody yes and thats why two days ago you pulled the plug when you found out phil yano died because bob lee swagger gave him a sword that one in a million turned out to be the one that some old guy used to cut some other old guys head off three centuries ago and that it had nothing to do with the north koreans no american national interest none of our business it was like a traffic accident thats all tough sad too bad but not a part of your operation so it was time to pull the plug game over investigation over swagger go home swagger that decision was made at the very top if it matters i fought against it you have no idea how i fought against it how everybody here fought against it but we all serve the daimyo i hear you i done my time serving the daimyo too the pay is lousy the food sucks but you get shot at a lot anyhow now its time for the daimyo to serve us where are you going with this swagger i aint going nowhere im sitting here and im gonna get another one of those mocha frappe things i think the japanese add fish oil to em thats a drink with some kick swagger i cant youre the one thats going someplace youre going to the fourthfloor commo room and getting out your little magical encryptor the one you got in that cereal box heres what you tell em in virginia you got a tip that someone is receiving explosives from north korea for a terror strike on tokyo hes mounting a mission here to bring down the hyatt or the tokyo tower or the tokyo dome theyll buy that in langley you request a tasked satellite intel mission flash you have a bird in the sky zero in on every known miwa property in tokyo and your research people can dig them up for you im guessing thats the seven mansions five or six distribution centers ten warehouses two or three tv stations four or five printing plants twenty tops you put the big sky eye smack cold zero on them and inside of five minutes the bird will uncover unusual abnormal activity at one of them lots of men on the grounds lots of seemingly aimless milling about maybe a lot of kendo practice some judo that sort of thing oh and an unusual collection of vehicles perimeter security maybe even patrols itll look very military op and im guessing its near a park or some wideopen facility with a single entrance they can control without a lot of travel thats where theyll run the exchange thats where kondo will kill miko before my eyes just to see the hurt on my face and thats where hell cut me down she just looked at him all right she finally said so weve found them you want to know whos on the team we put over the wall do you have fortyseven samurai waiting outside no outside is where you have your four korean exspecial forces guys who arent agency contract boys but okadasans bodyguards every time i get near you i gotta play bumper car with them the kid in the second car is too aggressive he almost creamed us on the trip back from kyoto i hope you reamed his ass for that he was way too close but i know the type theyre all probably in love with you and they like to fight theyll go youre right theyll go thats four now for the fun part we call oneeighthundredsamurai whats that heres another surprise i have regularly been reporting to a major albert fujikawa of the japanese selfdefense forces hes in the loop and right now hes in tokyo with forty of his boys he was phil yanos exec in samawah it was his life phil saved when the ied went off the unit is a recon company from the first airborne brigade of the eastern army hqd at narashino theyre paratroopers but all they do is play sixteenth century all day long and smack each other with wooden swords im betting theyre the best swordsmen in japan if we get them involved we break every law on the books regarding jdf theyve figured out the patterns of on some things trump others in this country and loyalty to murdered lords means more than obedience to the shoguns law theyre here all set up and ready to go you get us the satellite dope and we go in twentyfour hours she just looked at him you are dangerous she finally said this was your game from the start right we hit em dead solid cold they have no idea its coming its over in a few minutes because swords leave a mess but they dont make no noise then we go home sometime the day after someone notices the flies buzzing around the joint thats when they make the discovery everybodys home and in bed by that time and mikos fine kondo isamis head is on a pole the sword is in dr otowas vault where it belongs you just made head of station so forty jdf paratroopers plus major fujikawa four rok spec ops guys i count fortyfive its enough he said not quite you forgot the fortysixth whos that me okada dont even start redneck dont you dare even start im not sitting home baking cookies while you are destroying my career youre too stubborn to argue with fortysix she said just for the luck factor alone we should have one more who did i forget oh yeah you youre the fortyseventh samurai niis dreams it was well after dark nii was alone with the little girl in the white room he could hear vaguely the sound of other men moving in the large house loafing outside yelling and shoving and gambling playing around he knew that kondo was back from whatever errands and that the thing would happen very soon the day after tomorrow almost certainly he could hear traffic though this house was on a quiet street in a quiet part of tokyo far from the major arteries that hummed with life and action he could hear the quiet whistle of wind in the trees and he remembered how surprisingly cold it was and he realized that the seasons had changed and hed been so caught up in the drama of his life he hadnt noticed it he didnt think of the future or even the past he didnt think of his beloved oyabun or of his oyabuns daimyo in whose favor they all labored so hard he didnt think that it was almost over that he would be a complete and fullfledged member of the dominant yakuza gang in tokyo that his name would be known and that he would be mighty and feared that wasnt what preoccupied him he stared at her she slept uneasily her body spilled out in the low somber light his imagination played tricks on him he imagined she was naked when he knew she wasnt he imagined she wanted him as much as he wanted her when he knew she didnt he imagined somehow they could be together forever when he knew it was impossible because she had to die nii had never felt this before she was everywhere in his mind that she was four and he twentyfive had no meaning it was supposed to be he knew it had to be he could make out the soft up and down of her frail chest under the blanket hear the melody of her breathing he could see her small perfect foot her adorable toes with their flaky coat of the summers last toenail polish he could see the button of her nose the repose of her face the quietude of her pale eyelids he could see her cupid lips buttercups rose petals candy kisses he could see a flare of tension and relaxation in the perfect oval precision of her baby nostrils nii watched until he could watch no more then rushed out to masturbate the day after tomorrow he told himself the kendo champion bob pulled his bike into the museum parking lot it was cold getting on to nightfall his chilled steel hip throbbed dully broadcasting its message of deadness he shook off the unpleasant feeling and its tendrils of memory tonight it all happened he knew he tried to wipe his mind blank but he could not no man could he checked his watch it was pm tokyo time driving had been hellish sliding in and out of the busy mirrorimage shunt of the cars with things coming at him from odd angles he didnt enjoy it a bit it took too much out of him of course all these ill feelings had their source in the immediate few minutes where hed have to deliver some very bad news to a man whod been nothing but good to him not a happy prospect was it necessary yeah it was he couldnt proceed without what lay ahead in an office full of swords he thought of the parts assembling susan and her four koreans major fujikawa the paratroopers all of them quietly converging on a neighborhood in northwest tokyo far off the tourist way miles from the famous spots like the ginza and shinjuku and ueno and asakusa a place without major shrines or nightclubs or department stores it was near there that the agency satellites had uncovered intense activity on a miwa property a walled mansion in a secluded street next to a parkland called kiyosumi garden once the playground of the mitsubishi family and now a kind of wonderland of asian garden themes the mansion hit all the criteria perfectly quiet obscure close to a park with one gated entrance easy to command walled off from society they would meet to stage at the closeby hotel banquet room where under a guise susan had made an emergency rental of the large room claiming to represent a kendo club headed to an outoftown meet and needing a rallying point bob shivered the weather had changed abruptly the temperature had dropped and he really didnt have the clothes for the midthirties which it threatened to reach tonight he drew his raincoat tightly about him for warmth but it was a thin coat and his black suit was thin cotton summer weight unable to stand up to the bite of the sudden gusts of breeze or the generalized bite of the falling temperature he approached the museum feeling its cathedrallike grandeur tower over him it was a modern building constructed after the war of course but its lines carefully duplicated the harmonies of classical edo architecture so in a sense entering it was like being swallowed by japan as jonah was swallowed by a whale inside it was all japan only japan and no other place was permitted to exist the somber gray light lent everything a stoic dignity in glass cases kimonoed princesses and armored knights stood nobly reflecting the grandeur of a past so glorious and bloody and complicated so full of opera and murder it almost defied belief you could see the whole thing play out before your eyes in these vast rooms from the little men the chinese had found living in thatched huts to the brilliant men who had invaded china raped its cities cut it in half you could see the zen priest and the samurai warrior you could feel the presence of men so mentally tough and sublimely confident they could fight twenty at a time and win and not think much of it with their long curved swords of the most sophisticated metallurgy in the world but it was all one thing if you had those brave men you also had sword testers who went out in the night and cut random strangers down to see how well the blades cut you had secret diagrams of how to arrange a corpse to perform a cutting test on it how many times a skull could be cleaved and from what angle you had the brilliant men who destroyed the russian fleet in seven minutes in and their grandsons who fell from the sky in planes that were bombs skipping between the blasts of american flak hunting for a nice large gray superstructure against which to obliterate themselves it was that same utter commitment that sank the russian ships blew up the american fleet off okinawa and built the skyscrapers of shinjuku by this time the security people knew bob and nodded him through he took the elevator to the fourth floor is the doctor in yes yes said his secretary dr otowa swaggersan is here oh do come in i was just getting ready to leave do you think it will freeze feels like it in the air yes nippy out bracing i must say you have some news please sit my friend bob sat in the familiar chair and faced the old man in his room of swords the good news is i think this will be concluded very shortly and if all goes well i will be free to dispose of the sword as i want what i want is for the museum to have the blade youall would know what to do with it it shouldnt be the possession of any one man but of your nation that is very thoughtful of you i had hoped for as much it is my pleasure but i actually came on another bit of business im sorry to say this news aint good i am prepared are you sure speak please theres a man calling himself kondo isami do you know the name of course every japanese does kondo isami was the leader of shinsengumi in kyoto in eighteen sixtyseven he led many raids was in many fights a hero or a villain depending but surely an extraordinary swordsman in the shoguns cause he was executed in eighteen sixtyeight by the emperors forces he died well but dishonorably by beheading he was not permitted seppuku this new kondo isami is also an extraordinary swordsman in his fashion he works for the shogun fighting against outside domination hes a yakuza contract killer the very best you can see by his name he has some kind of vanity for samurai history he likes to think of himself as one of them old boys but nothing stops him he killed philip yano and family the whole business with the sword has been his invention now we have the sword im afraid to say he has kidnapped miko yano and tonight all that gets sorted out there will be blood a lot of it i think yours possibly you will fight this kondo isami if i can find him you are very brave swaggersan no i just dont see no other way hes too good to fight the others hell kill them quick so i have to run him down and face him off thats what he wants its what i want too its why i came here i see and from me you want i have gotten so much from you but i must ask for one more thing its the hardest thing and you can be forgiven for not wanting to give it but i felt i must ask what your blessing why would that be such a hard thing because this kondo isami is your son there was a pause i am beseeching the father of a man i must kill for his permission bob said i wont have a chance unless you free me i cant see a son i can only see an enemy dr otowa looked at him dully then he said i have no son then he is your brothers son or your sisters son i have no brother or sister he met swaggers gaze steadily it is said of the new kondo swagger said that some people he meets normally that he goes clubbing that he has a regular life but sometimes he retreats into some kind of artifice if he has to meet certain people he wears a mask or he designs some theatrical lighting setup so his face cant be seen whats behind that when i saw him i knew he cant meet people who know you he met me because he doesnt know ive been in contact with you but anyone whos seen him and you would see in a second the extreme facial similarity its all there the eyes the shape of the nose the shape of the mouth the texture and color of the skin the width of the face the hairline its a face i had seen before sir i saw it in a photo at doshus dojo in kyoto you doshu and the boy then possibly fourteen and some big trophy my son died said otowa bob saw no point in adding a thing in any case he had nothing to add finally dr otowa spoke i suppose i always feared such a thing no one can hurt a father like a son and no revenge is sweeter than the sons upon the father you should not blame yourself there is no one else to blame that picture was taken in nineteen seventyseven when the boy was sixteen he had just won the eighteenunder alljapan kendo championship open division under doshus coaching his life was set he would win it at seventeen and at eighteen then he would enter the mens division and win that for five years running then he would be a national hero a celebrity he could go anywhere and do anything japan would be before him he could be a politician a ceo an admiral what happened an appointment came up it was an extraordinary opportunity i supposed it would turn me into a national hero a celebrity i chose myself over him i took him to america with me for three years he had two years of american education at scarsdale high and a year at columbia i dont think he ever really forgave me for taking him out of his competitive kendo for the three most important years of his life but to this day i dont know how i could have turned it down in any event america changed him in some basic ways it confused him itll do that he came back in eighty at nineteen and we knew he was too far behind to score well in the eighteenovers that is the national championship but he competed valiantly it was astonishing he made it to the finals he was so heroic but he lost a close match so it goes but then in a split second he threw it all away samurai pride samurai rage the helmets were off the two opponents bowed and my son went berserk for one second he struck the man in the neck with his shinai hurt him quite badly broke his collarbone i had not been father enough to save him from his greediest hungers the scandal was shattering there was no hope his gi and slippers were found on the beach at enoshima he had walked into the sea no body was ever found im very sorry bob said you have no need to apologize the shame is mine to bear and mine alone i love what my son was i hate myself for my agency in his corruption and i loathe what he has become i can see the psychology though he did become the best swordsman in japan though not in a surrogate format with bamboo weapons as a calculated affront to me and to the elders of the kendo world he became a champion in the real world of the gutter where the blades are sharp and the blood is real bob said nothing come with me said the old man he led bob to the blank dark wall of the vault cranked the handle and slid the massive door open he ducked in gesturing bob to follow and bob found himself amid yet more swords even more beautiful more valuable there are many great collections otowa said but none so great as this i am privileged said bob the doctor leaned and plucked one off the wall here he said handing it to bob bob felt the electricity of the thing the perfection of its balance the hunger of its blade the stunning artistry of its fabrication may i of course bob turned the blade upward and cleanly drew it from the saya the koshiraeblood red sago of black sharkskin a goldtinted tsubawere magnificent but even that magnificence was diminished by the blade that may be the most perfect blade in all japan it is certainly the sharpest the strongest the most deadly sir its priceless take it use it fight with it possibly it gives you a slight edge my son will recognize it he will know its power it is one thing that may give him pause it is your only chance he had a superb natural skill set and if hes worked hard for the past twenty years he is indeed transcendent i couldnt risk losing it swaggersan it was built for this purpose and no other it is fulfilling its destiny were it sentient it would petition for permission to defend you think nothing of its value think nothing of its rarity think only of it as your weapon yes sir a muramasa i take it it is indeed the evil swordsmith his was the blademaybe even that onein the stream in the famous story about masamune the leaves and twigs avoided the great masamunes muramasas attracted them and it cut them flawlessly muramasa took pride in this when he should have felt shame thus his blades had a reputation for blood they yearned to cut they also had a penchant for seeking out members of the shoguns family and killing or maiming them they were banned rounded up and destroyed by the shogunate which is why they are so rare today and that is one of the survivors my son will know this and know that he works for a kind of shogun that will cloud his mind again a small thing but victory is won on small things i thank you i will return no if you kill him then the sword will have served its purpose maybe that is why it came to me so many years ago destroy it thats all get it off the earth send it to hell it came from hell it represents hell use it and destroy it without a second thought i will dr otowa that sword is my blessing now please go i wish to be alone the big shots youre sure said the shogun as sure as i can be i told you lord this is a determined and creative adversary but now we have him i worry that at the park it will be difficult to control it will spill into a mess and the news stations and the i will have ten men concealed they are experts at camouflage ninja almost not really but close i myself will be there its early we control access to the park no one will interfere certain suggestions have been made to the police to stay away its very very early barely dawn we control the terrain he has no choice but to come if he loves the child and he loves the child i saw it in his eyes at a signal i can get forty more men in the park almost instantly he has some skill i admit but not enough to overcome me and certainly not enough to overcome fifty men that only happens in movies suppose he brings he cant he wont have time he cannot locate us until we call him he will have to travel at extreme speed across tokyo we will be watching all the roads as he approaches and will know if he has allies but he cant get allies close enough in time its a very solid plan the child the child must die shes seen too much it is a small matter it means nothing its just that i lord it means nothing yes kondosan they sat in the living room of the mansion next to kiyosumi gardens it was nearly midnight kondo had spent the day going over his preparations he had his own trained men he had his kobun nii his most trusted fellow virtually connected by tether to the child he had forty toughened soldiers from boss otani ready to die for him no they werent the best and they preferred to fight with kalashnikov and makarov than katana and wakizashi but they would still rather die than yield and would kill at the drop of a hand and if necessary he had plenty of kalashnikovs and makarovs still the shogun was nervous kondo could tell he sat there licking his lips his face glowing in the light of the fire swallowing twitching occasionally trying to control his nerves he wasnt so brilliant at this kind of thing the shogun didnt even need to be there but he had insisted still regret seemed to cloud his thought i just wish all this hadnt happened he said petulantly we are running out of time pornographer thought kondo there was no point in explaining to him that what happens is what happens feelings about what is past are silly they contribute nothing one must only look at the now lord i have made all the arrangements the koshirae will be completed in record time the hard part was the polishing getting that doneand i understand the old man did a superb job maybe his bestwas the key you will have the sword in plenty of time to announce it to enjoy the prestige and attention to empower your plans all the things you desire will be delivered to you exactly as planned this unforeseen businessa trouble i admitis unfortunate but we have it under control the stroke of the child it was brilliant we went from losers to winners in that single instant strategy is very important you are a genius kondosan you will be well rewarded my service is my reward but ill still take that four million dollars tomorrow at this time i will have both my fortune and my opponents head i think ill take a nice vacation try los angeles ill give you some numbers fuck some blond white women very enjoyable once you do youll see why only certain japanese should be allowed that pleasure it would corrupt the general public and soon the concept of japanese would be gone we must protect the sexual powers of our men the submission of our women and the purity of our you had to stop him or hed go on for hours and kondo wanted a little sleep i look forward to it he said miwa went to pour himself another scotch he watched the amber fluid splash across the ice cubes then he raised his eyes and peered out the window where the many spotlights created an intense and impenetrable zone of illumination kondosan he said look its snowing staging an observer could be forgiven for thinking that indeed a kendo club had commandeered the banquet hall of the kasaibashi hotel on kasaibashi road a block from kiyosumi gardens in east tokyo the young men were husky handsome quiet athletic graceful and all carried kendo bags long enough to accommodate shinai the bamboo sword of the sport other bagged gear surely contained the armor kendoists wore and the appearance of medical technicians merely confirmed the impression as kendo can be a rough encounter leaving abrasions bruises sometimes even cuts their coaches a few years older were also husky handsome quiet athletic and graceful all wore black jumpsuits under sweatshirts all carried black watch caps wedged into their belts all spoke only to friends if at all so many young menbut they had to be a team because there was no joshing no horsing around no shoving or needling certainly a big match loomed ahead the observer would have wondered about the gaijin who seemed to be some kind of consultant to them for he enjoyed the confidence of the older fellows and soon took over the pep talk from the head coach but what to make of the slim beautiful woman in glasses who also seemed to enjoy everyones confidence was she a kendoist she was wearing blue jeans new balance sport shoes and a black turtleneck almost a kendoists outfit and yet again what of the final touch the four korean men much squarer in face and blockier in build than their japanese counterparts who spoke to no one and hovered close to the woman all in all it was a very strange gathering but of course there was no observer the kasaibashi was a twostar business joint well away from tourist areas at midnight when this strange confab began arriving in ones or twos checking in with a fellow who looked as much like a sergeant as a coach only a single employee was on duty at the hotel a night clerk who doubled as a telephone operator he was earnestly advised to mind his own business by someone whose seriousness of purpose impressed him and his switchboard was quietly disconnected from the outside all this was done with utmost politeness but at the same time utmost sincerity in the big room the men eventually assembled before a blackboard each silent each ready until at am the meeting commenced the head coach welcoming them promising them that this would be their night the night they had so long awaited the night when their team would triumph the men seemed like all men in preathletic stress tight and nervous and hungry at once finally the gaijin stood in front of the men hmmm what would a gaijin know about kendo but this one held their attention even if he didnt seem to be talking about kendo lastminute check he said speaking in an english that more than half understood but which was translated by the woman with great technical fluency in near real time medics there are medics here major fujikawa the major nodded as three men raised their hands youve all got oneg plenty of needle and thread plenty of quiklot plenty of clamps and transfusion equipment wounds tonight will be cuts you medics i hope youve been practicing clamping and sewing thats what itll be all about the appropriate men nodded okadasan he said the woman handed out xerox sheets she said in japanese thats the latest satellite photo of the target taken approximately six hours ago dont ask who took it or how i got it you can see the layout of the building the layout of the walls we have idd approximately fifty men on site they seem to be quartered in the basement because they go in and out of one lowerstory side door they were all inside as of nineteen hundred hours the front gate is locked you can also see that weve indicated by marker your approach to the target its no more than half a mile from here let me run through this one more time said the gaijin youve been briefed but lets take it by the steps he ran through it again how in small groups the men would infiltrate kiyosumi gardens come out at the far end and gather in two groups on the north and south sides of the wall around the miwa mansion the four snipers would take up positions on the walls at that point susan and bob would approach in her rx park next to the west wall midway between the two teams the signal was a loud blast from the horn and then the men would proceed over the walls captain tanada takes the rear team over the south wall major fujikawa will go over from the left of the gate the north wall i dont want to breach the gate because i dont want to use explosives and if there are sentries inside with firearms their first instinct will be to zero in on the gate as they look at the gate the snipers should find them in the windows and take them out okadasan and i will go over from our position on the east wall you get to the house then you toss your flashbangs each window each door i dont want you entering the house because you dont know the layout and the arrangement of the furniture or the closets and okadasan and i will be inside and i dont want us getting all mixed up with the flashbangs those guys will come pouring out i should tell you the one feature of a sword fight is a lot of blood it aint like no movie there will be blood everywhere you cannot cut with katana hard into the torso without severing major arteries it will be slippery and sloppy you cannot allow yourself to be shocked by it when you cut him hell bleed bad if he dont go down cut him again hard and he will then move on if you are cut disengage get your bandage tight on it and fall back to the medics who will be the last over the wall they will get you clamped and get an oneg line into you you have a lot of blood you can lose half of it before you pass out if you see a lot of your own blood do not panic move swiftly to the medics and you will be all right there is one man you should avoid this man is called kondo isami he will be older about fortyfive his skills are beyond yours believe me if you see him do not fight him if he means to escape let him escape if he is guarding someoneim imagining he will be guarding miwa the big bossthen you surround them but do not attempt to take him down he will kill six or seven of you before you can finish him and those are unacceptable casualties simply hold him at bay well get the snipers in quickly and if they wont surrender well shoot them or tell me where he is if it comes to it i will handle him ive done a lot of fighting in my life and i am not afraid to fight finally remember our priorities saving miko yano is first justice for the man who murdered her father and family is second and this fellow kondo is third okadasan and i will find the little girl okadasan has night vision and we will penetrate the house first we think the kids probably in a cluster of bedrooms on the second floor after we get the girl out safely i will be looking for kondo major fujikawa who is in charge of the ground forces will be looking for miwa captain tanada i think will just be looking for heads to take there was laughter now i just want to thank you i am a stranger to this country and the men of this platoon have made me feel at home i know i am among professionals our interests are the same justice for philip yano and his family and life for his surviving daughter the people who took the first and threaten the last are a halfmile away sleeping the sleep of the wicked confident that they own the world this is the night they find out different after that it just seemed to happen without much drama the men clutching their kendo bags pulling on their black watch caps began to form up into the twoor threeman teams the medics with the larger bags of gear fell in to the rear the staff peoplefujikawa sergeant major kanda captain tanada and bob and susanwere at the front looking at the map one last time bob and susan sat in her car outside the hotel watching as the last of the teams moseyed out and disappeared into the night it was about ten minutes from gotime bob looked at his watch suddenly a buzz filled the empty space shit susan said she pulled out her cell phone switched it off your date is annoyed because you stiffed him bob said my boss is pissed because i stiffed him thats the fifteenth time hes called in the last two hours hes also sent me ten text messages he wants to see me right now christ he cant reach me that doesnt please him hes mad hes desperate and tomorrow i get fired you could go now no way if my careers going south i want to be there for the fifth act i want to see it all turn sour now swagger yes some questions all right no bullshit i have never bullshitted you we may both be dead in twenty minutes so no bullshit yes maam swagger your little drama is about to come off you made it happen subtly carefully skillfully with a great deal of sound planning youve got a career cia officer and fifty japanese selfdefense force paratroopers about to raid a yakuza strong point in contravention to the basic laws of both groups it shouldnt be possible but you made it happen the question is simple why why well i cared a great deal about philip yano i felt involved because i gave him the sword bullshit thats what youve been saying but i see now youre too smart for that you think things through too carefully thats just a cover story you know that giving him that sword was pure chance you could not have known what the consequences were and you were not responsible for them you know that and another odd thing why did you work so hard to give him that sword you told me you went all over america looking for the sword so even before youd stayed with his family the yanos meant something special to you what swagger tell me swagger considered all right he finally said i was raised not to talk of such things and i never have but you deserve an answer okadasan he looked off the snow was falling more heavily sifting down through the trees muffling the earth driving most of the traffic away swagger thought of the men moving through the dark creeping toward their destination violence in the air another night of war so much war in the swagger family my father he finally said never talked about the war he was a great man one of very few surviving fiveinvasion marines he hit five beaches was shot up seven times once close to death but he kept going back finally two days after the fifth beach iwo jima he won the medal of honor i suppose he liked having won that medal and the respect it earned him but he never ever bragged on it or mentioned it and he told me once you are never to tell anyone about that medal that was very important to him but one night in nineteen fiftyfive a few weeks before he died he was out on the porch talking with a friend of his the county prosecutor a wonderful old goat named sam vincent the two of them were talking about the war sam was running himself down and dad said mr sam you think i am such a goddamned hero and you are a failure because of thebes let me tell you a thing or two and maybe you dont know so much and things aint so clear you know that big medal i won in the war and sam said earl everyone knows you singlehandedly took on a jap pillbox and killed forty men that day well sir said dad it wasnt quite like that and he told him what really happened moon of hell showa year second month st day february the third chamber had caught most of the blast as he squirmed into the entranceway earl saw that the big automatic weapon was atilt and two men standing over the body of a third struggled to restore it to a firing position goddamn they were good the little bastards fighting so hard no matter that death was here for them to kill a few more marines you had to respect them even as you killed them and kill them he did one spray that caught them in tracer and clouds of debris from the bulletstrikes against concrete behind them he stepped forward in aggression then he caught a flash of movement in his peripheral turned and saw that it was too late as a man with a sword drove forward had him cold and uncoiled the sword diving toward his neck but then it stopped there was a frozen moment when the sword caught on the ceiling for some reason and the arc was interrupted earl pulled back in panic swept left and fired the gun fired three times went empty but the three had all hit the japanese officer went down he squirmed into the fetal position blood pooling beneath him hard and black and glossy in the low smoky light of the gun pit he moaned convulsed thrashed kill him earl thought he dumped the light machine gun and his hand flew to his he got it up jacked back the hammer and put the sight on the mans head kill him but he couldnt the man was twisting in great pain his jaws clamped shut earl quickly stuffed the pistol back in its holster reached around for his firstaid kit and pulled out a squibb morphine syrette quickly he broke the glass casing that shielded the needle removed the needle and reversed it to puncture the tube seal then screwed the needle onto the neck all he had to do was inject the needle point and squeeze the tube he bent to the man pulled back his tunic collar to expose some neck and placed the pinprick against the flesh and the american fired from just outside the entrance his gun threw light into the room like the sparkly contents of a pail of water then the man stepped into the room to make sure and captain yano uncoiled he had done it a thousand a hundred thousand times felt the muscles charge with power as the sword acquired speed and certainty flashed through its arc and hungered for flesh he had him cold for he was so ahead of the reaction time that the hairy beast could do nothing but die the blade would shatter the clavicle bone cut through spine and lungs and heart continue to the intestines he would drive on cutting then withdraw on the same plane and then he felt his foot thrust forward in the stroke alight atop something hard so he was two inches high and the sword caught on the ceiling and its vibration of disaster flowed from point down shaft to gripfrom kissaki down to nakagoand in the second he lost the hairy one squirmed right spun the gun and it erupted he did not feel himself fall he did not feel his legs what he felt was that hed been drenched in hot steaming water the pain soon localized into three bad sites and his fingers clawed at them to hold the blood in but he could not he lay on his side his knees up feeling his life drain away he felt the american on him he felt the pressure of the other body he felt the hands go to his neck he cuts my throat his hands bunched at his stomach his elbows drawn in he suddenly realized he had a whisper of advantage for his enemy considered him dead already and in that second his elbow achieved force and speed and it slammed hard into the mans face just under the eye driving him back and again the captain elbowed him in the face driving him back still more in a moment of stunned weakness the captain liberated from the weight of the man drove himself at him they rolled in the dirt the captain seemed to get his hands around the americans throat but a punch arrived from nowhere breaking his grip knocking out two teeth he slammed the american under the eye with the palm of his hand feeling the blow strike hard hearing the other man grunt they pounded into each others torsos with fists and open hands their sweat fell on each others faces they tried to find leverage bracing against the floor he knew he would die his strength was ebbing and the pain in his guts rose gradually the stronger american seemed to prevail but the captain thought of kendo of perfect emptiness and found a blow to the throat and the man jacked upright lost his grip and somehow the captain put strength in it then took it away and the americans own strength toppled him so the captain slithered over him and was atop him in terrible intimacy his right hand flew to the leather haft of a knife the american wore on his belt he snatched it again feeling the friction as the blade freed itself from a metal scabbard he rammed his wrist into the mans throat driving him back and continued on the roll thrusting the knife upward nesting it between two ribs so that it would slide easily into the central chest cavity the grip was wood or leather grooved heavily a little thick for him but he controlled it quickly enough securing it in his strong fingers he felt the knife point pressuring the skin the skin fighting then yielding as the blade penetrated a quarter of an inch two ounces more of pressure and he could thrust through to the mans heart and take one more with him earl was dead where did the scrawny man find the strength he looked into the japaneses eyes felt the pinprick of the blade of his kabar between his ribs and fought to get his hands around the mans throat but was too late i am dead he thought he got me he beat me he closed his eyes he felt the wrist heavy against his throat smelled sweat and oil and fish felt their two hearts beating almost against each other locked in the murder embrace the deadly point of the kabar probed his skin bent it down maybe drew a drop of blood it would slide in easily climb through lung tissue and find the clump of muscle called his heart oh christ junie i tried so hard the captain leaned into the knife hilt andstopped he saw on the ground next to the americans head a flexible metal tube with a syrette screwed to its mouth he realized instantly it was morphine the american hadnt been trying to cut his throat hed been trying to ease his pain he drew back it seemed suddenly wrong to kill a man who meant to save him but it seemed wrong to surrender to him too i wish i done gave you a child i am so sorry to leave you alone there wasnt no time i had so much to tell you but he felt an immense liberation as the pinprick went away and the man somehow heaved himself off earls body and lay a foot away breathing hard a smile came to the mans grimy face samurai he said then he reversed the heavy war knife plunged it into his own neck where a major artery carried a river of blood to his brain the jab was expert and the blood spurted out in a bright and gaudy fountain in eight seconds his brain had devoured the oxygen and glucose that remained and his eyes closed he killed himself susan said yeah dad told sam he thought the guy may have seen the morphine single he was trying to inject it was right there on the floor next to them or maybe hideki yano had had enough killing or maybe he was saying im the better man i can kill you or not and then i can embrace death whatever my father always felt hed lost that battle the japanese officer won it and for whatever reason in the middle of a battlefield the worst battle on earth the most dangerouson a moon of hell as someone called itthe officer let earl swagger live thats why my dad gave up that sword maybe thats why he never talked about the medal and also because of that earl got to go home where he got his wife pregnant and they had a little boy called bob lee and how mr earl loved that boy and helped him and taught him so bob lee not only got his own life in the deal he got nine more years with his daddy who was a great man and thirtyodd years down the worthless road bob lee himself got a daughter out of it and shes a great one too it all goes back to the decision that japanese officer made in that pillbox so you could say bob lee he owes the yanos something big call it on call it whatever you want but what he owes them is everything he does said susan bob looked at his watch it was am okay she said samurai up chushingura the last thing swagger said was when you hit the ground wait a second then pull down your goggles and go to night vision but in the onetenth of a second of fall she forgot and she landed with more thud than she expected it was seven feet she felt her body elongate to full extension then accordion shut with a bang when she landed snapping her head hard enough to drive bangles and spangles before her eyes she could seenothing it made no sense light and dark nothing focused nothing where it should be all confusion her will scattered and gone goggles whispered swagger who had come down beside her she got the goggles downpvss shed had a day on them at a delta force counterterror workshop at fort bragg a few years agoand hit the toggle which was no longer where it should be but an inch to the right evidently resettled on her head in the landing this led to another moment of confusion but then she got them aligned right and it all popped to things were beginning to happen it was a green fuzzy world still she made out the house to the left a glowing amoeba seemed to be disintegrating before her eyes it was tanadas rear team coming hard over the back wall in fact most were down pausing only to withdraw their katana then peeling off individually to the left rear meanwhile to the right the same optical phenomenon reiterated itself this being fujikawas front team maybe a tad behind the curve but peeling right she swept the house saw nothing but then the front door opened and she saw a man with a rifleak she idd it again from her bragg tutorialand behind her she heard the sound ofwell of what it was light a wet piston floating through the grease of a hydraulic tube nothing sharp but surprisingly vibratory it was a silenced rifle wielded by sniper kim and before the sound had even dissipated the rifleman went down as if someone had cut his knees and they no longer held and he just flopped down hard and fast she realized i just saw a man die house clear came the voice of kim from above at that moment a series of bright flashes syncopated to hard pops lit off in the basement of the house as the first team of intruders had gotten their flashbangs into the area where the yaks were go go said bob but she was already on the way low hard cutting directly across the courtyard to the house reaching it and sliding along it she felt swagger beside her she reached the open door stepped over the body of the guy with the rifle and clutching her wakizashi in her right hand ducked inside captain tanada was not the sort to direct he was the sort to lead so he hit the ground and took off and fuck anybody who couldnt keep up with him but that got him close to the rear of the house first and he pulled his flashbang got the pin out and almostbut not quitelaunched it through the window he got himself under control four other men reached him and to each he gestured with the small munition and each duplicated his move flashbang out pin out lever secured each man placed himself next to a window and in the next second on tanadas nod each shattered the window with a padprotected elbow tossed in the illumination device and peeled back withdrawing katana from scabbard waiting for a target the things went off almost simultaneously not in concussive explosionthey werent bombs after allbut with a harsh bang and a white phosphorous flash that blasted anyones night vision to pieces you could be forgiven for thinking that the devil himself had chucked a nuclear device through the window they caused one of two responses utter paralysis or complete panic four of them quadrupled the effect in a second the first man came out unarmed and tanada hit him with the hilt hard in the head two more came out one to be conked the other took a roundhouse slash at tanada who neatly evaded and watched one of his men hit the yak with a hard diagonal cut left to right so that he jacked pirouetted dropping his weapon and went down spurting blood and then suddenly it was happening exactly as the men had dreamed about and believed they wanted exactly as had not happened in japan except on movie sets for more than a century the yaks poured from the house and began to spread out each unleashing a sword and the soldiers moved forward to engage them a kendotothedeath in dull light as the snow swooped downward the cuts hard and serious and meant to kill the evasions equally hard and serious and meant to avoid the whole thing happening in slow motion and fast motion at the same time tanada killed two men in a single second as they came at him his technique superb kesagiri on the first diagonal a flowing block from the second assailants kesagiri which led quite naturally into a horizontal yokogiri with four inches of blade opening eight inches of body the destroyed man made a gasping sound tried to step back and fell tanada looked about and saw war everywhere and was happy then he got back to work nii was dreaming filthily completely in anatomical detail dreams that would shame most but only gave him a boner the size of a v but then the v exploded and he came hard awake in time for another v explosion then a third and a fourth around him he heard screams starts lurches men jumped some wailed some grabbed weapons the door was open and someone rushed out and nii caught a glimpse of him brought down with a wicked blow attack he thought his mind dumped clear and empty he had a moment of stupendous confusion as all his reflexes broke down two more then two more explosions went off but after the first he got his eyes shut and buried in his fists when he opened them the big room was half empty he saw a man jump in blade whistling and take one of his friends down with a single blow and in the ferocity of the blow he knew there was no mercy this night it was to the death more men flooded the room blades slicing the air cutting through meat killing someone threw a charcoal hibachi at an invader who ducked and killed him with a cut across the belly nii rose to fight then remembered his mission kill the little girl it wasnt a judgment call it was what he owed oyabun it became the only thing in his life that plus the fact he would fuck her first then kill her then commit his beloved seppuku and go happily to his ancestors his honor restored he rose grabbed his sword and as men surged forward and death and chaos were everywhere he cut against the tide found the steps and rushed up one flight then another and entering the upper hallway saw that so far it was empty he counted the doors which were popping open and men were pouring out until he reached the door to the white room that contained the little girl he got out his key and fumbled to insert it major fujikawa saw that the plan was not quite working that is to say the congestion point seemed to be the doorways where the violence was sharp and ugly and the whole thing coagulated into a subway platform at rush hour with swords not pretty he pulled out a whistle there was no plan in the hurried assembly of assault details this one had not been considered but he understood that his people couldnt kill efficiently enough at this rate he blew the whistle hard and watched as dozens of eyes popped to him let them out goddammit he screamed then kill them what a good idea everyone understood and the crowding at the doorways immediately broke out as the raiders made way and the yakuza spilled out into the falling snow there was a moment of near poetry if the death even of evil men can be considered poetic someones flashbang went off in the crowd of fighters it was a moment with the snow falling in the gentle japanese fashion and behind the screen of lulling white men were briefly isolated by the flare of white chemical light in postures of attack and defense the cuts stopped in midflight so that the whole had the clarity of one of kuniyoshis woodcuts an orchestration of muted color and delicate grace though applied to the subject of maximum violence fujikawa wished he had seventeen syllables at his command to press into a poem but then he remembered he was a soldier and he rushed forward sword in hand looking eagerly for someone to kill aware that the chance to fight with a sword would never arrive at his doorstep again and hed better take advantage of it the raid caught the great kondo in an unfortunate position he was in the shower performing ablutions readying for the next days events when the first bomb went off followed by three more his first thought fuck he knew immediately that by some magic the gaijin had located them he had a moments rage for the fellows guile and wondered who had helped him and imagined their heads on the table next to the gaijins he got out threw on his robenaked they caught me nakedand edged quickly to the door his bathroom was on the second floor above the living room he edged down the hall looking for a view of the events to decide upon an action though he couldnt see much he noted shadows on the wall from a stairway leading downstairs the violence of the shadowwork dancing hard on the wall conveyed the violence of actuality then another flashbang went off by chance hed been looking directly at it and the brightness stunned him he could not think he could not see he was defenseless fuck he knew he could not retreat into the bathroom for to do so would equal his death or his capture actually the same thing yet he could not go back to his room where his swords were because he could not see he heard the rising screams and smashing of fists flesh and swords as the fighting rose and knew that his men had been engaged by a force as large as they he yearned to rush to his swords claim them and turn whirling with violent purpose into the melee cutting and cutting and cutting knowing that he could turn the tide but he was blind he thought the bathroom window it was a low dropsay ten feet to earth blindly he groped his way back to the bathroom window slid it open tried to remember exactly where the bathroom was with regard to the floor plan of the estate realized that thinking cost him time and he had no time so he launched himself forward fell through cold space and hit the ground with a thud theres one someone said grab him in seconds four men had him give it up brother we wont kill you if you surrender dont hurt me he said going limp and sad i am a cook please i only work here dont hurt me miwa tried to be calm he listened to the general roar outside and understood what was happening his only thought was to escape but of course he was too frightened to attempt such a thing on his own therefore he assumed that kondo the everloyal retainer would come for him after a few minutes he realized that kondo would not come for him cursing his luck he crawled to the doorway slipped it open half an inch and saw the same shadows on the wall that kondo had seen they really frightened him he fought panic he thought if i can hide i will survive they cannot stay long they must attack kill then flee i will never escape but i can hide on all fours he scrambled down the hallway found steps downstairs and like a snake slithered down into darkness please dont hurt me i am a cook kondo said as the arms locked him down and someone pinned his arms hes nothing said a raider akira take him to the courtyard well continue three of his captors dashed away to join the general melee still intense behind them come on asshole said the remaining raider get going christ youre not even dressed you poor son of a bitch true he wasnt dressed but kondo blinked and watched as the strobes flashing in his brain shut down he blinked again watched vision assemble itself out of sparkly chaos and he found himself alone in the backyard with his assailant his arm pinned behind him as he was being roughly driven ahead sir my arm he said shut up said the raider or perhaps meant to say but somewhere between the sh and the ut kondo got leverage hit the man with a lefthanded dragon punch out of the most basic aikido text knocked the man to the snow then drove a palm into his temple with a thud not knowing whether hed killed him or not he felt the man collapse with a groan he snatched up the mans sword a good utilitarian cutter and went to the wall he was over it in a single bound lay on the other side breathing hard waiting to see if anybody had followed him no he stood naked but for the robe and ran barefoot through the snow he found a nearby house broke a window and entered he raced upstairs to face a scared man and his wife in bed you stay there or ill kill you now i need some clothes and a cell phone nii got the door open and stepped into the white room all was dark to the left he recalled a light switch and not thinking clearly popped it the room leapt to view all its detail brilliantly exposedthe knotted bed the television the painted white window all of it white white white but where was the child a bolt of panic knocked through him then fear he could not fail he ran to the bed pulling it apart to find nothing dropped low and looked under it saw nothing then he thought to touch the sheets found them warm shes hiding you fool he thought he raced to the closet pulled it open finding nothing that left only the bathroom he ran to it pulled the door it was locked from within thats where she was little girl open the door you will be in big trouble if you dont open the door little girl do what i say damn you the door was silent and still outside the din of fighting rose to a still higher pitch the grunts the shouts the cries of being struck the thud of strikes a part of nii yearned to join the battle but he had duty little girl little girl i am getting mad but the child said nothing all right he said youll be sorry with that he drew back and with his katana began to cut at the door which being a cheap and typical modern product quickly splintered under the assault he watched it dissolve with three or four great whacks and when a ragged gap had been cut through it large enough for his shoulder and arm he reached in found the lock and popped it then he heard someone shout back off fatso he turned furious and found himself confronted by what appeared to be an actual mutant ninja turtle donatello or maybe one of the others leo raph that is to say his antagonist was unusually tiny and thin dressed all in black and had a single eye protruding from a mask suddenly the turtle reached up and flicked off its heavy eyepiece and as the thing flew away it pulled the hair loose and the hair cascaded free a dark torrent long and beautiful and nii realized he was facing a woman bitch he screamed at her susan leapt through the door her night vision goggles captured exactly what lay before her to the left were big rooms and from them rose the racket of battle a humming throbbing fusion of grunts that men made involuntarily as they came together and tried to dominate each other before her on the right a short stairway led up to a hallway while below it at this level another stairway led to bedrooms and the like down which hall certainly the top one they wouldnt put a prisoner even a small child at ground level up she went in one bound swagger just behind her they were met at the top by three men but they werent combatants they were fleeing in panic so susan and her companion stepped aside as the threecooks possibly or accountants hard to tell as they were in pajamasraced outside to be secured by raiders but suddenly two men came at them from the left and they were yakuza beside her swagger leapt forward evading a cut and clocked one with his elbow hard sending that boy to the floor in a heap and was then so close he had no room for swordplay and instead grappled rolling against a wall kneeing his opponent slamming him several times hard against the wall go go he shouted susan peeled off from the struggle kicked in the first door found the room behind it empty sped down the hall to another kicked it another empty one then heard screams and shouts from ahead she raced to a room whose door was already open and from which bright light flowed like water she ducked in and beheld a strange sight amplified by the night vision goggles though it was completely illuminated already a large man was brutally cutting a closet or a bathroom door to ribbons in a frenzy his blade splintering the thin wood he was screaming little girl come out little girl you must obey me or i will hurt you little girl you must cooperate or i will be very very angry susan stepped in back off fatso she commanded he turned to her his face bunched into a sweaty rage he was large and green then she realized she was still wearing her night vision goggles and she tore them off feeling a slight snare of pain as one of the straps caught in her hair her womanhood seemed to enrage him even more bitch he screamed cow she replied swagger found himself in a room with six men evidently some kind of security guard for the upper floors he flailed about driving them back now they faced each other one on six in the relatively close confines of the small room oh shit he thought wondering if he had a chance against six without willing it he went into full aggression mode going quickly to jodankamae right side and stepped forward ready to issue from on high feeling that pure force was the only solution to this tactical problem it was but not in the way he imagined his war posture the ferocity of his fighting spiritthe moon in the cold stream like a mirrorand his eagerness to cut people down immediately melted the will of his opponents six katana dropped quickly to the floor and the men fell to their knees wishing to offend him with their lives no more this was fine it was even an ideal outcome for at this point killing seemed pointless but it left him with the problem of administering to six prisoners he ran to them reaching in his pocket for the yellow plastic zipcuffs and discoveredshitonly four he worked around behind them until he ran out of zips it was twohanded work and he had to wedge the muramasa katana between his arm and body with each man he shouted kondo isami each man looked at him with fear redoubled in his eyes and his face yet paler by degrees if they knew kondo it was only by reputation ach the assault clock continued to grind on the seconds falling away as bob struggled with these boys of no consequence but still men who couldnt simply be released at any moment they could have turned on him the six on one and knocked him down and killed him but there was no fight at all left in them and after still more time he had them all neutralized four in the restraints two tied in their own obis not that such binding would hold but it was symbolic of surrender he pushed the first one out pointed down the hall and marched the small parade to the stairway from which the front door was visible possibly outside the fighting had died down as the din wasnt so loud he pointed again watched them file out to their fates suddenly he heard screams male and female signifying the coming together of two warriors at deathspeed one voice was susans outside suddenly it was over the blades stilled the grunts died the spurts of harsh breath rising like steam all finished only the snow continued its drift downward settling in increasingly delicate piles on the brick courtyard everywhere fujikawa looked the men had ceased to be opposed by the enemy some of the enemy were down with red smears across them or lay still in large puddles where blood and snow had fused to slush more however were on the ground either tied or obligingly raising hands to be tied secure them he yelled pointlessly for that process was already happening snipers the snipers were still perched on the walls hunting for armed targets in the house the calls came quickly sniper one clear sniper two i have nothing sniper three all quiet sniper four no targets secure the compound the major yelled again more ceremoniously than to real effect for his wellschooled men had already begun to spread out and hunt for the hidden the missing the escaped he watched as tanada came around toward him secure major said tanada yeah here too sergeant major kanda the sergeant major whod had a fine old time laying about with a boa fourfootlong stout fighting stickstood up from securing the yaks hed clobbered solidly yes sir get a head count yes sir the sergeant major ran off to consult with various squad leaders i cant believe it went so fast said tanada major fujikawa looked at his watch it had taken seven minutes any sign of miwa or the child swaggersan and the american woman are inside get them some help fast yes sir his rage flared kill smash crush all his anger turned chemical the chemicals went to his muscles which inflated with strength and resolve he would cut her in two he would destroy her he ran at her and she at him his sword was high and he meant to unleash hidari kesagiri diagonal cut left to right exactly as all those nights ago hed seen his oyabun perform it on the korean whore and he visualized it more clearly now the progress of blade through body the stunned look upon the face the slow slide as the parts separated agh he let fly and felt the blow form itself perfectly and issue from above with superb speed and violence as driven forward by the grunt which propelled oceans of air from his lungs she was quick the little bitch and he missed her by a hair as she slid by but he recovered in a split second improvising brilliantly he snapped his left hip outward and felt it smash into the running woman who was so light that its momentum flung her through the air she struck the wall with a satisfying crash she must have hit it midspine for her arms flew out spasmodically the sword in her hand flipped away her face went dull with momentary shock as she began to slide down the wall toward unconsciousness now the end tsuki thrust he no it was english he halted daddys home he turned it was the gaijin it was the source of his humiliation he had a rare chance to erase a failure his warrior heart swelled with pleasure death to the gaijin he said then the child then this whore the reason you are fat the gaijin said is that you are full of shit nii rushed the man sword high issuing from on high and cut a large slice in the universe though alas the gaijin wasnt in it he spun went to a cocked position and thrust forward at the man with both hands he drove the sword forward to impale his opponents opened body and nothing halted him as he plunged onward and onward waiting for the resistance when at last the swords point passed through the flesh the point and the blade it led must have been very sharp for the flesh didnt fight it a bit he just kept on going then he noticed he had no sword the second thing he noticed was that the reason he had no sword was that he had no hands the gaijin had cut them at the wrist both neatly and nearly painlessly going into what yagyu called crosswind specifically designed against kesagiri and culminating in the direction cut through his two hands the gaijin had been the faster the blood did not fizz and spray instead far still from coagulation it squirted out in pitiful little spurts each driven by a beat of his heart he looked at them and wished he had a death poem he turned to smile bravely and then the world cranked radically to the right and went to blur and he had a sense of falling but no sense of body then his eight seconds ran out bob stepped back from the carnage he had wreaked the fat ones body lay in the bed where it had emptied a great red tidal wave across sheets and blanket the head had bounced and rolled somewhere else then he picked up susan who moaned as she came to oh christ she said its okay he said wheres the child the bathroom bob turned went to the bathroom reached in the gap found the lock unlocked it and entered honey honey are you here sweetie where are you tin man tin man cried the girl in broken english here i am sweetie he ran to miko who crouched in the bathtub and picked her up and squeezed her hard feeling the tiny heart beat against him will the giant monster hurt me swagger spoke no japanese he just said its all right theyre all gone oh tin man now listen sweetie im going to take you out of here all right everything is going to be just fine the child spoke in japanese but then susan was there dont let her see anything susan said i wont susan spoke in japanese you have to make us a promise yes maam i will carry you but i want you to close your eyes very tight and press your face against my chest until i tell you its okay itll just be a minute or so can you do that for me then well get some ice cream i dont know where but well get some ice cream yes auntie will the tin man come yes he will she said in japanese and to bob said she thinks youre the tin man she picked the child up and turned all closed now yes auntie okadasan stepped from the bathroom and immediately saw two of her snipers carrying their ms at the ready standing there to escort her to the car and then to wherever you did good cheerleader said swagger so did you redneck she said and carried the child out miko obediently kept her eyes shut and never realized that the room was no longer white edo justice he reached the compound just as the buses that would take the raiders out of the area pulled in he walked to fujikawa what are your losses major we got out clean a few bad cuts now stitched a few concussions sprains a lot of bruises that sort of thing the worst was a trooper knocked unconscious by a cook who escaped swagger knew who that would be how many kills fifteen lots of wounded though our people are stitching up the badly hurt yaks and getting plasma into them theyre pretty goddamned lucky another yak crew would have let em die sixteen i had to take a fat one down anyhow it looks like youll be out of here before light we have a last job he turned and gestured bob saw yuichi miwa shivering in a kimonobathrobe that exposed his scrawny old mans chest kneeling in the snow nobody was touching him or abusing him but his face was down and grave possibly you dont want to see this said the major ive already seen it this is the old way its the right way the men think so we voted it was unanimous he nodded to sergeant major kanda who approached with what bob recognized immediately a red silk sword bag neatly tied quickly major fujikawa untied it removed a blade in shirasawa that bob knew intimately as it was the blade his father recovered on iwo jima major fujikawa approached the kneeling man he spoke in japanese but captain tanada whispered the translation in bobs ear miwa yuichi this is the sword asano retainer oishi used in the fifteenth year of genroku to behead kira who had betrayed his lord its the blade that was presented to philip yano by this american and had become ancestral to the yanos by reason of major hideki yanos last battle with it on iwo jima it is the blade you murdered philip yano and his family to obtain for reasons of career and ambition you who have so much who wanted so much more i fujikawa albert of the first airborne brigade of the japanese selfdefense force and former executive officer of philip yano claim a retainers right by ancient tradition to avenge the death of my lord i do offer you a choice if you wish you may use the sword to end your own life and thereby in samurai eyes regain your good name and honor if not i shall execute you like a common criminal miwas chest puffed importantly do what you will just know you are killing a man of vision i will say that the deaths of yanosan and family were necessary i fight to keep japan whole and pure i stand for the old japan i fight the foreigners and yanosan as is well known had sided with the foreigners now you kill me that is your way i would not talk you out of petty vengeance that only attests to your smallness as men but when i die a part of japan dies let it be said i gave you my neck and in nights far distant many will regret what you have done and who you have killed the snow fell drifting this way and that covering all cloaking all sound the moment was silent even the prisoners secured on the ground watched with respect acknowledging the ultimate meaning of the moment the old man leaned forward stretching his thin neck for not merely the ease of the executioner but also for his own ease and the major set himself he offered his blade for cleansing a bottle of fuji was emptied upon it consecrating it then the major stepped into a fluid shinchokugiri the straight vertical and the polished blade sang in the cold air the separation was almost bloodless the head fell with the thud of a book hitting the floor then the body pitched forward twitched and went still a red flow began to print odd patterns onto the snow the major performed a quick chiburi flinging the blood off the blade to form a spray of red abstraction in a snowpile then someone began to play the starspangled banner it wasnt until proof through the night that our flag was still there that swagger realized he was the source of the music it was the ringing of the forgotten cellular phone that kondo had given him to manage his transit to the point of exchange he flicked it open its five thirty am as i said i would i call you we have some business said kondo isami we do said bob time and place please its not so far gaijin its next door over the wall quite a lovely place kiyosumi gardens turn left at the pond look to the left i await you on an island ill be easy to find im the one with the sword steel to steel swagger turned and strode out the gate the muramasa blade over his shoulder the folds of his hakama jacket tied back by a figure eight of rope around his shoulder his obi tight his creases still sharp he turned right on the little street walked fifty yards then diverted to the left through the open gate of kiyosumi gardens in the somber rise of light he entered a kind of wonderland light snow lay upon everything as did the utter tranquillity of dawn before him he saw the pond a flat sheet of reflection its surface broken now and then by the ripple of one of the ceremonial carp the size of trout breaking the surface in a flash of golden torso in one corner reeds still green because their verticality gave snow no purchase waved ever gently more on their own internal vibration than by any force of atmosphere across the way a pavilion ivory with a sequence of tile roofs and the elfin upturn of asian style over stout mahogany pillars and a sea of paned opaque windows supported its own mantle of snow the trees were variously dressed in white as well the pines supporting it the willows less cooperative and like the reeds still mostly green ducks cruised the big fish fed the snow lay crisp as sugar everything was etched to a woodcut geniuss perfection no modern buildings could be seen it was a haiku called garden am break of dawn he might have added he saw the man standing on an island to the left still a hundred quiet yards away swagger followed the path skipping over rocks where they transected a cove for a shortcut ducked under willows turned again to find a wooden bridge and crossed to the island the circle of earth lay possibly thirty feet across with a shore of rocks artfully arranged some glazed white in snow its trees were willows bent with their own load of snow the white on the green the whole painted magenta by ribbons of sunlight broken through and captured on the surface of the low dense clouds now and then a bubble popped as a fat carp came up in search of food or merely to belch kondo stood one hip cocked with a warriors utter narcissism like swagger he held the saya over a shoulder almost like a rifle a smirk marked the handsome face on the square symmetrical head he looked like a jazz musician ready for a riff or a ballplayer in the ondeck circle his muscularity held taut under a black formal kimono his radiant vitality almost a heat vapor off his posture so he said as swagger approached did miwa die well not particularly said swagger he gave some bullshit speech alas i heard it many times you swaggersan i know you will die well i doubt it said swagger i plan on screaming like a baby but since it aint happening for thirty more years it aint worth worrying about now the jibe brought a sharper smile to kondos confident face then he noticed something oh i see my father gave you muramasas blade he actually still believes in all that crap itll be a pleasure to give it back to him without comment this afternoon hell know what it means that will be my revenge on him oh what a warm family moment what hell get is a bag with your head in it if dads been helping that means he sent you to doshu i studied with doshu too its too bad you know you can only get so far with doshu youre limited by doshus imagination you better have more than eight cuts if youre going to last a minute against me and when i take your head doshu will hear too i wish i could see that you must be nervous you talk too much i come to fight not talk no i am not nervous i am eager this is a redletter day for me i didnt help miwa win his dirty movie election but so what as i say he was only a pornographer but i am about to fight and defeat a really great samurai as i have dreamed of for years then i will have defeated in proxy my father and as he is the living memory of samurai in japan i will have entered legend youre talking so much you must think you have all the time in the world i do and let me tell you why i have genius and genius always triumphs its the law of genetics i have a thousand years of swordsmens blood in my veins then i have experience ive fought man on man to the death thirtytwo times and won all i know what happens in a duel i have strength and stamina i have foreknowledge i know doshus style and the eight cuts he taught you and i can easily counter every one with either hand i also know your particular style the cuts are shaky except for your best migi kiriage and your footwork is always suspect said kondo swagger said you forgot one thing i cheat the swords came out fast like the flickering of a snakes searching tongue with doubled rasps of polished steel against wood loud against the silence of the dawn kondo was much faster he was so swift in the unleashing swagger knew hed been smart to keep his distance so that he couldnt be chopped down in nukitsuke the draw and fall ruptured before the fight had even begun the island afforded little enough room swagger thought that was to his advantage because the less he ran the more strength hed have the closer he got the better chance hed have if it became a running cutting thing like all the movie fights he was done when his gas ran low so why bother with the technicalities just to die tired trusting aggression his old friend he moved in quickly cutting the island in half bringing his blade on high right to an enemy that awaited on the balls of his feet bent utterly in concentration his blade thrust before him bob closed forgetting the swordsmans shuffle over the bare wood of a dojo this was in the real world over clumps of grass drifts of feathery snow the odd stone he launched forwardaiwith his righthanded kesagiri but the mercuryslippery kondo rotated out of swords fall repaying with a fast sideways cut very strong classic yokogiri but swagger with a speed he never guessed he had but knew he wouldnt have for long got his blade up in time to turn it away as the steel on steel hit an almost musical tone swagger felt the muscle and precision in the blow even as he turned it and got himself out of range for a second yes thats good close in finish it fast we both know you cant stay with me each second is a point for me i dont need to cut you down quickly to win merely to last until your arms fade the yakuza said that fucking smirk still on his face in that second he made as if to relax and exactly as bobs subconscious read the relaxation in his body he knew it to be a fake and in the next moment from the pose of muscular softness kondo exploded his move had no coefficient in nature it was beyond metaphor what swagger was doing still alive after that he never knew because something catfast in himself took over as his blade didnt fight kondos for the space but vacated pronto turning with a waylessthangood cut which kondo easily thwarted but kondo didnt press the advantage instead eased backward not bad slow imperfect but you still breathe let us try you again tsuki a straight thrust driven by lunge and locked elbows flew at his face a fastclosing raptor seeking his eyes or his mouth or his throat and it was only an ancient dinosaur brain somewhere in swaggers pelvis that saved him this time jacking his upper body back an inch beyond the gleamy tip of the katana then stepping to the right he tried the sideways cut yokogiri he cut something but it was only cloth agh groaned kondo deeply affronted and his rage transferred itself instantaneously to the wicked diagonal kesagiri which bob redirected just enough to miss him then came a thud as something hard plunged into bobs face it was the hilt as the enemy swordsman with not enough room to reverse and get his blade into play simply reversed and drove clubbing him hard in the face with his hilt knocking spiderwebs and fly wings and gunflashes into his mind setting him up for the kill but swagger wasnt ready for death yet and grappled the man bob chose the moment to repay favor with favor unleashing a head butt that caught kondo flush and would have knocked a lesser man to the ground but kondo used the energy to break away and reset the two stared at each other each gulping for air each taut face leaking blood each set of eyes bulging in the need for information kondo took a small breath you fight like a peasant he said i am a peasant bob replied now it was his turn for the tsuki the fast thrust though he aimed lower meaning merely to puncture heart and center chest and bleed his enemy dry the thrust seemed to take an hour he stabbed air withdrew took a feint cut to his left and knew that kondo wouldnt feint left then cut right the first time and so was stable and locked when a nanosecond later the withdrawal abruptly ceased and became another launch from the left he rode the strike tried to turn it to his advantage by stepping inside but although the sword was past him he had momentarily forgotten that his enemy had two arms and with his other one the guy roped him around the neck swagger drove backward then yielded with a tricksters cunning dropped to one knee and heaved the man over his shoulder bracing himself on his own blade to stay upright that saved his balance but it meant he was behind the curve in getting the blade back in play and by the time he was ready to cut so was the other man having rolled adroitly through the throw to arrive standing in a cloud of snow sprinkles his fall had raised his hair a mess bob shivered ordering some small pain to abate for the moment again you surprise me two minutes of fighting you have even drawn blood and youre still standing and spitting bob had no words for the man he yearned to nurse the terrific clout hed taken under the eye and now battled a new enemy beside the real one his age his lack of experience and his fear his left eye was swelling oneeyed he might as well be blind he gathered in some breath trying not to make it obvious and ran through homilies that might help him the moon in the cold stream like a mirror nah nada think of sex bad idea think of the scythe the smooth sweep of the blade through the clear idaho air but as he was reminding himself to think of the scythe a scythe came at him that hardpowered kesagiri what a magnificent thing it was maybe the best ever all power concentrated in four inches of flying yakiba and if he werent again lucky as hell it would have cleaved him clavicle to belly button and left all his secrets to spill out on the nice white snow inside the thrust he headbutted again at the same time trying to find enough play to get his own point into flesh but the butt was a glancing thing more of an ear slap and by the time his blade was where kondo was kondo was no longer there bob gulped christ he felt old and used feel fear i see it in your eyes you have accepted your defeat wonderful i can do it quick you wont feel a thing they just fall wordlessly without a sound ive never heard a cry the eight seconds of oxygen in your brain goes fast the pain never catches up with it bobs answer was yokogiri left to right driven by the proper ai because expelling the air in perfect timing hastened the blade he sliced the air cleanly in two a lesser man would have fallen in both directions at once kondo pirouetted into a new defensive position then stepped forward with a high kick and a hai and drove a superspeed diagonal at swagger who fortunately had a nervous system still enough in the fight to react and leap ahead in a blinding flash kondo unleashed another giant power cut this time his own version of yokogiri left to right much more perfectly formed than bobs much more elegant and worthy of a movie the wicked point of the blade cut bobs hakama sleeve and maybe an inch or so of skin swagger smelled blood his own that was a serious cut deep almost to the bone it needed stitches or it would bleed him out in an hour or so but it wasnt to guts or heart or lungs it took down no bone structures it didnt interrupt the flow of neurons it just fucking hurt he rotated leftward bumped into something hard the thin trunk of one of the ceremonial willows and maybe lost a step at that moment from utter repose kondo fired another yokogiri at him and he winced not fast enough to block too tired to duck but instead of opening his throat like a broken gutter the blade lost possibly a tenth of its speed as it hit the willow trunk glided through without breaking a sweat and then halted and withdrew a few inches from his face pretty cool said kondo you havent seen that in a movie have you indeed he hadnt suddenly snow on the willow leaves shook itself loose as the top half of the tree tumbled trailing spirals of snow swagger took a shot at kiriage the rising cut left to right his best option but it was too slow ive seen better said kondo really i think doshu would admonish you for that one bob gulped air no snappy patter youre spent that was your last cut you have no offense with that swagger lunged again tsuki hard but spent most of his energy in the thrust which connected with nothing except the void that kondo had so recently occupied swagger sucked hard for oxygen god where was his second wind swagger let me finish it no need to go out on a bad cut screaming your guts hanging out i can put an instant end to your suffering swagger responded to the offer with a diagonal issued from on high that was so awkward and poorly timed it was almost an insult to kondo it missed by what felt like seven yards he had almost nothing left just let me end it now fast and clean old lion bob didnt take the advice as expressed in shinchokugiri a vertical downward but badly out of timing and harmless if you didnt kill me early you arent killing me at all kondo said okay i offered i pay my respects this has been great youre a valiant guy but the partys over five hard cuts and youll only be able to stay with me through four i know you will die strong great samurai fuck you was all the blown mans wretched mind could come up with hai screamed kondo the blows came so fast swaggers eyes could not stay with them only the dying warrior reptile far inside took over his instincts and got soft parries on the first lefthand diagonal the second lefthand diagonal somehow got horizontal for a harder lowblade block on a vertical lurched to the right to dissuade the fourth now righthanded diagonal and dropped to come against the final side cut the yokogiri no time no gas no speed his blade couldnt catch up with the blur of steel that seemed to pick up acceleration as it vectored hard to his body it was perfect yokogiri with kondos full might and genius behind it and as he knew it would it flew true into the shred of opening under bobs lagging defense kondo had an image almost of woodcut clarity of what must happen next yakibatempered edgesheers through hip bone shattering it continues downward shattering the femur ball by the inevitable physics of its own impact reverberation then shatters the femur itself and with it nips the femoral artery that torrent of blood sundered the femoral deposits its fluid in midair in a fine and driving rush to turn the snow below to purple slush the blade itself far from spent cleaves through what remains of flesh breaks free its amputation complete and bob falls as he exsanguinates clinical death is possibly not instantaneous but certainly occurs within eight seconds yet even as his brain told kondo that must happen it did not happen instead odd vibrations of uncertainty came his way as he felt the cut stop hard and shallow and his own hilt torque wildly almost out of his hands though he was fast enough to recover even as an old adage somehow came to mind who said it where when why was it so familiar steel cuts flesh steel cuts bone steel does not cut steel he struggled to regain timing but was not quite fast enough it was the migi kiriage the rising cut left to right the scythe cut swaggers best honed on desert slopes under a hard and ceaseless sun for his part bad old muramasa was with it all the way his blade hungered for blood driving up from just above the hip through hoses and ducts and wet linkages and mechanics through a whole anatomy lesson of viscera splitting them wide so they could jetempty their contents upon the snow it wasnt swaggers best cut for it wore out at the halfway point before cutting the spine much less the lungs but even doshu would have counted it adequate he withdrew and seeing that which was far as if close and that which was close as if far segued rather gracefully from recovery into the next most accessible position which was kasumi mist a horizontal overtheshoulders construction supported on reversed wrists feel the fear at last bob asked and maybe saw a glint of it in the mans stricken face i am mortal i will die my time is up why why why bobs kasumi then transcended miraculously and of its own volition into tsuki not well aimed but well enough as it punctured and passed through kondos throat splitting his larynx and jugular halfsevering his spine and weirdly sustaining him in midfall for a halfsecond before withdrawal kondo toppled issuing fiery liquids from his ruptures his face was blank his eyes distant his mouth slack when he hit a reddened puff of snow flew up swagger stood back from the carnage and his hand flew to his hip where the steel inserted courtesy of a russian sniper in vietnam decades ago had stopped kondos brilliant cut it was swaggers only card and hed been wise enough to play it last the cut was precise butchery smooth but shallow and some black gruel pulsed from it but it wasnt geysering spectacularly meaning no artery had been cut bob got a pouch of quiklot out tore the top off with his teeth and poured the clotting agent into the wound knowing again that stitches were mandatory within an hour if he had the strength then he poured more on the bloodier cut on his left shoulder christ it hurt he retreated found his saya and stood for a second do it right he thought thank the fucking sword feeling foolish and white he held the weapon horizontally before him and bowed to the little japanese god inside the steel and said arigato as best he could then since the thing wore a dapple of disfiguration he snapped it hard to the right flinging its contents off to splatter an abstraction on the snowchiburi in the vernacular big in all the movies now noto he sheathed the sword as ceremony demanded drawing the dull spine of the blade through his left hand and fingers while clutching the sayas opening until he reached the tip then smoothly snared the tip in the opening then ran the wood casing up to absorb and protect the blade the whole move ending with a gentle snap as tsuba met wood his watch read am tokyo time he turned and looked at the body of the man he had killed kondo lay in a sherbet field of blood and snow and the spurting had stopped it was only drainage now somewhere a big fat golden carp came to a placid surface and seemed to burp leaving a widening burst of rings in its passing swagger looked back at the body he could have taken the head as hed promised but reallywhat was the point office politics she arrived at the american embassy promptly at because nowadays it took a good fifteen minutes to get through security she wore a new burberry pantsuit shed bought recently at takashimaya a smartly tailored pinstripe on gray wool a white silk blouse and pearls a pair of christian louboutin roundtoed platform pumps her armani hornrims her hair was pulled back into a severe ponytail her foundation lanvin her blush revlon her mascara shiseido she got to his office exactly at nine and of course he let her wait ten minutes a kind of humiliation ordealmore of which would be coming her way assuming she survived the next few minutes in any casethen he ushered her in so nice of you to join us susan doug im very sorry i doug had graduated from annapolis and though he had never had a command at sea his office was filled with nautical gewgaws like brass sextants charts gaffs in office lore it was called the bridge though never when he was around he was the sort of man who demanded results yesterday but then forgot to ask for them tomorrow sit down sit down she sat opposite he was a largeheaded redfaced beefy man ten years older from an old family that was by reputation thirdgeneration agency his hair was a brusque graying crew cut and he wore his suit jacket at his desk he was a wellstudied imitation of the man swagger represented naturally without selfconsciousness or reflection look i shouldnt have to give a pro like you pointers but goddammit i have to be able to reach you twentyfour hours a day thats why we have cell phones pagers the like it doesnt work if you turn the goddamn things off i didnt turn anything off i just didnt answer because i was in an awkward situation anything you care to discuss with your chief of station its all right doug it was a swagger issue i told you the swagger thing wouldnt work hes too old hes too slow hes too stubborn hes nothing but trouble like to hear you say that to swagger asshole but she played his game i know it was my idea to bring the guy back he proved harder to manage than i thought however now its fine its great ill have him out of country as soon as i can make arrangements he made some progress he i want a report first thing tomorrow sure is that all i oh no oh no its not over susan this isnt just more swagger bullshit that was just the start the issue is much more serious as in why the fuck did you send an unauthorized request to satd to orbital on seven houses and thirteen business locations in the greater tokyo area oh that yes that it was missionrelated there is a big flap at langley i made a judgment possibly it was wrong i had to confirm something fast with an egomaniac like doug it was important to show contrition defiance simply enraged him and enraged he was even more erratic than when calm tell me why it was so goddamned important for the birds to eyeball japanese mansions and warehouses when they could have been looking at north korean launch sites chinese naval bases taliban outposts or god knows what i have a guy who has a network mostly lowgrade stuff but you never can tell somehow he picked up a whiff that a certain ultrawealthy japanese national had sympathies in a certain direction and was unstable it wasnt enough for any hard action i didnt put surveillance on him i didnt discuss him with japanese intelligence because we knew hed hear i didnt try to penetrate or eavesdrop i didnt recruit within his organization but i decided on a looksee come on susan youre stalling why please doug there are a lot of tall buildings in tokyo if someone flew an airliner into one of them wed look foolish plus it would kill a lot of people i was trying to split the hair between being overreactive and being responsible i was trying to do my job i flashprioritized it over your signature because if you dont it takes weeks you werent around to sign off as i recall you can use that one to justify anything susan yes doug i know however what did you find out about mr miwa oh at langley they made the connect and how they are not pleased what did you learn well frankly nothing at one mansion there was what might be termed unusual activity that is a great many people vehicles a lot of movement outside in the courtyard possibly it was a business conference possibly a company retreat of some sort even some kind of reunion then it occurred to me since id looked into him that it might have been yakuzarelated i believe he has yakuza ties but the infrared picked up no concentration of explosives the spectroscope didnt indicate nuclear and we dont have biochem sensors yet susan assure me you didnt muss even slightly yuichi miwas hair hmmm susan wondered does cutting his fucking head off count as mussing his hair doug no entity under any possibility of my influence or under my direction has had anything to do with yuichi miwa we looked at him from three miles up thats all it couldnt have been softer or more discreet if anybody finds out its because of a leak somewhere nothing that i have done or caused to have done youre sure i was going to eyeball him from upstairs another few times just to make certain maybe id put some discreet feelers out thats it i was just checking doug sat back he looked immensely relieved okay fine good the man is not to be touched even watched he is to be utterly ignored of course strictly hands off do you understand of course until you figure out how to destroy him ahhh thats why theyre in such a frenzy at langley thats what this is all about he reached into his desk pulled out a large folder wearing the usual top secret stamps across its top the file on miwasan its come to our attention that some years back miwasan almost went under he owed yakuza he owed banks the whole thing was going away he convinced himself it was an american plot against him that the mafia wanted to crack japanese porn and to do so they had to destroy him he was japanese porn he was japan for gods sake so he turned for help to the enemy of his enemies the north koreans he told them if they helped him his newspapers would always sing their song they funded him they cant feed their own people but theyre giving millions to a japanese pornographer to produce dvds the likes of which i cant even begin to describe teacherblowsjohnny thank you susan i knew i could count on you anyhow he turned it around got in on the internet early found some disgusting niches pushed the technological edge made sharp investments and became a major major billionaire so your boys sense of him may be right we just have to coordinate all this and stay organized i have it now hes involved in some election for the king of pornography or something its all in here hes got to win that election hes got to find some way to make himself an institution hes got to do something big to get all the muckymucks and all the little people behind him she just smiled a bit nick had it a week ago he beat langleys bright boys by seven full days if he wins the next step will be the bestowal of something called the supreme order of the chrysanthemum on him japans highest civilian honor hes had lobbyists pushing that in the diet for months now now there was something new that will have the impact of instantly legitimizing him and itll gain him access influence and so forth hes a north korean agent hell be set to get them stuff on the japanese and on us theyve never gotten before do the japanese know this no one of our listeners is in north korea and if we tell the japanese they will understand we have a good north korean earhole then maybe someone finds that out from them do you see of course susan make up for your bad judgment on swagger and put it all behind you this will take all your creativity and imagination its your number one priority now you must figure out a way to derail the miwa express but you must do it in a fashion that leaves no footprints to us we must appear entirely innocent and uninvolved but he has to go down before his big pr push makes him legit and the emperor gives him that award youve got to somehow move through japanese entities perhaps in ways that they themselves wont even recognize it wont be easy you have somehow got to do it susan your job and my job depend on it whats the time frame susan asked well youll need a week or so to recon and develop some sources another to come up with an operating plan well have to get it approved then youll have to staff it youve got at least three months no more i know its hard but sometimes we have to do the hard thing okay said susan suppose i can bring it off byfour thirty this afternoon what susan this isnt a joke this isnt doug do i look like im joking iwell arent you overconfident doug youre scheduled to rotate back to langley in the spring are they going to bring in another stateside tool to be head of station susan thats not fair focus doug nothing personal but im so tired of answering to tools by four thirty today doug all right and then by five thirty youve sent the first of many many wires in which you single me out for extraordinary praise and recommend to all your oldfart buddies i get head of station here do we have an understanding what do you know that do we have an understanding actually the announcement of miwa yuichis death of natural causes came at she beat the deadline by an hour and five minutes noto he came out of unconsciousness on the second day and floated through a semiconscious state aware of bindings on many parts of his body aware of the ceiling of the occasional japanese medical staffer and the slow passage of time on the third day he could sit upright and some clarity and memory returned on the fourth more clarity more memory it was around then that his japanese caretakers were subtly replaced by two cleancut american boys whom he took to be on no evidence except that they called him gunny navy corpsmen working in mufti they were good kids though and who knew from what secret installation they had been assigned on the fifth his brain had settled enough so that he could watch the television he quickly discovered a nation inwell not exactly mourning but something like morbid fascination perhaps a sense of mass irony perhaps a secret pleasure in the tragedy of the other this was occasioned by the sudden death of yuichi miwa aka the shogun one of japans leading geniuses of the silver screen the porn billionaire the founder of the aggressive shogunate av company and later publisher radio station owner media mogul playboy and nationalist crusader swagger watched without comment the coverage on bilingual tv news the man by rumors all but awarded the supreme order of the chrysanthemum had died suddenly of a stroke swagger was one of the few who knew whose stroke it was and with which weapon it had been delivered but watching swagger could tell the japanese werent that broken up about it not really miwa was after all a pornographer in any event soon enough the news passed from attention he managed to gain access to a laptop pulled up the japan times site and got the articles from two days after his fight on the island on the national page he found the brief item he was looking for an unknown body had been located in kiyosumi gardens presumably a yakuza or someone who had run afoul of the yakuza given the gravity of the cuts that had killed him a police captain was quoted expressing concern that while the brotherhood of the was frequently violent these crimes almost always took place in tenderloin areas such as kabukicho the captain worried that a corpse in the elegant historical glades of kiyosumi gardens indicated some new phase in criminal culture there was no other coverage no one visited him no one asked for a debriefing a statement a comment an account he simply lay there regathering his strength reading newspapers watching the tube eating cold eggs cucumber sandwiches and many kinds of fish and cutlets a week into it his wounds were checked rebandaged painkillers and more antibiotics provided and then he was declared well enough to travel the young men brought him a new suit as well as his fraudulent passport under the name thomas lee gunny im told that when you get to lax someone from state will meet you hell ask you to surrender this passport itll then disappear i dont know a thing about this but they told me to tell you that thomas lee will also disappear whos they oh you know the guys in the suits thats all i can say got you son he got into his clothes and assembled his meager possessionsthe passport the united ticket for the flight scheduled for pm that night the keys to his bike were missing it didnt matter the hospital insisted on a wheelchair and one of the corpsmen wheeled him ridiculously to the van a tan unmarked ford the cold air was like boise in january he climbed in slowly using his uncut arm and his uncut leg for leverage got everything gunny enough to get me back were off well get you there in plenty of time nobody talked on the long drive to narita it was essentially the second time hed been ejected from japan and he knew he was lucky he wasnt in prison the traffic the small crowded neighborhoods the driving ranges all fled by unremarkably and two hours later the low sleek hull of naritas no terminal came into view at the curbside he got out as did one of the corpsmen bens going to park the van i hope you dont mind but were supposed to stay with you till you get beyond security sure you have a job to do like everybody that ordeal went smoothly he checked in displayed his passport got his boarding passwell well the flight was first class so much easierand the two young guys took him to security this is always a pain he said i have a steel hip so bells go off no problem said one of the kids well help look he said is this it what do you mean well nobodys debriefed me nobodys taken a statement nobodys even asked any questions i dont know what happened to some people who were involved with me there was a little girl who gunny were just pharmacists mates we dont make policy this is the way they want it them again sorry gunny i just have to make sure this little girl is all right i mean she was just a kid i dont have any information for you gunny they didnt say anything ohokay okay so he turned to security and this time at least the bell didnt go off without ceremony he was through he nodded at the boys across the rope line and they nodded back but made no move to leave as this was the only exit clearly they were to stay until eightball swagger had safely departed he walked toward the gate skipping the mall area where a few months ago hed so memorably fallen off the wagon he feltwell what not satisfied not really old his wounds hurt his gait was stiff he needed another painkiller but at least he wasnt on crutches or in some kind of a chair he also felt oddly empty the light was gray and somber perfect for his mood used up useless spent irrelevant maybe even disappointed couldnt put a finger on it it was over was all back to the world deros all that good shit till the end he kept his hope up perhaps okadasan would show up perhaps shed have miko along and they could have a nice farewell chat that way thered be some finality to it some sense of ending but it didnt happen and then the flight was called the blade flew against the scrub bit hard and clean and sent a sheaf of cuttings flying through the air where a harsh wind sprayed them across the slope back and forth back and forth the scythe ate the brambles as bob found his rhythm leaning in uncoiling lightly and cutting he had to start over of course during the months in california and japan the slope had grown out now under a lowering winter sky you could hardly tell where hed cut and where he hadnt this was his fourth day here the air was raw and the wind sharp but on some principle that he could not name he had come back taken up the scythe and again laid into the long job that is not what is eating you julie said you dont give a damn about that slope something is eating you alive i can tell youd better get some help sweetie i am fine i started a job now i will finish it you should talk to someone about japan maybe not me maybe not anyone here in town but a specialist i have never seen you so low since the day you showed up in my front yard shot full of holes all those years ago bob if you dont deal with it thisll be the one that kills you nothing bad happened in japan he said everyone says it was a big success and that we got a job done now i am back everything is fine and i have this thing to do yes and you came home like you always do tired and sad with a whole new set of scars you only get scars like that in fights to the death but its even worse than that i can tell someone died someone you cared about and you dont have any way to scream about it honey youve got to find a place to scream there were some rough times yes some people died nothing i could do about it unfortunately but thats not it i have to tell you theres a child i wanted so much to help and i couldnt not really so shes lost not dead just lost thats all ill tell you more sometime not now well im sorry a child would be nice said julie liven this place up i might even love a child tired of living with a grouchy bear how much worse could a child be not even nikki whod come home for a spell could really get through to him something about a child that he didnt want to talk about has him all hurting her mother said and hes too goddamned stubborn to take a rest and get some help hell be all right you know him he comes back from everything but someday he wont and maybe that day has come no hes fine but even as she said it she didnt believe it her father was somehow therenot there at once as if a hole had been opened then lightly covered over a child what child could that be so the three lived in the nice house on the outskirts of boise and from a distance everything seemed fine the doting father the handsome wife the beautiful daughter now and then in town at a fine restaurant or off to the movies why it looked so fine there was plenty of money and the three of them so bright and attractive youd have thought those are americas aristocrats not of birth but of skill and strength they are so blessed with health and courage and even some wealth and so proud of each other they are the best we make he cut he cut he cut first day was the worst each cut brought an increment of pain his stamina was way down too and he wasnt as hard as he thought hed be hed lost a lot by the end of the first hour he breathed hot and hard through dry lips over the next few days it got a little better and by the third day he stayed out even as a squall blew through pelting him with ice particles it looked like today might bring more of the same though the heat hed raised was insulation against the rain and the cold in the distance of course stood the mountains dark to the point of purple their peaks lost in the low strata the prairies between them and him had turned yellow in the winter dried out and cleansed of wheat or let simply go if they were only grass so the whole earth had a yellowed used even dead feel to it yet it was so western nothing at all looked like it could be of japan or the east just rolling hills and plains and the scars of the mountains lost in the dark clouds thirty miles to the east it was about four when he saw nikkis truck what was that damned girl doing all the way out here hed driven her out to look at his land once late last summer before all this but shed not returned since and thered been no talk of a visit that morning or any other morning he was surprised she even knew the place for it involved a cutoff and a couple of unnamed back roads before it yielded the swagger retirement property maybe shed had a bitter fight with her mother and was pulling out early and stopped off for a goodbye it had happened before nikkis truck pulled up at the foot of the slope and bob came down to greet her he could see his daughter in the drivers seat laughing then he saw she had a passenger and the door opened and out climbed susan okada something went off inside him it might have been a sense of hope he took a deep breath well lookie here the lady from the embassy hello swagger i had to come my god its so great to see you you saved my life i never thanked you you saved the childs life i never thanked you the childs life is thanks enough fair enough you deserve a report on how it all shook out i been wondering well to start with the japanese government clamped down on it right away the fight the deaths never reported no scandal they got there and closed it all down they dont want it public it would take a lot of explaining and they dont like to explain but two days later major fujikawa and captain tanada surrendered to the authorities good lord yeah they felt they had to do it japanese thing dont ask whats going to happen to them not known yet depositions have been taken and all have been released on administrative leave while the government figures out what to do you might think eighteen men are dead including a multibillionaire huge deal but seventeen of the eighteen are lowranking yakuza who could have died in any of a hundred squalid ways and the eighteenth is miwa but dead miwa has no power no heirs no legacy and it turned out he had some unsavory foreign connections that made him very problematic finally the yakuza people dont want to upset the working relationship for vengeance since he wasnt really one of them im hoping that the whole thing will be brushed under the carpet the japanese are very good at brushing things under carpets can you help the officers theres not much i can do maybe itll work out at least they wont be ordered to commit seppuku thats something and how about you well it worked out to my advantage long story still classified but as i said miwa had some contacts that had lots of agency people worried and getting him out of the picturewell you got him out of the pictureworked out to my benefit im going to get a promotion im the new queen you were born to be a queen okadasan glad i helped still i have to ask about the child is sheis she all right shes better shes sleeping through the night i guess thats the important thing still i wish i had seen her one last time there at the end it was so crazy i just lost sight of you and her you just disappeared it was so sudden i got her back to my place and then we got her back into the system shes safe now i just hate the thought of her in that hospital shes not there anymore oh they found someone to take her well aint that nice i suppose thats all for the best she went on a long trip she went to gaijin there was no one left in japan we had to look hard to find someone to love her i hope its a good family i know its a good family swaggersan nikki she called and nikki climbed out of the truck delighted holding a wrapped but lively bundle that twisted in her arms mischievously and he recognized miko she looked over at swagger and her eyes filled with something miko its the tin man he came and rescued you he helped you so much the child looked at him then buried her shy eyes in nikkis chest then found the courage to look again decided it was okay and smiled hi there sweetie he said dont you look swell today oh youre a peach ill say here give her a hug nikki said handing the child over she squeezed him he squeezed her its so nice to see you he said to her now worried that his daughter and okadasan might see him cry big guys dont cry it was a rule its so nice that shes here he was trying to put it together somehow okadasan had taken charge of the child and was bringing herwell where you say that now but maybe youll change tunes in fifteen years when she brings home a boyfriend with fishhooks in his eyebrows okadasan said what its very tough for a foreigner to adopt a kid in japan but it turned out that miko tragically fit all the criteria when i found that out i couldnt just leave it alone so i went to the ambassador who went to the prime minister and maybe someone whispered something in someones ear about certain behindthescene occurrences anyway theres still paperwork to catch up on and some pro forma interviews but everybody concerned thought it was better to get her over here sooner rather than later and play catchup on the other stuff swaggersan say hello to your new daughter oh god said bob i dont believe this mom is so excited said nikki shes out buying a childs bed and toys and the whole shebang okay sweetie said bob holding his child closer its time to go home acknowledgments readers of the entire swagger saga will see that the account of earls heroics on iwo jima even as to date and unit have evolved slightly from previous accounts as i have progressed through what has become a lifes work i keep encountering small areas where the joinery between volumes is untidy and i can only plunge ahead correcting or reinterpreting as i go i count on your goodwill to understand that such awkwardnesses are unavoidable and make a promise that if i can ever convince a publisher to negotiate the complicated rights among the issues a trilogy in which each volume was issued by a different publisher and put the whole thing together in a uniform set ill try and reconcile all such annoyances i must also say that the great musashi oftquoted here said many provocative things about the art of the sword but steel cuts flesh steel cuts bone steel does not cut steel was not one of them it was hunter who said that sitting in his thirdfloor office in baltimore maryland this is another way of pointing out that no reader should impute to me any deep knowledge of the way of the sword im a writer not a samurai i tell stories i dont cut enemies down my weapon of choice is the adjective not the katana i based my accounts of sword encounters mainly on secondary sources a slew of texts and dozens of dvds of samurai films high and low i took swordcut terminology from shinkeudo japanese swordsmanship by toshishiro obata devotees will possibly be upset that ive mixed kendo and combat terms in my quest to give the encounters a different feel send angry emails to hunterdoesntcareaolcom i relied on friends for support and encouragement my old pal lenne miller gave me the advantage of his insightful enthusiasm gary goldberg did as much plus garythe worlds most advanced networkerset me up with dr david fowler the medical examiner of the state of maryland who gave me an hour of his time to discuss the biomechanics of sword cuts very helpful in a book as bloody as this one my pal and hunting pard and former collaborator john bainbridge gave me the gift of his great eye for proofreading jeff weber way out in california was uniformly enthusiastic and had a number of extremely useful insights i was happy to incorporate into the text james grady great navigator of the condor and a washington fixture also was a shrewd and helpful early reader as was jay carr the former film critic of the boston globe who in retirement has become a washington screeningroom regular and a good and valuable friend bob beers continues to maintain the unofficial stephen hunter website there being no official one what he gets out of it ill never know certainly nothing from me but hes made it into something solid check it out at stephenhunternet thanks again bob alan doelp as always was an invaluable advisor on computer issues in the world of the washington post four colleagues gave of themselves to my advantage the great kunio francis tanabe retired after forty years on book world advised me on japanese names and gave the manuscript a close reading he also wrote hideki yanos death poem after pointing out that my version wouldnt pass muster in japan anthony faiola the posts brilliant tokyo correspondent looked into and then briefed me on the structure of the porno business and its various governing bodies in todays japan finally tomoeh murikami tse took the trouble to render an early version of the death poem into kanji paul richard plied me with japanese art books im greatly indebted to all of them finally late in the process when news of the books publication had somehow reached the internet i received an email from mark schreiber a freelance writer translator and allaround manabouttown who has lived in tokyo since among his many accomplishments he is the organizing genius behind the tabloid tokyo books which compile some of the zanier tales of the tokyo weeklies for american readers mark volunteered to read the manuscript for accuracy in all those little areas through which hunter sometimes dozes and there were times when it seemed to me he was working harder than i was one weekend he went to kabukicho on a scouting trip found the ideal spot for kondo isami to test his blade measured it photographed it mapped it then emailed it to me that same weekend i drank watched football on tv slept and of course drank moreover he caught dozens of mistakes of the sort that would have deeply annoyed readers who were more familiar with tokyo than i was after a twoweek trip i should also point out that mistakes that remain are not marks fault or any of my other contributors but my own entirely as i said before angry emails may be sent to hunterwontrespondaolcom i should mention my professional colleagues as well all of whom were enthusiastic and supportive throughout michael korda and david rosenthal of simon schuster and my agent esther newberg of icm let me broadly thank the japanese themselves for being so damned interesting i must make special mention of my three muses sakura sakarada yui seto and shiho the dedication page expresses my profound gratitude to the artists of the theory and practice of samurai on the screen i should say also that in a certain way those movies saved my mind the origin of this book for anyone interested was a personal depression in my life as a professional film critic when american movies seemed to have reached a new low in this morass of mediocrity i saw yoji yamadas great twilight samurai and was instantly reborn that set me off on a twoyear samurai movie rampage interrupted by american gunfight and the obsession took its final form in the idea of writing a samurai novel set in the era of warring clans being smart enough to realize that a novel set then by a gaijin whod seen too many movies wasnt the soundest of ideaswhat would you call it memoirs of a samuraiso i tried to figure out a way to fuse samurai issues and fighting styles with a traditional american thriller the result you hold in your hand finally i must thank my wife jean marbella the worlds greatest trouper shes lived patiently for a year among swords samurai movies books on sword fighting sword making sword polishing and sword collecting all in piles spread randomly throughout the house and seldom policed never complained never whined and even pretended to be interested in sword fighting and yakuza what a gal about the author stephen hunter is the author of thirteen novels he is the chief film critic of the washington post and won the pulitzer prize for criticism he is also the author of one nonfiction book and two collections of film criticism he lives in baltimore maryland
