peter ackroyd the canterbury tales a retelling the general prologue here bygynneth the book of the tales of caunterbury when the soft sweet showers of april reach the roots of all things refreshing the parched earth nourishing every sapling and every seedling then humankind rises up in joy and expectation the west wind blows away the stench of the city and the crops flourish in the fields beyond the walls after the waste of winter it is delightful to hear birdsong once more in the streets the trees themselves are bathed in song it is a time of renewal of general restoration the sun has passed midway through the sign of the ram a good time for the sinews and the heart this is the best season of the year for travellers that is why good folk then long to go on pilgrimage they journey to strange shores and cities seeking solace among the shrines of the saints here in england many make their way to canterbury and to the tomb of the holy blissful martyr thomas they come from every shire to find a cure for infirmity and care it so happened that in april i was lodging at southwark i was staying at the tabard inn ready to take the way to canterbury and to venerate the saint there arrived one evening at the inn twentynine other travellers and much to my delight i discovered that they were all canterbury pilgrims they came from various places and from various walks of life but they all had the same destination the inn was spacious and comfortable enough to accommodate us all and we were soon at ease one with another we shared some ale and wine and agreed among ourselves that we would ride together it would be a diversion a merry journey made in good fellowship before the sun had gone down we had determined to meet at dawn on the following day to make our way along the pilgrims road before we begin our travels however i want to introduce you to the men and women who made up our company if i describe their rank and their appearance you may also acquire some inkling of their character dress and degree can be tokens of inward worth i will begin with the knight the knight as you might expect was a man of substance and of valour from the start of his career as a warrior he had fought for truth and honour for freedom and for dignity he had proved himself in warfare in many lands he had ridden through the territories of the christians and the countries of the infidel and had been universally praised for his military virtues he had been present when alexandria was won from the turks he had taken the palm of valour from all the knights of prussia he had mounted expeditions in russia and lithuania he had proved himself in granada and morocco and turkey where had he not travelled and where had he not been victorious he had fought fifteen battles and taken part in three tournaments these exploits were not for love of glory however but for love of christ piety guided his sword he considered himself no more than an instrument for god that is why he was despite his reputation for bravery modest and prudent in appearance he was meek as any maid and no oath or indecency ever passed his lips he was never insolent or condescending he was the very flower of chivalry in this springtime of the year he was a true and noble knight do you see him in front of you he did not wear the robes of office but a tunic of coarse cloth that would have better suited a monk than a soldier it was discoloured too by the rust from his coat of mail he had a good horse but it was not festooned with bells or expensive cloths it was the horse of a pilgrim he told me that he had come from an expedition in order once more to pledge his faith he asked me about myself then where i had come from where i had been but i quickly turned the conversation to another course he was travelling with his son a young squire a lusty and lively young man who also aspired to knighthood he was of moderate height but he was strong and agile it is said that the hair is a token of vitality the more virile a man is the more hair he will have his was knit in tight blond curls that flowed down his neck and across his shoulders he was about twenty years of age and had already taken part in cavalry expeditions in northern france in that short time he had made a good impression on his comrades but the only person he really wished to impress was a certain lady of his acquaintance i did not discover her name his tunic was embroidered with flowers white and red and blue it was as if he had gathered up a sweet meadow and placed it upon his shoulders he wore a short gown with wide sleeves as suited his rank he rode well and easily with the grace of a natural horseman he was always singing or playing the flute he wrote songs too and i learned that he could joust and write and draw and dance all the finer human accomplishments came naturally to him in his company it was always maytime he had good cause for high spirits he was so passionately in love that he could scarcely sleep at night he enjoyed no more rest than a nightingale yet he never forgot his manners he had been instructed in all the arts of courtesy and carved the meat for his father at the table when he spoke to me he took off his hat he did not glance down at the ground but looked at me steadfastly in the face without moving his hands or feet these are good manners the knight in fact had only one servant with him a yeoman who was dressed in the customary hood and coat of green cloth green is the colour of faithfulness and service he carried under his belt a sheaf of dainty peacock arrows keen and bright while in his hand he carried a bow he knew how to take good care of his equipment because the feathers were upright and the arrows flew to their target his hair was closely cropped and his visage was as brown as a smoked ham on his arm he wore a glittering armguard and by his right side hung a sword and small shield on his left side was a dagger in its sheath its handle richly ornamented and its blade exceedingly sharp this was a young man ready for combat yet he had a silver badge of saint christopher the saint of travellers as well as archers shining on his tunic i guessed that this yeoman when not dressed for battle worked as a forester on the knights estates he had a horn hanging at his hip from a broad belt of green i have often seen such a horn i told him in the woods and forests yes he said it rouses the buck then he rode on he was not a chatterer the prioress of course rode before him she was an exemplary nun who put on no airs of excessive piety she was amiable and modest and in the course of our pilgrimage she occasionally invoked the name of saint eligius since he is the patron saint of horses and of smiths she must have been wishing for good speed and a comfortable journey i should have asked her her name was madame eglantine and she was as fragrant as any sweetbriar or honeysuckle she sang the divine service with perfect pitch and intoned the sacred verses in a deft and sonorous manner she spoke french elegantly enough although her accent was closer to bow than to paris what does it matter if we do not speak the exact language of the french they are no longer our masters english is even spoken in the parliament house now the table manners of the prioress were of the best she never let any meat fall from her lips and she did not dip her hands too deeply into the sauce not a drop of it fell upon what i must call if she will forgive me her breasts she wiped her lips so carefully that not one smudge of grease was to be found on the rim of her cup after she had drunk from it and she was careful never to grab at the food on the table she knew that the manners of the table reflect the manner of a life she deported herself very well in other words and was amiable and pleasant in all of her dealings she tried very hard to imitate courtly manners and remained very dignified on all occasions she deemed herself to be worthy of respect and as a result came to deserve it of her sensibility there can be no doubt she was so compassionate that she wept whenever she saw a mouse caught in a trap even the sight of its blood made her lament against the rules of her order she had some small dogs that she fed with roasted meat and milk and fine white bread she never let them out of her sight in case one of them was trampled beneath the hooves of the horses or perhaps kicked by a fellow pilgrim then there would have been tears galore you can be sure of that she was all sympathy and tender heart you have seen a prioress before no doubt but she was a very model of her kind her wimple was carefully arranged to show her features to their best advantage her wellformed nose her eyes as bright as the glass that comes from venice her little mouth as soft and red as a cherry she was also eager to display the beautiful span of her forehead that token of truthfulness her cloak was well made and finely embroidered and about her arm she carried a rosary of coral with green beads that was not her only decoration she sported a bracelet of gold that was surmounted by the letter a and then beneath the legend amor vincit omnia love conquers everything i presume that she was referring to divine love i did not ask her about that either in fact she seemed a little cautious of me and i would sometimes catch her staring at me with a perplexed expression riding beside her was a nun who performed the duties of a chaplain together with three priests about whom i could gather very little information they were just priests and then there was a monk and a handsome one at that he was one of those monks who do much business outside the monastery arranging sales and contracts with the laypeople and he had acquired lay tastes he loved hunting for example he prided himself on being strong and firm of purpose he would make a very good abbot he had a stable of good horses as brown as autumn berries and when he rode you could hear his bridle jingling as loudly as the bell calling his fellows to chapel he was supposed to follow the rule of saint benedict in the small monastery over which he had authority but he found the precepts antiquated and altogether too strict he preferred to follow the modern fashions of good living and good drinking he loved a fat swan on his table he paid no heed to the injunction that huntsmen can never be holy men and scorned the old saying that a monk without rules is like a fish without water who needs water in any case when there is ale and wine why should he study in the book room off the cloister and make his head spin with words and texts why should he labour and work with his own hands as saint augustine ordained what good is that to the world let augustine do the work no this monk was a sportive horseman he owned greyhounds that were as swift as any bird in flight he loved tracking down and killing the hares on the lands of the monastery he looked the part too his sleeves were lined and trimmed with soft squirrel fur the most expensive of its kind he had a great gold pin to fasten his hood under his chin which blossomed into an intricate knot at its head that could not have been cheap his head was bald and shone as if it were made of glass his face glowed too as if it had been anointed with oil he was a fine plump specimen of a monk in excellent condition his eyes were very bright and mobile gleaming like the sudden spark from a furnace under a cauldron he was all fire and life a sanguinary man he was the best kind of prelate to my thinking and not a tormented ghost of a cleric he seemed to enjoy my company or rather he seemed to enjoy himself in my company he did not enquire about my life or my occupation i liked that and then there rode a friar he loved pleasure and any kind of merriment but since he was obliged to beg for alms he was still very resourceful he was not importunate but he was imposing of all the four orders however his was the most inclined to gossip and to flattery he had arranged many marriages and sometimes for reasons that i will not mention he had to pay for them himself still he was a pillar of the faith he was well known to all the rich landowners of his neighbourhood and he was familiar too with the worthy women of his town he had full power of confession which as he said himself was superior to that of an ordinary curate he could absolve the most awful sins he heard the confessions very patiently and pronounced the absolution very sweetly he exacted the mildest of penances especially if the penitent had something to give to his poor order bless me father for i have sinned and i have a large purse that was the kind of thing he liked to hear for as he said what is better proof of penitence than dispensing alms to the friars of god there are many men who suffer from guilt and repentance but are so hard of heart that they cannot weep for their sins therefore instead of tears and prayers these men must give silver to the friars the tip of his hood hanging down his back was stuffed full of knives and pins which he gave away to pretty wives whether he got anything in return i could not say i am only the narrator i cannot be everywhere at once i can say that the friar had a very pleasant voice he could sing well and play on the gitern or lute there was no one to beat him with a ballad i heard him sing grimalkin our cat he was excellent and when he played the harp and sang an accompaniment his eyes shone like the stars on a clear crisp night of frost he had skin as white as a lily but he was not lilylivered he was as strong as a champion at the shrovetide games he knew the taverns in every town as well as every landlord and barmaid certainly he spent more time with them than with lepers or beggarwomen who could blame him my position as a confessor he told me does not allow me to consort with the poorer sort it would not be honourable it would not be respectable it would not be beneficial i am more at my ease with the rich and with the wealthier merchants they are my congregation sir so wherever there was profit to be gained he was modest and courteous and virtuous to a fault no one was better at soliciting funds even a widow with no shoes to her name would have given him something when he greeted a poor householder with in principio he would end up with a farthing at least in the beginning was the coin his total income was higher than his projected income i will say no more he could frolic like a puppy and on love days when conflicts are resolved he was always on hand to reconcile opposing parties on those occasions he did not behave like a cloistered cleric wearing a threadbare gown like some poor scholar but rather like a master or a pope his cloak was made of expensive cloth and it encircled him as round as a bell just out of the mould he affected a slight lisp so that his enunciation seemed all the sweeter so as he said to me on the first evening god keep you in hith care oh one thing i forgot this worthy friar was called hubert among our merry company was a merchant with a forked beard he was dressed in an outfit of many colours just like the players in the mysteries and rode on a high saddle from which he looked down at me he wore a flemish hat of beaver in the latest style and a pair of elegant as well as expensive boots when he expressed an opinion he did so carefully and solemnly he was always trying to weigh the likely profit to be gained from it he commented for example that the sea between holland and england should be defended at all costs he was good at exchange dealings as you would expect and in fact this worthy gentleman was canny in every respect he was so dignified in his business in his buyings and in his sellings in his barterings and in his tradings that no one would ever know if he was in debt or not what a notable man funnily enough i did not discover his name i never bothered to ask him a clerk was there from oxford university he was what you and i would describe as a scholar he had studied logic for a long time without progressing any further he sat upon a withered horse that was almost as thin as its rider he was grave and gaunt and hollowcheeked he had obtained no benefices and he was too unworldly to seek for any profitable post as a result his coat was as threadbare as his purse he would rather have at his bedside twenty books of aristotle bound in red or black leather than any amount of rich clothes or expensive musical instruments he was a philosopher but he had not yet found the philosophers stone there was precious little gold in his coffers any money he could beg or borrow from his friends was immediately spent upon books and learning he was a bookworm he went down on his knees to pray for those who had paid for his education which was not cheap and he took the demands of scholarship very seriously indeed he never talked more than was strictly necessary and when he did speak it was in careful and measured tones he was brief and to the point but full of elevated sentiment he loved to discourse on problems of moral virtue like the lawyers he would begin put the case that but he learned from these debates too just as much as he contributed to them a great friend is aristotle he said to me but a greater friend is truth there was with us a sergeant of the law as wise and as prudent as any in that exalted position he consulted with his clients in the porch of saint paul s cathedral where he had acquired a reputation for judiciousness and discretion no one was more revered than he i am only reporting what i have heard of course but i do know that he often sat as a justice in the courts of assize that travelled around the country he was appointed by the king and in the letters patent he was granted full jurisdiction he received an annual income as well as private fees for his exertions his wealth allowed him to buy up land and of course he purchased it on the principle of absolute possession or fee simple that is the lawyers jargon there was no one busier than this man of law although in truth he seemed to be busier than he was he was all bustle and hustle he possessed all the year books in legal french so that he could consult cases from the time of william the conqueror by careful study of the precedents he was expert at drawing up the appropriate writs for each case if he made any mistake then the prosecution would be deemed to be void but he never made mistakes he knew all the abridgements and statutes and registers of writs how did he look he looked the part of course as all men must he wore a mantle of green cloth furred with black lamb and embroidered with stripes of mulberry and blue he wore a round cap of white silk upon his head he was dressed in the robes of authority there is no more to say a franklin was in our company a landowner free but not noble the beard of this freeholder was as white as a daisy and he was of redcheeked sanguinary humour that is to say he was vigorous and cheerful it was his custom in the morning to dip pieces of white bread into red wine it may have been a tribute to his complexion he was a true son of epicurus and thought no life more worthwhile than that of ease and pure delight he held the opinion that sensual pleasure was the goal of every reasonable man it was the secret of happiness itself he was a lavish host in his neighbourhood and worshipped at the shrine of saint julian the patron saint of hospitality his bread and his ale were always of the finest quality he had a wellstocked winecellar too there was no shortage of roast meat at his table there were baked pheasants and geese and wild fowl and pullets and pork there was fish served in green sauce partridges roasted in ginger peacocks with pepper sauce lobster in vinegar fried eels in sugar and mackerel in mint sauce the meals changed with the seasons but they were always plentiful the whole house snowed meat and drink he even had a pen for his birds and a pond for his fish so the food was always fresh and always renewed he would berate his cook if the sauces were not piquant and sharp and if the utensils the fleshhooks the skimmers and skillets the ladles and pestles were not prepared his table was always covered in the hall ready for use but he was not just a man of appetite he presided at the sessions of the local court and on many occasions represented the shire in the parliament house he had been a sheriff and a county auditor upon his girdle there hung a dagger and a silk purse as white as morning milk there had never been such a worthy freeholder i told him so and he laughed well sir he said i walk in the open way there were some worthy citizens among our company i saw a haberdasher a carpenter a weaver a dyer and a maker of tapestries all in the livery of their parish fraternity they were good guild folk with their robes freshly turned out their knives were made of silver not of brass while their belts and purses were of the best manufacture these were the citizens you would see in the guildhall sitting at the high table greeting each other with gods speed and god give you grace any one of them could have been an alderman any one of them had the income and the property to attain civic office their wives would have agreed on that point too and would have blamed them if they failed to take advantage of the situation these worthy women liked to be called ma dame they enjoyed leading the processions to the parish church on festal days bearing themselves with all the dignity of royalty these worthy citizens had hired a cook for the journey i tasted one of his meals a pudding of chicken marrow bones milk hardboiled eggs ginger and other spices that he kept secret it was delicious he knew all about london beer too and he could roast or broil or fry or simmer with the best of them he could prepare a stew and bake a pie with the same alacrity there was just one problem he had a large ulcer on his lower leg which wept and was unsightly still his chicken mousse was perfect you cant have everything there was a shipman with us hailing from the west country i imagine that he came from devon judging by his accent but i cannot be sure he rode upon a carthorse as best he could not being used to land transport and he wore a robe of coarse woollen cloth not being used to land fashion he had a dagger hanging from a cord around his neck as if he were about to encounter pirates the hot summers at sea had weathered him but he was a good enough fellow he had tapped many barrels of fine bordeaux wine when the merchant was not looking and had no scruples about it a ships cargo is not sacrosanct the sea was the element in which he felt at home he had acquired all the skills of observation and navigation he had learned how to calculate the tides and the currents and knew from long acquaintance the hidden perils of the deep no one from hull to carthage knew more about natural harbours and anchorages he could fix the position of the moon and the stars without the aid of an astrolabe he knew all the havens from gotland to cape finistere and every creek in brittany and spain he told me of his voyages as far north as iceland and of his journeys to the venetian colonies of crete and of corfu he called his bed his berth and his companions were his mates his beard had been shaken by many tempests but he was a sturdy and courageous man what is the broadest water he once asked me and the least danger to walk over i have no notion the dew his boat by the way was called the magdalene there was a doctor of physic also with us no one on earth could have spoken more eloquently about medicine and surgery he exemplified the old saying that a good physician is half an astronomer and he could identify all the influences of the stars he told me for example that aries governs the head and all its contents when the moon was in aries he felt able to operate upon the cheek or forehead taurus is the sign for neck and throat the bollocks or testicles or cod or yard apparently lie in scorpio this was news to me i thought that they lay in my mistress but enough of that i do not choose to display myself now this doctor knew the cause of every malady engendered in the bodily fluids some are hot and some are cold some are moist and some are dry but alas all things are mixed and mingled beneath the moon and then he discoursed upon the humours you he said to me are melancolius and a portion phlegmaticus i did not know whether to be alarmed or relieved he was in any event an excellent physician as soon as he knew the root and cause of any ailment he could apply the appropriate remedy he had his own chosen apothecaries to send him drugs and other medicines from which both he and they made a great deal of money the dung of doves was an excellent cure for sore feet and what was his remedy for convulsions sage well mixed with the excrements of a sparrow of a child and of a dog that eats only bones he was well versed in asclepius and the other ancient texts he could quote to you from galen and averroes and avicenna and a score of others he was in fact better versed in galen than in the bible but he practised what he preached he led a very temperate life and had a very moderate diet he told me that milk was good for melancholy for example and that green ginger quickened the memory he wore the furred hood and robe of his profession the robe lined with silk had the vertical red and purple stripes that proclaim the man of physic yet despite appearances he was not a big spender he saved most of what he earned from his practice the good doctor loved gold gold is the sovereign remedy after all it is the best medicine among our company was a good wife of bath she had such skill in making cloth that she easily surpassed the weavers of ypres and of ghent it was a pity that she was a little deaf she was also perhaps a little proud woe betide any woman in the parish who went up to the offertory rail with charitable alms before she did she became so angry that all thoughts of charity were instantly forgotten the linen scarves she wore about her head on her way to sunday mass were of very fine texture i dare say that some of them weighed at least ten pounds her stockings were of a vivid red and tightly laced her leather shoes were supple and of the newest cut her face was red too and she had a very bold look no wonder she had been married in church five times but in her youth she had enjoyed any number of liaisons there is no need to mention them now she was and is a respectable woman everyone says so she had made the pilgrimage to jerusalem three times after all and had crossed many foreign seas in pursuit of her devotion she had travelled to rome and to boulogne she had journeyed to saint james of compostella and also to cologne where the eleven thousand virgins were martyred there was no need for any more yes she had wandered and strayed far enough it is said that gaptoothed women like her have a propensity for lust but i cannot vouch for that she sat very easily upon her horse she wore an exquisite wimple and a hat as broad as a practice target she had hitched an overskirt about her fat hips and she wore a sharp pair of spurs in case her horse despaired of her weight she had an easy laugh and was affable with everyone she seemed to take a liking to me in particular and was very fond of discussing stories of lost love and of forlorn lovers she reached over and pressed my hand during the course of one affecting tale she had performed in that game before she knew as they say the ways of the dance that was the wife of bath there was also riding with us a good man of religion the poor parson of a small town he was poor in wealth perhaps but rich in thought and holy works he was also a learned man a clerk who preached christs gospel in the most faithful fashion and who taught his parishioners the lessons of devotion he was gracious and diligent in adversity as he proved many times he was patient he refused to excommunicate any of his flock for their failure to pay tithes to him indeed he would rather give what little he possessed to the poor people of the parish he did not earn a large income or collect much from the offering plate but he was content with what he had he had a large parish with the houses set far apart but neither rain nor thunder would prevent him from visiting his parishioners in times of grief or dearth he would pick up his sturdy staff and take off to the furthest reaches of his parish where he would bless both rich and poor he gave the best possible example to his flock perform before you preach good deeds are more fruitful than good words he took this message from the gospel but he added his own gloss if gold may rust then what will iron do for if a priest be evil what then might happen to the layman in his care it would be a shame as far as the priesthood is concerned if the sheep were clean and the shepherd had the scab a priests life must be a sign pointing the way to heaven only then will his parishioners follow his virtuous example so he did not hire out his post as a benefice he did not leave his sheep in the mire while he ran off to london seeking sinecures in the guild or chantry business no he stayed at home and protected his flock from the wolves of sin and greed that threatened it he was a true shepherd not a religious mercenary but although he was a holy and virtuous man he did not treat sinners with contempt or disgust in conversation he was never disdainful or haughty but properly benevolent and courteous he wanted to draw people to god with kind words and good deeds do you think he used to say that you can simply hop into heaven he was not so benign with men and women who were obstinate in sin he would rebuke them with stern words whatever their standing in the world barren corn he said to one of them is known as deaf corn a rotten nut is known as a deaf nut you are a deaf man i do not believe that a better priest could be found he never expected deference or reverence from those he met and he did not affect an overrefined conscience he simply taught and followed the law of christ and the gospel of the apostles he was gods darling i was in such awe of him that i scarcely talked to him he had brought with him on pilgrimage his brother a ploughman who had carted many wagons of dung in his time he was a good and faithful workman who lived in peace and charity with his neighbours he loved god before all things even though his own life was sometimes rough and painful and he loved his neighbour as himself for the love of christ he would thresh the hay or dig the ditches for a poor man who could not even afford to pay him he paid his tithes in full and on time in regard both to his labour and to his possessions he wore a coarse workmans tunic and rode on a mare the other pilgrims were a reeve and a miller a summoner and a pardoner a manciple and then myself you will be glad to hear that there were no others otherwise this story would become too long the miller was a burly man he had strong muscles and strong bones i would have said that he was bigger of brawn than of brain he was a bruiser too who always won the prize of the ram at wrestling competitions he was broad and squat with a thick neck he could knock any door off its hinges and would no doubt have excelled at that game the london apprentices play known as breaking doors with our heads his beard was as red as a sows tit or a foxs tail it was broad enough too to pass as a shovel there was a great wart on the top right of his nose with a tuft of hairs growing from it as thick as from a pigs ear his nostrils were wide like two great pits and his mouth was as big as a cauldron he carried a sword and a small shield by his side he seemed to distrust or dislike me and narrowed his eyes when he looked at me this was a trifle disconcerting in any case i considered him to be a buffoon he was always telling dirty stories about whores and other sinners i trust that i will never be accused of that he knew how to steal grain from the sacks and charge three times the amount he should in truth i do not think i have ever met an honest miller he wore a white coat and a blue hood he got out his bagpipes as we passed the boundary of the city and played a tune there was on our pilgrimage a manciple a business agent who worked for the inner temple i had studied there for a short time and we exchanged anecdotes about the wild apprentices of law i soon discovered his acumen however in the buying of stores and provisions he told me that cash or credit was good enough as long as the purchaser looked ahead and waited for the right moment the blacksmith always strikes he said to me when the iron is hot i thought this was an excellent saying i must remember it is it not an example of gods grace that such an unlearned man should outpace the wisdom of all the learned pates in the inner temple he had thirty masters above him all of them skilled in matters of law more than a dozen of them had the expertise to run the lands and rents of any lord in england so that unless they were out of their wits they could live honourably and without debt they had the knowledge to administer a whole shire through any crisis or danger that might arise but this was the funny thing the unlearned manciple had always got the better of them i will not say that he swindled them but many things as they say went under the thumb the reeve was a slender and choleric man his beard was closely shaved and his hair was shorn around his ears like that of a priest his legs were so long and so lean that he resembled a staff you could not see his calves but he was an excellent estate manager he kept the granaries full and the storage bins overflowing no auditor could ever catch him out he knew from the intervals of rain and drought how to calculate the harvests of seed and grain this reeve had complete control of the cattle and the sheep on his lords estate as well as the pigs the horses the livestock and the poultry i dare say that he even managed the worms he had kept the accounts under the terms of his employment since the time his lord turned twenty he paid out promptly too he knew every trick used by the farmmanagers and every excuse offered by the herdsmen and the servants they all feared him as they feared the plague he had a pretty little house upon a heath overshadowed by green trees in fact he could probably have afforded to buy more property than his lord and master for he had secretly amassed a lot of money he had learned how to take his lords possessions and then sell them back to him so that he obtained both compliments and rewards equally he could blear eyes better than any man in england in his youth he had the sense to learn a good trade and had become apprentice to a carpenter now he sat upon a sturdy horse it was a dapple grey and its name was scot he wore a long coat of dark blue cloth which was hitched up around a girdle by his side he carried a rusty sword but he had no need to fight anyone he was at peace with the world he came from norfolk he told me near a town called baldeswell i had never heard of it he said that it was close to norwich but this did not enlighten me much there is one other thing i forgot to mention he was always the last rider in our little group there was a summoner with us unfortunately he had the face of a fiery cherub covered with pimples he had swollen eyelids adding to the unfortunate impression he was as hot and lecherous as the proverbial london sparrow his eyebrows were scabby and the hair was falling out of his beard you could understand why children were afraid of him there was no medicine or ointment no quicksilver or brimstone no sulphur or cream of tartar no white lead or borax that could remove those unsightly pustules they were like oyster shells on his cheeks his diet may have had something to do with it he loved onions garlic and leeks which are well known to nourish bitter humours he drank the strongest red wine he could find and in his cups he would talk and cry out as if he were mad you are all janglers and clatterers he said he was looking at me at the time when he was completely drunk he would speak only in latin and one evening he sang out the old rhyme nos vagabunduli laeti jucunduli tara tarantare teino he knew two or three latin terms that he had learned from some ecclesiastical lawbook i will give you he said dispositio expositio and conclusio this was the kind of language he used when he summoned the citizens to the church courts and the local assize he had learned it all by rote but we all know that a parrot can say goodday as well as any pope if anyone ever tried to question him further then his well of learning suddenly dried up he would cry out questio quid juris which is to say what point of law are you trying to make and that was that he was a bit of a buffoon in other words but some swore that he was kindhearted for the payment of a quart of wine for example he would allow some rascal to keep his mistress for a year then he would excuse him completely in secret he could pull a few swindles and pull other things too if you know what i mean if he came across any other scoundrel in flagrante he would counsel him to ignore any archdeacons curse or threat of excommunication if a mans soul was in his purse only then would it be painful only the purse was really punished the purse he used to say is the archdeacons hell in that of course he was wholly wrong every guilty man should fear the consequences of excommunication just as absolution is the only salvation for the human soul the wicked man should beware too of the writ that consigns the excommunicated to the prison cell this summoner had the young girls of his diocese under his control he knew all their secrets and he was their sole adviser he had a green garland on his head just like those you see outside taverns and he had made himself a shield out of a loaf of bread as i said he was a buffoon riding in company with him was a pardoner working for saint anthonys hospital at charing cross he had come straight from the papal court at rome where he had been granted his licence for the sale of pardons and indulgences now he could carry his staff wound with red cloth and sing out oh one that is so fair and bright velut maris stella brighter than the day is light parens et puella the summoner joined in with a strong bass voice and their combined noise was louder than that of any trumpet this pardoner had hair as yellow as old wax hanging down his back as limply as a bundle of flax and draped across his shoulders it was very thin and was gathered in tufts and clumps he could have had rats tails upon his head they were all the more visible because he refused to wear any kind of hood the hood was considered by him to be out of date so he kept it in his knapsack with head bare except for a round felt hat he considered himself to be in the height of fashion he had the large and timid eyes of a hare on his woollen robe he had sewn small wooden crosses as well as the image of the saviour imprinted on the handkerchief of saint veronica his knapsack which he carried on his lap was filled with papal pardons smoking hot from rome if any man full penitent come to me and pay for his sin he said to me i will absolve him if anyone gives seven shillings to saint anthonys i will bestow on him an indulgence of seven hundred years i told him that i had scarcely enough money to pay my way he had a voice as high as that of a nanny goat he had no beard at all nor was likely to grow one his chin was as smooth as a girls arse he was either a eunuch or a homosexual a nurrit or a willjick as the common people put it i did not wish to investigate further yet as pardoners go he was effective enough in his bag he had a pillowcase which he told us was the veil of our lady he had a piece of the sail from the boat of saint peter he had a brass crucifix set with pebbles which he announced to be a precious ornament from bruges in a glass reliquary he carried pigs bones which he claimed were relics of the holy saints if they were dipped into any well the water from that well would cure all diseases so he said they did work in another sense whenever he came upon a foolish parson in the countryside he would wheedle more money out of him than the priest himself earned in two whole months so with feigning and flattery and trickery he made fools of the priest and the people he had one virtue it would be true to say that in church he was a notable performer he was the very model of a modern ecclesiastic he read out the liturgical texts during the mass and best of all he sang the offertories with gusto he knew that when the song was sung he would have to preach and so modulate his voice that he might win more silver from the congregation therefore he took care to sing merrily and loudly he was called the devils rattlebag now i have completed truly and i hope briefly my description of the estate rank and appearance of every pilgrim you know how many there were you know why they had come together in southwark you have been told that they all took lodgings for the night at that fine tavern known as the tabard which is close to the bell every tavern in southwark is close to another one but now it is time for me to tell you how we all behaved that night after we had arrived at the hostelry and only after that will i describe to you the journey and the remainder of our pilgrimage i will be your eyes and ears i have no other purpose but first i must ask you out of consideration for my feelings not to impute any malice or villainy to me if i describe plainly how they spoke and how they looked do not hold it against me if i report their words in full for you know this as well as i do if i intend to repeat the tale of another man i must write it down precisely as i heard it word for word i have a good example christ spoke out plainly in the gospels and no one has ever accused him of rudeness to the best of my ability i will record accurately all of the tales and conversations of the pilgrims however obscene or absurd they may turn out to be otherwise my work will be inaccurate it will be mere fiction i will not spare my characters even if one of them happens to be my brother characters no people living people the words of living people will be preserved by me i want you to hear their voices just as if you were riding with us those who have read plato will know well enough his apothegm the word must be cousin to the deed i have another request to make i hope you will forgive me if i do not introduce people precisely in their order of rank put it down to my general stupidity well enough of this rambling our host gave us all good cheer and set down a tasty supper for us on the table in the tavern itself there were cries of tapster fill the bowl and one pot more he served us good fish and flesh the wine was strong and potable we all agreed after our leather cups were filled that the landlord was an attractive man he could have acted as master of ceremonies at any public feast he was a large fellow with bright eyes you could not find a fairer citizen in the whole of cheapside he was forthright in speech but he was also shrewd and apparently well educated i did not find out what school he attended anyway he possessed all the characteristics of a proper man he was merry enough and after supper he began to amuse us with several stories he trusted that we would enjoy ourselves on this journey and after we had all paid our bills he addressed us with these words now good ladies and gentlemen i would like to bid you all welcome to my inn i must say that i have not come across a more joyful group of people under my roof if i could entertain you more then i would gladly in fact i have hit upon one scheme to make your journey easier and more agreeable hear me out it will cost you nothing we all know that you are on your way to canterbury where saint thomas god bless him will no doubt reward you for your devotion and i fully expect that you will pass the time in telling stories and other amusements that is only natural there is no comfort or entertainment to be had in riding silently together as dumb as any stone that is why i have this plan of my own to put to you it will keep you merry so if you all agree to abide by my judgement and play the game i have invented i promise on my fathers soul that you will be mightily entertained in the course of your journey tomorrow please without more ado hold up your hands in assent to my proposal it did not take us long to decide there was no point in any case in long deliberations without any real discussion then we all put up our hands in agreement with him we had to ask of course what his actual plan was well gentle ladies and gentle men he replied i have a proposal take it in good spirit dont mock me it is unusual i admit but it is not unprecedented do tell us the manciple said we are on tenterhooks until we hear you well to be brief i suggest this on our way to canterbury each of you will tell two stories as every traveller knows tales shorten journeys then on the way back to london each pilgrim will tell two more tales of what kind the prioress was very demure anything you like ma dame tales of saints tales of battles and adventures from long ago and here comes my other proposal the pilgrim who tells the best story by common consent will be awarded a free supper paid for by the rest here in the tabard on our return what do you think what do you mean by best the miller asked him the miller had a menacing face i expected trouble from him in the future it could be the most serious story it could be the funniest it could be the most pleasant let us see what happens in fact the idea is such a good one that i cant resist coming along myself i will ride with you tomorrow morning i will make the journey at my own cost and i will also be your guide none of you are familiar with the way anyone who challenges or disputes with me will have to pay a penalty he or she will be responsible for all the costs incurred on our travels is that reasonable let me know now then i can get ready for the feast of words we agreed with his suggestion and swore an oath that we would all perform as promised then we asked him if he would become our governor as well as our guide he was the one who could best judge the quality of the stories but he could also be the arbitrator in less important matters like the price of our suppers we would all be ruled by his decisions so by acclamation we decided to follow our leader then the wine was brought out and after a cup or two we went off to bed without any prompting we were cheerful though tomorrow as they say was still untouched then the morrow came at the first stirring of dawn our host sprang out of his chamber and awakened us all he called us together in the yard of the inn and led us at a slow pace out of southwark after a mile or two we reached the little brook known as saint thomas a watering which is the boundary of the city liberties he reined in his horse here and addressed us ladies and gentlemen or should i say fellow pilgrims i hope you all remember our agreement i recall it vividly myself i take it for granted that none of you have changed your minds is that not so good well who do you think should tell the first story we agreed that you would all be bound by my decision any man or woman who dissents will be obliged to pay all of our expenses if i am mistaken then i swear that i will never drink again the best plan is to draw sticks before we go any further and he that picks the shortest will begin we got down from our horses and formed a circle the host stood in the middle with the bundle of sticks in his hand sir knight he said my lord and master you will be the first to draw the lot the knight stepped forward gracefully accepting his authority and took a stick now my lady prioress the host said will it please you to come closer to me and you sir clerk put aside any embarrassment you do not need to be learned to draw a stick as for the rest of you take it in turns and so we all chose our stick whether it was by destiny or providence or just chance it turned out that the knight had chosen the shortest stick we were all pleased with this piece of luck it gave us more time to compose our own stories the first must be the boldest the knight would have to tell his tale that was the agreement in any case he was not the kind of man to break a promise so he said i have been chosen to begin the game i welcome the challenge in gods name as i welcome all noble challenges will it please you to ride forth and listen to my story so we mounted our horses and crossed the stream it was called in those parts going over the water then the knight with a steady and cheerful countenance began to tell his tale this is what he said the knights tale heere bigynneth the knyghtes tale part one once upon a time as the old stories tell us there was a duke named theseus he was the lord and governor of fabled athens and in his day he had won an unrivalled reputation as a conqueror no one was more splendid under the sun he had taken many rich kingdoms by wise generalship and force of arms he had conquered the land of the amazons formerly known as scythia and wedded there its queen hippolita he brought home his prize his bride with great celebrations and rejoicings he also brought back with him her younger sister emily who will be the heroine of this story so for the time being i will leave theseus at his victory parade you can imagine the scene the armies march in rank pomp music hurrahs the wagons bring up the rear stuffed with booty it was glorious stuff of course if i had more time i would like to tell you all about the victory of theseus over the amazons knights like to speak of war and what a fight that was i wish i could tell you about the pitched battle between the athenians and the amazon women i wish i could tell you how theseus laid siege in more than one sense to the beautiful and fiery hippolita i would like to have described the glorious wedding feast and then i might have added the detail of the tempest that threatened to overwhelm their ships on their return to athens but there we are it cannot be done in the time allotted to me god knows i have ahead of me a large field to furrow and the oxen at my plough are not the strongest beasts i have known the remains of my story are long enough i will not hinder any of this fair company let every man and woman here tell their tale in turn then we shall know who has won the supper where was i oh yes duke theseus well when he had come close to athens with his new bride in all his glory he noticed that there were some women kneeling in the highway they kneeled in rows beside each other two by two and they were all clothed in black they were screeching and crying and beating their breasts i doubt that anyone has heard such bitter lamentation they did not cease their cries until they had managed to get hold of the reins of the dukes horse of course he was very angry what kind of women are you he asked that ruin my triumphant homecoming with your tears and wails are you so envious of my honour that you cry out like scalded cats who has offended you who has done you hurt i will do my best to help you if i can and then why on earth are you all wearing black answer me the eldest of all the ladies then fainted she looked so pale that even theseus took pity on her but she recovered from her swoon gracefully stood upright and answered him my good lord she said upon whom dame fortune has smiled we do not grieve at your victories or lament your success far from it but we do beseech your mercy and your aid have shame on our woe and our distress shed some tears of compassion upon us poor women that we are show us your kindness we do perhaps deserve your consideration there is not one of us that was not previously a duchess or a queen now we are miserable worn down by grief dame fortune has thrown us aside well it is the wheel there is no joy that may not turn to sorrow that is why we have been waiting for you here in the temple of the goddess of pity for the last two weeks please help us noble duke give us your strength who are you ma dame wretched woman that i now am i was once the wife of the king known as capaneus he was one of the seven who stormed the city of thebes but there at the gate of the city he died struck down by the thunderbolt of zeus it was the most cursed day of my life you may know my name evadne all of these women with me flowing in tears also lost husbands at the siege of thebes yet the old man creon now alas king of thebes is filled with anger and evil no he is not king he is tyrant of thebes with malice in his heart this tyrant has defiled the bodies of our dead husbands he has stripped them and piled them in a heap he will not allow the corpses to be burned or buried instead they have become the prey of dogs and other scavengers at that the women set up another wail and beat their breasts have mercy on us one of them cried out we wretched women beg for succour let our sorrow enter your heart the noble lord theseus dismounted his heart was indeed filled with grief at the bitterness of their woes to see women of such high rank reduced to this level of suffering and indignity well he feared that his heart might break to leave the dead unburied was pure blasphemy so great then was the respect given to the conventions of war he embraced them all one by one and did his best to comfort them then he swore an oath as a knight good and true just as you our host interjected the knight pretended not to hear the remark theseus swore an oath that he would wreak such fatal vengeance on creon that all the people of greece would concur that the tyrant had met a prompt and welcome death at the hands of the ruler of athens this was his pledge all at once without any delay he mounted his steed then he unfurled his banner and led his army towards the city of thebes he vowed that he would not return to athens or linger for even half a day until he had defeated creon he took the precaution of sending hippolita his new bride and her beautiful younger sister emily to take up residence in athens meanwhile he spent his first night on the road rather than in his marital bed there is no more to say the weapons of his army glittered in the fields about thebes on the great white banner of theseus was embroidered the red image of mars god of war and king of combat with his spear and shield held aloft beside the banner was the pennant of theseus curiously wrought of gold it depicted the head of the minotaur whom he had killed in the labyrinth of crete death to all monsters so rode the duke so travelled the conqueror with the flower of chivalry all around him in majesty he came up to the gates of thebes and alighted there then he arrayed his troops in the field where he expected to do battle i do not want to embarrass the ladies with accounts of the fighting i will be brief in combat theseus killed creon according to the knightly book of arms and put his army to flight then he stormed the town and tore down its walls not a beam or rafter was left in place it was a just punishment he restored to the ladies the corpses of their husbands although little was left of them except the bones still they could now be dispatched with due form and order it would be too harrowing to report all the tears and cries and laments of the ladies when they saw the remains of their husbands burning on the funeral pyres it is enough to say that theseus the illustrious conqueror paid great honour and courtesy to them before they left for their respective cities after theseus had killed creon and captured thebes he stayed with his troops in the field they still had work to accomplish in the conquered kingdom there was pillaging to do the dead soldiers of thebes lay in heaps upon the ground and the athenians began systematically to strip them of their armour and their clothing the pillagers did their work with diligence searching all those defeated in battle for anything of value there is now a turn in the tale among the piles of the dead the athenians found two young knights lying side by side as if they had fought valiantly together they were both bearing the same heraldic device and they were both richly clad in ornamented armour and they were both badly wounded they were neither alive nor dead but in some uncertain state between one of the knights was named arcite the name of the other knight was palamon you will have heard of them i am sure when the athenian heralds examined their coats of arms they declared that these two young men were cousins of royal blood and true aristocrats of thebes so the soldiers carefully extracted them from the morass of the dead and carried them gently to the tent of theseus the noble duke then pronounced that they should be consigned to an athenian prison where they would remain for the rest of their lives without the possibility of freedom no ransom would be sought or accepted now that theseus had finished his glorious work he led his army from the scene of battle and rode home to athens bearing the laurel wreath of victory there he still lives in honour and in comfort happy ever after what is left to say yet turn your eyes towards a dark tower there in anguish and in woe lie palamon and arcite they will suffer there for the rest of their lives however large the ransom offered they will never be released so the world whirled on day by day and year by year until on one may morning everything changed on that spring morning emily left her bed emily the sister of the queen lovelier than the lily on its stalk of green fresher than the new flowers of may prettier than the rose whose hue is not so fair as hers i say that emily left her bed before dawn and was prepared for the day before the sun ever rose the month of may will brook no sluggishness at night the season stirs every noble heart and awakes the spirit with the words arise and do homage to spring so emily paid her obeisance to the season of rebirth she dressed in yellow and in green her blonde hair waist length was braided in tresses behind her back at the rising of the sun she strolled through the garden of the castle gathering red and white and particoloured flowers to make an intricate garland for her head she was singing like an angel as she picked the lilac and the violet yet beside this garden separated by the garden wall was the dark tower where palamon and arcite were confined it was the principal dungeon of the castle as thick and strong as any prison in the world so with emily singing and the two knights languishing heaven and hell were close together bright was the sun and the air most clear when palamon had risen from his pallet bed by permission of his gaoler this woeful prisoner had the use of an upper cell from which he could see the city of athens he could also see the garden beneath him clad in the green vesture of spring where radiant emily was still walking palamon however had not yet seen her he was pacing to and fro measuring the strict confines of his chamber and lamenting his fate alas he whispered to himself i wish that i had never been born but then just by chance he happened to look through the thick iron bars covering his window he cast a glance upon emily sauntering below then immediately he turned pale and cried out ah as if some barb had caught at his heart at the sound of his cry arcite started up from sleep and asked what had upset him cousin he said you have gone as pale as the dead what troubles you now you look so ill suddenly why did you cry out who has offended you for gods sake do not rail so much against our imprisonment we must have patience this is our fate we have no choice in the matter we are subject to the bad aspects of saturn in the turning of the spheres and cannot escape our destiny what is the saying he must need swim that is borne up to the chin so stood the heavens on the day that we were born we must endure palamon answered him shaking his head cousin you have received the wrong impression of my woe it was not our confinement that made me cry out my new torment entered my heart through my eye where very likely it will kill me i am woeful because of her with the flowers below us he went over to the window again and looked down at emily the fairness of this lady that i see walking to and fro through the castle garden is the cause of all my pain and lamentation i cannot tell whether she is a woman or a goddess my guess is that she is venus come to earth thereupon he fell to his knees and prayed aloud venus great goddess if it be your will to reveal yourself in this garden before me a wretched and sorrowful creature i beseech you to deliver us from this dark prison yet if it be my destiny to remain in durance vile imprisoned by divine decree then turn your piteous eye upon my family that has been brought so low by tyranny and as he prayed arcite walked over to the window and beheld emily wandering in the garden the sight of her beauty affected him so greatly that if palamon had been wounded arcite almost expired he sighed deeply and could not refrain from speaking out this perfect beauty this vision of her that walks within the garden has slain me suddenly unless i obtain her mercy and her grace unless at the very least i am permitted to see her i am as good as dead there is nothing else to say when palamon heard his complaint he became angry are you serious or is this a joke i am in deadly earnest god help me i have no reason to play it does not reflect well on your honour you know to be false and treacherous to your cousin he was frowning at arcite as he spoke we have both sworn deep oaths that we would never cross each other in love and would each seek our common good we have both sworn that we would rather die under torture than oppose or hinder one another we would remain true till death do us part that was my oath i presume that it was yours i dont think you will deny it but now what has happened you are aware of my love for the lady in the garden but you have decided that you also wish to be her lover no chance i will love and serve this lady until the day of my death that will not be your fate arcite i swear it i loved her first i took you into my confidence and told you all my woe as my sworn brother you are bound by oath to help me otherwise you will be judged a false and perjured knight arcite in pride of spirit answered him with disdain you will be judged the faithless knight palamon i was the one who loved her first what are you saying look at you you still do not know whether she is a goddess or a woman you are touched by love for a deity while i am consumed by love for a mortal woman that is why i confessed my feelings to you as my cousin and brother put the case that you loved her first what do all the learned clerks tell us when love is strong love knows no law love itself has greater dominion earthly rules are of no account lovers break them every day a man must love even if he strives against it he cannot escape love even at the cost of his own life it may be love for a maid for a widow or for a married woman it does not matter love is the law of life itself in any case it is not likely that you or i will ever win her favour you know well enough that we are both consigned to this cell perpetually without hope of ransom we are like the dogs in aesops fable striving for the bone they fought all day without result and then there came a kite that bore the prize away therefore we must behave like courtiers around the king each one for himself do you agree i tell you again that i will always love her you can love her too if you wish there is nothing more to say nothing else to do we will remain in this prison for the rest of our days and endure whatever fate is visited upon us if i had more time i would tell you more about the continual strife and enmity between them but let me be brief and to the point it happened one day that the worthy duke perotheus king of the lapiths arrived in athens he had been the intimate of theseus since earliest childhood and had come to the city to resume their happy companionship he loved no one in the world so much as his friend and theseus returned that love anyone who reads the old books will learn of it the story is that when theseus died perotheus went down to hell in order to rescue him what was theseus doing in hell i do not know that part of the story to resume my own tale if i may i should inform you that perotheus had been the lover of arcite so at his friends earnest desire and entreaty theseus decreed that arcite should be released from prison without any ransom arcite would be free to go wherever he wished but there was one condition to his liberty it was agreed that if arcite were ever found and caught in athenian territory he would be instantly beheaded whatever the pretext and whatever the time of his incursion he would die what did arcite do what else but leave athens at once and return to thebes there was no safer course but he had best beware he had left his head as his pledge yet in truth he suffered more keenly than before he felt all the pangs of death he wept he wailed he groaned he lamented he secretly longed for an occasion to kill himself alas he cried that i was ever born my prison now is darker and more dreary than my cell i am now forced to endure the torments of hell not of purgatory as before i wish that i had never known perotheus then i could still lie imprisoned with palamon then i would have been in bliss and not in woe for then even fettered and immured i could have enjoyed the sight of the mistress i adore i may never have enjoyed her favour but at least i could have looked upon her oh palamon dear cousin you have been awarded the palm of victory you may endure the pain of imprisonment endure no enjoy compared to me you are in paradise fortune has turned the dice for you you have the sight of her while i am rendered blind and since you have the blessing of her presence near at hand it is possible that you a worthy and a handsome knight might one day attain that goal you so fervently desire fortune is ever turning like the wheel but i living in barren exile have no such expectation of grace i am deprived of all hope in such despair that no creature on earth can comfort me there is nothing made of fire of earth or water or of air that can console me so i must live and die in misery and distress i must say farewell to joy and happiness he broke down weeping before he once more resumed his lament why do so many people complain of the actions of providence or the decisions of god himself when their eventual fate is better than any they could possibly have imagined some men long for riches but at the expense of their health and even of their lives some men desire to escape from prison as i once did only to be murdered in the households of their kin in hope and ambition there lie infinite harms we do not know the answers to our prayers we fare as one who wanders drunk through the streets he knows that he has a house somewhere but he cannot remember the name of the street his is a long and wayward journey so do we fare in this fallen world we search for felicity down every lane and alley but often enough we take the wrong path all will agree and i especially know the truth of this i who believed that release from prison would be the highest good i should have known better now i am exiled from all hope of happiness since i can no longer see you emily i am as good as dead who can give more heat to the fire or joy to heaven or pain to hell there is no more to say he sat in silence and bowed his head let us return to the cell where palamon still lay after the sudden departure of arcite he cried out in a paroxysm of anguish and despair the dark tower rang with his laments the fetters that held his legs were wet and shining with his salt and bitter tears alas arcite he cried in our contest you have the victory you now enjoy your freedom in our home city why should you give a thought to my suffering here i know that you are valiant i know that you are shrewd it is possible that you will call together the members of our affinity and prosecute so bold a war against athens that by some chance or even by some treaty with theseus you will obtain the hand of my lady emily i would rather lose my life than lose her but you are free to roam you have been delivered from our prison and you are a great lord my case is different i am confined i must weep and wail for the rest of my life with all the woes that prison life can give yet there is no woe so deep as that of unrequited love so i must endure a double torment upon this earth as he lay upon the stone floor of his prison lamenting he was seized by a fit of jealousy so strong and so sudden that he felt his heart contract within him it enveloped him like madness he turned as pale as milk no worse as pale as the bark of a dead ash tree once more he began to cry out loud oh cruel gods that govern this world binding it with your eternal decrees inscribed on sheets of adamantine steel what is humankind to you do men mean more to you than the sheep that cower in the fold men must die too like any beast of the field men also dwell in confinement and restraint men suffer great sickness and adversity even when they are guilty of no sin what glory can there be for you in treating humankind so ungenerously what is the good of your foreknowledge if it only torments the innocent and punishes the just what is the purpose of your providence one other matter too outrages me men must perform their duty and for the sake of the gods refrain from indulging their desires they must uphold certain principles for the salvation of their souls whereas the silly sheep goes into the darkness of nonbeing no beast suffers pain in the hereafter but after death we all may still weep and wail even though our life on earth was also one of suffering is this just is this commendable i suppose i must leave the answer to theologians but i know this for a fact the world is full of grief i have seen a serpent sting an unwary traveller and then glide away i have seen the thief murder his prey and then wander forth unchecked and unharmed but i must linger here in prison truly the gods in their jealous rage against my race have all but destroyed my family and razed the walls of thebes now venus herself has decided to slay me too by poisoning me with jealousy for arcite where can i turn i will now leave palamon in his sad plight for a moment and tell you what has been happening to arcite the summer has passed and the long nights have merely increased the duration of his pain in truth i do not know who has endured the most suffering the freed lover or the prisoner let me summarize their situation here is palamon he is condemned to perpetual imprisonment consigned to chains and shackles until the day of his death here is arcite on pain of death by beheading he is exiled from the territory of athens forever excluded from the sight of fair emily i will ask you lovers the question who is worse off one of them can glimpse his gracious lady day by day but will never be able to approach her the other is as free as air able to journey wherever he wishes but he will never see emily again consider it judge the matter as best you can put the two characters before you as if they were upon a gaming board meanwhile i will carry on with the story just to see what happens next part two when arcite eventually returned to thebes he grew faint and sick his one word endlessly repeated was alas we know the reason i will add only that no other creature upon the earth has ever suffered or will ever suffer so painfully he could not sleep he did not eat or drink he became lean and emaciated as dry and brittle as a stick his eyes were hollow and his complexion turned a sickly yellow as if he had the jaundice he looked truly frightful and he was alone he sought out solitude like a wounded animal he spent his nights in tears and if ever he heard the music of a lyre or lute he wept openly and without pause his spirits were so feeble and his demeanour so changed that no one recognized him or knew his voice he behaved madly wildly he did not seem to be suffering from lovesickness but rather from despair engendered by the melancholy humour he had been touched in the foremost ventricle of the brain which is the proper home of the imagination so in the fantasy of arcite everything was turned upside down all was on a totter there is no point in recalling every detail of his despair after two years of sorrow while he lived and suffered in thebes as he lay sleeping one night he had a vision or dream of mercury the winged god stood by his bedside holding his wand of sleep and bid him to be of good cheer now this great god wore a silver helmet ornamented with wings upon his golden hair in just such a guise he had lulled argos of the hundred eyes when he came to steal io he spoke or seemed to speak to arcite you must journey now to athens he said in that city there will be an end of all your woe at that arcite woke up with a start whatever the consequences he said even on pain of death itself i will follow my dream and travel to athens right away i will not be deterred by anything or anyone i will see my lady again i will be with her even if i have to die in her sight death then will be delightful then he took up a great mirror and saw the reflection of his altered looks he was so wan and ravaged that he was scarcely recognizable even to himself and then inspiration came to him whether he was inspired by mercury i cannot say he realized that he was so disfigured by suffering and sickness that he could remain quite unknown in athens if he was cautious and prudent he could live there for the rest of his life without being discovered by the authorities and then he could see emily every day what a wonderful prospect so he threw himself into joyful activity he changed his clothes and dressed himself in the garb of a poor labouring man his only companion was his squire this young man knew everything from first to last but he was happy to follow arcite he too dressed in the garb of a poor man on the following day the two of them set off for athens as soon as arcite arrived he went to the court of theseus and at the great gate there he offered his services to those who passed him he offered to drudge to draw water to carry goods anything that might help him to get closer to emily eventually and by great good fortune he was offered a job in the household of the chamberlain who looked after the fair lady he watched and waited taking advantage of any opening to gain access to her he was expert at cutting wood and tireless at carrying barrels of water he was strong with fine sinews and big bones he did any kind of work that was required he was zealous and indefatigable so by degrees he became a personal servant to fair emily herself what name did he give himself he was known to everyone as philostratus there never was a more wellrespected man he was so gentlemanly so modest in demeanour that his reputation spread throughout the royal court everyone said that it would be an act of charity on the part of theseus to give him more honourable employment in a post where his particular virtues might be nourished and displayed so his good deeds and eloquence were spread abroad theseus himself came to hear of them what was his response he made him squire of the chamber and gave him enough gold to maintain his new position but arcite also had another source of gold he received rental income from his lands in thebes it was brought to him privately and secretly by agents from his home city and they were so discreet that no one in athens ever guessed the truth he spent it wisely too and avoided gossip in this manner he spent the next three years of his life he worked so well both in peace and war that theseus held no man in higher regard now i will leave arcite for a little while and turn my attention to palamon oh dear what a difference while arcite dwelled in bliss palamon lived in hell for seven years he had lain in darkness and despair fettered in the dark tower wasted by suffering and suffused with woe he endured double distress with his unfulfilled love for emily increasing his burden of imprisonment he would never leave his cell he would never kneel before her or address her he was close to madness who could describe in plain english his suffering i am not the man so if you dont mind i will pass on take your time our host told him for this day has been a green day it will stay fresh in our imaginations i thank you but i must move on in the seventh year of his imprisonment on may to be exact the wheel turned for palamon that is the date given in the old books at least which are more to be trusted than i am i have no skill at narration whether by fortune or by destiny if there is any difference actually when something is meant to be it is meant to be at least that is what i think it was fated anyway that soon after midnight on may palamon escaped from his prison cell with the assistance of a friend this is how he did it he had given his gaoler a glass of sweet spiced wine in which he had mingled some narcotics and the best theban opium they had the required effect and the gaoler slept so soundly that no one could wake him and so palamon fled the city full speed ahead yet the spring night was short and at break of day he decided to conceal himself in a neighbouring wood he crept there fearful of discovery it was his plan to spend the rest of the day in hiding shaded by the dark trees and then to resume his flight to thebes that night once he had arrived there he planned to ask his friends to join him in making war upon theseus he would either die in combat or win emily to be his wife there was no third course now if i may i will turn back to arcite the poor man little knew what was in store for him fortune was his foe fortune set a trap and we all know that an hours cold can suck out seven years of heat the busy lark the messenger of day saluted in her song the break of day the mighty sun rose up with beams so bright that all the east was laughing in the light his welcome rays the land receives and all the dewdrops perish on the leaves this is the poetry of the morning that greeted arcite the squire of the royal chamber as he rose up from his bed he decided to pay homage to may inspired by his desire for emily so forth he went upon his fiery steed and rode some two or three miles beyond the city here were the open fields where he could find exercise and recreation quite by chance he had ridden towards the wood where palamon lay concealed here he wove for himself a garland of branches made from the leaves of the woodbine and the hawthorn and thus crowned he sang out in the sunlight this happy greeting may with all your flowers and your green livery welcome to you welcome to the fairest and freshest month may i deserve this green garland he dismounted from his horse and in lively mood explored a path that led into the wood itself where did the path take him it led him directly to the thicket of trees where palamon in fear of his life had taken refuge he had no idea that arcite was close to him god knows it would have seemed an unlikely coincidence but there is an old saying proven many times that fields have eyes and woods have ears it behoves all of you to behave wisely because you never know whom you are going to meet the course of life is unexpected so palamon little knew that the voice he heard was that of arcite he just lay very still in the obscure grove meanwhile arcite was singing his heart out wandering among the trees and bushes of the wood then he stopped suddenly and fell to musing as lovers will often do one minute the lover dallies among flowers and the next he is thrust upon thorns he goes up and down just like a bucket in a well venus like her day can change her countenance friday can be sunny and then filled with clouds friday is unlike any other day of the week in the same way venus is quixotic and unpredictable with her votaries so after arcite had sung he sighed he sat down upon the trunk of an upturned tree and began to mourn alas he cried i wish that i had never been born how long cruel and pitiless juno will you continue to wage war upon thebes the royal blood of cadmus and amphion the founders of thebes has been sprinkled and spilled cadmus was the first king of thebes i am of his direct lineage yet what has become of me i am now no better than a slave or a captive serving as a squire in the court of the most bitter enemy of our city yet juno heaps ever more shame upon me i dare not acknowledge my own name i cannot proclaim myself as noble arcite i must hide under the name of the insignificant philostratus oh juno and your ruthless son mars you two have destroyed my kith and kin the only survivors are myself and palamon who is now consigned by theseus to the martyrdom of endless prison and then above all else i am also a martyr i am a martyr to love love has fired its arrow into my heart my heart is gone before my life is done i believe that i was destined to this fate before i was born the eyes of emily have slain me utterly they are the warrant of my death nothing else in the world is of any consequence to me nothing else has meaning for me oh emily if only i could serve you and with this he fell down in a trance he lay face down for a long time before getting to his feet again palamon concealed close by had heard every word of arcites love lament he felt that a sword as cold as ice had been plunged into his heart he shook with anger he could no longer stay in hiding so like a madman pale as death he jumped out of the thicket shouting arcite arcite wicked arcite false traitor arcite i have caught you you proclaim yourself the lover of my lady emily for whom i have suffered so much pain and woe you are of my blood and allegiance as i have told you many times and yet what have you done you have deceived theseus you have lived at his court under a false name but you will not deal falsely with emily i am the only one who can or will ever love her so one of us will have to die look upon palamon as your mortal enemy and although i have no weapon in my possession since by great good fortune i have just escaped from my prison it makes no difference either you will die or else you will renounce your love for emily choose which one you will otherwise you will never leave this wood then arcite with anger in his heart unsheathed his sword he was as ferocious as a lion close to a kill by god above us he said if you were not sick with fever and made lunatic by love you would not walk out of this grove alive if you had a weapon you would surely die at my hand today i deny the covenant and i defy the bond that you say i pledged to you what do you think like a fool that love is negotiable that it can be tied down i will love emily despite all your threats he stopped for a moment and wiped his brow since you are a knight of high degree i take it that you will decide the right to her by mortal combat so here i pledge my faith to meet you in battle tomorrow without the knowledge of anyone in athens i will bring you armour and weapons you choose the very best and leave the worst for me tonight i will bring you food and drink too as well as blankets for your bedding here and if it so happens that you win my lady and slay me in this wood where now we stand then you may possess her with as firm a right as i and palamon answered i accept your terms so they parted from each other both of them pledging their knightly duty to fight the next day oh cupid god of love you are devoid of charity you are the youngest of the gods but you will permit no other to share your power it has been said with truth that neither love nor lordship will allow a rival arcite and palamon are as yet living examples so arcite rode back to athens and before daybreak on the following morning he quietly and secretly prepared two suits of armour they were both sturdy enough to decide that days battle between the two noble kinsmen then on his horse as alone as he was born he carried all this gear to the place of combat in the wood at the time and place appointed arcite and palamon confronted one another they both tried to gain their composure and master their countenance just like the hunters of thrace who stand waiting for the lion or the bear to be flushed out when they hear the beast come rushing through the branches and the leaves they think to themselves here comes my mortal enemy one of us must die either i will slay it when it comes rushing forward or if fortune is against me it will kill me palamon knew the strength of arcite and arcite was well aware of the might of palamon they did not greet or salute each other but without any words they helped one another to put on his armour they were so courteous that they might have been brothers but then they sailed out in deadly combat their swords and lances at the ready how could they maintain their contest for so long well as you may imagine palamon fought like a ferocious lion while arcite attacked him with all the savagery of a tiger no they were more beastly than that they fought like wild boars their jaws frothing with white foam they fought up to their ankles in blood crash bang ouch there i will leave them fighting to their destinies destiny is the administrator the general surveyor of gods plan providence lies in the mind of god destiny is the means whereby it is worked out in the world it is so powerful that it overrules all contradiction that which is deemed impossible may be determined by destiny even if it happens only once in a thousand years all our instincts and appetites on earth whether for war or peace for love or hate are ruled by destiny so in that spirit i turn to theseus lord of athens whose instinct and appetite were for hunting in may particularly he was eager to chase and kill the royal hart the day did not dawn when he was not dressed and ready to mount his horse accompanied by huntsmen and hounds and horns he loved the chase and he loved the kill he cried out in the pursuit so ho and ware ware he worshipped the god of war of course but after mars he venerated diana the goddess of the hunt clear was the day and bright the trembling air when theseus rode out he was in the highest spirits accompanied as he was by his queen hippolita and by fair emily dressed all in green he had been told by his men that there was a hart lurking in a nearby wood and with all speed he rode up to the spot he knew well enough that this was the place where the beast might break cover and fly across the stream to make its escape so he slipped the leashes of the hounds in preparation for pursuit yet wait call off the dogs where under the sun was this wood you have guessed it no sooner did theseus ride up among the trees than he saw palamon and arcite the two wild boars still in ferocious battle they wielded their bright swords with such power that the least stroke from one of them might have felled an oak he had no idea as yet who they were but he spurred on his horse and riding between the two combatants he unsheathed his sword and called out to them hoo stop this on pain of losing your head by mighty mars i will slay the next man who raises his sword now tell me what rank or estate are you how do you dare to fight in my land without judge or officer as you must do in a legal duel palamon answered directly sire there is nothing we can say both of us deserve the punishment of death we are two woeful wretches two slaves of destiny already overburdened by our own lives as you are a rightful lord and judge show us neither mercy nor refuge yet show some charity to me kill me first but then kill him as well on second thoughts you might as well kill him first it makes no difference shall i tell you who he is here stands arcite your mortal enemy who was banished from athens on pain of death surely now death is the fate that he deserves you may know him by another name this is the man that came to your court and called himself philostratus do you recognize him he has fooled you for many years you even made him your principal squire this is the man also who declares himself to be the lover of emily well enough of that since the day has come when i must die i will make a full confession to you i am woeful palamon the man who unlawfully escaped from your prison i am your mortal enemy too and i also profess myself to be the lover of fair emily let me die before her now that is all i wish so i ask for the sentence of death to be carried out on me and my companion both of us have deserved our fate then the worthy duke theseus replied to him there is nothing much to say out of your own mouth comes your confession you have condemned yourself it only falls to me to pronounce judgment there is no need to apply the rack or thumbscrew you will simply die i swear this by the patron of my life great mars yet now his queen hippolita out of sympathy and pity began to weep then emily started to cry and then of course all the ladies of the company joined in the lament they bewailed the fact that two knights of such noble deportment should meet such a fate the argument between them both was all for love the women beheld the great and bloody wounds upon their fair bodies and cried out in chorus have mercy lord upon all of us women they fell down upon the ground on their bare knees and would have kissed his feet in entreaty but then the anger of theseus passed pity soon enters a gentle heart he had at first been enraged at their abuse of his power but now on considering the matter he realized that their crimes were not so heinous they had some reason to act in the way they had his wrath was the accuser but his judgment was the defender he understood well enough that any man in love will try to help his cause and that any man in prison will wish to escape that was natural that was human he also felt some compassion for the women still weeping all around him he contemplated the matter and then spoke softly to himself there is a curse upon a merciless ruler who upholds only the law of the lion who is pitiless to the humble and haughty alike who does not distinguish between the unrepentant and the penitent shame on him who weighs all men alike so his anger was mollified he looked up with bright eyes and spoke aloud to the assembled company may the god of love he said bless me and bless you all how mighty and how great a lord is he no one can withstand his power he overcomes all obstacles his miracles themselves proclaim his divinity for he can move the human heart in any direction that he wishes look here at arcite and palamon they both escaped from imprisonment in the dark tower and might have lived royally in thebes they both knew that i was their mortal enemy and that it lay in my power to slaughter them and yet the god of love has brought them here where they may die consider it is it not the height of folly yet folly is the mark of the true lover look at them for gods sake do you see how they bleed do you see in what condition they are so has their lord and master the god of love repaid them for their loyalty to him yet of course they consider themselves to be wise men and virtuous in their service whatever may happen to them and do you want to know the best joke of all the lady who has provoked all their passion knew no more of it than i did emily was as unaware of their rash valour as the birds in the trees above us yet we have all to be tempered in the fire of love whether we are hot or cold young or old i know it well enough myself i was a servant of the god many years ago and since i know all about the pain of love and know how sore a wound it can inflict when the lover is caught in its meshes then i fully forgive the trespasses of these two knights i will accede to the petition both of my queen who kneels here before me and of my dear sister emily there is one condition both of you must swear that you will never again invade my territories you must never threaten war against me but on the contrary you must pledge yourselves to be my friends and allies on that condition you are forgiven palamon and arcite humbly and gratefully assented to his terms they asked him in turn to become their lord and protector to which he graciously agreed in terms of royal lineage and wealth he said either one of you is worthy to marry a princess or even a queen that is obvious if i may speak for my sister emily over whom you have suffered so much strife and jealousy well you yourselves know well enough that she cannot marry both of you at once you can fight for eternity but like it or not only one of you can be betrothed to her the other can go whistle in the wind be as jealous or as angry as you may that is the truth so listen while i explain to you my plan to find whose destiny is shaped for emily and whose is turned the other way this is what i have devised it is my will and you must make the best of it i will listen to no argument or objection i stipulate that both of you should go your separate ways without ransom or hindrance and in a years time that both of you should return with a company of one hundred knights fully armed and equipped for a tournament your men should be ready to decide the hand of emily by dint of battle upon my honour as a knight i promise you this i will reward whichever of you has the most strength whether you slay your adversary or with your hundred companions drive him from the joust i will give you the hand of fair emily thus fortune will favour the brave the tournament will take place here and as god have mercy on my soul i will be a fair and true judge of the contest and i will allow only one conclusion one of you will be killed or made captive if both of you agree then assent now and hold yourselves well served who could be more cheerful now than palamon who could be more joyful than arcite i cannot begin to describe the rejoicing of the whole company at the decision of theseus he had behaved so graciously that all of them went down on their knees and thanked him the two thebans in particular expressed their gratefulness so with heads high and hope in their hearts palamon and arcite made their way back to the ancient city of thebes they had a year to prepare themselves for battle part three i am sure that you would accuse me of negligence if i failed to tell you of the expense and trouble that theseus went to in preparing the royal tournament i dare say that there was no greater amphitheatre in the whole world it was a mile in circumference the shape of a circle environed with great walls and moats the seats rose in tiers some sixty feet and were so well arranged that everyone had a full view of the arena on the eastern side there stood a gate of white marble balanced in harmony with its counterpart on the western side it was a dream of stone nothing of this style had ever been built so well or so quickly theseus enquired throughout his land and enlisted the services of every craftsman skilled in arithmetic or in geometry he hired the best artists and the most renowned sculptors in the construction of this glorious theatre and then for the purposes of worship and ceremonial he caused to be built an altar and a shrine to venus in a room above the eastern gate above the western gate there was constructed a temple to mars they cost a wagonload of gold and then on the northern side within a turret on the wall theseus built an exquisite temple to the goddess of chastity diana elaborately wrought out of white alabaster and red coral i had almost forgotten to describe to you the noble carvings and paintings that adorned these three temples displaying all the most delicate skills of expression and action on the walls of the temple of venus for example were depicted images of the broken sleep and pitiful sighs of the servants of love here also were pictures of the sacred tears and lamentations of lovers together with the fiery strokes of their desires here were the oaths they passed here were the figures of pleasure and of hope of desire and of foolishness of beauty and of youth of mirth and of costliness of luxury and care and jealousy jealousy wore a garland of golden marigolds the token of cruelty and despair on her hand was perched a cuckoo bright bird of infidelity on the walls too were painted frescoes of all the feasts concerts songs and dances devoted to love here were images of desire and display all the circumstances of love that ever have been and ever will be celebrated i cannot mention them all suffice it to say that the whole island of cytherea the dwelling and domain of venus was floating upon the walls of the temple in its gardens could be seen the figure of idleness the keeper of loves gates here was narcissus of ancient times together with lecherous king solomon there were other martyrs to love there was hercules betrayed by goddesses and mortal women there was turnus who lost all for love there was croesus wretched in captivity on another wall were the two enchantresses medea and circe holding out their potions of love there is no force on earth that can withstand venus not wisdom not wealth not beauty not cunning not strength or endurance all will fail she rules the world i have given you one or two examples of her mastery there are a thousand more she captured all these lovers in her net and all they could do was let slip the word alas the image of venus in this temple was glorious to see she was naked floating on a limitless ocean of green from the navel down she was environed by waves as glittering as any glass she held a lute in her right hand ready to play upon its strings and on her head she wore a garland of fresh roses their perfume rose into the air above her where fluttered turtledoves beside her stood her son young winged cupid he was blind as the legend tells us but he bore a bow with arrows bright and keen why should i not also tell you about the frescoes within the temple of red mars the walls were all painted from top to bottom just as if they were the interior apartments of his desolate temple in thrace it is a region of frost and snow where the great god of war has his dominion so on the wall was painted the image of a forest forlorn and deserted with black and knotted boughs and bare ruined trees between these stumps and dead things there came a blast of wind like a sigh from hell as though a hideous tempest might whirl everything away there on a bank beside a hill stood the temple of mars omnipotent it was wrought of burnished steel its entrance long and narrow through this grim portal there rushed an endless wind that shook the hinges of the gates an icy light from the north shone through the doors of this temple for there were no windows in the edifice itself the doors themselves were adamantine and eternal their frames plated with sheets of thick iron the pillars that supported the temple were as thick as barrels cast out of cold glittering iron there on the walls i saw all the dark imaginings of the warring world i saw the plans and schemes of felony i saw cruel anger glowing like a coal in a furnace i saw the thief i saw pale fear itself i saw the smiler with the knife under his coat there was the farmhouse set on fire wreathed in burning smoke there were treason and secret murder closely placed beside strife and conflict i saw the wounds of war pouring with blood together with the dagger and the menacing blade that made them this inferno was an echo chamber of groans there was the suicide the sharp nail driven through his temple his hair clotted with his own blood there was death itself lying upwards with its mouth agape in the middle of this place lurked misfortune with the woeful countenance beside him was madness bellowing with wild laughter and with rage and who else were there but discontent alarm and cruelty painted on the wall was an image of the victim in the wood his throat cut of thousands dead although untouched by plague of the tyrant exulting over his prey of the town razed and its inhabitants destroyed i saw the burning ships tossed upon the waves the hunter killed by the raging bears the sow eating the child in the cradle the cook scalded by the devil despite his long spoon all men and affairs are blighted by the evil aspect of mars even one so lowly as the poor carter there he lies his body broken under the wheel here also were the trades favoured by mars here were the barber and the butcher wielding their blades here was the smith forging the bright steel above them was displayed the conquering general sitting in triumph upon a tower with a sword above his head hanging on a slender string there were images of the death of julius caesar of the notorious nero and of anthony who lost the world for love of course none of them was as yet born yet their deaths were still foretold by thunderous mars he saw their fates fully shaped in the patterns of the stars all the legends of great men come to the same conclusion i cannot recite them now and there preeminent stood mars in his chariot the glorious god of war wrapped in his armour looked grim he was ferocious above his head shone two stars that have been named in the old books as the maid puella and the warrior rubeus as the cunning men tell us they are the tokens of the two constellations aligned with mars himself at the feet of the god lay a wolf redeyed ready to devour a man so stood mars in splendour now i hasten on to the temple of chaste diana which i shall describe to you as briefly as i may on the walls of this edifice were painted all the devotion of this great goddess to hunting and to modest chastity there was one of the nymphs of diana fallen callisto in all her woe whom the goddess in her wrath changed into a bear then she relented and transformed her and her son by jupiter into stars so it was painted here i know no more there i saw daphne the daughter of peneus all changed into a laurel tree only thus could she preserve her virginity from lustful apollo there too was actaeon turned into a stag for the crime of observing diana naked by the poolside his own hounds pursued and devoured him little knowing that he was their master there was an image of atalanta and meleager who with others pursued the calydonian boar for which crime diana punished them both severely i saw there depicted many other wonderful stories and legends this is not the place to recall them all the goddess herself was depicted upright upon a hart with small dogs playing about her feet beneath her was the changing moon ever about to wax or wane she was clothed entirely in bright green her bow was in her hand her arrows in their quiver her eyes were cast down upon the ground as if searching for plutos kingdom beneath the earth before her lay a woman in labour the baby was so long in coming forth that the woman was crying out diana goddess of childbirth only you can help me endure the painter spared no expense with the colours of the work it was a living piece of nature these were the temples then that duke theseus had caused to be built at great cost within his amphitheatre when he saw them completed he was content the work had gone well now i will return to palamon and arcite the day was fast approaching for their return to athens where according to their agreement they would bring with them one hundred knights armed for the battle they were the flower of chivalry i do not think that there were any better warriors in the world at that time there were none more noble or more brave all of them were devoted to the knightly virtues of modesty and honour all of them wished to acquire a matchless reputation by dint of arms what better opportunity than the joust for the hand of emily it could happen today if there was a similar contest in england or elsewhere what knight would hesitate before coming forward as a champion to fight for a fair lady that is the height of bliss it is in my mind the meaning of knighthood then and now so rode out the hundred in the company of palamon some were armed with a coat of mail and armoured breastplate covering a light tunic some were wearing sets of plate armour heavy and strong others carried a prussian shield and buckler or were wearing leg armour one brandished a battleaxe and another wielded a steel mace so it was and so it will ever be among the knights who followed palamon was lycurgus king of thrace black was his beard and manly his appearance his eyes were brilliant flashing somewhere between yellow and red his eyebrows were wide and shaggy so that he looked half lion or like some mythical beast of strength he had large limbs and powerful muscles his shoulders were broad and his arms long what more is there to say as was the custom in his country he rode in a golden chariot pulled by four purewhite bulls instead of a tunic over his armour which was studded with bright nails golden in the sun he wore a bearskin black with age his long hair as black and lustrous as the feathers of a raven was combed behind his back upon his head he wore a coronet of gold its threads as thick as a mans arm it was studded with precious stones with rubies and with diamonds and was of tremendous weight beside his chariot ran a score or more of white wolfhounds as large as any steer used to hunting the lion and the stag they followed him with their muzzles tightly bound their leashes fastened to collars of gold he had a hundred knights in his train armed well with hearts stout and defiant so rode out lycurgus according to the old stories which i must use the procession of arcite was accompanied by the great emetreus king of india he rode upon a bay horse the noble beast had trappings of steel and was covered in cloth of gold embroidered with curious devices truly emetreus resembled mars himself his coat of arms was woven of rare silk and embroidered with large white pearls his saddle was of newly beaten gold and the mantle around his shoulders was studded with glowing rubies his hair hung down in curls carefully fashioned it was as yellow and as radiant as the sun he had an aquiline nose and eyes that gave out a golden light his lips were firm and well rounded his face fresh and fair except for some freckles scattered here and there he was a lion in appearance and in purpose i guess his age to be twentyfive he had the makings of a beard and his voice was as stirring as the note of a trumpet he had a wreath of laurel on his head all garlanded with green for his sport he carried on his hand a tame eagle as purely white as a lily he had brought with him like lycurgus a hundred knights armed and equipped in every point only their heads were bare in honour of the fact that they fought for love you should know that in their company were dukes and earls and even other kings assembled together for their delight in chivalry around them on all sides gambolled tame lions and leopards so in this manner the noble group rode to athens they arrived in the city at nine oclock in the morning on a sunday and in the streets they dismounted the duke of athens renowned theseus greeted them and then led them through his city to their lodgings each of them was given hospitality according to his rank he ordered a great feast for them too and arranged everything so well that no one else could have equalled his munificence you may expect me to comment on the music and the service at the feast on the gifts that were given to high and low on the rich furnishings of theseus palace or on the order of guests on the dais or on the ladies who were fairest or most expert at dancing or who sang best or who sang most passionately of love but i am afraid you will be disappointed you will not hear from me about the tame hawks that strutted on their perches or about the mastiffs lying upon the floor of the hall you may see these things in tapestries i deem it more important to carry on with the story that sunday night before the dawn of day just as the lark was beginning to sing it was an hour or two before the end of darkness and yet the lark still sang palamon rose from his bed and blessed himself he was in high spirits and was prepared to make a pilgrimage to venus he intended in other words to visit the shrine of the goddess erected in the amphitheatre in her holy hour the fifth hour of the day he entered the temple and kneeled upon the marble floor where in all humility he prayed to her image fairest of fair oh my lady venus daughter of great jove and spouse of mighty vulcanus joyful comfort of mount cytharea by virtue of the love you had for adonis have pity on my bitter tears receive my humble prayer into your heart alas i do not have the words to tell the sorrows and the torments of my private hell my heart cannot convey the grief i feel i am so distracted and confused that i can only invoke your blessed name have mercy on me fair lady you see into my heart you know my sorrow consider my plight have pity and i promise you this i will ever more be your servant and combat the blight of barren chastity that is my vow i do not ask for fame in arms or for a splendid victory on the field i do not crave feats of vainglory or of martial prowess i crave only the possession of emily so that i might live and die in your service you may choose the means as long as you inform me i do not care if i win victory or suffer defeat as long as i can hold my lady in my arms although i know that dread mars is the god of battle i also know that your power is so great in heaven that your wish is enough to bring me to bliss then i will worship in your temple before your sacred image for the rest of my life i will bear sweet fire to your altar in whatever place i am and sprinkle incense on the sacrifice if your will is against me and you disregard my plea then i wish to die tomorrow at the hand of arcite guide his spear against me when i have lost my life i will not care if he gains the favour of emily now that you have heard the purpose and the substance of my petition great goddess grant me her love when the prayer of palamon was ended he performed the rite of sacrifice to venus with all due diligence and solemnity i cannot recount all of his words and gestures here but i can tell you this at the close of his devotions the statue of venus trembled and made a sign it was a good omen he believed then that his prayer had been accepted the sign of the goddess had intimated some delay but he understood well enough that his request would be fulfilled so he returned home with a light heart three hours after palamon had set out for the temple the bright sun began its pilgrimage across the sky whereupon emily rose too and hastened to the temple of diana her maidens escorted her bearing the sacred fire the incense and the vestments that would be used in the ritual sacrifice the drinking horns were filled to the brim with mead as was the custom they had everything they needed for the holy ceremony emily washed herself in the water of a holy well before sprinkling the temple with incense then she of the gentle heart robed herself modestly i dare not tell you how she performed the sacred rites except in the most general terms what can be forbidden the monk asked him those days are past the pagan night is over tell us all the reeve urged him it will entertain us it can do no harm the miller said not if you mean well we must be free and easy in this company if you permit me then so will it be emilys bright hair was loose combed behind her back upon her head was set a coronet twined from the leaves of the evergreen oak sacred to zeus first she kindled two fires upon the altar and then performed the ritual as it is outlined in the thebaid of statius and other ancient authorities when the fires were fully lit she kneeled before the statue of diana and prayed to her oh chaste goddess of the green woods she murmured to whom all things of heaven and earth are visible queen of platos dark dominions goddess of innocent maidens you have seen into my heart for many years you know my desire i hope i never shall incur your wrath and vengeance as actaeon did when he was turned into a stag but you understand great goddess that i seek only to remain a virgin i never wish to be a mistress or a wife i am a part of your order of maidens devoted to hunting and not to love i long to walk in the wild woods never to marry and never to bear children i have never wished to lie with any man so help me now as goddess of the chase the moon and the underworld cast your triune grace upon me cure palamon and also arcite of their passion for me restore love and peace between them and turn their hearts away from me let all the flames of burning love and hot desire be quenched assuage their violent torment and put out their fire or at the very least send them other loves but if you will not vouchsafe this favour to me and if my destiny will not be as i wish then i ask you this if i must have arcite or palamon grant me the one who loves me best yet let it not come to that behold goddess of chaste purity one who kneels before you weeping bitter tears since you are maid and preserver of us all i pray you keep my maidenhead intact as a virgin i will serve you all my life the bright flames lit up the altar while emily kneeled in prayer but then to her amazement one of the fires was suddenly extinguished only to flare up again after that the other fire went out and as it died away there came a great crackling and roaring as of wet branches burning in a heap from each of the branches of the fire there now dripped blood drop upon drop falling to the floor of the temple emily was confused and terribly alarmed what was this in her fear she cried out like a mad woman she broke down and wept but at that moment she had a vision of diana the apparition of the goddess stood before her with hunters bow in hand and spoke thus daughter cast off your melancholy the gods have decreed and by eternal oath confirmed that you must be wedded to one of these two noble knights who have suffered so much on your behalf i may not tell you which of them but one of them will be your lawful husband farewell i must leave you now but i can tell you this the fires now burning on my altar have been a sign to you you have seen your destiny then the figure of diana vanished with the rattling of her arrows in the quiver emily was amazed at this sudden vision i do not know what the goddess meant she said but diana i put myself under your protection dispose of me as you will thereupon she left the holy place and returned to the palace there i will leave her the hour after this in the planetary hour of mars arcite walked to the temple of the god where he would make his sacrifice he performed all of the sacred rites and then with passion and devotion he prayed to the god of battle oh powerful god who holds dominion in the freezing land of thrace who holds the outcome of all wars in all countries and kingdoms in your hands oh lord of all the fortunes of war accept my sacrifice and hear my plea if my youth deserves your sympathy and if my strength is sufficient to serve you as one of your followers i entreat you to have pity on my pain you suffered the same anguish the same hot flame of desire when you took as your paramour the fair young and fresh venus you possessed her at your will of course there was the occasion when lame vulcan caught you in his net just as you were lying with his wife but let that pass for the sake of all the pain you suffered have pity upon my agonies i am young and ignorant as you know but i believe that i am wounded by love more sorely than any other man in the wide world emily the cause of all my woe does not care whether i sink or swim i know well enough that i must win her in the tournament before she will have mercy on me i know well too that i will need your help and grace before i assay my strength so assist me lord in the battle tomorrow for the sake of the fire that once burned you and for the sake of the fire that now burns me ordain that the victory tomorrow will be mine let my portion be the labour so that yours may be the glory i will honour your sacred temple before any other place on earth i will strive for your delight in all the arts and crafts of war i will hang my banners and all the arms of my company above this hallowed altar here too i will light an everlasting flame where i will worship to the day of my death and i make this vow to you i will cut off my hair and beard that have never yet felt the blade or razor and offer them as a sacrifice to your might i will be your true servant for the rest of my life now great god have pity on my sorrow grant me the victory i ask no more when arcite had finished his prayer the rings that hung upon the doors of the temple began to shake the doors themselves trembled with some unearthly power and arcite became afraid the fires upon the altar flared up and the whole temple was filled with brightness a sweet scent issued from the ground and wafted through the trembling air arcite raised his hand and sprinkled more incense upon the flame when he had finished all the rites of worship he waited with head bowed the statue of mars began to move and the gods coat of arms rattled there was a sound as of low murmuring and one word was whispered victory arcite rejoiced and having paid homage to mars returned to his lodgings with high hopes for the coming battle he was as exultant as a lark ascending yet now as a result of these events upon the earth there sprang up strife among the gods above venus and mars were opposed the goddess of love against the god of war jupiter attempted to resolve their dispute but it was really saturn who restored their harmony saturn is the pale and cold god but he was experienced in all the foibles and adventures of the other divinities he knew how to bring unity to the chambers of heaven age has its advantages after all it is a sign of wisdom and of long practice you can outrun the old but you cannot outwit them it may not be in the nature of saturn to quell strife and dispel terror yet on this occasion he found the means to satisfy both parties venus my granddaughter he said my wide orbit extends much further than humankind can understand mine is the drowning in the dark sea the prisoner in the dark cell is also mine i am the lord of strangling and of hanging by the throat i am the leader of revolt and rebellion i provoke the loud groaning i administer the secret poison when i am in the sign of leo then i deal out vengeance and punishment i stand in triumph above the ruined halls i throw the walls down on masons and on carpenters i slew sampson as he shook the pillar i am the master of shivering ague i direct the treasons and the secret plots i smile upon pestilence so listen to me now weep no more i will look after you your knight palamon will win the lady just as you have promised to him mars will in turn help arcite and save his honour nevertheless there must now be peace between the two of you i know that you have different temperaments and that as a result there is division between you but enough of strife i am your grandfather i am ready and willing to help you dry your eyes so spoke dread saturn now i will leave the gods in heaven and return to the events of earth it is time for the tournament of arms and the men i sing part four the festivities that day in athens were glorious the vigour of may entered every person so that all were bold and playful they danced and jousted all that monday or spent the day in the service of venus the night was for rest all were eager to rise early and to witness the great fight on that morning there was a great bustle and noise in the inns and lodgings as the horses and the suits of armour were prepared for the battle the knights and the companies of nobles mounted on stallions and fine steeds rode out to the palace if you had been there you would have seen armour so ornate and so exotic that it seemed to be spun out of gold and steel the spears the headarmour and the horsearmour glittered in the morning sun while the golden mail and coats of arms glowed in the throng in the saddle were lords wearing richly decorated robes followed by the knights of their retinue and their squires the squires themselves were busy fastening the heads to the shafts of the spears buckling up the helmets and fitting the shields with leather straps this was no time to be idle the horses were foaming and champing on their golden bridles the armourers were running here and there with file and hammer there were yeomen in procession and also many of the common people with thick staffs in their hands all of them rode or marched to the notes of pipes trumpets bugles and kettledrums blaring out the sound of battle in the palace there were small groups of people in excited debate all of them discussing the merits of the theban knights one had an opinion which another contradicted one said this another said that some supported the knight with the black beard while others commended the bald fellow yet others gave the palm to the knight with the shaggy hair i tell you this one courtier said he looks like a fighter that axe of his must weight twenty pounds at least never so long after the sun had risen the halls rang with gossip and speculation the noble lord theseus had already been woken by the music of minstrels and by the noise of the crowd yet he remained in the privy chambers of his palace until palamon and arcite equally honoured guests were brought into the courtyard theseus appeared at a great window where he sat in state as if he were a god enthroned the crowd of people were allowed to enter and pressed forward to see him and to do him reverence they were also curious to hear what he had decided to say so they grew silent when the herald called out oye oye when they were quite still he proceeded to read out the dukes decree the lord theseus he said revolving the matter of this tournament in his noble mind and deeming it little better than folly to risk the lives of these noble knights in mortal struggle whereupon what with one thing and another with the intent that none of them shall die he has changed his original plan no man therefore on pain of his life will bring any arrow or axe or knife into the jousts no one will carry or cause to be carried or draw or cause to be drawn any short sword no such weapon will be allowed only one charge will be allowed with a sharp spear against an opponent if on foot the combatant is allowed to thrust in selfdefence if by mischance he is taken he is not to be slain but marched under guard to a post that will be set up on either side there he must stay if either palamon or arcite is captured or if one of them dies then the tournament comes to an end god speed to all the fighters go forth now and smite hard good luck with your maces and your long swords make your way to the list this is the will of noble theseus the people cried aloud with one voice and their approbation reached the gates of heaven god bless you great lord in your goodness of heart you are not willing to shed noble blood then as the trumpets blew and the drums began to beat the whole company made its way to the amphitheatre of stone the people of athens proceeded according to their rank through a city decked in cloth of gold leading them was theseus himself with palamon and arcite riding on either side after him rode his queen hippolita and fair emily herself while all the rest followed it was not yet nine oclock when they arrived at the lists but theseus took his seat of state when he was enthroned in majesty hippolita and emily sat in their appointed places then all the others took their seats they looked towards the western gate of mars where arcite with a banner of red entered with his hundred knights at the same moment through the eastern gate dedicated to venus palamon rode out with his retinue he had unfurled a banner of white and carried it with spirit and dedication there could not have been two sets of troops in the world who were so evenly matched in every respect in courage in nobility and in age they rode in two ranks like beside like when their names were called to confirm their number each one answered in turn there was no attempt at treachery after the muster was taken the gates were shut and the cry rang out knights fulfil your duty then as the trumpets blared the heralds withdrew the battle was set to begin on both sides in go the spears held firmly for attack in go the spurs piercing the flanks of the horses these were plainly men who could joust and ride the shivering shafts then fell against the sturdy shields one rider feels the thrust against his breastbone the spears spring up some twenty feet in height the gleaming swords are raised as bright as silver the helmets of the knights are smashed to smithereens blood bubbles bones break breasts burst one knight hurls himself through the thickest of the throng one steed stumbles and down come horse and rider rolling under foot another knight stands his ground and fights with his spear sending his opponent tumbling here is one wounded and taken despite his protests he is led to the pillar of defeat where he must remain for the duration of the tournament another fallen knight is escorted to the other side from time to time theseus ordains a pause so that the knights may rest and with drink or other cordials refresh themselves there were many occasions when the two thebans palamon and arcite were engaged in single combat they scarred and slashed one another and were both unhorsed there is no tiger in the woods of greece her whelp stolen by a hyena who was more savage than arcite stalking his foe the moroccan lion hunted down and weak from hunger was not more fierce than palamon against his enemy in love enraged with jealousy they struck each other hard their blood ran in streams upon the earth yet there is an end to everything before the day drew to a close the strong king emetreus managed to get hold of palamon while he was fighting arcite he plunged his sword into his flesh and with twenty men dragged him to the stake immediately the great king lycurgus rode to the rescue of his champion but he was knocked from his horse emetreus himself was wounded by palamon who refusing to yield had struck out at him with his sword and dislodged him from his saddle yet it was all for nothing he was taken struggling to the stake his brave heart could not assist him now as the rules of theseus had stated he was obliged to remain where he was he had been defeated he was bowed in sorrow knowing well enough that he could not fight again when theseus witnessed all this he cried out to the knights left in the field no more the fighting is over i can now give my just and proper decision arcite of thebes has gained the hand of emily he has won her in a fair contest fortune is on his side the people then exclaimed with joy in cries and shouts so loud that it seemed the lists themselves might fall what can fair venus patron of palamon do now what can she say of course as women will she broke down in tears she wept at the thwarting of her will i am disgraced she said i have been put to shame wait saturn told her be calm mars has had his wish fulfilled and his knight has gained the victory but trust me your heart will soon be eased together they looked down upon the scene on earth as the trumpets blared out and the heralds joyfully declared that arcite had triumphed over palamon but do not join the general clamour listen to me first i will relate to you a miracle fierce arcite had removed his helmet so that the crowd might see his face he rode in triumph on his charger around the course looking up at emily she returned his look with an affectionate glance indicating to everyone that fortunes favourite was also her own it seemed to arcite that his heart might burst with love and tenderness but then something happened a hellborn fury rose up from the ground despatched from the dark world by pluto at the request of saturn the horse started with fright at the apparition reared up and then fell on its side before arcite could leap from his saddle he was thrown off and pitched headlong on to the ground he lay there as if he were already dead his chest shattered by his own bow the blood ran into his face so that it seemed to turn black immediately he was taken up and carried to the palace of theseus he was cut out of his armour and gently laid in a bed he was still alive and conscious crying out all the time for emily meanwhile duke theseus returned to athens with all of his company he travelled in ceremonial state and in festive guise since he did not wish to dishearten the people by dwelling on the accident it was widely reported that arcite was not in danger of death and that he would soon recover from his wounds there was another reason for celebration too since not one of the combatants had been slain in the tournament there were many who were badly injured especially one whose breastbone was broken by a spear but no one had died some of the knights had sweetsmelling ointment for their wounds while others had magical charms to work on broken limbs and broken heads many of the fighters could be seen gulping down the fermentation of herbs even sage in order to heal themselves sage is good for convulsions hence the saying why should a man die when sage grows in the garden theseus also did his best to comfort and to cheer them and according to the laws of good hospitality he organized a revel that would last all night he also issued a proclamation in which he stated that no one had been defeated or disgraced it had been a noble tournament an affair of honour to all concerned subject only to the whim of fate there was no shame in being captured and dragged to the stake by twenty armed men palamon had not surrendered but had been manhandled by knights yeomen and servants even his horse had been beaten with staves he had no reason to be ashamed or humiliated his bravery was clear for all to see so theseus calmed both sides of the dispute and prevented any outburst of anger or resentment in fact they embraced one another like brothers the duke gave them gifts their worth determined by their rank and organized a lavish feast that lasted for three days then he escorted the two kings emetreus and lycurgus royally out of his lands every man went home well pleased by the adventure and the final words among them all were farewell good fortune now i will return to the two thebans the breast of arcite was terribly swollen by his injury the pressure on his heart increased and the blood was clotted beyond the remedy of any physician it was trapped corrupted and seething in his body and could not be released by cupping or bleeding or herbal cure the animal spirits of the body were not powerful enough to expel the rotting matter so all the vessels of his lungs began to swell and all the muscles of his breast were paralysed by the venom he could neither vomit nor excrete that part of his body was thoroughly broken down life held no dominion there and if there comes a time when the powers of nature no longer work then the benefits of medicine are worthless it is time for church arcite must surely die that is the sum of it so on his deathbed he sent for emily and for palamon and whispered to them his dying words the woeful spirit in my heart cannot begin to tell my grief to you sweet lady whom i love most i am about to die now that my life is over i bequeath to you above all others lady the service of my spirit what is this woe what are the pains so strong that i have suffered for you and for so long what is this death that comes for me alas emily from whom i must depart for ever you are the queen of my heart my wife my sweetheart and the ender of my life what is this life what do men know of it we are in love and then we are in the cold grave there we lie alone without any company farewell my sweet enemy my emily yet before i leave you take me softly in your arms for love of god and listen to what i say my dear cousin palamon is with us for a long time there was strife and anger between us we fought each other for the right to claim you but i pray to jupiter now to give me the power to portray him properly to depict that is to say his truth and honour to celebrate his wisdom and humility to applaud his nobility of character to describe his noble lineage and his devotion to all the knightly virtues he is a servant too in the cause of love so by the great gods i recommend him to you emily to be your lover and your husband there is no one on earth more worthy he will serve you for the rest of his life if you do decide to marry do not forget this gentle man at this point the speech of arcite began to fail the cold of death had travelled from his feet to his chest his limbs grew weak and pale from loss of vital strength only his intellect remained but that too was dimmed when his heart grew feeble and felt the approach of death his eyes began to close and his breath was weak yet still he gazed at emily his last words were have pity emily and then his soul changed house i do not know where it travelled i have never been to that distant country i am not a theologian i can say nothing and why should i repeat the speculations of those who profess to know there is nothing about souls in the volume where i found this old story arcite is dead that is all i can tell you may his god mars guide his spirit and what of those left in life emily shrieked palamon howled theseus led his sisterinlaw swooning from the deathbed there is no point spending more time recounting how her night and morning were spent in tears in such cases women feel more sorrow than i can relate when their husbands are taken from them they are consumed in grief or become so sick that they must surely die the people of athens too were distraught infinite were the tears of old and young lamenting the fate of arcite the death of hector himself when his fresh corpse was carried back into troy could not have caused more sorrow there was nothing but pity and grief the women scratched their cheeks and rent their hair in mourning why did you die one of them cried out you had gold enough and you had emily there was only one man who could comfort theseus himself his old father aegaeus had seen the vicissitudes of the world and had witnessed the sudden changes from joy to woe from woe to happiness there is no man who has died on earth without having first lived and so there is no one alive who will not at some point die this world is nothing but a thoroughfare of woe down which we all pass as pilgrims so are we all here the franklin had interrupted the knights tale the whole world is an inn our host said and the end of the journey is always the same god give us grace and a good death this was the reeve crossing himself amen to that the knight replied and then he continued with his story as aegaeus told theseus death is an end to every worldly disappointment he said much more in a similar vein and in the same way he encouraged the people of athens to take heart so theseus was comforted by his words and busied himself in finding the best place for the tomb of arcite to be raised in honour of the fallen knight he finally came to the conclusion that the most appropriate site would be the wooded grove in which palamon and arcite had fought their duel for the hand of emily in this place ever green and ever fresh arcite had professed his love and uttered his hearts complaints so in this grove where all the fires of love had been kindled theseus would light the fire of arcites funeral pyre fire would put out fire so he commanded that his men cut down the ancient oaks and lay them in a row then he ordered that the trees should be piled up so that they might burn more easily his officers swiftly obeyed his commands then theseus bid them to prepare a bier which he covered with the richest cloth of gold that he possessed he dressed the body of arcite in the same material he put white gloves upon his hands crowned him with a laurel of myrtle and placed a bright sword in the hands of the fallen warrior he laid him face uncovered on the bier then he broke down and wept at first light he ordered that the bier be taken into the hall of the palace so that all the people might have a chance of paying respect to arcite it quickly became a place of grief and loud lamentation here came the woeful theban palamon with dishevelled beard and uncut hair his clothes of mourning were sprinkled with his tears he was followed by emily the most sorrowful of the company who could not stop weeping arcite had been of royal lineage and deserved a funeral suiting his rank and high blood so theseus commanded his officers to lead out three horses equipped with trappings of glittering steel and mantled with the heraldic arms of the dead hero upon these three great white horses there rode three horsemen the first of them carried the shield of arcite the second bore aloft the spear and the third held up the turkish bow fashioned out of pure gold they rode solemnly and with sorrowful countenance towards the wooded grove behind them marched at slow pace the most noble of all the athenian warriors carrying the bier on their shoulders their eyes red with weeping they made their way down the main street of the city that had been covered in black cloth and with black drapes hanging from the windows at their right hand walked aegaeus and on their left hand theseus father and son were carrying vessels of the purest gold filled with milk and honey blood and wine palamon followed them surrounded by a great company and after him came emily she carried with her according to custom the covered flame of the funeral service there had been much labour and preparation for this funeral the pyre itself reached up so high that its green summit seemed to touch the heavens while its base was as broad as twenty fathoms it was made up of branches and of straw piled up thickly the boughs came from the oak and the fir the birch and the aspen the elder and the ilex the poplar and the willow the elm and the plane the ash and the box the lime and the laurel is there any tree i have forgot to mention oh yes there was also wood from the maple and the thorn the beech and the hazel and of course the mournful willow i have not time now to describe how they were all cut down i can tell you this all the gods of the wood ran up and down in despair at losing their homes the nymphs the fauns the hamadryads used to repose among the trees in peace and safety now like the birds and animals they fled for fear after their wood had gone they could not live in a waste the ground itself was pale unvisited by the sun it seemed alarmed by the glare of the sudden light the funeral pyre had first been laid with straw covered by dry sticks and tree trunks hewn apart then green boughs and spices were placed upon them cloth of gold and precious stones were added to the pile followed by garlands of flowers and myrrh and sweetsmelling incense then arcite was laid upon this rich bed his body surrounded by treasure emily according to custom laid the flaming torch to the pyre but she swooned as the fire flared up she soon recovered but i cannot tell you what she said or felt because i do not know holy dread sorrow emptiness now the fire was burning strongly the mourners cast in their jewels some of the warriors threw on to the flames their swords and spears others tore off their robes and flung them on the pyre in fulfilment of the ritual the principal mourners threw in their cups of wine and milk and blood so that the roar of the flames grew ever louder the athenian warriors in a great throng and crying out in strong voices rode three times around the pyre with their spears raised into the air hail and farewell three times too the women set up their lamentation when the body of arcite was reduced to white ashes emily was escorted back to the palace a wake was held there lasting all that night the athenians performed their funeral games with wrestling matches the naked contestants glistening with oil and other sports when their play was done they returned to their homes in the city so now i will come to the point and make an end to my long story after a period of years when by general consent the time of mourning was passed and the last tear shed for arcite theseus called a parliament in athens to deliberate upon certain matters of state on treaties and alliances that kind of thing one debate concerned the allegiance of thebes to athens according to the old agreement and so theseus summoned palamon to attend the meeting palamon was not aware of the matter under discussion but he came in due haste he was still wearing the clothes of mourning for his dead comrade when palamon had taken his seat theseus called for emily the assembly was hushed and expectant waiting for theseus to speak he stood before his throne and before he said anything he looked around at the company with an observant eye then he sighed and with a serious countenance began to speak it was the first mover of the universe the first cause of being who created the great chain of love he had a high purpose and a strong intent he knew what he was doing and what he meant he had foreknowledge of the consequences too for in that chain of love he bound together fire and air earth and water they are locked in an embrace that they can never leave this same prince of being has established the rule of time in the restless world in which we dwell day follows day summer succeeds spring and the span of life is finite no one can surpass his allotted time although he may abridge it i need not cite authorities to prove my case it is the common human experience i will say only one thing if men recognize the harmony of the cosmos then they must conclude that the first mover is selfsufficient and eternal only a fool would deny that the part emerges from the whole nature did not derive from some provisional or partial being it is the offspring of eternal perfection that by degrees descends into the corrupted and mutable world so in his wisdom the first mover the great cause has ordained that all species and all types all forms and ranks shall endure for a space upon this earth nothing may be eternal here you can see the evidence all around you consider the oak its life is so long its nourishing so slow from its first growth to its final form and yet in the end it will fade and fall consider also how the hardest stone under our feet will eventually be worn away the broadest river may become a dry channel the greatest cities can become wastelands all things must end it is the law of life itself men and women grow from youth to age by due process king and slave will both expire some die in bed and some die in the deep sea some die on the battlefield the manner of their parting is not important there is only one outcome death holds dominion and who disposed all this but the sovereign god high jupiter it was he who has arranged that all created things should return to the darkness of their origins no force on earth can withstand his will so it is wise therefore to make a virtue of necessity and to accept that which cannot be averted it will come as certainly as tomorrow what cannot be cured must be endured he who raises his voice in protest is guilty of folly he is in rebellion against the great god and what gives a man more honour than to die in good time to die in the glory and flower of his life bearing a good name with him into the grave to die without shame to his friends and kinsmen surely all his acquaintance would applaud it it is better to depart this life in fame and good respect than to linger on in oblivion achievements neglected and victories forgotten to argue otherwise is foolishness no we have no reason to mourn the passing of arcite the pattern of chivalry or grieve for the fact that he has escaped the dark prison of this life he has performed his duty he has the right to be honoured and why should palamon and emily here lament his felicity he loved them well and would not thank them for their tears they hurt only themselves and not his ghost their sorrow would be lost upon dead arcite now i will make an end to my long speech i advise us all to lighten our mood after misery comes happiness after pain speeds bliss for this we may thank the grace of the great god above us before we leave this place therefore i hope that we can make one perfect and everlasting joy out of a double sorrow where we find the deepest hurt there we must apply the balm then he turned to emily sister he said this proposal has my strong consent and is confirmed by the parliament of athens i will ask you to look kindly upon palamon your own true knight who ever since you have known him has served you in soul and heart and mind i ask you to be gracious to him and to pity him i ask you to take him as your husband and your lord give me your hand as a token of our accord let me see your compassion he is not without merit he is descended from a royal race but even if he were simply a poor young knight he would be worthy of you he has been your servant for many years and has endured much adversity in following you and so when you consider his steadfastness let mercy triumph over strict justice then theseus turned to palamon i believe that you will need very little persuasion to accept my proposal come to your lady and take her by the hand so thereupon to general rejoicing a marriage bond was made between palamon and emily bliss melody union and so may god who created this wide world grant them his love now palamon has obtained happiness at last he lives in health and comfort emily loves him so tenderly and in turn is served by him so graciously that there is not one unhappy or jealous word between them so ends the story of palamon and arcite god save all this fair and attentive company heere is ended the knyghtes tale the millers prologue heere folwen the wordes bitwene the hoost and the millere when the knight had finished his story everyone in our company young and old rich and poor agreed that it was a noble story to be kept ever green in the memory our host harry bailey laughed and joked with us by my faith he said the gate has been opened we can see the path ahead of us now who is going to tell the next story the game has been well begun who will continue it how about you sir monk do you have anything to compare with the knights tale the miller was coming up behind half on and half off his horse he was so drunk that he could scarcely keep his saddle they say of a drunken man that he has seen the devil the miller was pale enough he did not have the courtesy to doff his hood or his hat or wait for anyone else to speak in a voice as loud as that of pilate on the pageant stage he cried out to our host by the blood and bones of christ harry he shouted i have a noble story to tell it will beat the knight by a mile then he burped harry could see that he was drunk and tried to calm him down wait a little robin he said let someone else tell the next story dear friend and you can tell yours later we have to arrange these things properly by gods soul i will not i will speak now or i will go my own way without you all in the devils name speak then harry replied you are a fool you left your wits in a dish of ale listen to me all of you the miller said i admit that i am drunk there is no point in denying it so if i swear or get my words mixed up blame it on good southwark beer but this is it this is the point i want to tell you the story of a carpenter and his wife and how a young scholar got the better of the carpenter if you know what i mean the reeve then angrily interrupted him thats enough stop spouting all this lewd nonsense slurring your words it is sinful and foolish to injure the reputation of any man and to bring wives into disrepute why damage the good folk there are plenty of other things to talk about the drunken miller answered him at once oswald dear brother he said you know the old saying he who has no wife cannot be a cuckold i am not saying you are one of them i dont know in any case there are plenty of good wives i would say if you were asking that there were a thousand good to one bad you should know as much yourself unless youre completely mad so why are you so angry with my story i have a wife just the same as you i swear on all i hold sacred that she has been faithful to me i swear let me think i swear on my oxen that i am not a cuckold at least i hope i am not no husband should want to know the secrets of god or the secrets of his wife as long as he can graze on gods plenty in the shape of a female body he should not bother about anything else it was clear that the miller was not about to restrain himself but was going to tell his vulgar story in his own very vulgar way i am only sorry that i have to repeat it here and therefore dear readers forgive anything you find in the next few pages my intentions are not bad i am obliged to repeat everything i have heard for good or ill otherwise i will have failed i will have been unfaithful to my material if you do not want to read the millers tale then pass on to one of the others i am not forcing you there are plenty of other stories here there are history tales and tales of piety and moral tales galore dont blame me if you choose the wrong one the miller is a vulgarian you know that the reeve is a bit of a lout too along with others i could mention they both told dirty stories so reflect do not lay the blame on me in any case why take this game too seriously the millers tale heere bigynneth the millere his tale once upon a time there was living in oxford an old codger a rich old carpenter he followed his trade faithfully enough but he also took paying guests into his house one of these lodgers was a poor student who had finished the university course but was more interested in learning all the arts of astrology he knew a number of operations and conclusions and calculations i dont know the precise terms for every one of them but he knew enough to work out the days of rain and the days of drought he also had a ready answer when anyone asked him to prophesy the future he was polite he was courteous his name was nicholas he also had an eye for the ladies and he knew how to get them into bed without any fuss he was as mildmannered as a maiden and very discreet but inwardly he burned he had his own chamber at the top of the carpenters house there he would rub the juice of sweet herbs all over his body so that he was as fragrant as odorous liquorice or balmy ginger of course this aroused the women on the shelves above his bed were the instruments of his art the globes and the treatises the astrolabe and the abacus with its glass counters here is another detail which the girls noticed his wardrobe was draped with an old scarlet curtain and there was a harp beside his bed on which he played at night the chamber rang to the sound of his sweet voice with his rendition of what the angel said to the virgin and the kings own tune you would think that he was an angel himself but no girl near him would have been a virgin very long so passed the happy life of young nicholas depending blithely on the money he earned or was given by his friends it made no difference to him now his landlord had recently taken a new wife alison was a sparkler eighteen years old and of course the carpenter loved her madly yet he was so jealous that he took great care to keep her to himself she was young and lusty he was old and crusty what if someone should beguile her he was too stupid to have read the works of cato otherwise he would have learned that it is better for a man to marry a woman who is his equal people should marry according to their age and rank winter and spring do not mix especially in bed well he had made his bed according to his wish and now he must lie in it this young wife was a beauty as small and delicate as a little squirrel she used to wear a girdle of striped silk she had an apron as white as morning milk with as many folds and flounces as a wedding dress above it she wore a white shift with its collar embroidered back and front the collar itself was of black silk very alluring the ribbons of her white cap were also black her headband was set back so that you could see her forehead the forehead is the plain of venus and then there were her eyes such lecherous eyes she had plucked her eyebrows so that they made a slender arch a delicate black matching the ribbons of her cap she was more delicious and refreshing than the sight of a tree filled with early fruit she was softer than the wool of a lamb from her girdle there hung a purse of leather swinging on tassels of silk and adorned with glowing brass no man in the world could have imagined such a frisker alison was a giglet a fisgig no wench ever had a merrier complexion either with cheeks as shiny as a new gold coin and when she sang her voice was as light and lively as that of any swallow perched upon a barn she could skip and play delightfully just like a kid or calf following its mother her mouth was as sweet as honey mixed with mead her breath like the perfume of apples laid in stores of heather she was as skittish as a winsome colt as slender as a mast and as straight as the bolt of a crossbow she had a brooch pinned to her collar which for size matched the boss of a warriors shield she wore high boots and laced them right to the top she was a little rose a marigold to heal the eye she was fit to be fucked by a prince and after that married to a yeoman now so it happened that one fine day while the old carpenter was working at osney abbey sweet nicholas began to flirt and play with her he was like many students a crafty and resourceful young man what does he do he begins to caress her cunt saying to her you know if i dont have you then i will die for love of you then his hand wandered further down and he began to stroke her thighs sweetheart he says make love to me now or god help me i will lie down and die fuck me or i am finished but she leaped up as fast as a colt about to have its hooves shod and instantly turned her head away sod you nicholas she screamed at him do you really think im going to kiss you sod off take your hands off me too or else ill cry rape so nicholas began to apologize and then from apology he went to excuse and from excuse to offer he got his way in the end of course by the time he had finished coaxing and charming her she was practically begging for it we have a problem she told him my husband is so full of jealousy that we have to be careful we have to wait otherwise he will kill me i am not joking we have to keep this a secret dont worry he said a scholar can outwit a carpenter any time what else is the use of education so they agreed with one another to bide their time and wait for the right moment nicholas gave her a kiss and ran his hands up and down the inside of her thighs then he went back to his chamber took up his harp and began to play a lively melody now it so happened that on the next holy day alison went to the parish church in order to worship the saviour she had finished her work and had made sure to wash her face so that it shone as any good wife would in this church there was a clerk in holy orders with the name of absolon he had the most lovely blond curls which were stretched out like a halo all over his head but he was no saint his hair was carefully parted with more art than nature his complexion was ruddy and his eyes as grey as a doves wing he had tracery on his shoes as if they were stainedglass windows and he wore red hose tight and shapely his clothes were tight too the better to show off his figure he wore a tunic of light blue its laces knotted at the waist above that he donned a fine surplice as white as the blossom on the bough god knows he was a sprightly young man he cheerfully performed all the duties pertaining to a clerk he could let blood with the best of them he knew how to cut hair and how to shave the chin he could draw up deeds and contracts without any fuss he knew twenty different dance steps too and in the oxford style he would kick up his legs in every direction he could play the fiddle and sing along in a light falsetto and he knew how to strum a guitar he knew all the inns and taverns of the city he knew every pretty barmaid of course and he could be very intimate and entertaining he had one or two little foibles he did not like to fart in public and secondly he was very prim in conversation so on this particular holy day absolon came out swinging his censer and made sure to point it in the direction of the females of the parish he could have pointed something else at them too he looked them up and down as they were wreathed in sweet smoke and then presently he noticed the carpenters young wife wow he could look at her all day she was so pretty so sweet so so inviting i dare say that if she had been a mouse and he a cat he would have pounced straight away he would have been the cat who got the cream he was so lost in love and longing that when he went around with the collection bowl he would not take a penny from any of the young women out of courtesy he said i think he was in a daze excuse me at this point the miller stopped and refreshed himself with some ale he put the flagon to his lips and almost choked on it the sound of his coughing and retching was horrible but then he resumed his tale that night under the light of the full moon absolon took up his guitar he fully expected to stay awake all night for the sake of love so he wandered abroad amorous and willing and made his way to the house of the carpenter just before dawn at the crowing of the cock he stood beneath one of the casement windows there he began softly to play the guitar and to sing this accompaniment now dear lady if it pleases you have pity on me but his voice woke up the carpenter who turned to his wife lying beside him alison he said wake up can you hear the voice of absolon he is singing right beneath the window all she said was yes john i hear him i hear him very clearly so as you would expect matters took their course absolon the unsuccessful wooer becomes deeply unhappy he fritters away the day and stays awake all night he never stops combing his hair and looking at himself in the mirror he sends notes to her by gobetweens and messengers he swears to serve her faithfully he sings to her trilling like some nightingale he sends her spiced wine mead and ale he even offers her money to spend in town some women can be won by cash you see just as some can be lured by kindness or taken by force it depends on the circumstances there was even a time when to show his prowess as a performer he agreed to take the part of herod in the pageant plays but what was the good of all this posturing the point is that alison loved another no not the carpenter of course she could not love her husband she loved the clerk and lodger nicholas absolon might as well go whistle in the wind she treated him as a joke she turned him into her pet monkey and laughed at his screechings the proverb is quite right the one who is closest comes first out of sight is out of mind lively nicholas was there in the house with her while poor distraught absolon was on the other side of town you might say that nicholas stood in his light so good luck to you young scholar even though absolon will wail alas it happened that one saturday the carpenter had gone back to osney abbey alison and nicholas took advantage of his absence and conferred together this was their plan nicholas would come up with a ruse to beguile the jealous old sod if everything went well then she would nestle in his arms all night that was what both of them wanted so without more ado nicholas left her and took up on a platter enough meat and drink to sustain him in his chamber for a day or two if the carpenter asked after him she was to say that she did not know where he was that she had not seen him that she had not heard from him that she even wondered if he was ill the maid had called for him but there had been no answer from him so all that saturday there was silence nicholas lay very quietly in his chamber eating and drinking and doing anything else he fancied i could not say what this lasted until sunday evening the old carpenter was by now in a state of some alarm and wondered if his lodger had taken ill could it be the white death i am afraid he said by the bones of all the saints something is wrong with nicholas god forbid that he should have died suddenly this wicked world is uncertain enough i saw today a corpse borne to church who last monday i saw at work then he turned to his servantboy robin go upstairs he said and shout for him at his door knock on it with a stone if you wish find out whats going on then come and tell me so the boy eagerly ran up the stairs and came to a halt outside nicholass chamber then he knocked on the door like a madman and shouted out very loudly hey where are you master nicholas how can you sleep all day it isnt right he might as well have saved his breath there was no response but he knew there was a hole in the skirting board which the cat used as a passage so he got down on his knees and peered through this hole what do you think he saw there was nicholas sitting upright in his bed with his mouth open motionless gaping at the ceiling he might have been struck by the new moon so robin rushed downstairs in a state of great excitement and relayed the strange news to the carpenter the old man blessed himself and said by the patron saint of oxford frydeswyde no man knows what will happen next our young friend has been affected by all this astronomy business he has fallen into a fit or he may have gone mad i knew this would happen all along no man should try to seek out gods secrets blessed are the ignorant who know only how to say their prayers it happened to another scholar you know did you hear about him he was walking in the fields one night gazing up at the stars to find the future when he fell into a clay pit he didnt see that did he and yet i do feel sorry for young nicholas if i get the chance and pray god i do i will scold him for all his studying get me a long staff robin and i will lever it under his door while you tear it off its hinges that will get his attention so they climbed upstairs and stood outside nicholass room robin was a strong boy and managed to get the door off without much difficulty it fell down on the floor with a clatter yet nicholas did not move a muscle he was completely motionless his mouth open staring into space the carpenter thought that he might be paralysed by despair and shook him violently by the shoulders then he shouted at him nicholas look at me wake up think of the passion of christ he made the sign of the cross over him look he said i am expelling the elves and wicked fairies that torment you he went to the four corners of the chamber and muttered the night spell then he crossed the threshold and recited the same charm jesus christ and benedict keep us from heavens interdict against the spirits of the night protect us from the evil blight now at this moment nicholas began to stir he sighed very deeply he groaned he began to talk to himself alas he said is it true is the world about to end what are you saying the carpenter was alarmed put your trust in god we who work in the world have faith get me a drink nicholas replied and then i will tell you something in confidence it is an affair that concerns both of us and i will tell nobody else about it so the carpenter went downstairs and came back with a flagon of strong ale they both drank deeply and then with a finger to his lips nicholas shut the door and sat down with the carpenter on the bed john he said my dear friend and landlord you must promise me that you will never reveal what i am about to tell you what i have to say has been sent to me from above he raised his eyes to the ceiling if you disclose it you will be damned for ever if you betray my confidence you will be lost you will be condemned to madness christ and his holy blood forbid it should come to that the poor fool replied although i say it myself i dont have a big mouth i am not about to gab to man or wife or child you have my word on that very good john nicholas sat closer to him and put his mouth to the carpenters ear this is it i am not going to lie to you i have been studying my books very carefully you might say that i have drunk deep of their wisdom and i have been observing the moon this is what i have discovered next monday about nine oclock at night there is going to be torrential rain it will be wild incessant and prolonged it will be more powerful than the flood in less than an hour the whole world will be drowned all human life will be destroyed oh god exclaimed the carpenter what about alison what about my wife will she be drowned too he was prostrate with sorrow he looked as if he were about to faint is there no solution no escape why yes there is god is above us you must follow my instructions to the letter dont start planning and scheming on your own that wont work the saying of solomon is still true follow good advice and you will not be sorry and i promise you this without having to build an ark i will save the three of us do you remember what happened to noah when god warned him that the earth was about to be drowned yes many years ago when you heard it or when it happened when i heard it so you must also have heard of the trouble of noah and his family trying to get his wife to go on board the ark he would have given up all the animals from aardvark to zebra to dispatch her on a ship of her own so now what are we going to do speed is necessary this is no time for making speeches we cannot wait what you have to do is this you have to find us three tubs or troughs you know the kind in which you knead dough or brew beer but they have to be large enough to accommodate each one of us and obviously they have to be able to float once you have them put enough food in each of them for a day there will be no need for any more the waters will go down as swiftly as they came up at nine oclock the next morning what about young robin and jill our maid i am afraid that they cannot be saved dont ask me why i cannot reveal the secrets of god it must suffice that you and alison and i will be rescued from the flood you would be mad not to do this so get on with it oh one more thing when you have found these three tubs you must hang them high up from the rafters so that no one will know what we are doing when you have done all this and have stored all the food and drink you must get hold of an axe we will need it to break the ropes and then cast off we will also have to make a hole through the gable over the stable on the garden side so that we can float free once the great rain has stopped we will bob along as merrily as a white duck following her drake then i will shout to you hi there alison hi there john cheer up the flood will soon be gone and you will shout back good morning nicholas i can see you again there is daylight then we will be masters of the world just like noah and his wife i must just warn you of one thing on the night of the tempest when we are safely ensconced in our tubs we must not speak or say one word we must stay in silent prayer that is gods will you and your wife must hang some way apart too so that you wont be tempted to sin with her in look in speech or in deed that is also gods command do you understand tomorrow night when the rest of the world is asleep we will creep into our tubs our boats we will sit there and wait for the grace of god thats it you had better get moving i dont have time for any more words there is an old saying spare the words and fare the wiser you are wise enough already i am sure and dont need to hear from me go and save us that is my last request so the innocent carpenter went on his way sighing and lamenting of course he told alison everything in conditions of complete secrecy but he might as well have saved his breath she knew exactly what was going on and had a pretty good idea of nicholass stratagem nevertheless she threw herself into the part and began to weep and wail at a great rate alas she cried out go and do what nicholas bids you help us to escape otherwise we are all doomed doomed i am your true and faithful wedded wife go on dear husband for pitys sake save us what a powerful agent is emotion it is well said that men may die of imagination if it forcibly impresses the mind so the foolish old man begins to tremble he begins to shake he sees in front of him the waves and the turbulent sea he sees noahs flood come again he sees the corpse of alison tossed up and down he weeps and wails he sobs and sighs he blubs and bawls then he calms down and goes out of doors to buy the three big tubs that nicholas demanded he has them secretly delivered and suspended from the rafters of the ceiling then with his own hands he builds three ladders by which they can climb up to safety he is a carpenter after all then he stores provisions in the tubs namely bread and cheese and jugs of good ale just enough to last them for the one day before he made his preparations however he made sure that jill and robin were far away he sent them off to london on some excuse or other then on the monday evening a few hours before the time nicholas predicted the flood he snuffed out the candlelight and shut the door in perfect silence the three of them climbed the ladders and settled down in the tubs each one apart from the other they were silent for a few minutes until nicholas whispered we should say the lords prayer and then keep quiet mum said john mum said alison so the carpenter muttered his devotions and then stayed as still as any stone he was listening for the onset of the rain but he was so weary with all the work and worry of the day that at dusk he fell sound asleep he was groaning and snoring it was not a very comfortable berth but the sound was delightful to nicholas and alison both of them softly crept down their ladders and in silence and haste they went off to bed there were other noises now coming from the carpenters bedroom there were squeals and sighs of pleasure there were pantings and groanings nicholas and alison kept at it all night in fact they fucked until daylight when the bells for lauds began to ring and the friars gathered in the choir the pair could hear them singing now do you remember absolon the lovestruck parish clerk on that monday he was paying a visit to osney abbey in the company of some other young clerics in festive mood quite by chance he came across the resident chorister there and started to ask him about the old carpenter he was always interested in that household they were walking out of the church when the chorister said to him i really dont know what has happened to him i havent seen him here since last saturday i imagine he has gone for timber somewhere the abbot probably sent him he often spends a day or two on one of the outlying farms bargaining for the wood or else he is back at home to tell you the truth i dont really know why do you ask no reason just curious absolon was delighted now is the time he said to himself when i must stay awake all night i dont think hes at home at all i did not see him stirring this morning and the door was closed just before dawn i will creep up to the house and knock softly upon the low window of his bedroom beside the orchard wall then i will whisper sweet love nothings to darling alison the least i will be offered is a kiss my lips have been itching all day which is a good sign and last night i dreamed that i was at a feast what can that mean but satisfaction i will have a nap now and then get myself ready for the game of the night so when the first cock crowed up sprung absolon he dressed himself in lovers guise all pert and polished and he combed his hair he sucked on some liquorice and cardamon seeds to sweeten his breath cardamon is known as the grain of paradise and paradise is what absolon wanted then he popped under his tongue a fourleaved sprig of herbparis signifying the knot of true love so that he might attract alison by secret influence then he made his way to the house of the carpenter and stood beneath the bedroom window it was so low that it barely reached his chest he leaned forward and gave a little cough alison he whispered my darling my little honeycomb my lovely bird my sweet stick of cinnamon wake up my sweetheart and speak to me you never think of my unhappiness do you i sweat for love of you i really do i faint i repine and as i say i sweat look at me i am as famished as a lamb looking for its mothers tits if youll pardon the expression i am lovelorn like the turtle i eat less than a girl kiss me quick fuck off that was alisons reply go away you fool kiss you quick you must be joking god help me you wont get anything from me i love someone else in any case who is far more of a man than you are go away now or i will throw something at you let me get some sleep i need it so go to hell absolon was in a miserable state was ever true love so thoroughly abused he asked her could i be more miserable have pity on me alison in my distress give me a little kiss thats the least you can do for the love of jesus the man of sorrows if not for love of me and if i do she said will you go away yes i will then get ready i must just do something first she went over to the bed keep quiet she whispered to nicholas and you will have a good laugh meanwhile absolon had got down on his knees in front of the window i have scored he said i dont think she will stop at a kiss oh my sweetheart be kind to me give me more then alison opened the window in all haste hurry up she told him come on i dont want the neighbours to see you so absolon wiped his mouth in preparation it was very dark it was still night after all here i am said alison then she put her naked arse out of the window absolon could see nothing at all of course and so he put out his tongue and gave her a french kiss he was eagerly slurping her bum but then he knew that something was wrong he had never known a woman with a beard before but he knew this much he had licked on something rough and hairy fuck me he said this isnt right alison laughed out loud and shut the window absolon shook his head and began to walk away but then he heard nicholas laughing too he scowled in anger and muttered to himself ill get my own back wait and see then he began to rub his lips and mouth with dust and straw and cloth and chips of wood anything to get rid of the taste he kept on repeating to himself what a mess i would give anything to be revenged on those two i would give my soul to the devil i really would if only i had turned away if only i had not kissed that that thing his lust of course was now completely quenched from this time forward from the time he kissed the arse of alison he never looked at another woman he was cured of lovesickness women what were they to him so weeping like a child that has just been whipped he crossed the street and made his way towards the shop of a blacksmith called gervase gervase forged the equipment for ploughs that sort of thing and just at that moment was working on a ploughshare for one of the local farmers so absolon knocked on the door and called out open the door gervase hurry up what whos there its me absolon what in gods name are you doing here so early whats the matter oh i know some young madame has got you all excited you rise early you know what i mean absolon was not bothered by these sly insinuations he had no time for joking he had other matters on his mind i can see that hot blade in the corner of the chimney he said to gervase its for a ploughshare isnt it can i borrow it from you for a few minutes i wont need it for long of course you can i would do anything for an old friend like you you could borrow it if it were made of gold or worth a sack of sovereigns but what on earth do you need it for that depends ill tell you all about it later then he picked up the blade its handle was cool by now and left the smithy he made his way quickly to the carpenters house and stood outside the window once more he coughed softly just like before and knocked whos there alison called out are you a thief or what no dear alison he said it is me again your darling absolon ive brought with me a gold ring my mother gave it to me many years ago it is of the purest gold and engraved with a true love knot i would like to give it you in exchange for another kiss nicholas was out of bed and just about to take a piss he thought that he could make the joke even funnier if he changed places with alison and stuck his own arse out of the window so he quickly went over to the window and thrust out his buttocks as far as he could absolon called out speak to me my little bird i cant see you sweetheart and at that nicholas let out a fart as loud as a peal of thunder what a noise what a smell you can guess what absolon did next he steadied the hot blade and thrust it right up nicholass arse oh dear he took the skin off that fundament and all around the edges nicholas was in such pain that he thought he might die and screamed out in agony like a madman help water for gods sake water now his cries awoke the carpenter and when he heard the exclamation water he started up oh christ he said here comes the flood so he took up the axe beside him and cut the rope that held his tub to the beams of the ceiling then as the children say all fall down in a moment the tub plummeted to the floor i could put it another way he had no time to sell the bread and ale on board he was on the floorboards passed out he was dead to the world when they realized what had happened alison and nicholas went out into the street calling havoc and harrow to wake their neighbours and then the good people ran out of their houses to take a look at the carpenter spread out on the floor he had broken his arm in the fall and was generally in a sad condition slowly he recovered from his faint he tried to stand up but it did him no good before he could say a word nicholas and alison assured the crowd that he had gone mad they said that he had become so obsessed with noah and the flood that he had gone out especially to buy three tubs when these vessels were hanging from the roof he had urged them to join him up there for the sake of company then all the neighbours began to laugh at him he was not only mad he was a fool they looked up at the two tubs still dangling from the roof and laughed even harder it was a joke the carpenter tried to explain what had happened but no one was in the mood to listen to him the testimony of nicholas and alison was so convincing that the whole town now treated him as little more than a lunatic everyone agreed about that so there we are that is how the young scholar got to fuck the young wife despite all the carpenters precautions how absolon kissed her arse how nicholas had a sore bum and that pilgrims is the end of my story god save us all then the miller fell off his horse heere endeth the millere his tale the reeves prologue the prologe of the reves tale when everyone had finished laughing at the lewd tale of absolon and nicholas they all interpreted it in different ways there is more than one way to peel an apple but the main response was laughter no one took offence at it apart from the reeve oswald he was a carpenter himself you see and he suffered just the tiniest bit of resentment so he grumbled and complained under his breath if i wanted to compete with you in dirty stories he eventually said to the miller i could tell you one about your profession i could get my own back but i dont want to do that i am old i dont want to soil my mouth with any filth about a cuckolded miller my grass time is done now i eat only winter hay my white hairs tell my age i know and my heart is frail too it has gone to mould like the fruit of the medlar that is ripe only when it is rotten it is laid in rubbish or in straw and there it sits until it falls apart like an open arse that is what old men do we are rotten before we are ripe of course we will still cut a caper while there is a piper playing we are always tickled by desire it is our fate like the leek to have a white head and a green tail our strength may have gone but the longing is still there when we cannot do it we talk about it in the white ashes there still smoulders the fire stirred by four burning embers they are in order boasting lying rage and envy these are the live coals of old age our limbs may not be supple and our members may not rise to the occasion but the need will surely never go away it has been many years since i came weeping into the world but i still have all the yearnings of a young man the tap of my life began to run far back further than i remember and the years have flowed on death turned the tap of course i am flowing towards him the vessel of my life is almost empty there are only a few drops left well i could carry on about the folly and the wickedness of times long gone i still have a tongue in my head but there is nothing left for old age but dotage harry bailey our host had been listening to all this and now he spoke out peremptorily to the reeve do you really want to give us a sermon he asked him are you a priest i dont think so the devil that turns a reeve into a preacher might just as well turn a cobbler into a sailor or a dairyman into a doctor can you please just tell your story we are already at deptford and it is half past seven in the morning we will soon be at greenwich that school for scoundrels i know i used to live there so the time has come old reeve fire away oswald the reeve took the rebuke in good spirit now fellow pilgrims he said please do not take anything amiss i may decide to continue in the way the miller has begun as they say a nail can drive out a nail this drunk has already told us how a carpenter was tricked he happens to know that i am also a carpenter what do you think by your leave then i will repay him in his own coin i will tell you a dirty story about a miller he mocks the mote in my eye when he cannot see the beam in his well sir i hope you break your neck the reeves tale heere bigynneth the reves tale at trumpington not far from cambridge there is a charming brook above that brook there is a bridge beside that brook there lies a mill all that i am about to tell you by the way is true so help me god a miller had been living and working here for many years he was as proud and as colourful as a peacock he strutted about his little kingdom he fished in the brook he played the bagpipes he could mend his nets and turn the lathe he could wrestle and use a bow on his belt there hung a cutlass with a blade as sharp as a razor he also kept a small dagger in his pocket i can assure you that no one dared to cross him there was also a sheffield knife thrust down his trousers he had a fat face and a nose like a bulldogs he was completely bald too the more he swaggered the more people were afraid of him he swore an oath that he would repay any injury sevenfold but this is the truth he was a thief he gave short weight of corn and meal he was sly and he never missed the chance to steal what was his name he was known as proud simkin his wife came from a noble family and her father was the parson of the town she was born on the wrong side of the blanket in other words but that made no difference her father gave simkin a collection of brass dishes for her dowry he desperately wanted the miller for a soninlaw on his part the miller was delighted that she had been brought up by nuns he wanted his wife to be a virgin and an educated virgin at that it would help him preserve his honour as a free man she was as proud as he was and as pert as a little magpie you should have seen them walking around town together on holy days he always walked ahead of her with his hood wrapped round his head she followed wearing a mantle of red cloth simkin dressed his legs in the same colour no one called her anything but dame otherwise there would have been hell to pay if a young man had tried to flirt with her or even just wink at her simkin would have killed him on the spot with cutlass dagger or knife no doubt about it jealous husbands are always dangerous or so at least their wives are encouraged to believe and although she was a little damaged being a bastard she stank of pride like water in a ditch she looked down on everyone she was arrogant and selfimportant what with her illustrious family and convent education nothing was too good for her or so she thought the miller and his wife had two children the first was a girl no more than twenty years of age and the second was a boy about six months old he was a bonny baby bouncing in his cradle the daughter was growing up well too she had a pugnose like her father but she was slender and well proportioned her eyes were grey as doves wings she had broad buttocks nice hair and her tits were like ripe melons she was riding high if you know what i mean now her grandfather the parson was very pleased with her he had decided that she should be the heir to all his property in the town his house and everything else so of course he was always talking about her marriage he wanted her to marry someone of noble and ancient blood the wealth of the holy church should be devoted to those who were descended from the holy church the blood of the holy church should be honoured even if the holy church was destroyed in the process that was his belief now the miller had a monopoly of trade in the neighbourhood he was the one who took in all the corn all the wheat and all the malt one of his clients was trinity college cambridge who sent him their supplies to be ground one day it so happened that the manciple of the college who looked after its affairs fell seriously ill it seemed likely that he would die and seeing his opportunity the miller stole as much corn and meal as he could he took a hundred times more than he had before once he had been a cautious and careful thief now with the manciple out of the way he was blatant the master of the college was not well pleased he reprimanded the miller and scolded him for dubious practice but the miller just blustered and swore that he had done nothing wrong he got away with it as usual there were two poor scholars who dwelled in the college named john and alan they were both from a town called newcastle somewhere in the north of england i have no idea where in any case they were highspirited and playful to say the least and for the sake of diversion they asked the master if they might go up to trumpington for a short while and watch the miller at work they were convinced that he was shortchanging the college and they assured the master that they would not allow him to steal any more corn by trickery or by threat they staked their necks on it after much thought the master gave them permission to journey to the mill so alan got everything ready and loaded the sack of corn on to his horse then both of them prepared themselves for the journey with sword and buckler these country roads are not always safe but they needed no guide john knew the way when they arrived at the mill john unloaded the sack while alan chatted to the miller canny to see you simkin he said how are your wife and your bonny daughter alan how are you and you too john what are you both doing here well simkin need knows no law a lad who has no servant must serve himself otherwise he has a pranny for a master you know that our manciple is on the way out i have heard even his teeth hurt its that bad so me and alan have come here to grind our corn and take it back to college will ye give us a hand of course i will better than that ill do it for you but what do you want to do while it is grinding well i think ill stand awa there by the hopper when the corn flows in i have never watched that happen i wouldnt mind seein it and ill stand awa there alan said and watch the meal gannin doon into the trough thatll keep me happy you and i are just the same john we kna nowt about mills or millers the miller was smiling at their stupidity they are trying to trick me he said to himself they think that nobody can fool them well well ill pull the wool over their eyes just the same their logic or philosophy whatever it is they study is not worth a bean the more tricks they pull the more i will return instead of flour ill give them bran as the wolf said to the mare the greatest scholars are not the wisest men that was a shrewd wolf and so will i be so when he saw his opportunity he left the mill very quietly and went down into the yard he looked about him and finally found the clerks horse tied to a tree behind the mill the miller goes up to it unties it and takes off its bridle when the horse was loose it started sniffing the air and then with a weehee galloped off towards the fen where the wild mares roam well pleased the miller returned to john and alan he said nothing about the horse of course but laughed and joked with them as he got on with the job at last the corn was finely ground and the meal put in a sack all above board then john went out into the yard he looked around for the horse and then oh fuck the horse is gone alan for fucks sake get oot here weve lost the masters horse alan forgot all about the meal and corn forgot all about watching the miller and rushed out of the mill which way did it gan he cried out to john how am i supposed to kna then out ran the millers wife in a state of great excitement that horse of yours she said has gone off to find the mares in the fen somebody didnt tie him up properly somebody should have known better lets put our swords doon john said and gan after it im strong enough to tek hold of it it cant get away from both of us why didnt you put him in the barn you clown so the two of them sped off towards the fen as soon as they had gone the miller took half a bushel of flour from their sack and told his wife to bake a loaf of bread with it they wont be back for a while he said a miller can still outwit a scholar well let them go let the children play he started laughing theyll have a hard time finding that horse so the two scholars ran up and down the fen trying to catch hold of their horse they called out stay stay and here boy here and they called out to each other wait go back a bit and whistle to him gan on however hard they tried the animal always managed to elude them he was fast it was not until nightfall in fact that they managed to catch him in a ditch the horse was exhausted and so were they they were weary and wet from the rain i divnt believe it john said everyonell be laughin at us now our cornll be gone were both ringin wet weve both been made to look like cocks the masterll rip the shit out of us so will the scholars and as it happens so will the miller you just wait and see so they walked back to the mill leading their horse along the way the miller was sitting by the fire it was pitch black outside now and they could travel no further so they asked him to provide them with food and lodging for the night they offered to pay of course if there be any room in my poor dwelling the miller said then you shall have it my house is small but you scholars know how to argue and dispute you can prove anything with your rhetoric see if you can prove that twenty square feet of space equals a square mile well simkin john replied thats a fair comment i divnt kna how to answer you theres a sayin up north that a man has only two options he can tek things as he finds them or bring things of his own but to be honest with you simkin were knackered and hungry we need food and drink bring us some bread and meat or anythin and were happy to pay for them look ive got silver here i kna that the hawk will not fly to an empty hand so the miller sent his daughter into town to buy bread and beer he roasted them a goose too and he made sure that the horse was tethered so that it would not escape again then he made up a bed for them in his own chamber complete with clean sheets and blankets it was only ten feet away from his own bed but where else could john and alan lie there was no other room available but this is the interesting point the bed of his daughter was also in the same chamber so the miller and his guests ate and drank and talked and drank until about midnight then they went up to their beds the miller himself was by this time very drunk his bald head was as red as a beetroot and then at the next moment he had gone pale as if he were about to vomit he was sweating and belching his voice croaking as if he had a bad cold or a fit of asthma his wife had got into bed with him she was also very far gone but she was jolly and giggling their baby was in a cradle at the end of their bed so that he could be easily rocked or given the teat when they had drained the last drop of drink it was time for sleep the young daughter got beneath the sheets so did alan and john what do you think happened next the miller and his wife needed no sleeping draught thats for sure he had drunk so much ale that he was gurgling and belching in his sleep like a horse he kept on farting too his wife kept up the same peal of farts the treble to his bass and both of them snored god did they snore they could have taken the roof off alan could not sleep with all the noise and poked john in the back john he said are you kippin i was have you ever heard a noise like it worse than a frickin earthquake i suppose this is called the song of the night curse them with all diseases whoever heard such a disgustin din yet ill pay them back for their snores and their mingin farts i may not get any kip tonight but i will get someik else i tell you what john i am goin to fuck their daughter i even have a case in law you know have you read the edict that states if in one point a man is aggrieved in another point he may be relieved i am sure that we have been screwed out of our corn leavin aside the other bollocks we have been offered no compensation so i will take my own from the millers goods ill distrain the girl think about it john replied this millers a dangerous man if he should wake up when youre doin it he will not hold back hell attack both of us i dont give a flyin fart there are enough farts flyin around in any case so up he got quietly and slowly and crept towards the young girl lying in her bed she was fast asleep and he got so close to her that she had no time to cry out she hardly had time to open her eyes but she did not say oh no oh no they were at it in a moment you have a good time alan while i turn back to john he was lying there listening to them after five minutes or so he got tired of their moaning and squealing this is miserable he said to himself what am i doin here all on me tod when he has got his cock up he took a risk and now he gets the reward i am just lyin here like a spare sack of shit when he tells the story at college ill look a real knob so here i go i am goin to follow his example fortune favours the brave so he rose quietly and went up to the babys cradle he lifted it very carefully and put it at the end of his own bed then he waited after a couple of minutes the millers wife stopped snoring and got up to take a piss when she returned to the bedroom she groped her way around and just before she got back into bed she realized that there was no cradle at its foot god she said to herself that would have been a joke i almost went into the students bed anything could have happened so she felt around until she found the cradle then she got hold of the bed and thought that it must be the right one the cradle was there wasnt it it was dark of course and she was still a little fuddled so she gets into bed next to the clerk and lays herself down to sleep but john was not about to let that happen he got himself ready wriggled on top of her and then shafted her he went for it hard and deep he was like a madman she had not enjoyed herself so much for years the two northern boys had the time of their lives too until they heard the crow of the cock dawn would not be far behind alan was to say the least of it fatigued he had fucked all night so he whispered to the millers daughter goodbye sweet chuck the sun is risin i cant stay any longer but ill tell you this much wherever i go whatever i do i swear to god that you will be me lass well lover she replied i wish you well but before you go i must tell you one thing when you go past the mill look in the righthand corner behind the door there youll find a halfbushel loaf mum and i baked it together with the meal dad stole from you i swear to god too that i am sorry she almost broke down in tears alan got up and then thought to himself ill get back into bed with john for a quick kip so he crept about in the dark until he found the cradle i must still be arseholed or my head is spinning with all that shaggin he said to himself ive got the wrong bed this one has the cradle i dont want to lie down with the miller and his wife it must be the other one so he crept up to the other bed where the miller was still sleeping on his own he thought that he was getting in beside john but of course he was getting close to the miller it got worse he threw his arm around the millers neck and whispered to him john john you fuckface wake up youll never believe it i fucked the millers daughter three times tonight god she loved it she was beggin for more beggin for it what a game i suppose you were just lyin here with your hand on your cock the miller was by now fully awake you cunt he shouted at him what have you been up to bastard ill kill you how dare you touch my daughter shes of noble blood then he took hold of alan by the neck and tried to throttle the life out of him he kicked him hard and punched him on the nose alan hit him back and the blood ran down the millers chest then they fell out of the bed and struggled with one another on the floor like two ferrets in a sack they rose and fell together fists flying until the miller stumbled he tripped on something and fell backwards right on top of his wife she was fast asleep next to john so exhausted by all the lovemaking that even the noise of the brawl had not woken her now the weight of the miller did oh my god she screamed lord help me what is going on wake up simkin im going to have a heart attack the two boys are fighting ones on my belly and the others on my head for gods sake do something john got up so fast greased lightning is slow by comparison it was still dark and so he groped around the chamber looking for a stick the wife was looking for one too and she knew where to find it there was a staff lying in the corner the moonlight was coming through a hole in the wall and in the light she could see the two men once again struggling on the floor but she could not tell who was who she saw something white gleaming in the moonlight and guessed that it was a nightcap worn by one of the clerks so she picked up the staff and thinking that she was about to strike alan or john she landed a hefty blow on the bald head of her husband he collapsed on the floor of course screaming and crying the two scholars gave him a few more kicks then they dressed themselves quickly picked up their sack of flour and rode off on the horse but not before alan had opened the door of the mill found the loaf of bread in the corner and taken it away so that is the story the miller was beaten up he lost all the corn he had ground he had even provided the scholars supper oh and his wife had been fucked so had his daughter that is what happens to deceitful millers they never learn their lesson do you know the old saying evil to him that evil doeth a fraudster is often defrauded may god who sits above us in majesty bless all of us pilgrims great and small and as for you sir miller i have paid you in kind heere is ended the reves tale the cooks prologue the prologe of the cokes tale the cook of london was so pleased with the reeves tale that he sat on his horse with a silly smile on his face just as if his back was being scratched his name was roger of ware well he said as god is my judge that was a very intriguing little story the miller certainly got paid back for giving the scholars lodging he should have known the saying of solomon dont bring every man into your house that especially applies at night you have to be careful about your invitations the bosoms of the family if i can put it that way have to be protected i swear to god i never heard of a miller so well requited he had a taste of malice in the dark but god forbid that we should stop there i am a poor man but if you will condescend to listen to me i will tell you a story it is an adventure set in london of course our host said tell us the story roger you had better make sure that it is a good one i know you i know your tricks you take the gravy out of the meat pasties so that they will last longer you sell your fish pies warmed over from the day before and from the day before that i have heard many customers complaining about your parsley sauce you stuff it in the goose to disguise the taste and your cookshop is full of flies god may send a man good meat but the devil may send an evil cook to destroy it is that not so roger no seriously tell your story im only joking of course but sometimes the truth just slips out oh does it said roger i suppose you are right harry bailey as always but as the dutch say a true joke is a bad joke now that i think about it i do know a very funny story about a southwark innkeeper dont worry i wont tell it now i will save it for later before the end of our journey i will give you all a good laugh then he laughed himself and with a cheerful expression he told the pilgrims this story the cooks tale heere bigynneth the cookes tale there was a london apprentice bound to the victuallers trade i am in the same guild thats how i heard about him he was as merry as a goldfinch in a hedge he was very good looking with a dark complexion and short dark curls he was a little short but that did not matter he was to put it in a phrase well groomed he could dance so nimbly that he was known as peter the performer he was as full of love and lust as the hive is full of sweet honey any girl who met him was sure to have a good time he would sing and dance at every wedding party and he preferred the tavern to his shop if there was any procession going down cheapside he would leap from behind the counter and stay in the street until he had seen everything he would jump up and down and cheer as if his life depended on it his fellow apprentices used to join him and become very boisterous you know how apprentices are anything for a laugh a song and dance are better than work they also used to make appointments to meet in a certain secret place and play at dice peter was easily the best diceplayer in the city and in these outoftheway dives he spent his money very freely it was not exactly his money however as his employer discovered the cash box was often mysteriously empty a master will suffer for the sins of a wayward apprentice he may have no part in the love games or the revelry or the gambling yet he will pay for them in the end that is sure peter might play well on the guitar and the fiddle but as far as i am concerned a debauched apprentice is nothing better than a thief in a man of low degree honesty and high living can never come together in any event the apprentice stayed with his master until he had finished his seven years indenture his employer scolded him and shouted at him there were even times when peter was led off in shame to newgate prison with the minstrels parading before him but nothing seemed to do any good at the end of the seven years when peter asked for his certificate of release his employer remembered the old saying it is better to get rid of a rotten apple before it infects the rest of the barrel it is exactly the same with a dissolute servant better to dismiss him before he corrupts the others so the master gave peter his release wished him bad luck and sent him on his way peter went off in high spirits ready to begin a life of freedom and debauchery wherever he could find it there is no thief without an accomplice someone who can help him waste and spend any money there is to be found by good or evil means in fact peter had already sent his bed and his belongings to a companion in sin now this companion had a wife she pretended to own a shop but in fact she was a prostitute oh exclaimed the prioress please no more thats enough harry bailey said i dont mind dirty stories but i draw the line at whores whatever are you thinking of man there are nuns among us roger was a little abashed i didnt mean to offend well you have offended sit on your saddle and stay silent someone else will have to tell a story heere endeth the cookes tale the man of laws prologue the wordes of the hoost to the compaignye our host saw that the sun had risen high into the sky and reckoned that it was already midmorning although he was not deeply learned in matters of astronomy he knew from the shadows of the trees equal in length to the trees themselves that mighty phoebus the great globe of fire the nurse of life the sovereign of the heavens had reached fortyfive degrees in altitude it was the th of april it was ten oclock so he turned his horse about and addressed the pilgrims lords and ladies he said i must tell you that a quarter of the suns day has already passed look how he has climbed the steep heavenly hill so for the love of god lets try to lose no more time time does not stay and wait for us when we sleep or daydream it runs on like the motion of a stream never turning and never slowing forever running from the mountain to the plain that is why true philosophers lament the loss of time more than the loss of gold seneca put it this way belongings can be restored but time cannot be retrieved it cannot be recovered it would be easier to turn a pregnant girl into a virgin so let us not moulder now in idleness then he turned to the man of law who was riding just behind him can i ask you sir if you would be so kind as to tell a story to us you agreed by your free consent to furnish a tale and to adhere to my judgement and choice so will you now fulfil your promise then you will have done your duty my good host the sergeant replied i agree of course i have no intention of breaking my pledge to you and the others a promise is an obligation and i always fulfil my obligations i am one who lays down the law to others so to law i will be bound but in truth i must say this to you all i really do not know a tale that geoffrey chaucer has not already told i admit that he knows very little about poetry and is hopeless at rhyming but he has recounted all the stories in such english as he could muster he may not be very good but i dont think there is one old fable he has not written down if he hasnt put it in one book he has put it in another he has narrated the adventures of more lovers than are mentioned in ovids epistles do you know that ancient volume in his youth chaucer wrote about ceyx and alcion ceyx was lost at sea and alcion threw herself into the waves in grief since he has written about so many starcrossed lovers so many noble women and their paramours why repeat him now if anyone should open that hefty volume of his the legend of good women he will come across lucretia who was raped and thisbe who died for love he loves sad stories you can read in that book of poor dido who fell upon her sword after the treachery of aeneas and of phyllis who hanged herself from the branches of a tree you can follow the laments of dianire and hermyon of adriana and isiphilee it is as i said a very long book you can read about the barren island in the middle of the sea and how leander drowned himself for love of hero what else is there i could mention the tears of lovely helen and the woes of false cressida i could relate the cruelty of wicked queen medea who hanged her own children for revenge when jason abandoned her it is not all doom and gloom though geoffrey chaucer does manage to praise the faithfulness of penelope and alceste there is one story that he does not tell he refuses to mention the wicked love of canacee for her own brother well incest is no fit matter that is why he does not write about tyro appollonius and king antioch that cursed monarch took the virginity of his own daughter can you believe it it is too horrible to talk about especially that moment when he threw her down on the floor and began to excuse me chaucer thought about including these stories but then decided against them i know that john gower narrates them but gower is not known for his good taste chaucer would never sully his writings with such abominations how do i know i just know i will follow his example in any case and say no more about them how shall i begin my own story i will not repeat chaucer i have said that already i dont want to be compared to those braggarts who thought that they could rival the muses and were turned into magpies for their insolence i will become no bird and i dont really care if i fall far short of him better a dull dish than no dish at all let him stick to his poetry i will use plain prose so the man of law with a solemn countenance began the story that you are about to hear the prologe of the mannes tale of lawe oh oh oh oh oh hate and harm the conditions of poverty the thirst the cold the hunger and the hurt if you are a poor man then you are hard pressed on all sides if you do not ask for your meat you die of hunger if you do ask for it you die of shame your need is known to all you must beg or borrow or steal and all against your will but how else will you stay alive will you blame christ himself lamenting bitterly that he has falsely distributed the riches of the world will you accuse your neighbour of sinfulness he has everything while you have nothing there will come a time you say when he will burn in hell he has turned the poor man from his door listen to a lesson from the wise it is better to die than to be poor it is better to leave this life than to be despised by your neighbour if you are poor then all respect for you is gone here is another saying from the wise all the days of poor men are sorrowful beware if you are poor your own brother hates you if you are poor your friends all leave you how different for you rich merchants who are swimming in coin what nobility what prudence you have cast the winning dice and now scoop up the pool who dances most gaily at christmas time you do you search the land and sail the sea to find your fortune you predict the rise and fall of kingdoms you know the secrets of kings concerning peace and war i said a minute ago that i knew no stories but now i remember one told me by guess who a rich merchant this is it the man of laws tale heere begynneth the man of lawe his tale part one once upon a time there dwelled a company of wealthy merchants in syria they were serious and responsible people they traded in spices all over the world as well as in satin and in cloth of gold their merchandise was so excellent and luxurious that every broker and dealer wanted to do business with them there were as many sellers as there were buyers now it so happened that some of these merchants decided to visit rome i do not know whether they were going for business or for pleasure but they decided that they wanted to travel to that city in person they did not want to deal with agents so they journeyed there and took up residence in that quarter of the city where they felt most comfortable they stayed in rome for some time visiting all the sites and enjoying all the pleasures of the city so it happened that they got to hear of the emperors daughter lady constance every day they heard more about her the common report was that the daughter of the emperor god save him was the most beautiful woman that ever was or ever will be in the world her honour was spotless if only one man told them she could be queen of all europe she has beauty without pride she possesses the blessings and none of the vices of youth she is not impetuous or foolish she follows the promptings of virtue in everything she does modesty is her guide she is a paragon of courtesy and gentleness holiness is in her heart bounty to the poor is in her hand all of this was true but let me return to the story the merchants declared that they would not return home until they had seen constance for themselves once they had seen her they were in truth content they loaded their ships with merchandise and travelled back to syria where they conducted their business as before they prospered there is nothing more to say now it so happened that these men were much favoured by the sultan of syria he was very courteous and gracious to them whenever they came back from any foreign country for example he invited them into his presence and questioned them about all the wonders they had seen or heard of he loved to hear news of strange lands so the merchants told him among other things about lady constance they told him of her beauty and her virtue they praised her gentleness and her nobility they extolled her so much in fact that the sultan began to imagine her in his arms he wanted to love her and to cherish her for the rest of his life in the book of the heavens the great dark sky above us the stars will have written that his love was to end in his death there can be no doubt about it in the patterns of the stars can be seen as if in a glass the death of every man yet who can interpret them properly in ancient times the stars had foretold the death of hector and of achilles of caesar and of pompey their fates were decided before they were born in the heavens could be seen the siege of thebes the stars prefigured the death of socrates the adventures of hercules and the misfortunes of sampson yet the wit of man is dull he cannot see what is above him the sultan consulted his privy council and to cut this story short he told them of his intention to possess constance by any means he could if he could not have her he said then he was as good as dead so he charged them with the task of discovering a way his wish might be granted how could he get hold of her diverse courtiers said diverse things they argued between themselves and canvassed many opinions they had plenty of ideas of course some advised the use of magic while others suggested even more deceitful methods and yet finally they concluded that the only way to win her was to marry her it was the best and simplest solution but then they realized the difficulties to be quite plain about it there was such a difference between the laws of east and west that it would be very difficult to find any accommodation no christian ruler they said to the sultan would dream of marrying his daughter to one who professed the sweet teaching of mahomet blessed be the prophet the sultan gave a firm reply rather than lose constance then i will be baptized as a christian she must be mine there is nothing else to be said no please there can be no argument about this either i have her or i will die so go on your way without delay travel to rome bring back the woman who has plunged me into such distress what else need i say there were negotiations and embassies between the two realms the pope was obliged to mediate between them too the princes of the church and the princes of the roman court were all involved the romans themselves were agreed that this was a good opportunity for augmenting the christian communion it represented a triumph against idolatry so these were the terms of the treaty the sultan and all his kin as well as the members of his court and government would be baptized as christians after that ceremony was performed the sultan was free to marry constance a great sum of gold was also to be paid to rome in surety of his good intentions the pact was duly signed by both parties oh constance god help you some people would now expect me to describe the feasts and celebrations arranged by the emperor for his daughter but i do not have space to enumerate all the details of the festivities i can only say that they were magnificent it was after all a noble occasion it was agreed that constance would be accompanied on her journey by many bishops travelling with her would also be lords and ladies of renown there were others with her too but i cannot remember them all then it was proclaimed throughout rome that the citizens should pray for her and invoke the blessing of jesus christ upon the marriage so the day came for her departure that woeful day that fatal day could not be avoided everyone came out on to the streets constance herself was overcome with sorrow she arose that morning pale and trembling and dressed herself for the journey she knew that there was no other course who can wonder at her tears she was being sent to a strange land far away from the friends she had loved she was being placed under the dominion of a man about whom she knew nothing husbands of course are always good and considerate just ask their wives i say no more father constance said take leave of your wretched daughter and you mother who has brought me up so tenderly i have loved you both you have been most precious to me more precious than anything except the saviour on high i commend myself to your prayers now that i am about to depart for syria i will never see you again it is your will that i travel to a barbarian nation so be it may christ who died for our sins give me the strength to obey his commands i am only a weak female it is no matter if i die women are born to servitude and punishment it is ordained that they should be ruled by men there was never such weeping heard when troy fell in flames or when thebes was taken or when rome was wounded by hannibal the tears and laments echoed through her chambers but she had no choice she was obliged to go oh first mover outer sphere of heaven inflexible and cruel you are the power that moves all things from east to west that makes the stars revolve in their unnatural course it was you who put mars in the ascendant at the beginning of this dangerous voyage it was you who cast a blight upon the marriage inauspicious ascent bleak and tortuous in effect unhappy mars must fall out of his place into the darkest house of all the house of saturn oh feeble moon of unfortunate fate you move into a place where you are not welcomed you are banished from your blessed haven such are the movements of the spheres and as for you imprudent emperor of rome constance s father was there no wise man in the city is one time no better than another in rome surely you had an astrologer in your court who could have determined the proper moment for such a voyage was there no one who could cast constance s horoscope or are all the romans stupid or slowwitted so the woeful maid is conducted to the ship with every formality and every ceremony jesus christ be with you all she cried out from the deck and the crowd shouted out farewell farewell constance they had no more to say she tried to maintain her composure but it was difficult now i must leave her on the high seas and return once more to syria the mother of the sultan a woman who was a pit of vice knew all about her sons intentions the sultaness had heard that he was about to abandon his old religion so she sent for her own privy council they gathered in the palace according to her instructions and when they were all assembled together she told them her plan lords she said you all know well enough that my son is about to turn away from the laws of the koran vouchsafed to mahomet by god himself and to do great dishonour to our holy religion but i make my vow before you all that i would rather die than disobey the least one of our religious laws what will happen to us if we accept this new dispensation we will be the slaves of rome but that is not the worst of it if we renounce mahomet we will be consigned to everlasting torment no it cannot be but my lords i have a plan will you follow me in the enterprise i am about to reveal assuredly it will save us all they assented and swore an oath that they would all live or die by her side they would persuade all of their friends and colleagues too to support and protect her so assured of their fealty she began to describe to them the scheme that she had contrived first of all she said we will pretend to embrace the false religion a little baptismal water will not affect us i will then throw such a feast and festival that the sultan will be paid back in kind this heathen girl may be as white as the day she was baptized but by the time i have finished with her she will need more than holy water to wash away the blood a christian font will not be enough oh sultaness root of iniquity you are a harpie unnatural and accursed you are a reptile with a womans face as wicked as the serpent who lies coiled in hell you are false and fraudulent confounding good and evil with your malice you are a nest of vices dreadful satan you have been watchful and malicious ever since you fell from heaven you know how to entrap women it was you who tempted eve the source of all our woe now you wish to destroy this christian marriage and what will be the instrument of your guile alas it will be another woman i will get on with the story so the evil sultaness having dismissed her council with an oath of secrecy rode out to visit her son she informed him that she was willing to renounce her faith and receive baptism at the hands of the christian priests she was sorry she said that she had remained a heathen for such a long time then she asked permission to organize a great feast for the visiting christians i will do everything in my power she said to make them welcome it shall be done as you wish he replied then he kneeled down before her and thanked her for her thoughtfulness he was overcome she kissed her son and went on her way part two so after a long journey by sea and land the christian legation eventually arrived in syria they were an impressive gathering of dignitaries as soon as the sultan heard of their approach he sent a message to his mother telling her that his new wife had come and urging her to welcome constance nobly for the honour of the realm he also announced the news to the rest of the country the throng was great and the show very splendid when the syrians and the christians finally greeted each other the sultaness could not have been more charming or more gracious in her greeting to them all she was especially nice to constance whom she received as tenderly as any mother would receive her favourite child so they proceeded slowly towards the city riding side by side in perfect amity i know nothing about the triumphal processions of julius caesar except for the description in lucans pharsalia but i do not suppose that they were any more rich or more spectacular than the procession of constance into damascus yet this was the time when the scorpion of syria the wicked demon of the royal family was preparing herself the sultaness for all her smiles and gracious words was getting ready to use her deadly sting the sultan himself then rode out to greet his bride with great fanfare and display he welcomed her with joy and wonder at her beauty so for the time being i will leave them to their happiness i will come soon enough to the heart of the matter the rest of the day was spent in revelry and sport until the company agreed that it was time to rest then the moment arrived for the banquet that the sultaness had organized all of the christians young and old alike were invited to attend all the guests would be able to enjoy royal luxury and to feast upon the most rare and delicate foods in the world and yet alas they soon paid too high a price for them woe is always the consequence of bliss sorrow follows prosperity and suffering succeeds joy that is the way of the world follow this advice for the sake of your wellbeing if you ever experience happiness keep in mind the day when it will end nothing abides i will be brief while they were at this feast all the guests syrian and christian were stabbed or cut to pieces all of them were killed with the exception of constance herself and who do you think had murdered them the sultaness of course together with her henchmen the old hag wanted to rule the country alone she had even murdered her own son all of the converts to christianity who had changed their faith on the instructions of the sultan were killed before they could escape constance herself was immediately dragged to the port where she was put on a boat without sail or rudder they told her that it was her chance to learn how to sail and bid her to go back to italy she had managed to take some of her possessions with her the syrians had also given her food and drink as well as a change of clothing so off she floated on to the salt sea oh dear constance dearest of the dear young daughter of the emperor may christ the saviour be your pilot so constance blessed herself and holding the crucifix before her she wept and prayed oh sacred altar holy cross red with the blood of the holy lamb spilled in pity for this world of sin keep me safe from the claws of the devil safeguard my soul when i drown in the deep tree of victory holy rood cross of truth preserve me oh tree that bore the sweet weight of our wounded saviour guard me oh white lamb pierced by the spear who drives away the evil spirits cast your grace around me help me to amend my life and do penance for my sins her fortune carried her across the eastern mediterranean and into the strait of gibraltar she ate only meagre meals as she drifted onward the days became months and the months became years there were many occasions when she prepared herself for death she did not know if the wild waves would take her to a shore or harbour why was she not killed at the feast in damascus who could have saved her i will answer that question with another who saved daniel in the lions den how did daniel survive when every other man had been killed and eaten by the creature god saved him god was in his heart in the same way god has shown his wonderful providence in the life of constance in her survival we see the miracle of his power christ is the cure for every ill the scholars know that he works by mysterious means and that his intentions cannot be understood by us our wit is too weak who saved constance from drowning in the sea who saved jonah in the belly of the whale we know well enough that he was spewed out at nineveh unharmed who saved the israelites from the waves of the red sea when they passed through the raging waters on a path of dry land god saved them who commanded the four angels of the tempest they were given the power to direct the winds of the world from north and south from east and west but god said to them trouble not the smallest leaf that trembles trouble neither the land nor the sea the lord protected constance from the tempest too and the mantle of his care covered her by night and by day how can it be that constance had meat and drink enough for three long years of voyaging who saved the holy hermit saint mary of egypt when she dwelled in the wilderness it was no one else but christ the saviour it was a great miracle when the crowd of five thousand were fed by five loaves and two fishes a greater miracle still is gods love he sent his succour to constance at her time of need so she floated across the wide world until she came to our own ocean and our own fierce northern seas she was washed ashore on the coast of northumberland beneath the walls of a castle when her ship was run aground it stuck so fast in the sands that the rise and fall of the tide could not move it it was christs wish that she should stay here the governor of the castle came down to the shore to view the wreckage he searched the ship and of course found the poor weary woman he also found the treasure constance had brought with her then in her own tongue she beseeched him for deliverance take my life from me she begged him release me from the misery i am suffering she spoke a corrupt form of latin but it was good enough for the governor to understand her when he saw that there was nothing else to find on the vessel he conducted her on to dry land she kneeled down and kissed the ground thanking god for his mercy to her but she would not tell anyone who she was or where she had come from nothing good or ill would make her speak she said that she was so bewildered by the wild waves that she had in truth lost her memory the governor of the castle and his wife hermengyld took pity on her they wept at her condition constance herself was so gracious and courteous she was so willing to please all the people about her that she became universally loved the governor and his wife were both pagans in this dark age of our country but hermengyld still loved her constance stayed so long in the castle praying and weeping that through the grace of christ hermengyld was converted to the true faith in this period the christians of britain could not assemble in public places most of them had fled menaced by pagan invasions from the north by land and sea they had gone to wales which had become a haven for the old britons and old christianity that was their refuge for the time being i am talking about the sixth century of our era some britons had remained however and practised their religion in secret they venerated christ far from the gaze of their pagan rulers there were in fact three such christians living near the castle one of these was blind he could see only by the light of his mind now that his eyes were closed for ever it so happened that on one bright summer morning the governor and his wife together with constance decided to ride out to the shore where they could refresh themselves with the bracing sea air it was only a short journey in the course of it however they met the blind man he was old and bent leaning heavily upon his staff but then he straightened up when they passed him and turned his face towards the governors wife in the name of christ he shouted out dame hermengyld give me back my sight now hermengyld was astonished by this outburst she was terrified too that her husband would kill her for renouncing the pagan faith constance however was calm and resolute she urged hermengyld as a true daughter of the church to work the will of christ the governor was inwardly troubled and amazed he asked the two women what does this mean what is going on it is the power of christ constance replied he is the saviour who rescues us from satan thereupon she explained to him the doctrines of the true faith with such sweetness and grace that before evening the governor was converted he was not himself the ruler of this territory but he kept it by force of arms in the name of aella king of northumberland he was a wise king who had proved himself stern in battle against the scots you probably know all about this so let me return to the story the archenemy satan always ready to deceive us had observed the goodness of constance he could not endure it he determined to harm her in any way he could so he cast his net upon a young knight who lived in the neighbourhood of the castle and filled his heart with foul lust for constance if he could not lie with her and have her he was willing to die he wooed her earnestly but without success she would not commit sin there was no more to say so out of revenge and humiliation he decided to ensure that she suffered a shameful death he waited until the governor was absent from the castle and then secretly found his way to the chamber of dame hermengyld here constance also slept both women had spent much of the night in prayer and were very weary the young knight under the influence of the demon crept up to the bed and cut the throat of hermengyld he placed the bloody knife beside constance and then left the castle may god curse him shortly afterwards the governor in company with the king aella returned to the castle what greeted him there but the sight of his wife with her throat cut you can imagine his horror and grief he also found the bloody knife lying in constance s bed what could she say she was nearly out of her mind with the horror of it the king soon knew all about it he questioned the governor about constance and learned her whole unhappy story when and where she had been found on the ship how she had conducted herself and so on he was touched by pity for her plight she seemed too gracious a lady to be overwhelmed by distress and misfortune so the innocent woman stood before the king like a lamb bound for the slaughter the young knight came forward and swore falsely that she had committed the murder yet there was clamour and dissent among the people who said that they could not believe constance was guilty of so heinous a crime they said that they had seen her virtues every day and that she had loved hermengyld like a sister all of them bore witness to this except of course the young knight who was actually guilty king aella himself was deeply impressed with the bearing of constance and decided that he would enquire deeper into the matter in order to learn the truth alas constance you have no champion you have no one to fight your corner so may jesus christ himself come forward to protect you it was he who bound satan so that the fiend still lies in the darkness where he first fell it was he who saved humankind may he now save you if he does not work a miracle on your behalf you will be slain as certainly as the coming of tomorrow in front of them all constance fell down on her knees and began to pray immortal god who saved susannah from her false accusers protect me holy virgin lady of mercy before whose blessed child the archangels sing orisons look kindly on me if i am innocent of this crime then come to my aid otherwise i will die have you not sometimes seen a pale face among a crowd of those being led to their deaths have you not seen the dread and loneliness upon that face have you not seen the overwhelming misery so looked constance as she stood among the press all you queens who live in prosperity all you duchesses and other ladies have some pity on the plight of dame constance she is the daughter of an emperor but she must stand alone she has no one to advise her or console her her royal blood is in danger of being spilled yet she has no friends to protect her king aella was so full of pity and compassion for her that the tears ran down his cheeks he was a pagan but he had a gentle heart now someone fetch a holy book he said and we will see if the knight will swear an oath upon it that constance murdered hermengyld only then will i mete out justice so a british book of gospels was brought forward the knight placed his hand upon it and in a confident tone swore that constance was guilty of the crime but then all of a sudden a giant hand struck him on the neck so strongly that he fell forward on the floor the blow had been so overwhelming that in sight of all those around his eyes burst out of their sockets then a voice could be heard by all foul knight you have slandered an innocent woman in the sight of god almighty you have defamed a daughter of the holy church you have shamed her and shall i hold my peace the crowd of people was of course amazed and terrified by the apparition those who had harboured suspicions of constance were deeply repentant and there was one other consequence of this miracle through the intercession of the innocent young woman aella and many of his courtiers were converted to the true faith the king made sure that the false knight was executed immediately even as constance lamented his death out of pity for him by the guidance of our saviour too aella took her to be his bride in solemn ceremony so at last this holy maid this jewel of virtue became a queen christ be praised there was one who did not join in the general chorus of adulation this was the mother of the king named donegild whose heart was full of malice and treachery she thought her cursed heart would break in two she considered it dishonourable for her son to take a foreign wife i will now remove the chaff and the straw from this story and leave you with the shining corn why should i describe to you all the pageants and festivities that surrounded the marriage why should i sing to you the songs and melodies of the players enough is enough they ate and they drank they danced and they sang there is nothing to add that night they were escorted to their royal bed as was right and proper even the holiest virgin must do her duty in the darkness i hope that constance did hers patiently there are certain necessary things to be done between man and wife saintliness must be put to one side on a solemn occasion such as this on that very night aella begat a son but soon he had other hot work to do he had to fight the scottish enemy massing on the border and so he left constance in the care of a bishop and of the governor while he took his army to the north constance was so far gone with child that she kept to her chamber as meek and as mild as ever she lay very still placing herself and her baby in the hands of christ in due time she gave birth to her son who was baptized with the name of maurice the governor of the castle called for a messenger and delivered to him a letter that he had written to aella in which he gave the king the good news of the birth as well as other timely matters of state so the messenger took the letter bowed and went on his way this messenger thought that he would do himself a favour by visiting the kings mother so he visited her quarters and paid her homage ma dame he said i have some wonderful news you will be so happy my lady constance has given birth to a male child there is no doubt about it the whole realm will be delighted look here is the letter written by the governor i have to take it to the king at once but if you have any other message for your son confide it to me i will be your good servant donegild needed time to think i have no message for you as yet she said but stay here overnight i will write a letter in the morning so the messenger settled down and drank some ale followed by wine followed by ale again while he was sleeping off the drink the governors letter was quietly taken from his bag and a substitute placed there this was a counterfeit letter apparently from the governor very subtly written it revealed horrors the letter stated that constance had been delivered of a fiend an unnatural monster bred out of the devil no one in the castle could endure the sight or sound or smell of it it was agreed by all that its mother was a witch sent to the castle by means of spells and sorcery no one would go near her the kings grief on reading this letter was overwhelming but he said nothing he kept his sorrow secret and wrote to the governor of the castle let the providence of christ be my guide i am now converted to his cause and must abide his will oh lord i will obey your commands in everything do with me as you wish then he added to the governor keep this child safe whether it be foul or fair and safeguard my wife too until i return christ will grant me another child fair and wholesome when he deems it right weeping he sealed and dispatched this letter to the messenger there was nothing else to be done yet how false a messenger you are a drunken sot your breath is foul and your limbs are weak you falter on your legs you betray every secret entrusted to you you have lost your mind you chatter like a parrot your face is distorted and awry wherever there is a drunk there is also a loud mouth you can be sure of it oh donegild evil queen mother i have no words to describe the malice of your wickedness i give you over to your companion the foul fiend let him record your treachery i defy you unnatural creature no you are yourself a fiend wherever your body wanders your spirit dwells in hell so the messenger left the presence of the king and returned to the court of donegild she was delighted to see him again and offered him all the hospitality she could possibly provide he drank himself close to bursting then he passed out and spent the night snorting and farting like a swine in its sty in the meantime of course donegild had stolen the letter from the king and forged one in its place the king she wrote commands the governor on pain of death to make sure that constance is banished from the realm of northumberland she may remain only for three days after that time she must be gone place her in the same ship in which she arrived here she must take her infant son and all her possessions then push the ship out to sea and forbid her ever to return oh constance well may your spirit tremble well may your dreams be sorrowful donegild intends to strike at you when the rising sun had roused the messenger he took the shortest route to the castle he presented the letter to the governor of that place who on reading its contents burst into lamentation lord christ he said what is this world it is a place of evil and of sin almighty god why is it your wish and will that the innocent should suffer you are the judge of righteousness why do you allow the wicked to prosper oh constance i must now be your executioner or die a shameful death there is no alternative the old and the young of the castle wept at the news of constance s banishment they could not believe that the king had sent such a cursed letter yet constance remained calm she accepted the will of christ she went down to the ship looking deathly pale and kneeled upon the shore almighty lord she prayed i accept your command he who saved me from false blame when i lived in this land will now protect me from harm he will comfort me on the wild ocean i do not know his means but he is as strong now as he has always been in him i trust blessed be the lord god and the virgin mother they are my rudder and my sail her little child lay wailing in her arms she cradled him and soothed him peace my son she whispered to him i will never harm you she took off the scarf she had been wearing and placed it over his eyes and hair then she rocked the child in her arms praying softly all the while mother mary bright queen of heaven it is true that humankind fell through the sin of eve through the fault of the first woman your blessed son was nailed to the cross your own eyes witnessed his torment your woe was greater than the weight of all the world there is no comparison between your suffering and my affliction you saw your son tortured and slain before your eyes my little son is yet in life now blessed lady to whom all pray in this vale of tears glory of womanhood and fairest maid you are a haven of refuge and the bright star of day in your gentleness you take pity on all those in distress take pity on my infant son oh little child you are innocent without sin or guilt why does your cruel father wish to kill you then she turned to the governor of the castle have mercy on him she said let my little son dwell with you here he shook his head but if you dare not save him for fear of punishment then kiss him once in his fathers name she turned around and for the last time looked back at the land farewell she called and farewell cruel husband then she rose up and walked along the shore towards the ship she was caressing the child as she went and comforting him then at last she took her leave she blessed herself and with the child in her arms stepped aboard the ship the ship was well stocked with provisions and other necessary things for the long voyage ahead of her god be thanked and dear god grant her the winds and tides to steer her safely home she must now make her way across the wild ocean part three aella returned to the castle soon after her sad departure he wanted to see of course his wife and newborn son where were they the governor felt the cold creep into his heart he told the king exactly what had occurred in his absence he showed him the forged letter with the royal seal upon it i did no more and no less than you asked sir you commanded me on pain of death what else was i to do the messenger was summoned and put to the torture he revealed every detail of his journey where he had ridden where he had supped where he had spent the night it all became plain it did not take much enquiry or investigation to discover the guilty party in this wicked affair i do not know how they discovered that the queen mother had herself written those poisonous letters but her fate was sealed soon after all the chroniclers agree that aella killed his own mother blaming her for bringing dishonour and shame to his family so ended the career of donegild a woman steeped in evil no one can adequately impart the grief that aella suffered over the fate of his young wife and newborn son i will leave it to one side and return instead to the plight of constance floating on the sea by the will of christ she spent five long years upon the waves in pain and in woe before finally she caught sight of land she came close to on a beach beneath a pagan castle i do not have the name of it by me where the sea delivered constance and maurice on to dry ground almighty god i beseech you preserve the fair maid and her child once more she has fallen into the hands of heathens who might wish to kill her who can tell there came down from the castle a procession of people eager to take a look at constance and the foreign ship but then at nightfall a steward of the castle came down secretly to the ship and told her that he would lie with her whether she liked it or not god damn him for a rapist and a rogue constance of course set up a great lamentation in which her child joined but then the holy virgin placed her mantle around her in the course of his struggles with constance the steward fell overboard and was instantly drowned he had merited his punishment so christ kept constance undefiled see the result of foul sensuality it does not only darken the mind and mar the judgement it can kill the end of blind lust the end of the dread deed itself is misery how many men have found that even the intention of committing that sin is enough to destroy them whether they accomplish it or not how did this weak woman have the strength to defend herself against the wretch how was it that the giant goliath was slain by the young and untested david how dared he even look upon that monsters dreadful face his strength was derived from the grace of christ who gave judith the courage and endurance to murder holofernes in his tent and to lift the chosen people out of their misery i say that it was all gods work and that same god instilled might and vigour within constance herself so the ship sailed on through the narrow strait that separates gibraltar from the tip of africa the wind came from the east and from the west from the north and from the south driving the vessel in all directions and in none constance was weary unto death when one day the virgin mary blessed among women brought an end to all her woe with an act of goodness let us leave her for a moment however and turn to her father the emperor of rome had learned from diplomatic correspondence out of syria that all of the christians had been slain at the banquet in damascus of course he had also discovered that the wicked mother of the sultan had dishonoured his daughter and cast her adrift so he decided to take revenge he sent his principal senator with royal authority to syria he sent all of his lords and knights too with express orders to deliver condign vengeance for a long time the roman forces burned and pillaged and killed whatever and whomever they found in the capital when they had meted out the punishment they set sail again for rome it so happened that the roman senator while making his progress across the sea came upon the little ship in which constance was marooned he did not know who she was or how she came to be there and for her part constance would not speak she would rather die than reveal her condition he brought her back with him to rome and gave her into the keeping of his wife and young son constance spent the next part of her life in the senators family so did the blessed virgin rescue her from all her woe as she has saved many others constance conducted herself in a devout and gentle way doing good works wherever she could the wife of the senator was in fact her aunt but neither one recognized the other i can say no more about it that was what happened i will leave constance with the family and now i will return to the king of northumberland aella who still bitterly mourned and lamented his wifes absence the fact that he had killed his own mother now began to weigh on his conscience he fell into such a mood of repentance in fact that he decided to travel to rome in order to do penance he would put himself under the authority of the pope in all matters and beseech christ to forgive him his sins his ambassadors travelled ahead of him announcing his arrival it soon became known throughout the holy city that this high king was coming on a pilgrimage so the senators of rome rode out to greet him according to custom and to do reverence to his majesty they also wanted to put on a good show one of these senators was of course the protector of constance he welcomed aella and paid him homage and the king duly returned his courtesies a day or two later the king invited him and his retinue to a banquet who do you think was among the guests none other than maurice the son of constance some people would say of course that constance herself persuaded the senator to take her son i do not know the circumstances all i know is that maurice attended the feast and i know this too constance had told her son to stand before the king during the meal and look him steadfastly in the face aella was struck with wonder on seeing the boy he turned to the senator and asked him the identity of the handsome child standing before the table i have no idea the senator replied god be my witness he has a mother but as far as i know he has no father and then he told the king the story of how mother and child were found god knows he said i have never seen a more virtuous woman in all my life i have never heard of a woman maid or married who is her equal she would rather be stabbed in the heart than perform a wicked deed no man on earth could persuade her otherwise this young boy was the image of his mother there could not be a closer resemblance so aella was reminded of constance herself and wondered if it could possibly be that she his dear wife was indeed the mother of the child he was troubled by this naturally and left the banquet as quickly as he could what phantom or vision is in my head he asked himself when i know well enough that my wife lies at the bottom of the sea but then he put to himself another question but is it not possible that christ the saviour has brought constance to this place just as he once sent her to the coast of my own kingdom on that same afternoon he decided to visit the home of the senator and see for himself had there been another miracle the senator greeted the king with reverence and then summoned constance when she was told that she was about to meet aella she almost fainted she could hardly stand let alone dance for joy as soon as aella caught sight of his wife he greeted her and began to weep piteously he knew it was her his wife stood before him constance herself was dumb with amazement and was as rooted to the ground as a tree she remembered all his unkindness or so she thought and she suffered double distress at the sight of him she swooned and then recovered herself then she swooned again the king himself wept and did his best to excuse himself i swear by god and all the saints in heaven he said that i am as guiltless of any crimes against you as your own son our own son who so much resembles you let the devil take me if i am lying so they wept together they lamented the past they lamented the evil done to them those around them were filled with pity as their woes seemed to increase with their tears will you excuse me from saying any more about their sorrow it would take me until tomorrow to do full justice to it and i am weary of describing nothing but pain finally when constance understood that aella had no part in her exile the tears gave way to smiles they must have kissed each other a hundred times there was such bliss between them that no couple in the world have ever been or could ever be so happy only the joy of heaven is superior then constance begged of him one favour to recompense for her life of woe she asked him to send an invitation in the most gracious terms to her father the emperor and entreat him to attend a royal banquet but she urged her husband not to say one word about her it has been said that maurice was chosen to deliver the message to the emperor i dont believe it aella would not have been so disrespectful as to send a mere child into the presence of the great ruler who has sovereign authority over all christendom it is better to suppose that the king himself visited the emperors palace nevertheless i have read that maurice was indeed the ambassador according to the story the emperor graciously accepted the invitation while all the time studying maurice intently the child reminded him of his daughter aella in the meantime went back to his residence and prepared everything for the banquet in as magnificent a manner as he could he spared no expense the day came for the feast aella and his dear wife prepared to meet their royal guest and in joy and festivity rode out together when constance saw her father in the street she alighted from her horse and fell to her knees father she said perhaps you have forgotten about your child constance but i am here before you i am the girl you sent to syria i am the one who was dispatched to die alone upon the wide ocean now dear father have mercy upon me do not banish me to any more pagan lands but thank my husband for his kindness to me who could portray the mingled joy and sorrow that now filled the hearts of constance aella and the emperor i cannot in any case i must draw to a close the day is fading fast i wont delay they sat down to dinner that is all i will say i wont begin to describe their happiness which was hundreds and hundreds of times more joyous than i can possibly relate in later years the pope crowned maurice as holy roman emperor in succession to his grandfather maurice was a good and devout churchman and ruled in christian fashion i will not tell you his story i am more concerned with his mother if you want to learn more about him then consult the old roman historians they will enlighten you further i am not so well informed when aella realized that the time had come he left rome and with his beloved wife sailed back to england in our nation they lived in bliss and comfort but their happiness lasted for only a short time the joys of this world do not endure life changes like the tide after the brightness of the day comes the darkness of the night who can be happy even for one day without being moved by anger or by jealousy who has not been touched continually by guilt or ill will or resentment think about your own life i tell you this only to reach my conclusion that the happiness of aella and constance could not last for ever death who collects his tithes from high and low alike could not be thwarted within a year of their return to england aella was taken out of this world constance mourned him bitterly of course may god keep his soul safe then after his burial she decided to go back to rome on her return she found her friends and family safe and in good health now at last she felt that her adventures had come to an end when she came into the presence of her father she kneeled before him and wept constance of tender heart sent up her orisons of praise to god a hundred thousand times and so they lived in virtue and in charity they were never parted except by death itself and so farewell to you all my story has come to an end may jesus christ bring us joy after woe and save us all on the last day god preserve you my fellow pilgrims heere endeth the tale of the man of lawe the epilogue to the man of laws tale harry bailey our host stood up on his stirrups and congratulated the man of law that was a fine story he said very worthwhile dont you all agree and then he turned to the parish priest father he said for the love of god tell us a story you promised i know well enough that learned men can be good storytellers you know enough for gods sake the parson reproved him bless us all why is this man blaspheming in front of us never take the name of god in vain oh john wyclif have you come among us our host replied i smell a lollard in the wind i predict fellow pilgrims that before too long the priest will deliver a long sermon that is what lollards love to do on my fathers soul he will not the shipman rode up to our host he is not going to preach we wont allow it this is not the place to teach the gospel we all believe in god we dont need the doctrines of holy mother church interpreted or evaluated or revised he will be sowing weeds in healthy ground ill tell you what harry i will give you a good story it will ring out loud and clear it wont be full of philosophical terms or learned quibbles i dont have enough latin for that excuse me it was the good wife of bath looking very majestic on her palfrey surely i take precedence over this seaman it is a sad day when a good woman is refused her due come now mr bailey do let me speak i have a lot to say then without waiting for his assent she began her story the wife of baths prologue the prologe of the wives tale of bathe i dont care what anyone says experience of the world is the best thing it may not be the main authority but in relationships it is a good teacher i know all about unhappiness in marriage goodness me oh yes i was twelve years old when i first got a husband ive had five altogether thanks be to god five of them trooping up to the church door that is a lot of men by and large they were gentlemen or so i was led to believe yet i was told quite recently i forget by whom that our saviour attended only one wedding it was in the town of cana so the argument goes i should only ever have been married once and then there was the time when jesus rebuked the samaritan woman they were standing beside a well werent they you have had five husbands he said and the man you are living with is not your husband he was god and man so i suppose he knew what he was talking about i dont understand what his point was but i am sure he had one why was the fifth man not her husband it doesnt make any sense how many husbands had she actually had how many husbands was she allowed in all my life i never heard there was a limit have you there will be ever so many experts telling us one thing and another but i know this much god told us to go forth and multiply am i right i can understand that part of the bible at any rate and wasnt it god who commanded my husband to leave father and mother and belong to me alone but he never mentioned a number it could be two it could be eight who knows theres nothing wrong with it anyway what about that solomon he was a clever man didnt he have more than one wife i wish to god i had his luck if i had half as many husbands as he had wives i would be laughing think of it i could be gods gift to men and what about all those wedding nights i bet that he did youknowwhat as hard as a hammer with a nail i bet he gave them a right pounding well thank god i have had five at least roll on number six i dont care where or when as long as he comes i am not going to sew myself up when my present husband goes the way of all flesh i shall be looking for another you can bet on it what is the name of that apostle who said that was the best thing to do better to marry than to burn thats what he said and he can say it again i dont give a damn what people think the father of noah had two wives didnt he i saw them in the pageant play it made no difference to him and what about abraham what about jacob they were old holies werent they and they had more than two wives plenty of these prophets did show me the passage where god forbids more than one marriage go on show me you cant where is the part of the bible that commands virginity there isnt one the apostle paul says that he had no firm opinion on the matter he may advise a woman to keep her virginity thats fair enough but he cannot order her he leaves it up to her if god himself had wanted us all to be virgins he would not have invented marriage would he if we were never allowed to mate then where would the next generation of virgins come from not even paul dared to touch a subject that his master left alone if theres a prize for virginity im not going to compete for it thats for sure and i bet there wont be many runners not everyone will agree with me of course there are some people who stay virgins because they believe that they are performing gods will paul himself was a virgin wasnt he he may have wished that everyone else would follow his example but he was just stating an opinion he did not forbid me from marrying how could he so it is no sin to marry me once the old man is dead it will not count as bigamy of course it is always dangerous for a man to touch a woman in bed at least it is like putting a flame to dry wood you know what i mean but that is as far as i will go paul said only that he preferred the virgin to the married couple the virgin is stronger i grant you that i have no quarrel with virgins if they want to remain pure in body and soul i will not stop them i cant criticize and in any case i make no great claims for myself but let me put it this way not all the vessels in a house are necessarily made of gold the wooden ones are good for certain purposes a man can put his lips to wood as well as gold although it may not glitter it serves its function god calls men and women to different vocations all of us have different talents some can do this others can do that i can do that i know that virginity is a form of perfection chastity is close to holiness christ himself is perfection but he did not tell people to surrender everything for the sake of the poor he did not order them to give up their worldly goods and follow his footsteps that was reserved for perfectionists as i said but my lords i am not one of those i have a few years left in me yet and i am going to devote them to the arts of married life i will couple and thrive and tell me this why does god give us those parts between our legs cunts are not made for nothing are they they are not unnecessary some will say that they have been created so that we can urinate others will say that they are just the marks to distinguish female from male you know that isnt true all experience tells us otherwise i hope that none of you priests and nuns will be angry with me but i must say this we have been given our private parts for pleasure as well as necessity we must procreate as well as pee within the limits set by god why else is there the ruling that a wife must freely render her body to her husband how is he going to receive it without using his youknowwhat ill say it once again our parts are there for two purposes for purging piss and for propagation now i am not claiming that every man and woman is bound to propagate that would be absurd that would be to deny the virtue of chastity christ was a virgin and he had a male body did he not many saints have been virginal too i expect that they had private parts i will say nothing against them they are loaves of the purest white bread and we wives are buns of coarse barley and yet mark tells us that christ himself fed the multitude with barley bread i am not fussy i will fulfil the role that god gave me i will use my hole my instrument my cunt with as good a grace as he bequeathed it to me if i am grudging about it god will never forgive me my husband can have it morning and night whenever it pleases him he can pay his debt any time i want him to be my debtor and my slave i will be troubling his flesh as they put it while i am married to him i am given power over his body for the rest of my life is that not so that is what paul says paul also orders husbands to love their wives i quite agree the pardoner suddenly rose from his saddle and interrupted her now dame he said by god and the cross you have been a noble orator in your cause i was just about to get married myself but hearing you i am having second thoughts why should i put my flesh to so much trouble as you put it i dont think i will be wed at all just wait a minute she said i havent begun my story yet you may not find it a wholesome draught it will not be as sweet as ale but drink it down i will tell you a story about unhappiness in marriage i am old enough to be experienced in the subject well i was the one who held the whip i know all about it do you still want to sip out of my barrel i have given you fair warning i will give you ten different examples of marital disaster there may be more than ten i am not sure there is an old saying forewarned is forearmed i think those are the exact words of ptolemy look it up its in one of his books dame the pardoner said to her do begin we are on tenterhooks until we hear you tell us the story and spare no man in the process teach all the young men here your techniques gladly she replied if that is what you want but yet i beg all of you to remember this dont get upset about anything i say dont take offence i mean no harm i just want to entertain you all so now i will begin i shall tell you the truth so help me god may i never taste wine or ale again if i deceive you i have had as i said five husbands three of them were good and two of them were bad the three good ones were rich and they were old they were so old that they could hardly fulfil their duties they could hardly rise to the occasion you know what i mean god help me i cant help laughing when i remember how hard they tried god did they sweat i set no store by them in any case once they had given me their land and their fortune i wasnt bothered about the rest i did not have to flatter or beguile them they loved me so much that i took their love for granted that is the truth of it a wise woman will be busy looking for a lover only when she hasnt got one but since i had them in the palm of my hand and got all their money too why should i go to the trouble of pleasing them further i could please myself instead so i set them to work many nights they were exhausted and miserable were they unhappy with me well let me put it like this we would not have won many prizes for domestic bliss yet i got my way i kept them sweet enough they were always bringing me gifts from the local fair and they were always happy when i spoke nicely to them god alone knows that there were many times when i scolded them oh did i nag them now all you wives listen to me carefully always be mistress in your household if you need to accuse your husbands of things they havent done that is the way to behave towards men i tell you this much women are much better at lying and cheating than men i am not telling this to experienced wives they have no need of my advice i am talking to those who are having trouble a wise wife if she knows what she is doing can swear that fire is water if a little bird whispers in her husbands ear about something or other she will call the little bird a liar she will even get her maid to swear to her virtue thats the way to do it so this is the kind of thing i said now you old dotard what have you got to tell me why is our neighbours wife looking so pleased with herself she is respected and flattered wherever she goes and what about me i am obliged to sit at home i dont have any clothes to wear and why are you always next door is that woman so goodlooking or are you just randy why are you always whispering with my maid good god man button up your trousers you old lecher and what if i do have a man friend whats that to you why do you always complain if i just pop into his house for a minute or two then you come home ratarsed stinking of drink and start lecturing me on my behaviour what a load of nonsense you go drivelling on about the curse of marriage if you marry a poor woman you say then it costs a fortune if you marry a rich woman or a woman of high birth you have to put up with her airs and graces if she is goodlooking then you have to put up with her easy virtue oh yes you say any lecher can take her her virtue comes cheap everyone wants her and everyone can have her and all the while you are looking at me how dare you i pause for breath and start again then you start talking about women some men want them for their looks and some for their money some men are only interested in their figures others are pleased if their women can sing or dance or talk well or are sociable some like slender hands and arms some like long legs oh you say no man can keep guard over these castles the enemy is sure to get over the wall and make it inside an ugly woman lusts for any man she sees according to you she will leap on anyone with her tongue hanging out like a spaniel until she finds one who is willing to do it there never was a goose so grey that it did not find its gander any itch can be scratched this is your socalled philosophy this is what you dole out to me when you come to bed you say that no man needs to get married no man who wants to get to heaven should consider it well old man may thunder and lightning strike you down may your ancient withered neck be broken you tell me that there is an old proverb the sight of a leaking roof the smell of smoke and the sound of wives are enough to make a man flee from his home you silly old fool what are you talking about you say women will hide their vices until they are safely married only then will they show them that is an idiots opinion they say that a good englishman takes stock of his oxen and his cattle his horses and his hounds before he buys them he tries out his bowls and his washbasins his stools and his spoons to make sure that they are sound he even checks his chamber pots why does he not take the same precaution with his wife you old dotard you fool how dare you say that we show our vices only when we are married and another thing you say that i am only happy when you are praising my good looks that i expect you to gaze lovingly upon me and call me my most lovely wife in public i expect you to make my birthday a holy day do i and receive expensive presents i never heard such nonsense in my life you are supposed to receive my old nurse and my chambermaid in great state and to entertain my father and all his relatives lies all lies from the mouth of an old goat oh yes then you make a fuss about our apprentice johnny just because he has lovely blond hair it shines like gold it really does and just because he accompanies me on my shopping expeditions you become suspicious johnny means nothing to me if you died tomorrow i would not give him a second look and tell me this why do you hide the keys to your chest it is as much mine as yours do you think you are going to make a fool out of me you are not going to get my body and my goods you must be mad even to consider it you can have one or the other but not both think about it old man what is the point of spying on me and questioning the servants if you had your way i would be locked up in that damned chest as well what you should be saying is this oh dear wife please go wherever you like feel free i wont listen to any rumours about you i know you dame alice to be a true and faithful wife that is what you should say we wives never like husbands who pry or who try to control us we must be at liberty thats the truth of it the best of all you men was that wise astrologer ptolemy he was from egypt wasnt he he wrote down a proverb in one of his books that sums it all up the wisest man he said is the one who minds his own business and does not worry about the conduct of the world you understand what he meant by that i suppose if you have enough or more than enough why should you bother about the pleasures of other people let me tell you this you old goat you will get cunt enough at night only a miser would stop a man lighting a candle with the flame from his lantern do you understand me you will still be able to see in the dark dont worry no one has stolen your flame im sick to death of hearing you say that we women should dress demurely and discreetly just as if we were still virgins you love to quote from the bible dont you what is that text no woman should be apparelled in precious stones or walk abroad with braided hair no woman should dress herself in pearls or gold or fine fabrics what a load of nonsense i cant even be bothered to argue with you about it what is that i am like a cat am i you only have to singe my skin and i will never roam from home is that what you think but if the skin of a cat is sleek and shiny then she will not stay in the house for half an hour she will be on the tiles before daybreak showing herself off and setting up such a caterwaul that every cat in the neighbourhood will know shes on heat do you get my drift if i am in the mood i will stray what good is it spying on me you old fool argus was supposed to have a hundred eyes but even he would not be able to stop me not unless i wanted him to lay his hands on me even so i would still be able to fool him you can count on it you say that there are three types that torment the whole earth they are an upstart servant a wellfed fool and a maid who is heir to her mistress you tell me that the world cannot bear a fourth namely a wife who is a shrew you hateful old man may god send you an early death why should you pick on wives shrewish or not surely there are other candidates for that honour leave off your preaching and then you say that a womans love is nothing but hell on earth a piece of barren land without water you compare it to wild fire it burns out of control the more it consumes in flame the more it wishes to destroy then you change your metaphor you compare the poor wife to a worm eating its way up a tree she gets hold of her husbands vital parts and eventually pulls him down all husbands are supposed to know this are they old dotard goat wait till i get my hands on you and that in a nutshell is the way i talked to my five husbands i really flattened them i swore that they were drunk when they accused me of anything i got dear johnny and my maid to back me up oh lord the amount of trouble i caused them and to tell you the truth they were quite innocent i was like a filly i could bite and whinny i would scold them when i was really in the wrong otherwise i would have got the worst of it that could not be allowed the first one who comes to the mill is the first one to get bread i called foul first so i won the battle they were quite ready to beg forgiveness for sins they had never committed i accused them of having affairs with women when they were so ill that they could hardly stand yet they put up with it they really believed that i complained so much because deep down i loved them oh i used to say i go out at night because i want to check up on all the women you are screwing with that excuse i had quite a lot of fun myself women are born with these skills you see god gave us the gift of weeping and trimming and deceiving i have been doing it all my life and if i am allowed to boast i must say that i managed to get the better of all of my husbands whether it was by trick or force by nagging or complaining i had the mastery they got the worst of it in bed of course thats where i really gave them hell if i felt their hands reaching out for me i threatened to make a quick exit unless that is they paid me some form of ransom once they had paid up i let them do whatever they liked i wasnt particular so i tell you all this you must pay for what you want everything in this world is for sale an empty hand lures no hawk you know that expression i suppose i would satisfy all their lusts once my purse was full sometimes i even pretended to enjoy it in fact i never really enjoyed the taste of tough old meat that was probably the reason i gave them such a hard time the pope himself could have been sitting right beside them at table and i would still have nagged them i gave as good as i got if i were making my last will and testament i would still owe them nothing i paid them word for word so help me god i was so smart and tricky that they gave up the fight it was the best thing they could have done believe me otherwise they would have had no rest one or two of them may have looked at me like tigers but they would never have got me in their jaws this is what i said to one of them oh look sweetheart at willy willy was the name of our sheep look at him look how meek and lovely he is come over to me now dear and let me give you a little kiss on your cheek you should be like willy you should be patient and humble you are always telling me about the patience of job why not follow suit you should practise what you preach is that not so otherwise i will have to teach you a harder lesson that it is a good thing to keep a wife peaceful one of us must give in thats for sure and its not going to be me a man is more reasonable than a woman in any case and must surely be able to bear more hardship why are you always moaning and complaining do you want to reserve my pussy for yourself you can have it take it all go on take it i know how much you love it if i were able to sell it i would be walking around in luxury i can tell you that but no i will keep it for you alone to graze on but by god you do me wrong those were my exact words to him let me tell you about my fourth husband he was an old dog he had a mistress anyway i was still young and full of life i was a bit wanton i admit but i was strong and stubborn with it i was as pert as a magpie if anyone played the harp i was up on my feet dancing when i had drunk a glass of sweet white wine i could sing like a nightingale in spring do you know the story of metellius who beat his wife to death because she liked her liquor he would not have stopped me even if i had been his wife no one can keep me away from it once i have had a few of course i start thinking about youknowwhat love is on my mind just as surely as cold weather makes hail or snow so a greedy mouth makes for a greedy tail a drunken woman is not going to be able to protect her virtue is she every lecher knows that jesus when i think about my youth i cant help but laugh all that fun all that sex the memories cheer me even now i was on top of the world in those days i was hot of course age poisons everything it has taken my beauty it has robbed me of strength well let them go farewell to both of them let the devil take them now that the flour has gone i have got to sell the bran thats the sum of it but im trying to keep up my spirits cant you tell what was i saying about my fourth husband oh yes i was furious when i imagined him in the arms of another woman but i got my own back my god i made a cross for him out of the same wood thats all i can say i did not prostitute myself certainly not but i was so friendly to other men so approachable that i made him fry in his own fat he simmered with anger and jealousy i was his purgatory on earth he suffered so much that his soul must have gone straight to heaven when the shoe pinched he cried out loudly enough but no one except god and my husband knows how bitterly i tormented him he died when i came back from my pilgrimage to jerusalem now he lies buried before the main altar i cant say that his tomb is as sumptuous as that of a king or emperor but it will serve it would have been a waste of money to build anything grand well goodbye old man may god give you rest in your coffin sweet dreams now i will tell you all about my fifth husband i sincerely hope that he will not end in hell although to tell you the truth he was the worst behaved of all of them god he did beat me i can still feel it in my ribs and will do until my dying day ouch yet in bed he was so strong and supple that i have no complaints he knew how to get the best out of me especially when he grabbed hold of my fanny i dont care how often he beat me he knew how to kiss and make up i loved him better than all the others he played hard to get he excited me you know that we women have strange inclinations sometimes we long most for the things we cannot have it is perverse isnt it we will cry out and beg for the one thing forbidden to us deny us something and we will desire it offer it to us and we will run away we spread out our wares and put on a show of indifference you have seen it in the market nobody wants things that are sold too cheaply a throng of buyers always puts up the price every woman knows this if she knows anything so i was talking about my fifth husband jankyn god bless him i took him for his looks and not for his money he had been a student at oxford but then he left university and took lodgings in the house of my old friend and townswoman alison god bless her too we used to gossip all the time so she knew all my little secrets and desires better than our parish priest i would not have told them to him in any case but i told her everything if my husband had pissed against the wall she would have known about it if he had done some dirty deed i would have informed her straight away i also used to whisper in the ear of my niece and another ladyfriend but i swear to you that otherwise i was very discreet there were times when jankyn got very hot and bothered about all this he went red and grew short of breath but as i said to him he only had himself to blame he should not entrust his secrets to me should he it stands to reason so it happened that one day in the season of lent i was on my way to have an intimate chat with alison i did this all the time march april may whatever since there is nothing i like more than hearing all the news of the town you should see me darting from house to house well on this day in the company of dear alison and of her new lodger i decided to walk into the fields my husband was in london for the whole of lent thank god for that i was not constantly looking over my shoulder i had the chance of eyeing up some hunk and i would be pretty visible too how did i know where luck might lead me i did not really care what places we went to as long as there were plenty of people around so i went to vigils and to processions to openair preachings and to festivals and of course i loved going on pilgrimages you meet a better class of person dont you think then i attended miracle plays and marriages i always wore the same lovely red robes there was no chance that the worms or moths would get at them either i put them on every day they were gorgeous now i will tell you what happened next i told you that the three of us were walking in the fields i was having such a delicious conversation with jankyn that before i knew what i was saying i told him that if i were a widowwoman he could have me he could marry me there and then well i did know what i was saying in actual fact i am not boasting but i do have a little bit of foresight left in me i am prudent in marital matters as in much else if a mouse has only one hole then it is asking for trouble if that hole is blocked then goodbye mouse so i led him to believe that i had fallen madly in love with him thats an old trick my mother taught me by the way i told him that i dreamed of him every night i dreamed that he came into my bed and killed me and that the sheets were drenched in blood but i said to him this is a lucky dream it is a good omen blood signifies gold doesnt it of course it was all a lie i never dreamed of him at all i always followed my mothers advice though in more ways than one now where was i oh yes fortunately my fourth husband was soon in his coffin i wept buckets as wives are supposed to do boohoo i kept a sorrowful look upon my face and draped a black kerchief over my head i followed the proper custom in other words but since i already had my eye on my next husband you may believe that i mourned less in private so my late husband was carried to the church with all our neighbours following his bier jankyn was with them too what a great pair of legs he had i had never seen a more handsome face in that churchyard even before i had entered the church i had fallen for him do you blame me he was only twenty years old my age no im lying i was forty by then but i had the desires of a twentyyearold i had the hot blood of a colt venus was in my ascendant what did i have to lose i was fair and rich and well set up and i wasnt that old as my husbands always told me i had the nicest pussy in england i have got mars in my heart but venus everywhere else venus gives me lust and lecherousness but mars grants me boldness i was born under a good sign so i ask you this why was love ever considered to be a sin i have followed all my inclinations by virtue of the constellations i could no more withdraw my love from a handsome young man than i could disobey the stars i will tell you something else i have a red birthmark on my face just where my hood hides it and i have another one in a more private place so god be my judge i have never been discreet i have never been backward i have always followed my appetites i didnt mind if he was short or tall black or white if he liked me i was on i didnt care if he was rich or poor noble or serf as long as i had him what else is there to say at the end of the month jankyn was my new husband we had a grand wedding i gave him all my worldly goods inherited from the previous four husbands that is what marriage is all about but god did i regret doing it he was hard he never let me do what i wanted and he did beat me once i accidentally tore a page out of his book and he went for me he bashed me around the head so much that i became deaf in one ear i still am yet i was stubborn i was a lioness and i had a loose tongue too he told me not to gossip in the neighbourhood but i paid no attention to him i still made my visits to alison and the other dames so then he began to preach at me and cite all the ancient examples there was one old roman called simplicius gallus i think that was his name who left his wife for ever what was her crime one day he saw her standing on the doorstep with her head uncovered then there was another roman who left his wife because she went to a midsummer revel without his permission can you believe it of course he quoted the bible at me too he would recite that passage from ecclesiastes which forbids men from letting their wives roam abroad then he would tell me this in a solemn voice a man cannot build a house with reeds a man cannot ride a blind horse it is even more foolish to have a wife that longs to go on pilgrimages such a man deserves to be hanged what was i supposed to make of that i made nothing of it i ignored him i despised his old sayings and proverbs i was not going to be corrected by him i hate anyone who tells me what my vices are im sure that you all feel the same this really made him mad of course but i was not going to put up with his whining let me tell you what happened about this book i tore a page out of it if you remember and he beat me around the head as i said i am still deaf in one ear he read this book all the time night and day he said that it was written by valerius and theophrastus and that it was an attack upon women he loved it he lapped it up there were other books bound up in the same volume there was some cardinal at rome called saint jerome who had written an attack on someone called jovinian dont ask me what that was all about then there was a work by tertullian one by chrysippus and one by heloise who was an abbess near paris she was the one who ran after abelard i know all about her let me try to remember the other books oh yes there was a copy of solomons proverbs and a book called ars amatoria by ovid there they all were collected together so he spent his time when he wasnt working that is reading and rereading these old books he loved to pore over the stories of wicked wives he knew more stories about them than any scholar he was not so interested in tales of good wives even if they came from the bible i know for a fact in any case that no priest will ever speak well of wives or even of women unless they are saints of course when they dont really count as female who called the lion a savage beast it certainly was not the lion itself by god if women had written the stories instead of the monks in their cloisters they would have made men so wicked that they would have been an accursed sex scholars and lovers are miles apart those under the sway of mercury love study and learning while those in the power of venus love love itself they love to party that is why there is such a difference in temperament when venus rises mercury falls when mercury is in the ascendant venus is desolate so no priest will ever praise a woman when these pious men are old and can no more make love than my old boot then they will sit down and complain that women cannot keep their marriage vows what old dolts let me get back to the point i was about to tell you why jankyn beat me up for meddling with his book one evening the master of the house as he liked to call himself was sitting by the fire and reading he read out to me the story of eve through whose wickedness all humankind was brought into woe only jesus could save us when he purchased our redemption with his holy blood that is clear evidence jankyn told me that a woman was responsible for the fall of mankind it is an old argument then he read to me the tale of how sampson lost his hair it was cut off by his mistress delilah while he slept as a result he was captured and blinded by the philistines then he told me the story of hercules and deianira and how the shirt she wove him consumed him in flames jankyn was thorough he did not forget the trouble that the two wives of socrates caused him and how one of them xantippa had thrown piss into his face the poor innocent man stayed very still as if he were dead and then just wiped his face with a cloth all he said was after the thunder comes the rain as soon as he had finished that story he told me all about pasiphae queen of crete he thought it was an excellent example of mad lechery and bestiality i dont want to think about it it was all too horrible she must have been mad and there was clytemnestra who for the sake of her adulterous lusts murdered her husband he read out her history with great pleasure he lectured me about the reason amphiorax of argos met his death he knew the whole story he was betrayed by his wife eriphily who for a brooch of gold led the greeks to the place where her husband was hiding as a result he died at the siege of thebes he was very indignant with livia wife of sejanus and with lucia wife of lucretius one killed her husband out of love and the other out of hate livia poisoned her man late one night because he had become her enemy lucia on the other hand was so lecherous that she prepared an aphrodisiac for her husband it was meant to ensure that he was besotted with her but it was too powerful he drank it and died before morning whatever way you look at it the husbands come off worse i am so sorry for them that wasnt the end of it oh no jankyn told me about another roman of old times latumyus who complained to a friend of his that in his garden there grew a tree of sorrow apparently three of his wives had hanged themselves from its branches out of spite i imagine this friend arrius clapped him on the back and said listen mate let me have a cutting from that tree it sounds great id love to have one in my garden then jankyn told me all about the wives that had killed their husbands in their beds with the corpse lying on the floor they would have sex in bed with another man other wives have driven nails into the brains of their husbands as they slept while others have administered poison he knew of more evil deeds than even i could imagine and he knew more proverbs too than there are blades of grass or sands on the shore it is better he said to live with a lion or a dragon rather than a nagging woman it is better to live on the roof than share your bed with a shrewish wife these women are so cantankerous and contrary that they hold in contempt what their husbands hold dear that is what jankyn said you can imagine my reply then he told me another saying a woman casts off her shame when she takes off her dress oh and heres another a goodlooking women who has lost her virtue is like a gold ring in a sows nose can you imagine how i felt i was angry i was in pain when i realized that he was going to carry on reading that book all bloody night if necessary i lost it i grabbed the book from his hands and tore three pages out of it then i punched him in the face so hard that he toppled back into the fire he got up like a wild animal and knocked me down with his fist it was a powerful blow and i lay on the floor as if i were dead when he saw how still i was lying he got scared and would have run away men are like that but then quick as a flash i came round oh false thief i whispered have you finally killed me have you murdered me for the sake of my property oh jankyn come to me let me kiss you before i die that did it he came over to me and kneeled down beside me oh sweet alison he said so help me god i shall never strike you again you know yourself what i have done forgive me dearest have pity on me i beseech you then i got up and hit him again now we are quits i said i can die in peace these are my last words they were not of course and eventually we made up with much sighing and crying i had won he gave me the reins and i took control of my house and property i also ruled over his tongue and over his fists what do you think i did with that book i made him burn it when i had taken charge of the household he came up to me and said my own true wife my alison do as you please for the rest of your life just preserve my honour and my standing from that day forward we never had an argument i swear to god that i became the best wife in the world i was loyal to him and he was true to me i hope his soul is now at peace in a better world shall i tell you my story now biholde the wordes bitwene the somonour and the frere the friar laughed when he heard all this now ma dame he said by god that was a long preamble to a tale the summoner was listening what do you think he asked the other pilgrims a friar will always be interfering a friar is like a fly he will alight on any dish and any meat what is all this about preamble or perambulation whatever you call it preamble yourself or trot if you like or gallop ahead you are spoiling our fun is that all you have to say sir summoner the friar replied by god before i leave you all i will tell you a story about a summoner that will keep you in fits of laughter fuck you friar before we get to sittingbourne i will have told two or three tales about your profession that will reduce you to tears i can see that you have already lost your temper harry bailey intervened peace no more squabbling let the woman begin her story you two are behaving like drunks go on now mistress and tell us your tale i am ready mr bailey that is if the worthy friar here will let me continue ma dame the friar replied nothing would give me greater pleasure the wife of baths tale heere bigynneth the tale of the wyf of bathe in the good old days in the time of blessed king arthur this island was filled with spirits it was a magical land the queen of the fairies danced over green mead and meadow with all her elves and pixies in attendance that was what people believed in any case it must have been hundreds of years ago by my reckoning now we live in the modern world we no longer see fairies do you know why they have been chased away by monks and friars who are forever purifying and sanctifying the different parts of the country these clericals seek out woods and streams they spread out over the land as thick as specks of dust in the sunbeam they bless the halls the chambers the kitchens and the bedrooms they bless cities towns boroughs castles and high towers they bless villages barns stables and dairies that is why there are no more fairies the friars now tread upon the elvish paths morning and evening saying their matins and their other holy offices where there were once pixies there are now prayers of course a woman can feel much safer knowing that there wont be an evil spirit beneath a bush or tree she may meet a friar of course but he will take only her chastity not her soul once upon a time there was a knight at the court of king arthur one day this knight was riding by the riverside without any company when all at once he saw a young maid walking ahead of him she was also alone he took advantage of the situation and raped her she tried to fight him off but she did not have the strength this sinful deed caused such an uproar and provoked such criticism at court that the king ordered the knight to be executed he would have been beheaded according to the law were it not for the fact that the queen and the other ladies of the court pleaded for his life they cried mercy mercy so long and so loudly that the king eventually gave in and delegated the decision to his wife she would decide whether the knight lived or died the queen thanked her lord for his graciousness and as soon as she found the opportunity she called the knight to her your fate is in the balance she said to him you cannot be certain of your life the day of your doom may be nearer than you think i will save you if you can tell me one thing what is it that women most desire be careful think before you speak that is the only way you will be able to rescue your neck from the executioners blade if you cannot give me the answer today i will give you permission to leave the court seek out the answer far and wide then return here in a year and a day before you go you must give me your solemn pledge that you will come back and surrender yourself to the court the knight sighed filled with doubt and perplexity how could he answer such a question yet he had no real choice in the matter in the end he decided that he would obey the queens command he would leave the court and return within a year and a day he put his faith in god to find the right course for him and jumped on to his horse he tried every town and village looking for enlightenment what is it he said to one and all that women desire most however hard he tried he could not find a suitable answer no two people agreed on the subject some said that women loved money the most some said that they prized honour and others pleasure some said that women wanted gorgeous clothes but others chose sex as the main dish some said that women loved to be married and widowed often some said that they liked to be married and looked after in luxury the knight was told that a man could win a woman with flattery or that any woman young or old rich or poor could be caught by fuss and attention of course there were others who claimed that us women really wanted our liberty we wanted to do as we pleased and not to be judged i think there is a lot of truth in that who wants to be told that she is acting immodestly ill tell you one thing if women are attacked on a sensitive point then they will hit back try it and you will see even if we are vicious on the inside we need to appear virtuous and wholesome there were other arguments some people told the knight that above all else women wished to seem discreet and trustworthy they wanted to have a reputation for strength of mind and for preserving secrets that is rubbish naturally women can never keep a secret have you heard the story of midas according to ovid and other learned writers midas had two great asss ears concealed beneath his long hair he was terrified lest anyone should find out about his deformity that would be the end so no one knew anything about it except his wife he loved her and he trusted her so he told her to keep quiet about this this unfortunate development could she do that could she hell of course she swore to him that she would lose everything in the world rather than reveal his secret it would be evil she said to besmirch the honour of her dear husband it would shame her too beyond reckoning yet she almost died with the effort of suppressing the truth she was sure that she would burst that the words would make their way out somehow do you know that feeling i do she had promised to tell no one so what was she to do she ran down to some marshland near the house her heart pounding and put her mouth close to the reeds and the water just like a heron now she said to the water dont betray me dont repeat this i am going to tell you something that i will never tell anyone else my husband has the ears of an ass god i feel so much better now that ive said it i am so relieved that i have let go of the secret it just proves that we women cannot keep a confidence for very long the words will pour out if you want to learn the rest of the story you will have to look it up in ovid when the knight realized that he was never going to find an answer to the question what do women love most he felt ill at ease and unhappy but the day for his return had come he had to go home and attend the queens court on his way back full of care he happened to ride through a forest there by the side of the track he saw a most amazing spectacle there were twentyfour or more young maidens dancing in a ring among the trees he was drawn to them in the hope that he might acquire some secret wisdom from this circle of young women yet as he came up to them they vanished into thin air the dance had gone he looked around in bewilderment it was then that he saw an old crone sitting on the upturned trunk of a dead tree he had never come across an uglier woman sir knight she said this is not the way for you tell me what you want here what are you looking for it may be that i can help you old women are sometimes wise women dear mother the knight replied i will die unless i find the answer to one question what is it that women desire most if you could tell me the solution i will forever be in your debt give me your word then take my hand and swear if i provide you with the answer then you must do whatever i require of you anything within your power if you agree then i will tell you the secret before nightfall i plight to you my oath as a knight he said then i am sure that your life is safe trust me i have no doubt at all that the queen will agree with me about this the proudest of all the great ladies with all their jewels and fine headgear will not dare to contradict me then she whispered some words into his ear come now she added more loudly be happy be confident lets travel on to the court without delay when they arrived at the palace the knight attended the queen as he had promised her he announced that he had an answer to the burning question you can imagine the excitement among all the women the wives the paramours the maids the widows all came to the court the queen was there too ready to give judgement before the assembly everyone was waiting to hear what he would say the queen called for silence and then ordered the knight to come forward tell us now gentle knight she asked him what is your answer what do women desire most the knight did not hang his head like a beast in its stall he stepped forward and before them all responded to her in a ringing voice my liege my lady women desire to have sovereignty over their husbands and over their lovers they wish to dominate them kill me if you wish but that is the truth i stand here before you do with me as you will there was a general murmur of approval not a wife or widow or virgin disagreed with what he said they all concurred that he had won his life as soon as this was clear the old crone came forward justice she called justice sovereign queen before the court disperses listen to my plea i was the one who taught this answer to the knight i made him swear an oath that in return he would grant me any wish that lay within his power i vow to you that i am telling the truth now that i have saved his life the time has come she turned to face him now sir knight i ask that you marry me without delay i wish to be your wife he looked at her in horror oh my god is that it how can i i admit that i did swear an oath to you but for gods sake ask for something else take all my money anything but dont take my body no way i will not betray myself or you i may be foul and old and poor but i dont want your money i would not part with you for all the gold in the world i only want your love my love no my ruin my despair i am to be degraded and disgraced he complained in vain it was determined that he must marry this old woman he was also obliged to go to bed with her i wish that i could tell you all about the happy festivities and the joyful ceremonies that accompanied the union but i cant there were none there were no speeches of congratulation no toasts no wedding cake there were instead expressions of sorrow and pity he married her secretly the next morning and then hid himself from the light of day like an owl he could not look at her ugly and dirty as she was when eventually he got into bed with his new wife he was disgusted and ashamed he turned and twisted beneath the sheets while she just lay there with a smile on her face oh husband dear she said bless me is this the way that knights treat their new brides is this the household law of king arthur is everyone of your rank so shy i am the love of your life your own wife i am the woman who saved you i have never done you any harm i know that much so why are you behaving like this on our first night together you are writhing like a madman what is my crime tell me for gods sake if i can amend it i will do so amend it i dont think so there is nothing you can do about it you are old you are ugly you come from such low stock that it is little wonder that i twist and turn my lineage is besmirched i wish to god that my heart would break is that the only reason for your distress only what do you think well sir i think i can cure it i think i may do you a service in a day or two if necessary if you showed me a little bit more consideration i might help you out but please dont go on about your high rank you get your lineage from old money that is all it isnt worth a damn it is sheer conceit you should be more concerned with human virtue you should give more consideration to those who perform good works in private and in public they are the real gentlemen our saviour tells us that true nobility comes from his example not from the money bags of our rich ancestors although they may give us all of their worldly goods from which we claim good breeding they cannot bequeath to us the gift of holy living an honest man is made by honest deeds that is the only lesson your forefathers can impart to you i suppose you know the high words of the florentine poet dante who taught us this sentence a man cannot climb heavenward on his own slender branches god wills us to claim from him our strength and purpose the only things we can inherit from our ancestors are material goods that in fact may harm or injure us everyone knows this as well as i do if virtue were of natural growth in certain families proceeding down the line from parent to child then they could do nothing but good it would be impossible for them to be caught in villainy or vice take a piece of fire carry it into the darkest house between here and the caucasian mountains shut the doors upon it and depart the fire will keep on burning pure and unsullied just as if twenty thousand people were observing it it will perform its natural function until it expires i stake my life upon it so now you may understand what i have been telling you gentility cannot be borrowed or purchased fire is always and forever fire men are of more mixed natures susceptible to change god knows it happens often enough that the son of a nobleman behaves shamefully there are some who make great play of their ancestry and of their virtuous grandfathers and greatgrandfathers but who themselves are only notable as villains they are not like their ancestors at all a man may call himself a lord or an earl but in reality he is a sot and a churl nobility is the renown won by others who came before you it does not belong to you by right of birth god alone can grant you virtue god alone is the source and spring of grace valerius maximus was a roman author have you heard of him he praises the nobility of tullius hostilius who rose from poverty to become the third king of rome that hostilius was a real gentleman seneca and boethius both teach us that gentle natures are seen in gentle deeds and therefore dear husband i conclude as follows even if my ancestors were humble i hope by the grace of god and by my own efforts to lead a virtuous life when i choose virtue and eschew sin then i will be a gentlewoman and do you blame me for my poverty did not the saviour the incarnate god choose a poor life on earth every man woman and child will surely know that jesus king of heaven would not have made a bad or sinful choice seneca and other philosophers tell us that cheerful and willing poverty is a great blessing whoever is satisfied with a slender purse even though he does not have a shirt on his back i hold rich indeed he who is greedy is wretched he longs for that which he cannot have he that has nothing and wants nothing is a man of wealth you may call him a knave but i call him a spiritual knight poverty sings you may know that quotation from juvenal to the effect that the poor man whistles and dances before thieves poverty may seem hateful but it is in truth a blessing it encourages hard work it teaches the wise man patience it teaches the patient man wisdom it may seem miserable it may be a state no one wishes but it brings us closer to god it brings us selfknowledge poverty is the eyeglass through which we see our true friends so therefore dear husband cease your complaining i have done you no harm do not rebuke me for my poverty but then you tell me that i am old i dont know whether it is taught in any learned books but i always believed that gentlemen were meant to reverence old age you call an old man father do you not i am sure that i could find many authors who say so why then do you call me foul and ancient at least you will not be a cuckold age and ugliness are the best guardians of chastity in existence nevertheless i know that you have a good appetite i will satisfy it as best i can so choose now one of two things you can have me old and ugly until i die in which case i will be your humble and faithful wife obedient in everything or you can have me young and beautiful in which case you can expect many visitors in the house the crowd may flock to another warm place too but i leave that to your imagination which will it be choose now and forever hold your peace the knight thought about this and could not make up his mind he sighed and shook his head and sighed again finally he said dear wife my lady and my love i put myself in your hands choose whichever fate most pleases you and choose the one most honourable to both of us i dont care which way you decide as long as you want it so am i in control she asked him may i decide what is best for our marriage sure he replied that suits me then kiss me we no longer need to quarrel by my oath i will now be both women for you i will be beautiful and faithful too may i die a mad woman rather than let you down i will be as good and true to you as any wife ever was or ever will be and thats not all in the morning i will be as fair as any lady empress or queen in the whole world do with me what you will but now just lift up the curtain and look at me the knight was amazed to find her as young and as beautiful as she had promised he took her up in his arms joyfully and kissed her a thousand times true to her word she obeyed him in everything she never once displeased him and so they lived together in peace and harmony for the rest of their lives god send us all gentle husbands especially if they are young and good in bed pray to god too that we women outlive them cursed be the men who will not obey their wives and double curses to mean husbands that is all i have to say heere endeth the wyves tale of bathe the friars prologue the prologe of the freres tale that worthy man that friar had been frowning and glowering at the summoner all the time that the wife had been speaking he had not forgotten their argument but for the sake of decency he had not said anything vicious now he spoke up dame alison he said good wife of bath god send you a long life i swear that you have touched upon a matter for debate by scholars and you have acquitted yourself very well but ma dame while we are riding here together our only task is to entertain one another there is no need to engage in moral discussion leave that to the priests in their pulpits so if the rest of the company are agreed i will now tell you a funny story about a summoner i think you will all admit that there is nothing good to be said about that profession summoners are the pits of course i am not referring to any individual here he glanced at the summoner before continuing a summoner is a jackal he runs up and down with writs of arrest for fornication and of course consequently he gets beaten up all the time harry bailey our host interrupted him good friar he said please be polite a man of the cloth ought to be courteous to others we will have no arguments between ourselves get on with your story and leave the summoner alone let him say what he likes the summoner replied it doesnt worry me when my turn comes i will pay him back in kind i will tell him all about friars false flatterers as they are i have a lot of dirty stories about them that i will keep in reserve he will learn what it is to be a friar peace no more our host put up his hand now good master friar will you please tell your story without more delay it is getting late the friar cleared his throat the friars tale heere bigynneth the freres tale once upon a time there was living in my district an archdeacon a man of great position who sat in judgment on all sorts of matters fornication witchcraft bawdy slander adultery that kind of thing he laid down the law on robbery violations of contract making of wills failure to take the sacraments usury and simony he was tough but he was really hard on those caught in the act of lechery he made them pay for it did they sing then there were those who did not pay the proper taxes to the church if any parish priest complained about them they were severely punished by the archdeacon they never escaped a very heavy fine if anyone gave a small offering in church or a small tithe he was in trouble he was in the archdeacons black book before he could be hooked by the bishops staff the archdeacon had all the authority he needed he represented church justice after all now among his officers there was a summoner there was no more crafty man in england he had his own secret network of spies who told him exactly what was going on so he could go easy on one or two adulterers as long as they led him to a score of others i can see that our summoner here is becoming angry his nose is twitching like the snout on a march hare but i will not spare him on that account i will reveal all he has no authority among us does he he cannot punish us now or ever that is what all the harlots say exclaimed the summoner you cant touch us we are in the liberties no wonder a harlot like you follows suit stop this our host was very firm gods punishment on you if you carry on like this continue with your story sir friar and pay no attention to the summoner dont spare his blushes thank you mr bailey as i was saying this false thief this villain this summoner had any number of pimps ready to inform on their clients they were like tame hawks in his hand they had known most of these lechers a long time and were quite happy to spill all their secrets so they were the summoners confidential agents and he made a lot of money out of them the archdeacon never knew the half of it he never got the half of it either he had to be content with less the men themselves were happy to bribe the summoner of course he could have called them to court on pain of excommunication many of them could not even read his summons so they filled his purse they plied him with ale in the tavern just as judas was a thief taking the money given to him for safekeeping by the apostles so likewise was he let me give him his full title he was a thief a fraud a lecher and a summoner he had some women to service him they were prostitutes of course and they whispered in his ear if sir robert or sir hugh or plain jack had fucked them so he and the women were in league together he would make up some false summons bring them to judgment fine the man and let off the woman friend he would say i will strike the womans name from the record for your sake you dont want it known do you dont worry everything is settled i am your friend i want to help you he knew of more ways to extort money than i could recount to you it would take me years there is no hunting dog that does not know a wounded deer from a healthy one it was the same with him he could smell a lecher or an adulterer or a whore a mile away since that was the way he earned his living he bounded after them with his tongue hanging out so it happened that one day this worthy summoner was after some new prey he was about to pay a call on an elderly woman an old trout from whom he was about to extort money on some trumpedup charge or other it so happened that as he was riding through the forest he came upon a jolly yeoman this young man was carrying his bow with bright sharp arrows he was wearing a green jacket and a smart black cap with tassels hail and well met called out the summoner the same to you the yeoman replied where are you riding today beneath the greenwood trees are you going far no not really i am travelling only a short distance i have to collect the rent for the lord of my manor and earn myself a little fee for the trouble oh so you are a bailiff thats right he would not admit out of shame that he was actually a summoner he might as well pour shit on his head good god said the yeoman what a coincidence i am a bailiff too isnt that something then he grew more confidential the trouble is that i dont know this area at all so i would be very happy to make your acquaintance brother with brother and learn a thing or two i have gold and silver in my box here and if you should ever venture into my shire in turn i will be very happy to look after you thats very kind of you the summoner replied he held out his hand put it here then they shook hands swore an oath that they would be true to each other until death and rode on together in great good spirits the summoner was as full of gossip as a carrion crow is full of worms so he kept on questioning the yeoman about this and that now tell me this he asked him where exactly do you live where would i be able to find you the yeoman answered him softly i live far off in the north country i hope very much to see you there i will give you such directions before we part that you will never mistake my dwelling now dear brother the summoner went on tell me this as well just between the two of us riding together since you are a bailiff like me let me know some of your tricks how i can make the most of my position you know what i mean dont hold back for fear of offending me you wont do that we are all sinners just tell me how do you do it i will tell you the truth brother bailiff i will be straight with you my wages are low and my lord is very demanding i have a hard time of it i can tell you and so i am forced to live by bribery and extortion i admit it i take as much as i can sometimes i use low cunning and sometimes i use force thats the way i earn my living theres nothing more to say snap said the summoner its the same with me too ill steal anything god knows as long as it is not too heavy or too hot what i earn privately is my own business i dont lose any sleep over it if i didnt steal i wouldnt live its as simple as that and im not about to confess my sins to the priest i have no pity i have no conscience these holy confessors can go fuck themselves so there sir we are well mated and well met just one more thing what do they call you the yeoman began smiling when he asked the question do you really want to know my name to tell you the truth i am a fiend my dwelling is in hell i ride about the world searching for gains i like to find out if men like you will give me anything that is the only profit i can earn we are engaged in the same trade you see to get something anything is the sum of my endeavour i will ride to the end of the world to find my prey i am riding now god in heaven the summoner replied what are you saying i really thought that you were a yeoman you have the shape of a man just like mine do you have the same form in hell where you chiefly dwell certainly not we have no shape in hell but we can adopt whatever form we fancy or else make it appear so i can appear as a human being or as an ape i can even take on the form of a bright angel why are you surprised a secondrate conjuror can deceive you easily enough so why cannot i i have more experience after all so you are telling me that you can ride around in different shapes you are only a yeoman for a short while of course i take whatever shape is necessary to trap my prey why sir fiend do you go to all this trouble there are many reasons dear summoner now is not the time to explain them the day is short it is already past nine and i have not yet found my quarry i must attend to business if you dont mind and not spend the time revealing all my plans dont take this the wrong way brother but i doubt that you are capable of understanding them in any case you asked me why we take such trouble well sometimes we are the instruments of god himself fulfilling his commandment he wreaks his will on humankind in various ways and for various reasons we have no strength or purpose without him that is certain sometimes if we ask kindly enough we are allowed to afflict the body rather than the soul job is a case in point we certainly punished him there are occasions when we can do some harm to the soul as well as to the body thats the fun part there are other times when we can attack the soul but not the body it all depends it works out well in any case ill tell you why if anybody can resist our temptations then he or she will go to heaven that was not our intention of course we want the soul to settle down with us and there are even occasions when we act as servants to mankind take the case of archbishop dunstan he used to be able to control us devils i myself have served one of the apostles in a lowly way but thats a long story can you tell me this the summoner was now thoroughly absorbed in the conversation is it true that you make your new bodies out of the elements themselves out of the wind and the fire not really sometimes we create the illusion of that yet there are other times when we reanimate the bodies of the dead and rise from their graves did you hear about the witch of endor who conjured up the spirit of samuel before king saul of israel some people claim that it was not samuel at all i dont know i am not a theologian but ill warn you of one thing i wont deceive you soon enough you will find out about our changing shapes you will not need to learn anything from me you will know the truth from experience you will be able to lecture on it write books about it more learned than those of virgil and of dante come on let us ride i enjoy being in your company ill stay with you until you tell me to piss off thats not going to happen the summoner replied i am a yeoman and widely respected i am known to keep my word and i would stick to it even if you were satan himself we are brothers you and i and we will be true to one another we will help each other in our various trades you take what you can and i shall do the same we are both businessmen after all but if one of us makes a killing then he should share it with the other that is fair dont you think i grant you that the fiend said on my honour so they rode forth on their way they passed through the forest and very soon came up to the village where the summoner hoped to exact some tribute here they happened to see a cart filled with hay being driven with some difficulty by a carter the road was deep in mud and the wheels were lodged in it they could not be moved the carter was frantic and kept on shouting at the horses come on brock he screamed come on scot what are you stopping for get a move on the devil take the lot of you as whole as you were born i have gone through hell today because of you well you can go to the devil hay cart and horses this is going to be fun the summoner murmured to his companion did you hear what that oaf said did you hear the carter he offered you the cart and the hay and his three horses what do you say to that not much he doesnt really mean it you see if you dont believe me go and ask him just wait for a moment you will learn that i am right the carter began to strike his horses on their hindquarters all the while urging them on with the reins until finally they began to move they put their heads down and dragged the cart from the mire thats good the carter exclaimed jesus christ bless you well done you dappled beauties all the saints in heaven preserve you you have got us free what did i tell you the fiend asked the summoner this is a lesson for you dear friend the carter said one thing but he thought another lets be on our way i am going to earn nothing here this is a waste of time so they rode through the village just as they came to the edge of it the summoner rode up to his companion and whispered in his ear again there is an old woman living around here who would sooner risk her neck than lose a penny ill get some money out of her so help me otherwise she will end up in court she hasnt done anything wrong of course but that doesnt matter the important thing is to get her you havent had much luck so far but ill show you how its done just watch when they came up to the old widows door the summoner began beating on it come out you old trout he shouted have you got some priest or friar with you you old hag who is knocking the old woman opened the door a fraction god save us what do you want dear sir she knew that he was the summoner i have a bill of summons here he said on pain of excommunication i command you to attend the archdeacons court tomorrow there you will have to respond to certain charges made against you may god be my witness she said i have done nothing wrong i have been ill for a long time in any case and i cannot go very far i can only hobble and sir i could no more get on a horse than on your back the pain in my side is something dreadful can you not give me a written statement of the case then i can get someone to answer the charges for me in open court if you pay up now ill consider it now let me see yes twelve pence should do it if you pay me those twelve pence ill drop all charges i shant make much profit myself it all goes to my lord and master but for your sake ill do it come on cough up wheres the money twelve pence she exclaimed mary mother of god save me from ruin if i were to gain the whole world by it i still havent got the money twelve pence ive never seen so much money in my life you can see well enough sir what i am have pity on a poor old hag no way if i let you off may the devil take me pay up even if it kills you in gods truth i dont have any money pay me now otherwise i will confiscate your brandnew frying pan the one i can see lying in the corner dont you remember the debt you owe me for cheating on your husband i paid your fine then to the archdeacon thats a lie i swear to god that i have never once been summoned to your court as a wife or as a widowwoman i have always been honest she fell down on her knees in an attitude of prayer may the black and smoking devil take you and my frying pan too if he wants it when the devil heard her curse he said gently to her mother mabel is this what you really want are you saying this in earnest or in game in deadly earnest sir if this summoner does not repent his lies may the devil carry him off and he can take my frying pan with him well you old bitch the summoner replied i dont repent anything i have ever had of you i would take your smock if i could i would strip every stitch off your back dont be angry dear brother the fiend said your body and her frying pan are mine by right you must descend to hell with me tonight where i will teach you all of our secrets you will become more learned than any theologian and with that the devil caught him in his arms and carried him off the soul and body of the summoner were taken to the place where all summoners eventually retire may god who made us in his own image grant us all salvation may he even teach summoners to become good men i could have told you gentlemen and gentle ladies and if i had time i could have told this summoner here what christ and the apostles have said about the pains of hell that cursed house is filled with pain and suffering which i could not describe in the space of a thousand winters no mind can conceive of it no tongue can tell it may jesus our saviour keep us from that evil place and may he protect us from the wiles of satan beware stay alert remember the old proverb the lion is always poised to slay and eat the innocent if ever he gets the chance dispose your hearts so fittingly that you will be able to withstand the snares of the devil the fiend cannot tempt you beyond your strength remember that christ will be your champion and your knight let us pray that all the summoners of this nation repent their misdeeds before they are taken down to hell amen heere endeth the freres tale the summoners prologue the prologe of the somonours tale the summoner stood up in his stirrups and shook his fist at the friar he was so angry that he was shaking like an aspen leaf he was as mad as hell i want only one thing fellow pilgrims he said i ask you out of courtesy to me now that you have heard this false friar lying through his teeth to listen to my tale this friar boasts that he knows all about hell i am not surprised friars and fiends are very closely related you must have heard the story about the friar who was taken to hell in a vision when the angel guided him through all the circles and pains of that inferno the friar could see none of his brethren there were plenty of other people in torment but there were no friars so he spoke up and asked the angel tell me sir are friars so virtuous that none are damned no indeed the angel replied there are millions of them here the spirit led him down to the body of satan himself do you see the demons tail he asked the friar it is as broad as a sail on a great ship is it not just look what is beneath it hold up your tail satan let us see your arse let the friar see where all his brethren are hiding satan did as he was told a couple of minutes later the friars came out like a swarm of bees they were pushed and prodded by junior fiends they ran in all directions here and there through the precincts of hell till on one accord they fled back up satans fundament then the devil covered his arse with his tail and settled down again when the friar had thoroughly acquainted himself with all the miseries and mysteries of hell his spirit returned to his body he awoke in his own bed by gods mercy but he was so fearful that he sweated and shook he could not get the arse of the devil out of his thoughts that was the place he was heading for god save all of you gentlemen and ladies all except the cursed friar here now i will get on with my story the summoners tale heere bigynneth the somonour his tale there is in yorkshire i believe a marshy area known as holderness or is it a town i cant remember anyway there was a friar who frequented the area preaching and begging in the usual fashion of his breed his name was friar john it so happened that one day he had given a sermon in one of the local churches it was the same old story donate alms for the sake of masses for the dead donate alms so that we can build more friaries and honour god almighty dont give money where it will only be wasted and misspent dont support those who are already living in luxury thanks be to god like the monks and the priests your alms he said can release the souls of all folk young and old from the pains of purgatory it does not matter if the prayers at the mass are sung hastily i will not accuse any priest of being frivolous or wanton for saying only one mass a day far from it these poor souls must be delivered from their torments as quickly as possible it is hard for them to endure the fleshhooks and the spikes it is agony for them to be torn to pieces or burned or boiled can you imagine it so give me your money quickly for all their sakes when the friar had finished his little sermon he blessed the congregation and went on his way but not before the folk in the church had given him their coins as soon as that was settled he was off he was not going to stay around with his satchel and his staff tucked up in his belt he went from house to house begging for bread or cheese or corn he was always peering through the windows and putting his head around open doors he had a companion with him too who carried with him a set of writing tablets and a long pointed pen he told the people that this allowed him to note down the names of all those who gave him alms so that he could pray for them later give us a little portion of wheat malt or rye he would whine give us a piece of cake or a morsel of cheese whatever you have we will take we are not fussy a penny or a halfpenny will do we would love some meat of course if you have any to spare no well then give me the cloth blanket i see over there look dear sister we are ready to write down your name how do you spell it are you sure that you dont have a morsel of bacon or of beef they were followed by a servant who worked for the landlord of the inn where they were staying he was carrying a sack whatever the people gave them he added to the load on his back as soon as the friar had left the neighbourhood however he would take out the writing tablet and erase the names he had just put down it was all a trick an act on his part this is all lies the friar was very indignant peace harry bailey called out for the love of god go on with your story sir summoner go on till the end leave out nothing thats what i intend the summoner replied you can be sure of it so friar john went from house to house until he came to one where he was accustomed to hospitality he was sure of getting something here but the good man who lived here was sick he was lying upon a low couch and could scarcely rise god be with you the friar said good day to you thomas and may god reward you my friend i have been very well fed at this table i have enjoyed many meals havent i he shoved the cat from its favourite chair put down his stick his satchel and his hat and then sat down at the table with a smile on his face he was alone his friend had already gone into town with the servant in order to book rooms in the inn for that night oh my dear master the sick man said how have you been this last week or two i havent seen you for a while god knows thomas i have been hard at work i have been working for your salvation you would never believe the number of prayers i have offered up for you and for my other friends in jesus i have just come from your parish church as a matter of fact where i delivered a sermon during mass it was a poor thing but it was my own it was not entirely based on scriptures of course because i prefer to paraphrase and interpret in my own way holy writ is too hard for some to understand so paraphrase is a good alternative do you know that phrase we friars use the letter killeth i simply told the congregation to be charitable and give their money for a good cause i saw your wife there by the way where is she now shes in the backyard i think shell be here in a minute and then stepped in the good wife welcome holy friar she said in the name of saint john are you keeping well the friar rose to his feet very politely put his arms around her very tightly and kissed her on the lips he was chirping like a sparrow never felt better in my life good woman i am yours to command in all things i saw you in church today you know i have never seen a prettier wife as god is my witness alas i have my faults good friar i am a frail woman but thank you and welcome you have always been kind to me he replied but can i beg your pardon in advance i would like to have a quiet word with your husband do you mind leaving us for a moment these parish priests are slow and negligent in their duties particularly those of confession and absolution i am a preacher as you know preaching is my profession i am well versed in the words of peter and of paul like them i fish for mens souls i render christ jesus his due i spread abroad his message to the world scold thomas well then my good sir he deserves it he gets as angry as a red ant even though he has everything he could possibly want although i cover him at night and make him warm although i give him a good cuddle he still moans like the old boar in our sty i dont get any enjoyment out of him at all theres no pleasure in it oh thomas thomas friar john said listen to me this must be amended this is the work of the devil himself god forbad anger as a sin i will have to have a word with you about this before i leave you two alone his wife added let me ask you something what would you like for your dinner good friar i can prepare it while you talk oh good woman my wants are very simple just the merest taste of chickens liver perhaps and some soft white bread to go with it and then perhaps a pigs head i dont want you to kill a pig on my behalf of course that would be sinful but a head would suit me i am a man of small appetite as you know i am nourished by the bible i am so used to mortification and penance that my appetite is all but destroyed he raised his eyes to heaven do not be annoyed with me good wife i am taking you into my confidence i am baring my soul to you there are very few people i can trust these days there is one last thing i must tell you she replied my little child died two weeks ago just after you had left the town i knew it i saw his death in a vision i was lying in the dormitory when i saw him before me it was probably less than a hour after he expired i saw him being transported to heaven so help me god our sacristan and our infirmarian saw him too and they have been holy friars for fifty years or more they have reached the age when they may walk about in the world alone god bless them as soon as i saw your child in bliss i got up from my bed the tears were running down my cheeks lord my eyes were waterspouts the whole of our convent came out with me with no bells and no noise at all and we went into the chapel where we sang the te deum then i prayed to christ thanking him for his revelation to me trust me good wife and husband when i tell you that the prayers of friars really do work we know more about the teachings of christ than any layperson kings included we live in poverty and abstinence you lay folk indulge in luxury and spendthrift ways you love meat and drink and all the foul temptations of the flesh we friars on the other hand hold the world in contempt the wife now left the room in order to prepare the pigs head for her guest do you know the difference thomas he went on in the same even tone between the poor man lazar and the rich man dives one of them came to a bad end which one do you think it was those who wish to pray must fast and remain pure they must curb the body and attend to the soul we follow the teaching of the apostles we are content with scraps of food and the merest rags so our penance and our abstinence give wings to our prayers they fly straight up to christ in heaven you recall thomas that moses fasted for forty days and forty nights before he was permitted to converse with almighty god on the summit of mount sinai only after he had denied himself food for all that time was he permitted to receive the ten commandments written with jehovahs own finger of fire and do you remember elijah on mount horeb the prophet fasted too and spent his days in contemplation before god deemed it right to speak to him aaron and all the other priests of the temple would never dare to approach the incense altar without mortifying their flesh they prayed only after they had abstained from drink how could they be drunk in the holy place it was unthinkable god would have struck them dead take warning from what i say thomas the priest who prays for your welfare and recovery must be sober or else well i will say no more you catch my drift our own saviour as the new testament tells us gave us many examples of fasting and of prayer that is why simple friars like myself are wedded to poverty and to celibacy we lead lives of charity of pity and of purity i myself am always weeping yes i am of course sometimes we are persecuted for our holiness that is the world for you nevertheless i tell you this our prayers are more acceptable to god they rise higher than those of you and your kind who can think only of your sensual appetites adam and eve were expelled from the garden of eden for the sin of gluttony is that not so it was not for lechery i know that much thomas listen to me i beseech you i dont have the exact text about me at the moment but i can remember the gist of it these are the words of sweet lord jesus when he was talking about us friars blessed he said are the poor in spirit thats me all the gospels sing our praises cleanliness is next to godliness the eye of the needle that kind of thing do you think they are referring to us or to those of you who wallow in your possessions i pity those who are in thrall to gluttony i spit on those who are addicted to lechery i abjure them thomas i renounce them they are no better than that heretic jovinian he was as fat as a whale and he waddled like a swan he was as full of booze as a bottle in an alehouse how can people like that pray when they pray they burp instead do you know that psalm of david when he says that his heart is issuing a great matter all they issue is gas no we are the ones that humbly follow the path and example of jesus we are meek we are poor we are chaste we are lowly thomas ever so lowly we do not just listen to gods word we practise it just as the hawk in upward flight mounts to the firmament so do our prayers and solicitations reach the gates of heaven we aspire thomas as i live and breathe thomas you will not flourish unless you are part of our brotherhood i swear that on all the saints we friars are praying for you night and day beseeching christ to take pity on your sick flesh and restore your poor body to health god help me the invalid replied i havent felt the benefit over the last few years i have spent pounds and pounds on the various orders of friars what good has it done me none at all i have got through most of my money and now i might as well say goodbye to the rest oh thomas thomas wash out your mouth how can you talk like that what is all this nonsense about various orders of friars what is the point of seeking out various orders of specialists when you see before you the perfect doctor your fickleness will be the ruin of you mark my words do you really believe that my prayers and those of my holy brothers are not enough for you that is ludicrous if anything you have given us too little give one convent a halfload of oats give another convent twentyfour pence give this friar a penny and let him go give that friar well you get the idea no no thomas that is not right that is not proper what is a farthing worth if it is divided into twelve a thing whole and complete is stronger than anything that is divided and scattered that is common sense i am not going to flatter you thomas that is not my style you want to get our prayers for nothing is that not so but god himself great ruler of the universe and here the friar raised his eyes up to the ceiling he has declared that the labourer is worthy of his hire im not interested in your money for my part i wouldnt touch any of it but the fact is that the whole convent is praying for you and we also need funds for the new church i am reminded of the life of saint thomas of india that blessed man built many churches that were very pleasing in the eyes of god oh thomas thomas you are lying here all eaten up by anger and impatience the devil has inflamed you thats what it is thats why you are so foul to that lovely little woman your wife what an innocent she is so meek so patient listen to me thomas trust me leave your wife alone think about what im saying its not just me it is the word of the wise never have a lion in the house do not terrorize those who are subject to you dont make your friends afraid of you thomas let me say one thing more for your benefit be careful of the anger that lies in your heart it is like the serpent that glides through the grass with its poison hidden in its fangs listen to me dont be so restless twenty thousand men to put it no higher have lost their lives because they have become angry with their wives or their mistresses what is the point of quarrelling with your sweet wife you know that if you tread on the tail of a snake it strikes back in anger that snake is not half so cruel as a wife who believes herself to be wronged all she wants then is vengeance vengeance is mine said the lord but she is too fired up to listen revenge is one of the seven deadly sins revenge turns on the sinner leading to destruction every common cleric every parish priest will tell you that anger leads to murder anger is at the mercy of pride i could tell you so many stories of deadly anger that i would still be here tomorrow no all right i wont but i will pray for you i will pray day and night that god curbs the might of all angry men it does great harm to set up a man of ire and vengeance as a ruler that noble gentleman seneca has told the story of a magistrate of terrible temper one day during the course of his reign two knights went out riding it so befell that one of them came back the other did not the knight returned home was brought before the court where the judge pronounced sentence upon him you have murdered your comrade he said so i sentence you to death then he turned to another knight in the court take this man to the scaffold he said at once now it so happened that on their way to the executioners block the other knight suddenly appeared he was meant to be dead but he was very much alive so everyone thought that the best thing was to return with both knights to the court sir said the knight who had accompanied the condemned man this knight has not killed his comrade the dead man stands before you by god the judge replied i will have the heads of all three of you he addressed the first knight i have already condemned you to death my word still stands you will die then he addressed the second knight since you are the cause of this mans death you too must be executed then he turned to the third knight since you disobeyed my order i sentence you to beheading and that is what happened all three men were executed do you know the case of cambises king of persia he was a drunk and a quarrelsome drunk at that he was a bully there was a lord in his household who was a proper and virtuous man now it happened one day that this good lord said to the king if a lord is vicious then he is lost drunkenness is itself a blot on the name of any man but especially on that of a ruler a lot of people are watching him he does not know all the eyes and ears that surround him so for gods love sire drink more temperately wine can affect the brain it can affect the body too is that what you think cambises replied i will prove to you how wrong you can be the exact opposite is the case as you will soon find out for yourself no wine on earth is going to affect my eyesight or my limbs or my strength watch so then he began to drink much more than he had ever done before a hundred times more i should say when he was thoroughly pissed he ordered the son of this courtier to be brought before him he told the boy to stand upright in front of him then he took out his bow and arrow and stretched the bowstring right back to his ear then he let go the arrow killed the child of course dont you think he asked the grieving father that i have a steady hand has my strength gone has my eyesight suffered has my judgement i dont think so what use was the answer of the courtier his son was dead there was nothing more to say so beware my friend how you deal with kings and lords just say if it please you sir or i will do whatever i can for you sir you can tell a poor man what you think of him vices and all but you cannot berate your master even if he seems to be going straight to hell say nothing think of that other persian king cyrus who in his anger destroyed the river gyndes because one of his sacred white horses had drowned in it on the way to babylon he drained the river by diverting it into various channels so that in the end women could cross it without getting their skirts wet what did wise solomon tell us never make friends with an angry man never walk in company with a madman you will be sorry i will say no more on that matter thomas so swallow your anger you will find me as straight and firm as a carpenters square dont thrust the knife of the devil into your heart your anger will do you infinite harm come now thomas give me your full confession no way thomas replied i have already confessed to the curate this morning i have told him everything there is no need to repeat it all in any case give me some of your money give us gold to build a cloister for the lord we friars have been forced to live off oysters and mussels while people like you have drunk and eaten well think of what we have suffered to raise that cloister yet god knows that we still have not completed the foundations the pavement is not laid not a tile has been put in place we owe forty pounds alone for building materials can you believe it so help us thomas in the name of he who harrowed hell otherwise we will have to sell our books if we cannot preach then the whole world will suffer to take us from our pulpits and our preaching crosses will be to take the sun out of the sky i am being serious who can preach and do good works as we can we are not some novelty there have been friars around since the time of elijah and that was a very long time ago there are records mentioning us i need your charity thomas for gods sake charity and at that the friar fell down upon his knees and crossed himself thomas himself was already in a very bad temper he realized well enough that the friar was full of shit he was a liar and a hypocrite if he had had the strength he would have tossed him into the fire i can only give you he said what i possess on my person now did you say that i had become a lay brother yes of course i have brought the letter of fraternity with me i was going to give it to your wife for safekeeping that is good thank you i will make a donation to your convent while i still live you will hold it in your hand i promise you but there is one condition you have to swear to me that every other friar in your convent has an equal share of what i am about to give you swear to that on your holy brotherhood without cavil or hesitation i swear it the friar replied on the blood and bones of christ he shook hands with thomas you can have trust in me all right then thomas said just put your hand down my back down there if you grope just behind my buttocks you will find something that i have hidden away for your benefit aha the friar thought this is going with me this is my prize so he plunged his hand under the sheets and started feeling the mans arse to find some treasure he put his fingers up his cleft in case there was a small package when thomas felt the fingers of the friar groping around his bum he suddenly let out a great fart a farmhorse pulling a cart could not have let out a greater fart a ploughmans ox could not have made a smellier one the noise was terrific friar john was so startled that he jumped up you bastard he shouted you did that on purpose didnt you god help you youll pay for that fart i promise you just you wait the servants of the house hearing the uproar came scurrying into the room and chased out the friar so he left with a scowl on his face and went in search of the comrade who always followed him about he looked like an old boar in pain he was grinding his teeth or rather his tusks then he set out for the manor house of the village where lived a gentleman of great distinction to whom he sometimes gave confession this worthy man was naturally lord of the manor he was sitting at dinner in his hall when friar john approached him in a fearful rage the friar was so angry that he could not get his words out then he finally managed god be with you the lord looked up at him and greeted him friar john he said what on earth is the matter with you i can see that something has happened you look as if the wood were full of thieves sit down tell me all about it if i can help you i will i have been insulted the friar replied humiliated in your village there is no one so poor so lowly so despised who would not feel that he had been degraded by the treatment i have received here just now of course i do not complain on my own account i am a mere friar but i do mind that this this fool this knave this whitehaired old clown should blaspheme against my convent now master friar no sir not master never master i am a mere servant i know that i have been made a master of divinity but i never use the title it is not modest it is not seemly here or anywhere else thats up to you but please tell me what has happened sir today my order and myself have been dealt a shameful wrong it is too dreadful to contemplate the whole of the holy church all its degrees from pope to priest has been insulted god help us all i am sure the lord of the manor said that you know the best way to proceed dont get into a state about it you are my confessor after all you are the salt of the earth be calm for gods sake and tell me what happened so the friar sat down and told him the whole story there is no need for me to repeat it to you the lady of the house had come in and heard what the friar had to say mother of god she said holy virgin is there anything else tell me thats it friar john replied what do you think what do i think god help me i say that a common man has done a common deed what else am i supposed to say he will end up in trouble i know that much his sickness must be affecting him he may be having some kind of seizure he doesnt know what he is doing ma dame the friar said i will not lie to you i will be revenged upon him one way or another i will denounce him from the pulpit i will defame him i will shame him how dare he tell me to divide a thing that cannot be divided you know what i am talking about how can i give a portion of youknowwhat to all the friars god damn him and his fart the lord listened to all this in amazement and asked himself how it was possible for this wretched man to have the wit to put such a problem to the friar who could solve such a conundrum i never heard anything like it he said out loud to no one in particular the devil must have put it in his mind i dont think that any master of arithmetic has ever asked the question who could demonstrate the proper method by which every friar should have a part of the sound and the smell of a fart is this man this invalid fiendishly clever or what he is too clever for his own good thats for sure who ever heard of such a thing one divisible part to every man alike tell me how it is impossible it cannot be done the rumbling of a fart well it is just reverberation of the air it is a hollow sound fading ever so slowly away no man can judge if it has been divided properly who would have thought that one of my own villagers would come up with something so so problematic and he put it to my confessor too he must be a madman eat your supper friar john and forget all about it let the churl go hang himself the wordes of the lordes squier and his kervere for departinge of the fart on twelve jack the young squire of the lord was standing by the table and carving the roast meat of course he had heard everything sir he said please dont be angry with me if you gave me enough cloth to make a new gown as a reward if you like i think i could tell the friar the solution to this riddle i think i could explain to him how to divide this mans fart among all the members of his convent if you give us the answer the lord of the manor replied you can have your cloth god knows you will have earned it my lord the squire said pick a day when the weather is mild and favourable when there is no wind or breeze to disturb the air then have a cartwheel with its usual twelve spokes brought into the hall here it has to be a complete wheel yes and then summon twelve friars into the hall thirteen make up a convent do they not well your confessor here can be the thirteenth they all have to kneel down at the same time then every friar has to put his nose against one of the spokes our worthy friar here will place his nose against the hub in the middle of the wheel may god be with him we will then bring the churl among them his belly will have to be as taut as a drum and ready to blow he will bend down on the other side of the hub and let loose a great fart i swear to you on my life that you will see the proof of my theory the sound of the fart will travel along all twelve of the spokes so will the stink of it of course your worthy confessor here will have the first fruit so to speak he deserved the first offering that is only fair has he not said in the past that the worthiest friar should be the first to receive alms he deserves the best does he not only this morning i heard him preaching from the pulpit it did me good it really did i would let him savour three farts if i could i am sure his whole convent agrees with me about that what a holy man he is the lord and his lady were in full agreement with young jack everyone there said that he had explained himself as subtly as euclid or ptolemy everyone that is except the holy friar as for the churl who had started the whole business they all agreed that he was neither mad nor foolish on the contrary he had all his wits about him so jack won his new gown that is the end of my story and just in time look we are coming into a new town heere endeth the somonours tale the clerks prologue heere folweth the prologe of the clerkes tale of oxenforde come now master scholar from oxford our host exclaimed you have been as coy and quiet as a young virgin waiting for her first night in bed you havent said a word throughout the journey i suppose you are studying some great intellectual problem but you know what wise solomon believed there is a time for everything for christs sake cheer up man this is not the occasion to be serious tell us a funny story anyone who agrees to be part of the game must play by its rules isnt that so dont preach to us in any case that is for the friars that is for lent dont start moaning about the sins of the world and dont tell us a tale that will bore us to death be jolly tell us about fantastic adventures and dont clothe everything with your oxford rhetoric we dont want technical terms or figures of speech they are for the secretaries of kings speak plainly in the language men use make sure that all of us here can understand you the oxford man answered him politely host he said i am under your authority you are in charge i will obey you in everything unless of course you become unreasonable i will tell you a story i first heard from a worthy scholar at the university of padua he was a very learned man and a good one alas he is now dead and nailed in his coffin god give him rest this scholar was also a great poet francis petrarch by name have you heard of him his sweet rhetoric sugared the poetry of italy his colleague at padua giovani di lignano did the same for law and rhetoric but you wont have heard of him they have gone now death is no respecter of persons it will not allow us to linger in the world in an instant it had taken both of them and we will all surely follow let me tell you more about petrarch himself before he recited this tale to me he explained that he had composed it in a high style fitting its matter he also told me that he had written a prologue before starting on the substance of the story in this prologue he had described the area of piedmont and its region of saluzzo where the action is set he described the apennine mountains that make up the western border of lombardy in particular he portrayed mount viso highest of the mountains where the river po has its source in a little spring among the rocks from there the river goes eastward increasing all the way towards ferrara and lovely venice before entering the sea but thats another story it is irrelevant here except as an introduction now that i have set the scene i will get on with my tale the clerks tale heere bigynneth the tale of the clerk of oxenforde part one on the western side of italy just beside the foot of chilly mount viso there is a rich and fruitful plain dotted with towns and castles that were built up in ancient times there are many other pleasant places to be seen here in the region known as saluzzo a marquis was the lord of this land one of a long line of distinguished noblemen all of his vassals high and low were diligent and obedient to his commands so for many years he lived in peace and prosperity the favoured son of fortune beloved and respected by the lords and by the common people he came from the stock of the most noble lineage in all of lombardy he was strong and courageous young and fair a very model of honour and of chivalry he exercised his authority very well except in certain affairs that i am about to mention to you the name of this marquis by the way was walter walter was worthy of criticism in one respect he never considered what might or might not happen in the future his only concern was the present moment he busied himself about hunting and hawking that was all nothing else seemed to matter to him he was not interested in marriage for example on no account would he take a bride this was the one thing for which his people blamed him so a delegation asked to be admitted into his presence among them was a wise and worthy man it was believed that the marquis would listen to him as a representative of the general opinion so this man stood before the marquis and spoke thus noble marquis your wellknown benignity and humanity embolden us to speak to you plainly it has become necessary for us to tell you of our distress listen to us sir in your usual merciful way with piteous hearts we address you do not turn away from me or condemn my words i am no more able or more knowledgeable than any other man in this place but in as much as i have found favour with you before dear lord i will be so bold as to put before you our request it will then be up to you of course whether you accept or reject it you know well enough that we have always admired your words and deeds there is no way in which we could enjoy more peace and happiness except perhaps in one matter we would love to hear wedding bells if you were to marry sir that would give us more pleasure than anything else i plead with you to bow your neck and enter a new state of sovereignty not service which is called wedlock or matrimony you are wise sir and will consider that our days flee like the wind when we wake or sleep when we ride or wander time does not stand still it abides for no man you are still in your green time but youth will one day give way to age the years come as silent as a stone death is the enemy of all young or old high or low no one can escape but even if we are all certain that we will die sir none of us know when that day will come our intentions are good you know that we have never yet disobeyed you in anything so very humbly we ask you to listen to our request it concerns a marriage if you agree we will choose for you a wife in as short a time as possible she will be of the utmost rank of the nobility so that as your wife she will bring honour to you and to god free us from fear and trembling dear lord take a wife for gods sake if it should happen god forbid that you should die and that your line came to an end we might be ruled by some stranger from a strange land we cannot think of anything more terrible so we beg you to marry in all haste walter heard this humble and sorrowful request and was moved by it how could he be angry with such suppliants you well know my dear people he replied that before this moment i have never thought of the sweet constraints of a wife i enjoy my liberty and know well enough that it is not to be found in marriage where once i was free i would be in servitude nevertheless i understand your good intentions i know your good will towards me and i trust your judgement as i have always done so of my own free will i declare that i will be married as soon as i can i know that you have promised today to find a wife for me but i release you from that pledge i wish to hear no more about it god knows that children are often very different from their parents goodness comes from god and not from noble ancestors or a rich family i will put my trust in god i place my life and estate and my marriage in his care let him do with me as he please so allow me please to find a wife for myself i will take the responsibility but you must promise me this i ask you to honour whatever wife i choose for as long as she may live you must make the most solemn pledge to support her in word and deed here and everywhere just as if she were the daughter of an emperor you must also swear another oath you must swear not to complain or criticize when i have chosen i have chosen you are asking me to give up my liberty after all so i must be allowed to follow my own inclination unless you assent to my proposals i will have nothing more to do with the matter so unanimously they agreed to all of the marquiss conditions no one dissented before they departed however they begged their lord to name the day of the wedding as soon as possible they feared you see that in the end he might not marry at all he did name a day as they asked on that particular day he declared he would be faithfully married in compliance to their wishes they all kneeled down before him and pledged their obedience he thanked them for the respect and affection they had shown to him and sent them on their way they filed out of the hall and went to their own homes then walter summoned the officers of his court and asked them to prepare a feast he ordered the members of his private household to make all the arrangements for the bridal day they busied themselves about the preparations with a good will each of them wanting to make a success of the occasion part two not far from this great palace where the marquis was making ready for the feast there was a hamlet nestling in very pleasant scenery the poor folk of the neighbourhood lodged and kept their cattle here they laboured in the fields and the fields were often fruitful among these poor people was one fellow who was reckoned to be the poorest of them all yet was not the son of god born in a simple manger gods grace can reach an oxs stall the name of this poor man was janiculus he had a beautiful young daughter whose name was griselda to speak of virtue and of beauty she was in every sense one of the fairest in the world she had been brought up in honest poverty and there was no trace of greed or sensuality in her nature she drank water more often than she drank wine she embraced labour rather than idleness griselda was still of a young age and a virgin but in her heart were genuine ardour and courage she looked after her poor and elderly father with tenderness and affection she watched the sheep in the pasture and in the cottage was busy at the spinningwheel she did not stop working until she retired to bed when she came home from the fields she brought with her cabbages and other vegetables which she cut up and cooked to make a modest meal her bed was hard there were no feathers in her pillow but she always cared for her father and treated him with all the reverence and obedience he could possibly desire walter in the course of his many hunting expeditions had often seen this maid he had not looked upon her in lust far from it he had gazed and gazed and sighed he had contemplated her beauty he had recognized her to be the very image of a virtuous woman passing all others of her age he had seen feminine grace in her manner and appearance it is true that many people have no insight into these things but the marquis was an exception he decided that he would marry griselda and no other the day appointed for the wedding had come but no one in the land knew who if anyone was to be the bride many of them wondered aloud others asked each other in private if the marquis had broken his promise is he not going to be married after all they complained is he going to make a fool of himself and of us as well yet secretly the marquis had already ordered rings and brooches and other precious gems set in gold and azure for the sake of griselda he had also found a young woman of the same stature and had measured her for the dresses of his new bride griselda was sure to have a full trousseau as well as every adornment for her wedding day it was nine oclock on the morning of the wedding day all the palace had been decorated every hall and every little chamber had been made ready for the celebrations the kitchens and storerooms had been stuffed with food and drink you could not have seen better fare in the whole of italy the marquis rode out in state attended by all the company of his lords and ladies who had been invited to the wedding feast the knights in his service also accompanied him on the royal journey to the sound of lutes and trumpets then the procession wound its way to the little hamlet where janiculus and griselda lived griselda had of course no idea that all this magnificence and display were for her sake she had gone to the well to fetch water as usual and was now hurrying back home to see the grand spectacle she knew that the marquis was going to be married that day and didnt want to miss it i will stand with the other girls she said to herself outside the door and take a look at the bride as she rides past i will get through all the work at home as quickly as i can then ill have time to catch a glimpse of her on the way to the palace i hope she comes this way she had just got up to her door and was about to cross the threshold when she heard a voice the marquis had ridden towards her and was calling out to her she put down the watervessel in a little wicker enclosure and fell upon her knees she kneeled in front of her lord waiting patiently to hear his will the marquis dismounted from his horse and walked over to her she did not dare look up at him he gazed at her thoughtfully and then in an earnest manner began to speak to her where is your father griselda he is here sir inside the cottage will you fetch him for me so she rose to her feet and entered the cottage when she brought out her father the marquis shook his hand and led him aside janiculus he said i cant conceal my feelings any longer i love your daughter and wish to marry her if you give your permission to the match i promise to love her and live with her until the day of my death i know that you love me in turn and that you are my faithful subject i am your liege lord whatever pleases me i think will also please you am i right and as i said there is one thing that will please me more than anything else will you allow me to become your soninlaw the old man was so astounded that his face turned scarlet he was trembling he was so nervous that he could hardly get the words out finally he managed to stammer an answer my lord he said please do whatever you like i will agree to anything so long as it pleases you anything at all wait a moment i think you and me and griselda should have a conversation the marquis spoke very softly and politely dont you agree i would like to ask her if she is willing to become my wife and to obey my wishes as her lawful husband i want to talk to her in your presence i will say nothing out of your hearing so the three of them entered the cottage and began their discussion i will tell you about that later meanwhile all manner of people began to gather outside the cottage commenting loudly on how neat and clean it looked griselda herself was almost overcome with astonishment as well she might at the turn of events she had never seen before such lords and ladies and such knights in gleaming armour she had never experienced such magnificence and to have the marquis sitting beside her well she had gone quite pale now i will tell you what the marquis said to this paragon this cynosure this true heart enough of that these are his actual words griselda he said you should know that your father and i have come to an understanding we have agreed that you will be my bride and lawful wife i dont suppose that you have any objection but let me ask you this first this is all being done at great speed i admit so i want to know whether you are happy to go along with it or do you want time to consider the matter further i have another question are you willing to be ruled by me in everything according to my pleasure will you remain true to me whether i treat you for better or for worse you must never complain you must never contradict me with a no rather than a yes you must never frown or show any sign of displeasure if you swear all this i will swear to marry you griselda was afraid and wondered at the meaning of his words my lord she replied i am unworthy of the honour you wish to pay to me but if this is truly your will then i will gladly accede to it i swear to you now in front of my father that i will never disobey you in word or deed i swear this on my life even though life is dear to me you have said enough griselda you will be mine he came out of the cottage looking very grave and griselda followed him as they stood together the marquis addressed the crowd that had gathered there here is my wife he said honour her and love her as you love and honour me there is no more to say he did not want anything from her old life to be brought into the palace and so he ordered his ladies to undress her there and then these ladies were reluctant to touch the scraps and tatters on her back but they were obliged to obey orders even if they risked getting their hands dirty off came the rags on came the new garments and there was griselda radiant and resplendent in her natural beauty they combed hair that had hardly ever seen a comb before they put a crown upon her head they pinned on her brooches and precious jewels what else can i say about her appearance she had become so ornate and regal that she was scarcely recognizable then the marquis gave her a ring especially bought for the occasion as a token of their union he set her upon a snowwhite palfrey and with gentle pace they rode to the palace they were greeted by wellwishers along the route and after their arrival they attended a great feast that continued until sunset i will not go on and on about her beauty and her virtue it suffices to say that she had such natural grace that it did not seem possible that she had been brought up in poverty she could not have come from a cottage or an oxstall she must have been educated in an emperors palace even the people who had come from the same village and had seen her growing from year to year could hardly believe that this was griselda the daughter of janiculus they could have sworn that this was a completely different person she was as virtuous as she had always been but in her new eminence her virtues shone all the brighter she was as fair as she was eloquent as mild as she was bountiful she became the princess of all the people whoever looked upon her loved her so the fame of griselda spread throughout the region of saluzzo and was then conveyed further abroad her virtues became known far and wide and from all parts of italy flocked men and women young and old to see her so walter the marquis had not married one of low degree at all he seemed to have married a noble woman and he was so fortunate in his union that he lived at peace with himself and all others he was highly regarded too he had proved that outward poverty may conceal virtue as well as grace so the people deemed him to be a prudent man a rare gift in one so favoured by fortune griseldas virtue was not confined to household tasks and duties far from it when the occasion demanded it she was able to nurture the common good and the welfare of the ordinary people she could resolve any argument appease any bitterness and heal any division she was the agent of peace and unity even when her husband was abroad on business she could conciliate enemies and rivals whether they were noble or otherwise her words were wise and succinct her judgements were models of equity it was said that she had been sent by heaven to save the world and to amend all wrongs then nine months after her marriage griselda bore a child everyone had secretly wished for a male child but in fact she gave birth to a daughter still the marquis was happy and the people rejoiced with him even though a daughter had come first there was every reason to believe that in time she would bear a son she was not barren after all part three then it happened it has happened many times before soon after the birth of his daughter walter decided to test his wife he wanted to see how constant and how steadfast she really was he could not resist the thought of tempting griselda he wanted to frighten her even though god knows there was no need he had put her to the test before and she had never disappointed him she was always loyal and always patient what was the point of tempting her again and again some men might say that the marquis was a subtle fellow but i say that it is evil to submit a wife to scrutiny without reason it simply causes needless grief and anxiety this is what the marquis did he came one night to her bedside with a serious face and a disturbed manner they were alone griselda do you remember that day when i lifted you out of poverty and placed you in an exalted rank you havent forgotten that i hope i hope you still recall the days when you lived with your father in that little cottage i hope your present glory has not made you forgetful you were in so wretched a position that you could scarcely have dreamed of your good fortune so listen to every word that i am about to tell you there is no one here but you and me you know well enough the circumstances that led you here less than a year ago although i am of course mild and loving towards you my noble courtiers are not so respectful they tell me that it is shameful and humiliating for them to serve one of such humble estate as yourself they do not wish to stoop so low ever since the birth of your daughter they have been complaining more and more she shares your blood after all my fervent will and wish is to live at peace with them i must listen to what they say and dispose of your daughter as i think best it is not what i would but what i must do god knows all this is distasteful to me but believe me i will do nothing without your knowledge you must assent to all of my decisions show me your patience and your constancy be faithful to your promise to me on our wedding day when she heard her husband she seemed to remain unmoved she showed no fear or alarm or anger she was calm and composed lord she said you must do as you please my daughter and i are your faithful servants we will obey your commands for better or for worse we are wholly yours do as you wish there is nothing in the world that will please me if it displeases you i desire nothing i dread nothing i fear only to lose you my husband this is the truth rooted in my heart it will remain there for ever and will never fade i will always be faithful to you the marquis was happy with her answer yet he pretended otherwise he looked at her gravely almost angrily and left the bedchamber a short while later he confided in one of his servants secretly told him what he intended and dispatched him as a messenger to his wife this servant was a secret agent or enforcer very useful in matters of state if there was any low or dishonest work to be done he was the man the marquis knew well enough that he loved and respected his master and would ask no questions he would obey orders so without delay he went quietly into griseldas chamber ma dame he said you must forgive me for coming here but i must do what my lord has demanded you know well enough that his commands cannot be averted or evaded they may cause grief and suffering i know but they cannot be challenged he is our master that is all there is to it he took a step towards her and he has ordered me to take this child he said no more he seized the infant girl and was about to carry her out of the room with such an expression on his face well it seemed that he would murder her on the spot griselda was forced to endure all and to be patient she was as meek and as quiet as a lamb she witnessed the actions of the servant without remonstrance or complaint the bad reputation of this man preceded him everywhere his appearance was threatening his words ominous even the hour of his arrival was suspicious griselda truly believed that her little daughter was about to be killed before her eyes but she did not cry out she did not weep she was obliged to fulfil the demands of her husband yet in the end she was moved to speak she pleaded with the servant as if he were a good and noble man to let her kiss her little girl before she died she cradled the child on her lap and caressed her she made the sign of the cross on her forehead and then kissed her again she began to murmur to her in a soft voice as if she were singing a lullaby farewell my little child i will never see you again but since i have made the sign of the blessed lord jesus who died for us on a wooden cross i trust that he will take your soul to paradise for my sake you will die tonight i do not think that any nurse could have endured so much pain and sorrow let alone a mother what woman would not have broken down in tears yet griselda stayed as firm and resolute as ever very quietly she said to the official here take back the child the little girl is yours as she gave the infant to him she told him to go and obey his masters orders there is just one thing i ask of you she said out of consideration to me and my child unless our lord absolutely forbids it i would ask you to bury her little body in a place where the carrion birds and wild beasts will not get at it he made no answer to her but left the chamber with the child in his arms he went back to the marquis and presented him with his daughter then he told him everything that griselda had done and said he went through every detail the marquis on hearing this was inclined to pity his wife nevertheless he decided to hold to his original purpose that is the way with lords they are always masterful he told his agent to convey the child to a secret place and to clothe her in the softest silks and linens then he was to find a little box or a shawl of linen in which to hide her then on pain of his life he ordered him to remain silent about all these things and to tell no one where he came from or where he was going he was in fact going to bologna where the marquiss sister was countess of the region having explained the whole reason for the journey he was to leave the little girl with the countess on the understanding that she would be properly brought up as a royal child the countess was under no circumstances to tell anyone the identity of the infant the servant obeyed his masters orders to the letter let us return now to the marquis himself walter was eager to discover if his wife had changed in any way he was alert to any alteration in her manner or her conversation but there was none she was as kind and as patient as ever she was as industrious and meek as she had always been ever ready to smile and obey she never said a word about her daughter there was no sign of sorrow or blame she would not so much as murmur her name in her dreams part four four years passed then thanks be to god griselda bore a male child a strong and handsome baby as soon as walter heard the news he was overjoyed the whole country celebrated the birth with bells and church services when the child was two years old and had finished with his wet nurse the marquis was tempted to test his wife once more there was no need for any of this but men can become ruthless when they are married to patient and pliable wives griselda was at walters mercy wife he said you have heard before that our marriage is unpopular with the people now that my son is born the complaints and recriminations have grown ever louder i am half dead with anxiety the protests are making me ill i can bear it no longer do you know what they are saying when i am gone i will be succeeded by an offspring of the peasant janiculus this lowborn wretch will be our lord that is what they whisper to one another i have to listen to their grievances griselda i cannot ignore them even if they never mention them in my presence what if they were to rebel against me i want to live at peace with my subjects as far as i am able so this is what i propose i propose to treat my son in the same way that i treated my daughter under the cover of night and secrecy i am telling you now so that you will not break out in passionate grief or anything of that kind i want you to be patient once again i have told you this before sir she said i will tell you again i will do whatever you wish or request if my son and daughter are killed well i will never grieve and never complain i accept your commandments as my lord and master i have had no part in my two children except sickness and pain and sorrow you are our lord you must do with us as you please there is no need to consult me when i left my home i did not just leave my old clothing behind me i left my will and my liberty too on that occasion i put on the clothes you chose for me in everything else your choice is my command do as you wish sir i will obey you if i knew in advance what you wanted i would hasten to perform it without even being told now i do know what you require of me and i will not hesitate if you ordered me to die in front of you i would do so gladly it would give me pleasure death is less powerful than my love for you the marquis listened to his wife with averted eyes he marvelled at her constancy and wondered how it was possible for her to bear all the suffering he inflicted he exulted inwardly but he remained dour and grave in countenance so the secret agent was dispatched once more to griseldas bedchamber where with even more brutality than before if such a thing is possible he snatched the pretty son as he had once snatched the daughter griselda was the model of forbearance she did not lament or cry out she kissed her little son and made the sign of the cross upon his forehead she made the same request too she begged the agent to lay her son in a deep grave of earth where the birds and beasts could not reach him he made no reply to her he did not care then with the child he rode on to bologna walter the marquis was more and more astonished by her endless patience if he had not seen for himself her great love for her children he would have thought that there was something wrong with her he would have accused her of malice or of coldness or of hypocrisy for bearing all this woe with an untroubled face but he knew well enough that griselda dearly loved her children next to himself of course and had always been tender towards them i would like to ask all women here whether he had not gone far enough in testing her what more could any husband devise to challenge her patience and her fortitude how cruel could he be but there are some people who will not be moved once they have devised a plan they must follow it to the end he was fettered to the stake of his intentions he was caught fast he had to continue torturing his wife to see if she would break so he watched and waited he wanted to see if griselda would change in any way but he saw no difference in her mood or manner she was as patient and as loving as before as the years passed she was more devoted to him if such a thing were possible and more attentive it was as if they were one person with one will and understanding they had their essence but in one if walter wished for anything she wished for it too so thanks be to god all seemed to be for the best she proved herself to be the model wife happy to accept her husbands authority yet there were now slanders spread abroad about walter it was widely rumoured that he was a wicked man who had secretly killed his two children for the crime of being born to a wife of lowly estate this was the opinion of the people who had no reason to think otherwise who had any other theory where were the children so the marquis was no longer the wellbeloved leader he was now hated by his people who does not detest and despise a murderer yet he did not relent he carried on with the cruel trial of his wife he had no other purpose in life when his daughter was twelve years old he sent a secret message to the papal court in rome he asked his representatives there to counterfeit a papal bull in which the pope gave him permission to remarry if he should so wish can you imagine such cruelty in the same edict the pope was supposed to state that the marquis had permission to divorce his first wife the pontiff had given him this dispensation in order to resolve any conflict or misunderstanding between the marquis and his subjects so the fake bull was widely published throughout saluzzo the ignorant people obviously believed the edict to be genuine who would not but when the news was brought to griselda she was bowed down with woe yet she remained calm this humble woman was determined to endure all the adversities of fortune she had resolved to follow her husbands will and pleasure in everything she had pledged her heart to him he was the centre of her being what more is there to say the marquis had meanwhile written a secret letter to bologna in which he explained his actions and his intentions he addressed it to the husband of his sister the earl of the region and asked this nobleman to bring the two children back to saluzzo in royal pomp and circumstance but he begged him not to reveal their true identity to anyone in the world he was supposed to say only that the young girl was espoused to the marquis that is of course walter himself so the earl performed the duty given to him by the marquis on the following morning he set out in grand procession to saluzzo with the lords of his court surrounding him the young girl rode out with him in great state and her younger brother rode beside her the girl herself was arrayed with pearls and other precious stones in preparation for her bridal day and the sevenyearold boy was dressed as finely as a prince he was a prince after all so with grandeur and ceremony they made their way slowly towards saluzzo part five the marquis there had abandoned none of his wicked ways he set out to test griselda yet again to find out if she was really still as patient and as devoted to him as before he wanted to push her to the limit of her endurance so at a public audience he addressed her in a stern voice it is true griselda he said that i married you for your virtue i took you for my wife because of your piety and your loyalty i certainly did not marry you for your lineage or your wealth far from it but i have discovered from experience that power and lordship can be forms of servitude i may not do what every humble ploughman may do i am not my own master my subjects beg me to choose another wife they will not be denied the pope himself has decreed that i can divorce you to restrain their anger and marry again there is not much more to say to you my new bride is already on her way here be strong let her usurp your place take back the dowry you brought with you i give you my permission what was it in any case return to your fathers cottage no man or woman can enjoy uninterrupted prosperity with tranquil heart i urge you to endure the blows of chance and fickle fortune griselda answered him in a clear calm voice my lord i know and i have always known that there is no comparison between your wealth and magnificence and my poverty there is no denying my low degree i never believed myself worthy of being your chambermaid let alone your wife i swear as god is my witness that i never deemed myself to be the mistress of your household or to be a lady worthy of such a lord i am your servant i always have been and i always will be i have no other aim in life than to please you god knows that you have treated me generously and nobly when i never deserved such consideration i thank you for your kindness to me now take it back renounce it i will return gladly to my father and live with him until the end of my life i grew up in that little cottage and am happy to remain there until my death i will be a widow in mind and heart and deed ever since that time i yielded my virginity to you i have been a true and faithful wife that is how i will remain i have been married to a prince among men god forbid that i should ever take another man as a husband i pray to god that your new wife brings you happiness and prosperity i willingly give up to her my place even though it was a source of bliss to me you were and are my lord since you desire me to leave i will leave whenever you wish you asked me about the dowry i brought with me i know well enough that all i possessed were rags and wretched scraps of clothes i do not think that i will be able to find them again good god when i think of your bounty to me on that day how you looked at me what you said to me i still marvel there is a saying that for me at least has proved to be true love grown old is not the same as new love but whatever happens to me sir even if it were death itself i will never repent of my love for you never in this world you know well enough lord that you took the poor clothes off my back and decked me in finery i brought nothing to you but faith and modesty and maidenhead i will give you back all of the rich clothing you presented to me i will return my wedding ring you will find the rest of the jewellery in my bedchamber safely stored i came naked out of my fathers house and naked i will return i will follow your orders in everything but may i ask you this sir is it your intention that i should actually leave your palace without clothes it would be a great dishonour to you and to me if the belly in which your children lay was paraded before the people let me not go as naked as a worm upon its way remember sir that unworthy though i be i was still once your wife so in requital for the virginity i gave you and which can never be restored to me i plead with you to let me have as my reward a simple smock just like the smock i used to wear before i met you i would then be able to cover up the womb of the woman who was once your wife now i will bid farewell to you sir in case i have angered you keep the smock you are wearing now he said to her take it back with you that was all he said he could say no more overwhelmed by sorrow and by pity he went on his way so griselda removed her other garments in front of the whole court and then returned to her fathers cottage in the simple smock she walked back with bare head and with bare feet accompanied by many people bewailing her fate and cursing the misadventures of fortune but griselda did not cry she never shed a tear and she never said a word her father on the other hand wept and cursed when he heard the news he did not want to live a day longer in fact the poor old man had always harboured doubts about the marriage he had always suspected that the marquis would get rid of his daughter as soon as he had had enough of her he believed that the lord would regret having wed a poor woman and would banish her from his court so he hastened out of doors to meet griselda alerted by the noise of the crowd and covered her smock with an old coat that he had brought with him he was weeping yet the coat did not fit her it was old and coarse and out of date she was not the same slim young girl she had been at the time of her marriage so for a while griselda dwelled with her father she was still a model of loyalty and patience never complaining never explaining never lamenting she did not show to her father or to anyone else any grief at her treatment she did not mention her previous life as the wife of a great lord she said nothing she looked content what else would you expect even when she lived in great state she had always retained her deep humility she had never been greedy or selfindulgent she had never enjoyed pomp and circumstance she had always been as modest and as kind as any young nun except that she had a husband whom she honoured above all others who could have been meeker or more obedient the patience and humility of job are well known male clerks are all too ready to honour the achievements of other men they rarely mention women but in truth women are far more faithful and patient than any man women are kinder women are more trustworthy then and now if someone has a different opinion i will be astonished part six so the earl made his way from bologna as i have already described with the two children of griselda and walter the news of their arrival was soon spread abroad it was rumoured that the earl was bringing with him the new wife of the marquis and was surrounding her with more pomp and dignity than had ever before been seen in italy the marquis who had himself arranged all this sent a message to griselda before the arrival of the earl and his train he ordered her to come to court and of course she obeyed him she arrived in her humble clothes with no thought of herself ready to fulfil whatever commands he gave her she went down on her knees in his presence and reverently greeted him griselda he said i have determined that the young maiden the young girl who is about to become my bride must be received with as much ceremony as possible it must be a royal occasion all my courtiers and servants will be consigned to a place according to their rank and in their proper role they will serve the new princess in every way i deem to be fit it is true however that i do not have enough women to adorn and decorate the chambers in the luxury i desire that is why i have called for you you know how to spruce up the palace you know my mind you do not look very appealing i admit but the least you can do is your duty i will obey your command gladly my lord griselda replied i long to be of service to you i will do my best to please you in everything without demur whatever happens good or ill i will never stop loving you with all my heart then she began to decorate the palace setting the tables and making up the beds for the honoured guests she did everything she could and encouraged the chambermaids to finish their work as soon as possible they were to sweep and to dust and to clean while she busied herself about decorating the banqueting hall and the private chambers at about nine in the morning the earl and his charges finally arrived at the palace the people ran over to see the two children and to marvel at the richness of their retinue and their apparel then for the first time they said among themselves that walter was no fool after all and that he had chosen his second wife well the young girl was much prettier than griselda according to common opinion and a much better age for childbearing she and the marquis would have good progeny especially since this young girl was unlike griselda of proper lineage the people also marvelled at the beauty of the young boy beside her seeing sister and brother together they all praised the marquis for his judgement oh fickle people people of the wind unsteady and unfaithful you are as ever changing as a weathervane you delight only in novelty you wax and wane as does the moon you gape and chatter much to your own cost your opinions are worthless and your behaviour proves that you are never to be trusted only a fool would believe anything you say the more thoughtful knew this to be true even as they watched the others running up and down and gawping at the fine dresses the silly folk were so pleased with the novelty of this new maiden that they could speak and think about nothing else well enough of this i will turn now to griselda and see how she is coping with the situation she was as busy as ever she was doing what was expected of her by walter and attending to all the details of the great feast she did not care at all about the tattered state of her own clothing but with cheerful spirit she hurried with the others towards the great gate where she could see the young bride advancing then she went back to work she greeted all the guests of the marquis with due deference and propriety no one could fault her in anything and in fact she behaved with such decorum that everyone wondered who she might be who was this woman dressed so unbecomingly who was yet the soul of tact and cheerfulness all of them commended her in the meantime griselda praised the young brother and sister with such warmth and affection that no one could have equalled it the time came when the whole company was about to sit down at the feast at that moment as she was supervising the preparations the marquis called out to her griselda he said to her playfully how do you like my new wife isnt she a beauty she is indeed my lord i have never seen a lovelier woman in my life god send her good fortune and i hope he will send both of you peace and prosperity until the end of your lives i will say one thing however if i may i would beg you not to test and torment this poor girl as you once tested me she has been brought up more tenderly she is more delicate than me i believe she could not endure adversity in the same way as a girl born and brought up in poverty you know who i mean when walter looked upon her cheerful face when he saw that there was no malice in her heart towards him he recalled the number of times he had grievously offended her she was still as steady and as constant as a stone wall so he began to take pity on her yes pity for her loyalty to him enough he said you have suffered enough griselda fear no more all things shall be well i have tested your faith and kindness to the utmost i have tested you in wealth and in poverty no other woman in the world could have endured so much now i know dear wife the full measure of your truth and constancy with that he took her in his arms and kissed her she was so amazed that she did not know what was happening to her she did not understand a word he said to her it was as if she were walking in her sleep then suddenly she was wide awake griselda he said i swear to god you have always been my true and faithful wife i will have no other as long as i live this is your daughter you believed her to be my new bride but you yourself gave birth to her this young man is your son one day he will be my heir they have been brought up secretly in bologna by my orders take them back again you will never be able to say that you have lost your children i know that the people think the worst of me but i swear that i did not test you out of anger or out of cruelty i merely wished to assay your patience and your womanly fidelity i did not kill my children god forbid i merely wanted to keep them out of the way while i watched over you when griselda heard this she almost fainted for joy then she called her two young children to her and embraced them she wept as she kissed them her tears falling upon their cheeks and upon their hair all those around her were crying too as she spoke softly to her son and daughter i give thanks to god she said for saving my dear children i give thanks to my lord and master too if i were to die now i would know at least that i have found favour in your eyes now that i am restored to grace i do not fear death i do not fear anything oh my dear children my little ones your poor mother imagined that you were buried beneath the ground she really believed that rats or dogs had eaten your bodies but god has saved you and your father has kept you safe then she fainted upon the ground she had embraced her children so tightly in fact that it was difficult to prise them from their mothers loving arms all those around her were still crying of course they could not bear to see her in her extremity of joy and bewilderment walter kneeled beside her and tried to soothe her after a while she stood up a little disconcerted and everyone cheered her and encouraged her until eventually she recovered her composure walter was the very soul of comfort and concern really it was a delight to see them both together once again when the ladies of the court saw their opportunity they led griselda to her old chamber there they removed her threadbare clothes and dressed her in a gown made of cloth of gold they put a crown of many jewels upon her head before leading her into the principal hall where the newly restored wife and mother was greeted with acclamation so this unhappy day had a happy ending every man and woman danced and feasted as well they might until the stars lit up the heavens with their blissful light there was more joy and more revelry more expense too than the celebrations of the bridal day so many years before so for many years griselda and walter lived together in love and happiness their daughter was married to one of the richest and most noble lords in all of italy the marquis took good care of griseldas father too who spent the rest of his days at ease in the palace griseldas son on the death of his father took over the rule of saluzzo he married well and happily but he never put his wife to any test it is said by some that this world is not so strong as it was in old times i dont know about that but listen to what our noble author petrarch had to say in conclusion to his tale i have not told this story to counsel wives into submission they could not and should not copy the patience of griselda the real lesson is more simple every man and woman should like her try to be steadfast in adversity that is enough and that is why petrarch chose to narrate the story of griselda in his most noble prose if a woman can be so submissive to a man then how much more should we show our obedience to god himself he has every reason to test us all he created us but in his epistle saint james tells us that god will never tempt us beyond our strength it is true that he tempts us every day he disciplines us with seasons of adversity since in misfortune we can exercise our virtue he knows all our frailties of course and does not need to probe them further he does everything for our own good so be patient be of good cheer i will say one more thing to you lords and ladies of the pilgrimage it would be almost impossible to find another griselda in modern england if you put a wife or mother to the test you would find more brass than gold a woman nowadays is like a bad coin she will break rather than bend naturally i have nothing against the wife of bath may god give her and those like her a good life long may she rule over us griselda is dead and lies buried somewhere in the land of italy her patience was in the end rewarded but i beg you all you husbands never to test your wives as walter tested her your efforts will not work you will fail all you noble wives take heed never let humility nail down your tongue do not allow some other writer to tell your story as petrarch recounted that of kind and patient griselda do you remember the story of chichevache who could feed only on humble housewives that was why he was so lean please do not be fodder for his stomach you should follow the example of echo who always had an answer ready dont be naive dont be beaten down fight back keep the lesson of griselda firmly in your mind you can do nothing but profit from it oh you mighty wives defend yourselves you can be as strong as elephants i am sure of it dont allow men to get the better of you those of you who are not so mighty well i am sure you can still be fierce you can rattle on and on just like a windmill in a gale have no fear of your husband even if he were clothed in full armour the arrows of your eloquence would get through the chainmail make him jealous or better still accuse him of something then he will be as still and frightened as a little bird if you are goodlooking make use of it show off your features and your dress if you are ugly spend your money freely and make friends with everyone get them on your side be as light and playful as a leaf upon a linden tree let your husband do the wailing and lamenting that is all i have to say heere endeth the tale of the clerk of oxenford the merchants prologue the prologe of the marchantes tale i know all about wailing and lamenting said the merchant i am acquainted with grief many married men can tell the same story i am sure of it i have learned by experience i have the worst wife in the world you see if she were married to the devil she would get the better of him i wont bore you with all the details of her malice suffice to say that she is a complete bitch there could not be a greater difference between her cruelty and the patience of griselda if i were free again i would never fall into the same trap a burned husband fears the fire you know i am telling the truth it may not be the case for all husbands god forbid but it is true of the majority i have been married only for two months i admit but i have been tormented every day by my wife no bachelor could possibly understand the pain i have endured even if he were knifed or whipped he would not suffer half as much as i have done she is a wicked woman harry bailey clapped him on the back well sir merchant he said since you are such an expert on the woes of marriage tell us all about them willingly sir but i will say no more about my own plight i am too depressed about it and heaving a sigh he began his story the merchants tale heere bigynneth the marchantes tale once upon a time there dwelled in lombardy a worthy knight he lived in pavia where he was prosperous and well respected he had in fact been a bachelor for sixty years but he enjoyed himself with any number of women he was highly sexed i believe as are many unmarried men his name was january when he had just passed his sixtieth year he either went mad or he repented of his sinfulness he decided to get married in other words he went around looking for a likely wife beseeching the lord god all the time that he might for once experience the bliss that lies in married life i am not making this up he was determined to live under that holy bond that gracious union that blessed state in which god determined that the first man and woman should dwell no other life he announced is worth anything wedlock is so pure wedlock is so easy wedlock is paradise on earth so said this wise and worthy knight he may have had a point especially when the husband is old and infirm then a young wife is a regular treasure she is a fruit to be plucked he can enjoy her youth and at the same time engender an heir he can have a good time while an old bachelor can only moan and groan confirmed bachelors always suffer for their calling they are building on shifting ground they think they have found stability but it falls apart in their hands they live like animals without care or restraint married men on the other hand are happy and secure in the blissful state of matrimony they have everything they could possibly need who could be so obedient as a wife who could be more true who could be more attentive in sickness or in health a wife will never leave her husband she will never tire of caring for him even if he became bedridden and close to death especially not then of course yet there are some wise men who beg to disagree with this take theophrastus for example who wrote the golden book on marriage marriage was not golden for him but i suspect him of lying do not take a wife he said for the sake of household economy it is a false saving a good servant will spare you expense and will also look after you better than any wife a wife will always demand her half share in everything if you are sick you will be happier in the hands of your friends or even of a servingboy your wife as always will be thinking of your goods and chattels i will tell you something else if you marry you are sure to be cuckolded a woman is unfaithful by nature no no theophrastus may god curse you for these words you are telling nothing but lies and more lies pay no attention to him listen to me instead a wife is a gift from god all other gifts are as nothing think of them lands rents pastures household goods they are the gifts of fortune mutable and transitory they are shadows on the wall but be sure of this a wife is for life a wife can last a long time longer perhaps than you might like that is why i hold marriage to be a great sacrament he who is wifeless is cursed he is helpless he is desolate i am not talking about monks or friars of course let me tell you this too women are born to be the servants of men they are born to help us out when god had made adam and saw him lying in the grass alone and naked he took pity on him in his goodness he thought to himself let us now make a companion for this poor man who resembles him that is the thing to do and he wrought eve so you see i have proved my point a wife is a husbands comfort she is his earthly paradise she is his honey she is so virtuous and obedient that the two of them are bound to live in harmony they are one flesh so of course they have one heart between them both in sickness and in health a wife good god how can a man suffer when he has a wife beside him i cannot say there is no way of describing or picturing the bliss between them if he is poor she will help him in his labours she keeps house for him and wastes nothing she approves of everything her husband does she will never say no when he says yes do this he says of course sir she replies that is the way it is oh happy sacrament of matrimony you are so cordial so delightful so well loved and so well respected any man worth his salt will go down on his bended knees and thank god for the day he was married or else he will pray to god to send him a wife as quickly as possible oh god he says send me a woman to last me all my life then i will be content he will not be wrong in that i can tell you especially if he heeds his wifes advice then he will be able to hold up his head women are so truthful and so wise as i am sure you all know that men are duty bound to follow their commandments do you remember how jacob took the advice of rebecca his mother told him to wear the skin of a goat around his shoulders to trick his father and win his blessing and do you remember the story of judith who slew holofernes and thus saved the people of god and then there was abigail who by her good counsel saved her husband nabal when he was about to be slain by king david what about esther she saved the people of god from a life of lamentation she persuaded her husband ahasuerus to advance the cause of mordechai you can look up the stories in the bible if you dont believe me seneca that wise man tells us there is nothing more pleasing than a humble wife suffer your wife to speak as cato tells us and fulfil her commands of course if you are lucky she may even obey you on occasions thats only being polite a wife must be the keeper of your worldly goods who is going to look after you when you are sick take my advice love your wife in the manner that jesus christ loves the holy church if you love yourself you must also love your wife no man is an enemy of his own flesh i am sure he protects it you must cherish your wife in the same way or you will never thrive whatever people say and joke that was no lady that was my wife husband and wife are on the highway to happiness they are bound so closely together that no harm can come to them the wife in particular gets off lightly i will now return to my worthy knight named january he had been considering all the matters i have put before you the encroaching years the physical bliss of marriage the quiet and order of a settled home the honey pot of a fair wife revolving these matters in his mind he called together a group of his good friends in order to announce his decision and with grave face he addressed them thus i am growing old dear comrades i am getting closer and closer to the brink of the grave i must think about the life to come i have stupidly wasted my strength in pursuit of all sorts of folly as god is my judge i am going to change i have decided to marry as quickly as possible i need your help in finding a pretty young girl i need a bride now i dont think i can wait much longer for my part i will look up and down the town but you all must keep your eyes open too you must help me find a suitable wife there is one thing i must tell you though i will not stomach an old bride she must be below the age of twenty i enjoy my fish but not my flesh mature i like fresh meat a pike is better than a pickerel but a frisky calf is better than an old cow i dont want or need a woman of thirty women of that age are nothing but bales of straw they are beanbags as for those old widows god forbid i should come near any of them they are nothing but trouble and strife they are more wily than any scholar they have been to the school of life where they learned all the lessons no give me a young thing i will be able to mould her in my hands like a piece of warm wax so there we are friends throw out the old and bring in the new if i should by any chance be unlucky in love and suffer an unhappy marriage why i would take up adultery for a living and go to the devil after my death i would certainly never father any children on an old misery i would rather be eaten by dogs than allow my inheritance to pass into strange hands i am not kidding i know all the reasons for marriage although i suspect that there are many people who talk about it who havent the faintest idea so i will tell you this if a man cannot live chastely then he must marry if a man wants to have children by lawful procreation then he should take a wife a mistress or a lover is not the same thing that is mere lechery in the eyes of god and has nothing to do with the obligations of the marital bed husband and wife can also live together in perfect innocence of course just like brother and sister i dont think that is the way for me i can say thank god that all my limbs are in good working order i can do the job of a man i know where my strength lies i may seem aged but i am like an old tree that still brings forth its leaves i can feel my buds begin to swell my blossoms will soon be poking out i am not dried up or dead as yet the only hoar frost is sprinkled on my head in every other place i am as green and fresh as a laurel year in and year out well enough now that you have heard my proposal let me know what you think the company all had different opinions and different questions some of them praised marriage others criticized it they all had stories and examples to confirm their points of view they argued all of that day in a goodhumoured fashion but in the end the main argument was between two of his closest friends one of them was named placebo a pleasing sort of fellow and the other was known as justinus or the just one this was placebos point oh january dear friend you really have no need to ask any of us for our opinions you are wise enough to know that it is best to follow the judgement of solomon in this matter do you remember what he said work out what is the best advice then follow it you will not regret it that was the sum of his wisdom i believe and i agree with every word of it except on this occasion dear brother weighing one thing with another i am inclined to believe that you should follow your instinct consult your heart my friend let me tell you something i have been a courtier all my life god knows i am unworthy of the honour but i have been privileged to serve some of the greatest lords of our land never once have i argued with them i have never contradicted them i knew well enough that they had more judgement than i could possibly claim i agree with every word they say i say the same in fact or something very similar a courtier would be a great fool if he dared to presume that he had more wit than his lordship he must not even think it no our lords are not idiots i will say that for them this is my point dear january you have shown such eloquence and wisdom here today that i fully agree with everything you say i would not change one word there is not a man in all of italy who could have spoken more nobly christ himself would concur it is truly a courageous act for a man of your years to take on a young wife it is bold it is magnanimous you are a good creature so this is my opinion do whatever you think is best i am sure that will be the right course justinus had been sitting quietly listening to placebo dear friend he said to january be patient with me i have heard everything that has been said i will add a few words of my own seneca has told us that a man must be careful and think twice before giving away his lands or his cattle since it is important to be sure about the recipient of your worldly goods surely there is even more reason to scrutinize the person to whom you are giving away your body you will never get it back marriage is not childs play you should never take a wife without very careful thought you have to ask questions you have to find out whether she is prudent or wasteful you must know whether she is sober or a drunk you do not want to marry a scold do you or a manchaser or a bitch it is important to discover too whether she is rich or poor dont tie yourself down with a shrew in other words now i know that it will be impossible in this fallen world to find a woman who is perfect in every way i give you that still you really ought to find out whether your wifetobe has more good qualities than bad qualities this will take time but it is important i should know i have wept plentifully and often since i took a wife praise the married life all you like but i personally have found it to be full of cost and care of duties rather than pleasures god knows that all my neighbours especially the females congratulate me on my choice of wife they say that she is considerate and steady in the extreme yet i know where the shoe pinches i know where it hurts of course january you must do as you please but take my advice you are a man of a certain age think very carefully before you take on a young and pretty wife by him who made heaven and earth the youngest man among us would have trouble keeping on top of such a woman restraining her i mean trust me within three years she will be sick of you you know what a wife needs dont you do you think you have the strength to fulfil all her desires a wife asks for a lot you know i just hope that you are not riding for a fall well january replied is that all you have to say i dont give a fuck for seneca or for your own grave words and as for your warnings well i dismiss them they are a crock of shit wiser men than you as you have heard take quite a different view of my proposal what do you say placebo i say dear sir that it is a serious matter it is almost profane to raise any impediment to holy matrimony with that the whole company rose to their feet they agreed one and all that january should be married when and where he wished as for the bride well that was up to him and the bride was on his mind he thought about her all the time he had fantasies about her many beautiful bodies and many pretty faces went through his mind as he lay in bed at night if you took a brightly polished mirror and placed it in the middle of a fair or a market you would be bound to see the images of many people passing to and fro januarys imagination was the same it was a mirror in which were reflected the shapes of all the prettiest young girls in his district he was not sure which one to choose as yet one had a beautiful face while another had a good reputation for modesty and obedience one came from a rich family but had a bad character nevertheless after much thought he fixed on one above all others half in earnest and half in game he dismissed thoughts of all the rest without consulting anyone else he made his decision love is blind after all when he got into bed every night he imagined her in every state and every position he gloated on her perfect body and on her youthfulness he pictured her narrow waist her long legs and her slender arms oh of course he also reflected on her wifely virtues on her modesty and her tenderness her womanly bearing and her seriousness when he had decided then he believed that he could not have made a better choice nothing and no one could have changed his mind if anyone had been so brave as to try to do so he would have dismissed him as a fool he was living in a fantasy world once more he sent a message to all of his friends asking them to assemble in his house as soon as possible he would not detain them long he said and in any case he would spare them the labour of looking out for a young girl to be his mate he had made his choice he would not change his mind placebo arrived first of course but he was soon followed by the others january greeted them all and then asked a favour of them they would please not argue with him he had made his decision it would simply be foolish to oppose it all his happiness depended on the choice he had made he told them that there was a young girl in the town who was renowned for her good looks she was of relatively humble stock but her youth and beauty compensated for that he said that he had determined to marry her and to lead the rest of his life in perfect bliss and holiness he would own all of her and no one else would ever get a part of her so he asked his friends to assist him in this enterprise and help him to succeed in securing his prize his soul would then be at ease there will he said be nothing to mar my happiness but i do have one thing on my conscience let me explain many years ago i heard that no man can enjoy the two kinds of bliss the bliss of earth and the bliss of heaven he can have one or the other he cannot have both i may not commit any of the seven deadly sins i may not commit any of the little ones but this is the trouble i am about to get married to the perfect wife with whom i will live in the utmost felicity all will be calm all will be sweet so i will have heaven on earth do you see the problem we are always taught that heaven itself is the reward of pain and purgation of penance and tribulation how can i living in comfort and joy attain my eternal reward i am not alone of course all husbands live in comfort with their wives or so i believe but give me your honest opinion on my problem justinus despising januarys total stupidity responded straight away with a joke he did not bother to quote authorities he would give him a short answer there is no obstacle on your path to heaven god by some miracle will come to your aid he will ensure that before you are carried to the grave you will have cause to repent your marriage you say there is no woe or strife in marriage by divine intervention he will prove you wrong did you not know that husbands always have more cause for repentance than single men this is the best advice i can give you wait and see do not despair of heaven it may turn out that your wife will be your purgatory she may be gods instrument his whip to scourge you then your soul will skip up to heaven faster than an arrow leaves a bow i hope to god for your own sake then that you discover there is no great happiness to be found in marriage there is nothing so pleasurable about it that will keep you from salvation you still have to be moderate in all things of course you must never fulfil all of your wifes desires if you know what i mean do not be too amorous with her and keep yourself free from other sins then you will reach heavens gate that is the only advice i can give to you my cupboard is bare as they say dont look so surprised dear brother shall we forget we ever mentioned the subject you have already heard the wife of bath discourse on the perils of marriage the wife of bath she made a lot of sense didnt she well enough god keep you and with that justinus and placebo took their leave of january they knew that there was no alternative so by secret negotiation and treaty they arranged that their friend should marry the young girl whom he admired as quickly as possible her name by the way was may it would be too long a story to tell you of the marital arrangements of the lands put in mays name of the costly garments promised to her the day came may and january proceeded to the church in great array where they received the holy sacrament of marriage the priest came out before the altar with the stole around his neck and enjoined may to follow the example of sarah and rebecca they were wise and faithful wives then he said a few prayers made the sign of the cross over the couple asked god to bless them and performed every other holy rite he could think of so they were joined with great solemnity the pair of them sat at the feast on the top table with all the other noble guests the house was filled with festival and music with feasting and drinking the like of which had never before been seen in italy the instruments were of such fineness and delicacy that they rivalled the harp of orpheus and the golden lyre of amphion as every course was brought out the minstrels sounded their trumpets making more clangour than joab ever heard at mount zion or theodomas at the siege of thebes bacchus himself might have been pouring out the wine and was that venus laughing and smiling upon all the company yes it was january had become her devoted servant after all he was about to be tested in marriage as once he had been in his bachelor state so the goddess with a firebrand in each hand danced before the bride and groom i can tell you this much the god of marriage hymen never saw a more cheerful bridegroom than january say no more martianus capella you have written of the splendid marriage between philology and mercury and extolled the songs the muses sung for them but your pen is too short your tongue too small to begin the description of the wedding day of january and may this was the day when tender youth married halting age do you have enough ink for your quill this cannot be told the fun of it would not be believed find out for yourself then tell me whether i am lying or not it was a delight to look at the young bride may dressed in all her finery she looked like a fairy queen queen esther who caught the eye of that persian king never looked half so lovely i cannot explain her beauty words fail me suffice it to say that she lived up to her name she was as fresh and lovely as a spring morning old january was ravished by her every time he looked at her he went into a trance in his imagination of course he was contemplating their first night he would hold her in his arms more tightly than paris held helen yet he also felt sorry for her she was going to be his victim that very night and he might have to hurt her alas he said to himself you are such a tender creature i hope god gives you the strength to bear up under me i am on heat to put it mildly i am worried that i will be too much for you to handle god forbid that i should injure you in any way do you know what i wish i wish the night had come i wish the night would last for ever and finally i wish all these people would go away he did everything he could by subtle means to persuade the guests to finish quickly he was after all an honourable man eventually the time came for them all to rise from the table the men began to dance and to drink deeply while the women scattered spices about the house everyone was happy everyone that is except for a certain squire called damian he carved januarys meat for him every day but now he had an eye on tastier fare he was so ravished at the sight of may that he thought he would go out of his mind do you recall venus dancing with a firebrand in each hand she put one of those brands within damians heart he could hardly stand he was about to faint so he retired to his bed as quickly as he could there we will leave him to his tears and laments until such time as may will have pity on him oh perilous fire that smoulders in the bedding the enemy in the household is the most dangerous of all the traitorous servant is like an adder clasped to the bosom he is treacherous and sly god keep him away from all good men oh january be careful you are lost in pleasure now but keep an eye on damian your own squire your man intends to do you harm i hope to god that you catch him in time there is no worse plague in the world than a dishonest and treacherous servant the sun had traced its arc of gold across the sky and could not linger on the horizon of that day the night had fallen and darkness spread over the earth the merry guests left the marriage feast giving thanks to january and rode homewards in cheerful mood were they going straight to bed i dont know i do know however what january wanted to do bed was the only thing on his mind he was not going to wait any longer so he prepared himself a hot punch of spice and sweetened wine as an aphrodisiac he also took some herbs and simples recommended by the disgraceful monk constantinus africanus who wrote that book on fucking he tried every single ointment and concoction then he turned to the close friends who were still in the house telling them to leave quickly and quietly for the love of god they did as they were told they drank up and then they drew the curtains the priest blessed the bed and may was brought to it she was as still and silent as any stone everyone filed out of the bedchamber leaving bride and bridegroom there alone january grabbed may as soon as they were gone she was his spring his paradise his wife he petted her and clawed her kissing her on the cheek and lips his bristle was as tough as the skin of an old dogfish his face was like a bed of briars and he rubbed it all over her tender flesh then he started crooning to her oh dear oh dear i must trespass upon you my sweetheart and perhaps offend you i may hurt you before i have finished with you but consider this my duckling no labourer worth his hire can work hastily it has to be done slowly and surely it doesnt matter how long we play together we are both coupled in holy matrimony so we can take all the time we want we have been blessed by the priest nothing we do will be considered sinful a man cannot cut himself with his own knife the law gives us permission to have some fun so he fell upon her thrusting and heaving all that night he climbed off her eventually and refreshed himself with some bread soaked in fine red wine then he sat up in bed and began to sing loudly and clearly he leered at her and licked his lips he was as frisky as a colt as wanton as a monkey when he started singing the slack skin about his neck began to shake his voice gave out and he started croaking god knows what may thought of all this she stared at him as he sat there in his nightshirt and nightcap with his scrawny neck and bony face she did not praise his performance thats for sure i will take a rest now he said to her its already daylight i need to sleep then he laid his head upon the pillow and fell into a sound slumber when he woke up at nine oclock he sprang out of bed may however stayed in the bedchamber for four days the labourer needs rest you see otherwise he or she will not be able to survive this is true of every creature under the sun fish or bird beast or man now i will turn back to woeful damian who is languishing for love of may this is what i should tell him oh foolish boy you silly thing damian answer me this one question how are you going to explain your plight to may she will just turn you away if you tell her how much you love her she will simply betray you to her husband god help you i can say no more so damian is bathed in the fire of venus lost and helpless with desire ready even to put his life at risk he could stand it no longer he borrowed a pen and then wrote a letter in which he revealed all his sorrow he wrote it in verse a poetical complaint addressed to his fresh and lovely may a lay is a lay in any language he placed the manuscript in a little silk purse that he hung around his neck close to his heart from the time of the wedding day the moon had glided from the sign of taurus into cancer that is how long may resided in her bedchamber it was the custom of new brides they must not eat in hall until three or four days have passed after that time she can sit at the feast on the fourth day therefore january and may attended high mass before proceeding to dinner in the hall she was as bright and lovely as a summers day then the sight of the meat prompted her good husband to think of damian mother of god he exclaimed why isnt damian here to wait on me is he sick or something what has happened the other squires explained to him that damian had indeed been taken ill and could not perform his duties only sickness would keep him away from the table i am sorry for it january replied damian is a good and loyal servant it would be a great pity if he were to die he is as intelligent and as discreet as any young man of his rank he has always been attentive and eager to please after dinner my wife and i will visit him in his chamber to see if we can offer him any comfort all the company blessed him for that out of sheer kindness this good knight was willing to visit his sick squire it was very gracious of him dearest wife january said listen to me after we have finished the meal i would like you and your women to attend to damian try to cheer him up he is a good boy tell him that i intend to visit him too after i have had a nap dont be gone too long dear i will not be content until you are back with me and lying by my side then he called over one of the other squires his master of ceremonies and discussed some matters of business with him so may accompanied by all her women proceeded to the chamber of damian she sat down by the side of his bed and comforted him as best she could then the young squire as soon as he saw his opportunity secretly put in her hand the little silk purse in which he had placed his lay of love he sighed deeply as he did so and then whispered to her have mercy on me lady tell no one about this if i am discovered i am as good as dead so may hid the purse in her bosom and went on her way i shall say no more she came back to her husband who was already in bed he clasped her in his arms and kissed her then he laid himself down to sleep may excused herself saying that she had to visit the youknowwhat where everyone has to go she took out damians verses and read them in the toilet then she tore the paper into pieces and flushed them down the loo may now had a lot to think about she lay down beside january who was fast asleep until he woke himself up with a coughing fit as soon as he opened his eyes he asked her to strip naked he told her that her clothes got in his way whether she liked it or not she was forced to obey her husband i will not go into any more details for fear of offending the more fastidious among you let me just add that he took his pleasure of her whether this was heaven or hell for her i cannot say they were at their business until the time of evensong when they rose from their bed i do not know whether it was chance or destiny i am not sure if it was the work of grace or the work of nature but it happened that at this time the pattern of the constellations worked in favour of lovers this was the moment to submit a petition a billetdoux to venus the scholars tell us that all things have their season this was the season for young women to find who knows what god alone knows all the causes within human affairs i can tell you nothing about them i do know this however may had taken such a liking to damian that she could not stop thinking about him his image was lodged in her heart i dont care what anyone thinks about me she said i love him i love him more than anyone else in the world if he had only his shirt to his name i would still love him do you see how pity soon suffuses a gentle heart you may perhaps now understand how generosity of spirit comes naturally to women consideration makes them bountiful of course certain women are as hard as adamant they would rather starve a man to death than show him favour they would not consider themselves murderers oh no they would congratulate themselves on their cruel virtue not so for may she was full of pity for damian she wrote him a letter in which she pledged to him her heart all they needed to find was the time and place then she would be happy to satisfy all of his desires could he come up with a plan this was the gist of her message when she found the opportunity she went to damians chamber and surreptitiously slipped her note beneath his pillow would he find it she squeezed his hand without anyone else seeing and begged him to get well soon then she returned to her husband who was calling out for her up rises damian on the following morning he had forgotten all about his sickness and his sorrow there was a spring in his step he combed his hair cleaned himself and brushed down his clothes he did everything to please a certain lady then he presented himself to january as humbly as a dog trained to hunt he was so pleasant to everyone in fact that the household was full of praise for him craft is easy for those who are crafty above all else he stood high in the favour of may so i will leave damian going about his business and carry on with my story some wise men suggest that human happiness is to be found in the pursuit of pleasure certainly the noble january was of this opinion he looked for pleasure all the time in the most virtuous possible way of course he was an honest knight after all so his house and all his other fine goods were as fitting for his rank as are a kings among his treasured belongings was a delicious garden walled all around with stone i cannot begin to describe the beauty of it there was nothing like it the author of the romance of the rose could not do justice to it the god of gardens priapus himself would not be equal to the task of depicting the fairness of this place there was a refreshing well for example under a laurel tree that was always green it was said that pluto and proserpina with their fairy band sang and danced about that well it was filled with music not with water the noble knight took such pleasure in walking through these green arbours that he never allowed anyone else to enter the garden he was the only one who held the key it was a small silver latchkey that unlocked a wicketgate so he came and went as he pleased in the summer he took his young wife with him and there he had his way with her he frisked and frolicked whatever he had not done in bed he did on the grass he did it whatever it was as often as he could what fun can you imagine the happiness of january and of may but wait worldly joy may not always endure for january or for any other human being oh sudden chance oh unstable fortune you are as treacherous as the scorpion who creeps towards his unsuspecting victim with a hidden sting its tail means death by sudden poisoning oh brittle happiness oh sweet and cunning poison oh fortune let me cry out against you one more time you are a monster who can paint your blessings with all the bright colours under the sun as if they were to last for ever but you are false to young and old rich and poor how could you deceive that honest and noble man january who placed such trust in you fie on you what did you mean by taking away his sight yes that is what happened amidst all his joy and prosperity january was suddenly struck blind he wept and wailed he wanted to die and then another thing crossed his mind he became inflamed with jealousy he could no longer keep an eye now gone on young may what if she were able to fool him he was so heartbroken so dejected that he would willingly have paid someone to murder him and his wife he hated the thought of her being the mistress of another man or even the wife of someone else he wanted her after his death to be clothed in perpetual black he wanted her to be as solitary and sorrowful as the turtledove that has lost its mate after a month or two however he began to settle down he became less miserable he learned to adjust to his misfortune what cannot be cured must be endured but his jealousy had not abated it burned as fiercely as ever he had become so suspicious of his wife that he would not allow her to go anywhere without him she could not go out for a ride she could not visit friends he even insisted that she stayed with him in the house so may often wept she loved damian so truly that she believed she would die if she could not hold him in her arms she believed that her heart would break damian himself became the most sorrowful man that ever lived he could not utter a word to may night or day if he had said anything to the purpose january was bound to hear him he never left her alone his old hand was always upon her nevertheless they passed messages and made certain private and silent signs so that one knew the mind and intentions of the other oh january what good would it do you if you could see as far as the bounds of the ocean what difference does it make to be blind and tricked or to have sight and be tricked argus had a hundred eyes looking into every corner yet he was deceived god knows how many other husbands have been fooled into thinking their wives are chaste my position is simple what you dont know cant hurt you let us return to fresh and lovely may she had taken some warm wax and made an impression of the little silver key to the garden that january always held she gave it quietly to damian who then made a copy of it i will not anticipate events but listen to my story and you will hear a wonder concerning this garden and its wicketgate ovid my master you know the truth of human life you have said that there is no subtlety no deception that lovers will not pursue for the sake of their passion nothing is too arduous nothing is too complicated for them there was the case of pyramus and thisbe who strictly watched and supervised managed to hold converse through a wall no man could have discovered their method back to the story on the morning of june i am not sure of the year january urged by his wife conceived a great desire for some sportive tricks in the garden he wanted to play with her so on that morning he cooed to may rise up my dearest my lovely baby the voice of the turtledove can be heard in the land my dove and the winter storms have gone rise up now open your dovelike eyes come forth with me oh your breasts are sweeter than wine the garden is walled no one can see us walk out with me white and fair as you are you have captured my heart with your spotless beauty and virtue come let us go to play i have chosen you for my pleasure these were the lecherous words of the old man may meanwhile had made a sign to damian that he should go before them through the wicketgate so damian took the counterfeit key opened the gate and silently made his way into the garden no one saw or heard him once inside he sat quietly beneath a bush january as blind as a stone now entered the garden he was holding mays hand as soon as he had closed the gate behind him with a great clatter he turned to her now wife he said only the two of us are here you are the creature i love best in all the world as god is my witness i would rather cut my own throat than offend you do you remember how i chose you not out of greed dear heart but out of love for you i may be old and blind but i will explain to you the blessings of fidelity it is a debt you owe to jesus christ and to your own honour and of course you will inherit everything palace money everything i will sign a contract to that effect before tomorrow evening now in return i will ask you for a little kiss your lips will seal the bargain dont blame me for being jealous by the way you are so deeply imprinted on my heart that when i consider your beauty in contrast to my old age i cannot bear to be out of your company i must always have you beside me precious one for the love i feel for you now kiss me dearest lets go for a stroll may hearing his words began to weep very gently then she recovered herself and replied to him i have a soul to keep spotless just like you and of course i must guard my honour the tender flower of my womanhood is in your hands i gave it to you when the priest bound us together in holy matrimony and i tell you this my dear lord i pray to god that the day never comes when i bring shame to my family or bring dishonour to my own name i will never be unfaithful i would rather die the most painful death in the world if i prove false to you then sew me in a sack and drop me in the nearest river i am a gentlewoman not a whore why do you talk to me this way well men are ever untrue they never stop reproaching their wives they never stop being suspicious and distrustful she caught sight of damian sitting beneath the bush she coughed lightly and then using sign language told him to climb a nearby pear tree full of fruit he was on his feet and up the tree in a flash he knew exactly what she intended and could read her mind better than january ever could she had written him a letter in any case where she had explained her plan so for the time being i will leave him in the pear tree with may and january strolling happily between the beds of flowers bright was the day and through the trembling air the golden rays of phoebus descended to the earth warming all the flowers with their caress he was at that time in gemini i suspect close to the summer solstice the bright sun would soon begin its decline it so happened on this day that pluto king of the fairies entered the garden on the farther side he was accompanied by his wife proserpina and all the ladies of her entourage he had taken her from etna if you remember when she was gathering wild flowers on the mountainside you can read the story in claudians the rape of proserpina where he describes the dark chariot in which she was driven away pluto sat down upon a green sward of turf in the middle of the walled garden and addressed his queen my wife no one will disagree with me experience teaches us every day that women are treacherous towards men i could tell you a million stories about their frailty and fickleness oh solomon wisest and wealthiest of all winner of human glory what reasonable person could fail to note and remember your words he was praising the goodness of humankind observing that i have found one man among a thousand but among women i have found none so said king solomon knowing full well the wickedness of the female sex jesus of syrak author of ecclesiasticus rarely speaks of you with reverence may wild fire cover you may pestilence fall upon your bones do you see what is happening now this honourable knight old and blind as he is is about to be cuckolded by his own servant look where the lecherous bastard is hiding in the pear tree i now decree of my majesty that sight will be restored to this worthy old man his eyes will open at the moment his wife betrays him then he will know her wickedness to the great shame of her and of other harlots oh will you proserpina was very sharp is that what you intend to do by the soul of my grandfather great saturn i swear that i will give the woman a sufficient answer to him i will help all other women too who are accused if they are found in any sin i will ensure that they put on a bold face and give a good excuse they will bear down their accusers none of them will die for lack of a retort even if the man sees the offence with his own eyes yet the woman will face it out boldly she will weep and swear and bully until she wins the argument you men are as gullible as geese what do your socalled authorities matter to me i know well enough that this jew this solomon discovered plenty of fools among women he may not have come across a good woman but other men have found women to be true and faithful and virtuous what about all those good christian women who proved their constancy with martyrdom the roman annals are filled with stories of faithful wives keep your temper dear husband i will explain to you what solomon meant when he said that he could find no good woman i will interpret he meant that supreme goodness lies only in god and that all flesh male or female is frail anyway solomon is only one man why do you make such a fuss of him who cares if he built a great temple to god who cares about his wealth and wisdom he also built a temple to the pagan gods there is no blasphemy worse than that you may try and excuse his faults but he was a lecher and an idolater he abandoned god in his old age the bible tells us that god spared him only for the sake of his father king david if it had not been for david solomon would have lost his kingdom sooner than he would have expected i dont give a damn for any of the slanders he and others have written against women i am a woman i must speak out or else my heart will break how dare he call us chatterers and worse as long as i live i will attack him for his vicious opinions i will never spare him calm down dear pluto replied curb your anger i give in but since i swore an oath to restore his sight i must keep it my word must stand i am a king i cannot break oaths and i am a queen this young woman will have her answer i guarantee it so let us not argue any more i will not be at cross purposes with you let us leave the rulers of fairyland and return to january he was enjoying his stroll through the garden with may and was chirping like a budgerigar you know he said i love you best i always will they went up and down the walks until eventually they returned to the pear tree in which damian was concealed he was sitting high among the green leaves so may glowing with health and energy now piped up oh she said ive got a terrible pain in my side i must have one of those little green pears that i can see i dont care about anything else i must eat one i must handle one of them for the love of heaven my husband help me to the fruit i might die otherwise the fruit the green fruit oh god he replied if only i had a servant here who could climb the tree i am blind i cannot help yes you can if you put both your arms around the tree like so then i could place my feet upon your back and climb up to the branches trust me i can do it of course i trust you i would do anything for you darling is this the right position so he stooped down on the ground beside her she clambered on to his back and grabbing a branch hauled herself up into the tree ladies forgive the next bit i am a rude man i cannot gloss over the facts as soon as she had mounted the tree damian pulled up her smock and fucked her when pluto saw that this great wrong was being wreaked upon january he gave back the old knight his sight it was better than it had been before and of course the first thing he wanted to look upon was his lovely wife so he glanced lovingly up at the tree whereupon he saw damian thrusting away i will say no more about it it is not polite i have already said enough so january sets up a roaring and a crying just like a mother who has lost her only child help he shouted harrow havoc alarm what are you doing you little whore what is the matter with you sir may replied demurely have patience be reasonable i have just cured your blindness as god is my witness i am not lying i was told that there was one way to bring back your sight if i were to struggle with a man up a tree you would be healed thats the truth god knows my intentions were honest struggle january replied i saw his cock inside you i hope to god that you both die of shame he fucked you i saw it with my own eyes may i be hanged otherwise it seems that my medicine did not work may said if you really could see you would not be using these words to me you have a glimpse or squint and not perfect sight i can see as well as i ever could thank god both of my eyes were open i am sure i thought that he was fucking you you are still dazed good husband you are imagining things and that is all the thanks i get for curing your blindness i try to be kind and then she burst into tears now wife january said let us forget all about it come down from the pear tree if i have slandered you then i am well punished for it by your tears i really did believe that i saw damian having sex with you on my fathers soul i believe that i saw your smock against his chest you may believe what you like may replied but a man that is suddenly woken from sleep may not grasp a situation straight away he has to be perfectly awake before he sees things clearly you were asleep in one sense you were blind do you expect to see perfectly the very moment your eyes are opened you have to wait a day or two until your eyesight has settled down i am sure you will be deceived by other illusions be careful dear husband men are fooled by their visions or their fantasies every day he who misunderstands misjudges and with these words she leaped down from the tree into his arms who could be happier than january he clasped her tight and kissed her all over he ran his hand against her belly then rejoicing he walked with her back to the palace now good pilgrims i hope that you are also content so ends my story of may and january god bless you all heere is ended the marchantes tale of januarie the merchants epilogue god in heaven harry bailey exclaimed keep me away from a wife like that do you realize how many tricks and deceits a woman can use they are busy as bees morning and night trying to fool us the last thing they want is the truth the merchants tale proves it i will tell you plainly my own wife is faithful to me i know that but she is a shrew she may be poor but she is rich in insults she has plenty of other vices too well i cant do much about it now can i forgive and forget but do you know what between you and me i wish that i were not wed to her of course i would be a fool to repeat all of her faults do you know why it would get back to her there would be gossip by one or two members of this company i do not need to name names you all know who i mean women have a way about them they know the market for their wares i havent got the wit to carry on with a long story in any case farewell to all that then he turned in his saddle and addressed another pilgrim the squires prologue squire come nearer to me come do us a favour tell us a love story i am sure you are an expert in that field i dont think so sir the squire replied but i will do my best i will not disobey your order i will tell you a story but dont think any the worse of me if i mess up my intentions are good in any case well here goes the squires tale here bigynneth the squieres tale part one at the city of tsarev in the land of the mongols there lived a king who made continual war on muscovy it was a struggle in which many brave men were killed the name of this king was genghis khan he had achieved such glory by force of arms that there was no more renowned leader in the entire region he lacked nothing that pertains to kingship he faithfully observed all the laws of his religion he was doughty wise and rich he was as pious as he was just he kept his word in honour and in kindness he was as stable as the centre of a circle he was young too and full of life like any other bachelor knight he prided himself on feats of arms what else is there to say he was a happy and a fortunate man and maintained so royal an estate that no one else could hope for a better now genghis khan had by his wife elpheta two sons the oldest of them was named algarsyf and the younger one was called cambalo he also had a daughter canacee by name i could not begin to describe her beauty to you all it is beyond my abilities i would not be able to stammer the words my english is insufficient it would take an excellent orator knowing all the arts of his trade even to attempt to portray canacee but i am no orator i am a poor squire so it happened that in the twentieth year of his reign genghis khan proclaimed the feast of his nativity throughout the city of tsarev he celebrated that day every year it was in the middle of march i believe the sun was powerful and strong in those climes it was already in the first ten degrees of aries sign of heat and dryness so that the weather was warm and refreshing the little birds sang in the sunshine their notes rose up into the air as if they were a protection against the keen frosts of winter so genghis khan wearing the vestments of lord and king was sitting on his throne in the royal palace he was holding a feast to commemorate his birthday there was so much of everything on the tables that i will not describe the array it would take a summers day to go through the entire menu there is no point either in reciting the sequence of dishes brought from the kitchens i will not mention the swans or the young herons all boiled or roasted i know that tastes vary what is considered a delicacy in one country is scorned in another in any case i cannot comment on everything time is running on it is almost nine oclock i will resume the story where i left off the feast had come to the third course the king and his courtiers were listening to the sweet music of the players performing before the dais when there was a sudden clatter a knight appeared at the doors of the hall sitting astride a horse of brass in his hand he held a great glass mirror he had a broad ring of gold on his thumb and a gleaming sword hung down by his side he rode up to the kings table no one said a word they were all astonished by the sight of this knight young and old looked on this knight was in full armour except that he wore no helmet he gracefully saluted all the company king and queen ladies and nobles in order of rank he seemed so full of reverence and modesty in looks and speech that gawain himself if he emerged from fairyland could not have equalled him then as he stood before the assembled company he delivered his message in a calm clear voice full of strength he followed all the rules of discourse and enunciation just as the orators teach us fitting his gestures to his words i cannot imitate his high style of course that would be too great a challenge but i can give you the gist of what he said if my memory doesnt fail me the king of arabia and india salutes you great lord and sends you greetings on this solemn day of festival in honour of your birthday he presents you with this steed of brass i who am your willing servant was asked to bring it into your presence this horse can in the course of a single night and day carry you to any place on earth wind or rain does not deter it wherever you wish to go there it will take you unharmed if you want to soar through the air like an eagle this horse will carry you you can fall asleep on its back and still come to no harm do you see this pin here behind his ear if you twist it the horse will return you to your starting place the inventor who made this horse was a very cunning man he waited until all the planets were in the right aspect before he began work he knew all the secrets of his craft now let me tell you about the mirror i am holding it has much power when a man looks into it he will see whatever misfortune awaits him it will show you sire any harm that threatens you or your kingdom friend and foe will be reflected in the glass if any gracious lady has set her heart on a man she will see in this mirror if he is false to her she will see his unfaithfulness as clear as day nothing will be concealed on this auspicious spring day my lord and master sends this mirror and this gold ring to your excellent daughter canacee may i tell you about the virtues of the ring if the noble lady cares to wear it on her thumb or carry it in her purse she will understand the language of the birds she will be able to speak to them as they fly above her she will also understand the language of every herb that grows upon the earth and will know which of them heals or cures the most grievous wound i will now explain the power of the sword that is hanging by my side it has the ability to smite through the heaviest and greatest armour it will cut through metal plates thick as oak trees as if they were made of butter it has one other power any man who is wounded by this sword will never be whole again unless you take up the blunt side of the weapon itself and lay it upon his body in the place where he is hurt stroke the wound with the sword and it will close up i swear that all this is true this sword will not fail you as soon as he had finished speaking the knight rode out of the hall and leaped from his horse this animal its brass shining as bright as the sun stood absolutely still in the courtyard the knight himself was led to a chamber where he was carefully undressed and given meat meanwhile the gifts he had brought with him the sword and the mirror were taken by royal officers to the high tower of the palace the ring itself was solemnly presented to canacee as she sat at the high table the horse of brass however could not be moved it seemed to be glued to the ground none of the courtiers or soldiers could dislodge it not with pulley or windlass or mechanical engine of any kind how could they they did not know its secrets so they left it in position until the knight in shining armour as you shall hear later told them the trick of shifting it great was the crowd that swarmed about this horse it was so tall so broad so strong and so well proportioned that it seemed like a steed out of lombardy it had all the qualities of a horse it was the horsiest horse anyone had ever seen it could have come from apulia in fact rather than from northern italy from its tail to its ears it was a model of its kind everyone agreed that neither art nor nature could have improved upon it and of course everyone was astonished that it was made of brass how could the knight ride it some said that it was a wonder of the fairy world some said that it was the work of magicians diverse people offered diverse opinions there were as many theories propounded as there were heads the people murmured like a swarm of bees they came up with elaborate fancies based upon the stories they had read some said that it resembled pegasus the horse that had wings others said that it was the twin of the wooden horse that brought destruction into troy they knew all about these animals from the old books i am very afraid said one of them i am sure that there is an army inside the belly of this beast waiting to destroy this city why cant we find out why cant we know hes quite wrong another whispered softly to his companion this is an apparition shaped by magic just like the illusions created by conjurors at great feasts so the company was besieged by various doubts and fears this is the way of common people when confronted by something beyond their experience or understanding they come to the wrong conclusion they panic others among them were wondering out loud about the mirror that had already been carried into the principal tower of the palace they wanted to know how it worked how could all these things be seen within it one of them said that it might be a natural phenomenon it was a question of perspectives and angles and reflections there was one just like it in rome then they all started talking about alhazen and vitello and aristotle who had written on the subject of mirrors and optics they had heard of these authors even if they had not actually read them and then again they wondered at the magic sword that could cut through anything they talked about king telephus who was wounded and then healed by the wonderful spear of achilles it had exactly the same miraculous properties as this sword as you have just heard so the company talked about the ways in which metal could be hardened they spoke of the especial solutions that could be used to temper steel they debated all the whys and wherefores i myself know nothing about them when they had satisfied themselves on that matter they turned their attention to the gold ring given to canacee they all said that they had never heard of a ring like it in all the history of rings they had never known one except perhaps from the hand of moses or solomon who were supposed to be masters of magic they gathered in little groups and muttered to each other wasnt it queer to learn that glass was made from the ashes of fern glass doesnt look a bit like fern does it or like ashes since it is a matter of fact that glass is made from the ashes of fern they soon stopped asking stupid questions they were like people who wonder all the time about the origins of thunder or the causes of tides or the webs of spiders or the gathering of mist they want to get to the bottom of everything and so they questioned and debated and puzzled until the time that genghis khan rose from the high table the sun had left its meridian and the lion was ascending when the great king left the hall it was two oclock on march in other words the minstrels walked before him playing loudly on the gitern and the harp as he made his way to the presence chamber the music was so sweet and solemn that it might have issued from the halls of heaven venus was sitting in majesty exalted in pisces and all her children on earth were dancing she looked down at the revellers in the palace with a very friendly eye so the noble king is set upon his throne very soon the strange knight is brought before him and look he is dancing with canacee all is joy all is harmony a dullwitted man like myself cannot describe the scene it would need a lovestruck genius filled with the spirit of spring to do justice to the occasion who could explain to you the intricacies of the native dances the subtle rhythms the smiles the devious looks and glances passing between the maids and the young men only lancelot the knight of love and he is dead so i pass over all the playfulness they danced and flirted until it was time to dine then as the music played the steward of the household called for the wine and spiced cakes to be brought in quickly the ushers and the squires left the hall while the revellers feasted on the food and drink when they had finished they all trooped into the temple for a service once that was over they fell upon their suppers why say any more about it every man knows that at a kings banquet there is enough and more than enough no one goes hungry there were more dainties there than i can describe when the feast was complete the king and his entourage walked out into the courtyard in order to view the miraculous horse there was more amazement at this animal than at any time since the siege of troy the trojans were astonished at the appearance of a wooden horse the lords and ladies at the court of genghis khan were even more astounded by a metallic one eventually the king asked the knight to explain the properties of this horse he wanted to know how strong it was and the best way to ride it as soon as the knight put his hand upon the reins the horse began to frisk and dance sir the knight said there is nothing more to tell you when you want to ride anywhere you just twist this pin behind the ear when we are alone i will tell you how to do it you simply mention to the horse the city or the country you wish to visit and it will take you there when you wish to stop and walk around just twist this other pin that is all there is to do it will descend and wait for you until your return nothing in the world will move it or if you want the horse to disappear use this pin here then it will vanish out of mens sight and will reappear only when you call him i will give you the secret signal later on so travel where you like ride the wind the king listened carefully to everything the knight told him as soon as he had understood the instructions and the method of riding he was delighted he went back to the feast and the horses bridle was taken up to the tower thereupon the horse itself vanished i dont know how i can say no more about it i know only that genghis khan stayed at the revels with his nobles until the following dawn part two the kind nurse of digestion and appetite sleep began to descend upon the party hypnos the son of night let it be known that after much toil and after much drink it was time to rest so he kissed them all he yawned and bid them all to lie down their blood was thick and heavy cherish your blood he said it is natures friend by now they were all yawning too they thanked him for his advice and laid themselves down to rest it was the best thing to do i shall not describe their dreams they were filled with drink and in that state dreams have no meaning they all slept until prime nine oclock all of them that is except canacee she had been very sensible as women are and had gone to bed early after thanking and blessing her father she did not want to look ill or pale on the following day she wanted to look fresh and gay so she slept a moderate amount and then awoke on opening her eyes she thought once more of the ring and the magic mirror she was so excited that she must have changed colour twenty times even in her sleep she had dreamed of that mirror it had made such an impression on her so just before the sun began to rise she called her governess to her bedside telling her that she wanted to dress and get ready for the day the old crone who considered herself to be as wise as her mistress readily answered where will you go ma dame she asked her when everyone else is still in bed i want to get up i have had enough sleep i want to walk about and take the air so the governess clapped her hands and summoned the maidservants a dozen or more to attend their mistress then up rose canacee as bright and rosy as the sun itself it was already warm the sun having risen into aries and so the princess walked out blithely into the light she was gaily dressed for the season and with five or six of her attendants she enjoyed the fragrance of the early morning together they made their way down a green avenue in the park the mist rising from the fresh earth made the sun seem roseate and large it was so fair a sight that all of the ladies were glad at heart it was a lovely season it was a wonderful morning all the birds began to sing and as they sang canacee understood them perfectly she could follow their meaning note by note i forgot to mention one thing you see she had put on the ring no one wants to hear a long story without a point or a story in which the point is long delayed all the fun goes the patience wears thin the narrative loses its savour so without more ado i will put an end to this walk in the park canacee was having a delightful time when suddenly she came to a dry and withered tree as white as chalk in its branches perched a falcon that set up such a shriek that the whole wood resounded with her cries the bird had beaten herself so badly with both of her wings that her red blood ran down the white tree she kept up her bitter lament all the time stabbing her breast with her beak there was no beast no tiger so cruel that it would not have pitied her all the animals of wood and forest would have wept with her if they had been capable of tears there had never been a falcon so fair of shape and form so beautiful of plumage so noble of nature she seemed to be a peregrine falcon from some foreign land she was perched on the tree but she had lost so much blood that several times she was close to swooning she might have fallen out of the tree now the fair princess canacee who wore the ring understood everything that the falcon had said she could listen to her and reply to her in her language in fact she was so filled with pity for the bird that she might have died so she hastened up to the tree looking up through its branches at the falcon then she spread wide the skirt of her dress in case the bird fell through lack of blood canacee stood there for a long time saying nothing until eventually she spoke out loud what is the cause of all this pain if you can tell me you are in hell i know what is the reason are you mourning a death or the loss of love those are the two reasons for sorrow such as yours no other woe comes near to them you are injuring yourself so grievously that fear or fury must be goading you there is no one as far as i can see hunting you have pity on your own sufferings for the love of god tell me how can i help you i have never in all the world seen a bird or beast enduring so much selfinflicted pain you are killing me with your sorrow i feel such sympathy for you i entreat you please come down from the tree i am the daughter of a noble king if i know the cause of your suffering i will try to alleviate it as best as i can as far as it lies within my power so help me god i will cure your woe before night comes here look i will find herbs for you now to cure the wounds you bear on hearing the words of the princess the falcon gave out a shriek more piteous than before she toppled from the branches and fell down upon the ground where she lay as still as any stone canacee took the bird into her lap and caressed her gently until she had awoken from her faint as the falcon recovered from her swoon she began to speak to the princess in the language of the birds it is true that pity runs freely in a gentle heart it is only natural to feel anothers woe as if it were your own we have all experienced it we have all read about it a gentle heart manifests gentleness i can see well enough canacee that you have pity for my distress nature has given you compassion fair princess as one of the principles of your being you are the paradigm of female kindness i have no hope of getting better but in honour of your kind heart i will tell you everything i will perhaps be able to set an example and act as a warning to others you may beat the dog to warn off the lion for that reason while i still have breath in my little body i will confess the whole truth as the bird spoke the princess was bathed in tears she was weeping so piteously that the falcon bid her to be still and stop her sobbing then with a sigh she began her tale i was born god curse the day and brought up on a rock of grey marble i was raised so tenderly that nothing in the world ailed me i knew nothing of adversity until the time when i first sailed high into the air close to me dwelled a tercelet the male of my species he seemed noble and honourable but in fact he was filled with treachery and falseness he seemed so cheerful and so humble that he fooled everyone he was always so eager to please who could have known that it was all an act as we birds say he had dyed his feathers he was like the snake who conceals himself beneath sweetsmelling flowers the easier to bite and wound he was the hypocrite of love all smiles and bows obeying all the rules and customs of courtly romance a tomb is raised out of shining white marble nicely carved but there is a rotting corpse within so did this hypocrite display himself on every occasion he was all front only the devil knew his true purpose he was always crying on my feathers he was always bewailing the miserable life of a lover he courted me year after year until finally i relented my heart was too soft i was too gullible i knew nothing of his malice of course and in fact i was afraid that he might die of love so i made him utter a solemn oath i would grant him my love on condition that my honour and good name were not tarnished i wished to be blameless both in private and in public so i gave him all my heart and all my hopes i thought that he deserved them when he agreed on oath to respect me then i took him as my own true love but there is a saying as old as it is true that an honest man and a thief do not think alike when this tercelet this false bird realized that he had snared me and had captured my loving heart he fell down on his knees in gratitude he was as faithless as a tiger he vowed that he had never been so happy he said that he was more joyful than jason or paris of troy jason why do i mention him this bird was more like lamech who according to the old books was the first bigamist no man since the beginning of the world no human being living or dead could match the tricks of this tercelet he was the supreme counterfeiter no other fraudster was fit to unbuckle his sandals he was the prince of perjury you should have seen the way he offered his thanks to me a thousand times he was perfect in the part the wisest woman would have fallen for it the mask fitted his face the paint was laid on thick in looks and in words he was all charm i loved him for the love he bore me and for his true and honest heart if anything troubled or upset him i felt it so strongly that i might have died so in time i became the supple instrument of his will his will was the stronger and i obeyed him in everything within the bounds of reason and of modesty of course i never loved a bird more or half as much as i loved him i never will again so for a year or two i was convinced of his goodness but nothing lasts for ever fortune turns the wheel eventually the time came when he was obliged to leave the land in which i lived of course i was distraught i cannot describe my feelings i can tell you one thing though i knew the pains of death i was acquainted with grief now that my love could no longer stay by my side on the day of his departure he was so sorrowful that i believed he suffered as much as i did when i heard him speak and saw his pale countenance i truly believed that he was also in despair nevertheless i was convinced that he would return to me as quickly as possible i reassured myself that he would be back soon enough he had to go away for reasons of duty so i made a virtue of necessity i tried to stay cheerful i concealed my pain i took him by the hand and calling on saint john as a witness told him that i would always be faithful to him i will be yours i said for now and ever more please be loyal to me too there is no need to tell you his reply who could speak more nobly than him who could act more wickedly he who sups with the devil needs a long spoon is that not the saying so having made his little speech he left and flew to his destination i do not know where but when he finally came to rest i am sure that he had the following text in mind all creatures of the earth wrote boethius when they regain their proper nature naturally rejoice i think it was boethius men love novelty i know that much have you ever seen those birds that live in cages they are fed on milk and honey bread and sugar their cages are lined with straw as soft and smooth as silk yet as soon as the door of the cage is opened what do they do they fly away of course they leave the little cup and bells they take wing to the wood where they can feed on worms and dirt they need new meat they need change and a new diet good breeding does not come into it this is what happened to my tercelet i could weep even now although he was of gentle birth well mannered and well groomed he happened to see a lowborn kite sailing by on that instant the sweet gentleman became infatuated with a scavenger bird can you believe it of course he forgot all about his love for me he broke all his oaths and promises so my socalled lover has fallen for a kite and i am left behind without hope at that the falcon let out a scream and fainted dead away in the lap of canacee the princess and her entourage were greatly moved by the falcons plight but they did not know how to comfort her canacee decided to take the bird home cradling her in her lap and then she began to wrap up the selfinflicted wounds with bandages and plasters the princess also took rare herbs from the garden of the palace making ointments and other medicines from them she tried everything in her power to heal the hawk she even made a pen of wickerwork by the side of her bed draped in blue velvet cloths where the bird might rest blue of course is the colour of faithfulness the outside of this cage was painted green and on it were depicted the images of all the false birds of the world the owls the tercelets the lecherous sparrows there were also placed here in derision the portraits of those little chatterers known as magpies how they scold and chide so i will leave canacee in the company of her ailing hawk i will say no more about her magic ring until a later occasion when i will tell you how the poor bird regained her repentant lover the old books relate how this reunion was accomplished by the son of genghis khan cambalus i think i have mentioned him before anyway he was the one who brought the birds together enough of that i now want to proceed to tales of battle and adventure i have many marvels to impart to you i will tell you the history of genghis khan the great conqueror then i will speak of algarsif the oldest son of the mighty warrior who won his wife by magical means he would have been in great danger if he had not been saved by that wondrous horse of brass then i will narrate the adventures of another warrior who fought the two brothers for the hand of their sister canacee there is so much to tell you i will begin again where i left off part three apollo was riding in his chariot so high that he entered the house of cunning mercury whats the matter why are you putting your finger to your lips here folwen the wordes of the frankeleyn to the squier and the wordes of the hoost to the frankeleyn great job you have done very well squire the franklin said to him you have spoken nobly i can only praise your wit and invention considering how young you are you really got into the spirit of the story i loved the falcon in my judgement there is no one among us here who is your equal in eloquence i hope you live a long life and continue to exercise your skill in words what an orator you are i have a son myself about your age i wish that he had half of your discretion i would give twenty pounds of land to the person who could instil some common sense into him whats the point of property or possessions if you have no good qualities in yourself i have remonstrated with him time and time again i have rebuked him for following the easy path to vice he wants to play at dice all day losing his money in the process he would sooner gossip with a common servingboy than converse with a gentleman from whom he might learn some manners enough of your manners called out our host you have a task to perform you know well enough sir franklin that each of the pilgrims must tell a tale or two on our journey that was the solemn oath i know that sir replied the franklin but am i not allowed to address a word or two to this worthy young man just get on with your story gladly i will obey you to the letter dear host listen and i will tell you all i will not go against your wishes i will speak as far as my poor wit allows me i pray to god that you enjoy my tale if it pleases you i will be rewarded the franklins prologue the prologe of the frankeleyns tale the noble bretons of ancient times sang lays about heroes and adventures they rhymed their words in the original breton tongue and accompanied them with the harp or other instrument sometimes they wrote them down i have memorized one of them in fact and will now recite it to the best of my ability but sirs and dames i am an unlearned man you will have to excuse my unpolished speech i was never taught the rules of rhetoric thats for sure whatever i say will have to be plain and simple i never slept on mount parnassus or studied under cicero i know nothing about flourishes or styles the only colours i know are those of the flowers in the field or those used by the dyer i know nothing about chiasmus or oxymoron those terms leave me cold but here goes this is my story the franklins tale here bigynneth the frankeleyns tale in armorica better known to us as brittany there dwelled a knight who loved and honoured a fair lady he was wholly at her service he performed many a great enterprise and many a hard labour before he earned her love she was one of the fairest ladies under the sun and came from such noble ancestry that he hardly dared to reveal to her his torment and distress but in time she grew to admire him she had such admiration for his modesty and his gentleness such pity for his sufferings that privately she agreed to take him as her husband she would accept him as her lord with all the obligations that implies in turn he swore to her that in order to preserve their happiness he would never once assert his mastery nor would he ever show jealousy he would obey her in everything submitting to her will as gladly as any lover with his lady for the sake of his honour he would have to preserve his sovereignty in public but that was all she thanked him for his promise sir she said since you have so nobly afforded me such a large measure of freedom i swear that i will never let anything come between us through my actions i will not argue with you i will not scold you i will be your true and humble wife here take my hand this is my pledge if i break it may my heart itself break so they were both reassured they were happy and at peace there is one thing i can say for certain sirs and dames if two lovers want to remain in love they had better accede to each others wishes love will not be constrained by domination when mastery rears up then the god of love beats his wings and flies away love should be as free as air women of their nature crave for liberty they will not be ordered around like servants men are the same of course the one who is most patient and obedient is the one who triumphs in the end patience is a great virtue and as the scholars tell us will accomplish what the exercise of power never can achieve people should not reply in kind to every complaint or attack we must all learn to suffer and endure whether we like it or not everyone in this world at one time or another will say or do an unwise thing it might be out of anger or of sickness it might be the influence of the stars or of the bodily humours it might be drink or suffering whatever the cause all of us will make mistakes we cannot persecute every error therefore the best policy is mildness it is the only way to retain selfcontrol that is why this knight agreed to be a devoted and obedient husband and why the lady in turn promised that she would never hurt or offend him here then we see a wise agreement a pact of mutual respect the lady has gained both a servant and a lord a servant in love and a lord in marriage he is both master and slave slave no he is preeminently a master because he now has both his lady and his love according to the law of love his lady has become his wife in this happy state he took her back to his own region of the country where he had a house not far from the coast of brittany his name by the way was arveragus her name was dorigen who could possibly describe their happiness only a married man they lived together in peace and prosperity for a year or more until that time when arveragus decided to sail to england britain as our nation was then called was the home of chivalry and adventure that is why he wanted to move here he wanted to engage in feats of arms the old story informs us that he lived in britain for two years i will now turn from arveragus to dorigen she loved her husband with her whole heart and of course she wept and sighed during his long absence that is the way of noble ladies she mourned she stayed awake all night she cried she wailed out loud she could not eat she missed him so much that nothing else in the world mattered to her her friends tried to comfort her knowing how greatly she suffered they tried to reassure her and to reason with her they told her night and day that she was tormenting herself unnecessarily they tried every means of consoling her and of cheering her you all know well enough that in time water will wear down the hardest stone if you scrape into flint you will eventually create an image so by degrees dorigen was comforted little by little she was persuaded to calm down she could not remain in despair for ever after all arveragus himself was writing her letters all the time telling her he was well and that he was eager to return without these messages of love she would never have regained her composure she would have died of sorrow i am sure of it as soon as they saw that she was beginning to recover her friends got on their knees and begged her to go out and enjoy herself she should spend time in their company and in that way try to forget her cares perpetual woe is a dark burden eventually she agreed with them that this was for the best the castle of dorigen was close to the sea as i said and there were many times when she would walk with her friends along the shore from that vantage she could see all the ships and barges making their way over the waves sailing to one port or another but the sight of them of course renewed her suffering often she murmured to herself alas if only one of these ships were bringing home my husband then all this pain would go away then would my heart be light again there were other times when she would stand by the side of the cliff and look down upon the waves dashing against the black rocks she would be filled with anxiety so nervous and fearful that she could hardly stay upon her feet she would sit down upon the short grass and gaze out at the ocean then she would pray to god her words mingled with sorrowful sighs almighty god through whose will and foresight the whole world is governed you create nothing without a purpose yet why then did you create these fearful rocks below me they are so dark and so destructive they seem more like a foul fault in creation than the work of a wise and benevolent deity why did you let them issue from your hand there is no living thing that cannot be harmed by them any man or bird or beast from any point of the compass can be broken against them these sinister rocks do nothing but harm do you know lord how many men and women have been shipwrecked of course you do the rocks of the ocean have killed many hundreds of thousands of people all of them lost and forgotten it is said that you loved humankind so much that you fashioned it in your own image it seemed then that you were bestowing a great boon how then is it possible that you should create these evil rocks that do nothing but provoke death and disaster no possible good can come from them i believe theologians argue that your providence is such that all things turn out for the best i myself cannot follow their arguments about destiny and free will i say only this may the god who made the winds blow preserve my husband that is all the scholars can dispute as much as they like i pray only that all the rocks in the world are consigned to hell for my husbands sake so dorigen in tears would express her grief her friends began to realize that these walks by the sea were not doing her any good quite the opposite so they set about finding some other place to entertain her they took her to cool rivers and to holy wells they took her to dances and other celebrations they taught her to play chess and backgammon then one morning at the rising of the sun they came into a garden where they had laid out food and drink to accompany their revels all that day this was on may a fair morning when the sweet showers had brought forth the leaves and flowers of early spring they had been arrayed so carefully throughout the garden that there was no other display like it in the world it was like a garden in paradise the scent and brightness of the flowers would have lightened any heart except for one bowed down with sorrow or distress it was a place of beauty and delight after they had eaten the lords and ladies set out to sing and dance all of them that is except for dorigen who still made her moan there was no dancing for her if her husband was not part of the happy company still she sat on one side not in solitary retreat and hoped that her sorrow might lessen a little there was among the dancers a jolly young squire handsome and fleet of foot he was fresher than the spring day and according to all reports he could sing and dance better than any other man in the world he was also one of the most goodlooking he was young and strong virtuous and rich wise and well respected what else can i say oh one more thing unknown to dorigen and the others this young squire aurelius by name was in thrall to venus for the last two years he had secretly been enamoured of dorigen he loved her more than anyone else in the world but of course he had not been able to disclose his love he had drunk the bitter cup of misery down to the lees he was in despair but he was silent save for the songs of woe that he sometimes sang he did not sing of his own case but rather made general complaint about the pains of love in various chants and lyrics roundels and virelays he sang of a lover who was not beloved he sang of a true heart beating in vain he sang of a lover suffering all the pains of hell echo pined away for love of narcissus that will always be the fate of the starstruck lover so in all his pain aurelius dared not reveal his feelings to dorigen yet there were times at dances where the young come together when he looked upon her with such intentness that he seemed to be asking her for mercy but she knew nothing about this nevertheless it happened on this day that after the dance was over they fell into conversation there was nothing wrong with that they were neighbours they had known each for a long time and he was an honourable man yet as they talked aurelius came closer and closer towards the one theme that haunted him when he saw the right time he spoke out ma dame he said i wish to god that i had gone over the seas like your husband i wish i had set sail on the same day if it would make you happy i would gladly travel to a distant land from which i could never return i know well enough that my service to you here is all in vain my reward is a broken heart ma dame have pity on my pain you can cure me or kill me with one word i wish that i lay buried here beneath your feet i have no more to say have mercy on me sweet dorigen or else i will die she turned and looked at aurelius what are you saying to me can i believe what i am hearing i never suspected this of you before but now i know everything by the god who gave me soul and life i never shall be an unfaithful wife in word and deed to the utmost limit of my strength i will be a true lady to my lord take that as my final answer but then as if playing a game with him she seemed to relent a little aurelius she said i swear to the same god that i will bestow my love on you i have taken pity on your tears there is only one condition on the day that you manage to clear all the rocks that deface the coast of brittany on the day that you remove stone by stone these cruel impediments to our ships and boats i will promise to love you as no other man has ever been loved when the coasts are clear i will be yours i swear it is there no other way he asked her none i know that it is never going to happen dont dwell upon the possibilities it just cant be done in any case what kind of a person are you to have designs upon another mans wife my body is not for auction aurelius sighed very deeply he was depressed by what he had heard and with sorrowful countenance he replied to her ma dame he said you have set me an impossible task there is no choice for me now i must die a piteous death and with these words he turned and walked away now the rest of the company came and joined them not realizing the conversation that had passed between them they paraded through the garden walks and soon began singing and dancing again until the setting of the sun the horizon dimmed its light the night came upon them so they went back to their homes in peace and happiness all except aurelius of course who returned to a house of woe he saw no remedy but in death he felt his breast and it was as cold as ice he fell down on his knees and raised his hands to heaven he prayed he knew not what he was out of his mind with grief he did not know what to say or what to do so instead he set up a long low complaint to the gods in heaven he addressed the sun first of all fair apollo he prayed you are god and governor of every living thing on earth you lend the time and give the season for every plant and flower and tree just as you take care of nature great god will you take care of your poor servant aurelius cast your eye upon the wretch who kneels before you oh god above i am lost my lady has condemned me to death but i am innocent through your divine kindness have some pity on my plight i know well enough great phoebus that you could help me best next to dorigen of course i know that you can work all things to your will please tell me what i ought to do please give me hope i know that your sister lucina full of grace is the mistress of the moon she is also the principal goddess of the sea and the tides she has dominion even over neptune in the affairs of the deep you know better than i do lord phoebus that she likes nothing better than to be lit by your fire so she follows you through the firmament and in turn the mighty seas follow her as their lawful protector and deity she holds sway over every stream and brook so this is my request to you great lord perform this miracle for me or i will die when you and your sister are in opposition within the sign of leo when the tides are high will you beseech her to send so great a flood along the coast that the highest rocks in brittany are overwhelmed by five fathoms of water that is my plea and will you ask your sister to maintain the seas at that pitch for at least two years then i will be able to tell dorigen that i have performed my part of the bargain and that she must fulfil hers perform this miracle for me lord of the sun ask your sister to travel in step with you at your speed for the next two years remain in opposition one to another then there will be a full moon every night and the spring tides will not abate one inch but if glorious lucina does not wish me to win my love in this way then will you plead with her to take those dark rocks down with her to the realm of pluto let them be buried leagues beneath the earth otherwise i will never gain my lady i will journey in bare feet to your temple in delphi great lord see the tears upon my cheeks take pity on my pain sir and with those words he fell into a swoon he did not recover for a long time it was his brother who looked after him when he heard of his distress he took him up and brought him to his bed so there will i leave poor grieving aurelius to his painful thoughts i do not know whether he will live or die in the meantime arveragus full of honour has returned home he came back with all the other knights but there was none more renowned for chivalry you are happy again dorigen to have your loving husband safely in your arms this noble knight this famous man of arms still loves you above all else he is not a suspicious husband either he would not even have considered the possibility of a rival the thought never crossed his mind he just wanted to dance and joust and make good cheer so i will leave them together in married bliss it is time to return to sick aurelius oh dear for two entire years he lay in woe and torment he never left his bed he could not have taken one step he received comfort from no one except his brother who was a scholar and very sympathetic to his plight of course aurelius told no one else about it he was silent and discreet he kept the secret hidden deeply in his breast just as pamphilus once concealed his love for galatea his breast looked whole and healthy but the arrow unseen had pierced his heart any surgeon will tell you that a wound healed only on the surface can be deadly you must get at the arrow beneath so his brother the clerk wept bitterly beside his bed but then this brother learned in many things happened to remember his time at the university of orleans while he was living there he fell into the company of other young students all of them eager for learning above all else they were fascinated by the arts of the occult they searched in every corner for secret lore he remembered that one day he had come across a book of natural magic it had been left on a desk by one of his companions a student of law who was interested in more than legal matters this book described the operations of the twentyeight mansions or stations of the moon it is all foolishness to us nowadays of course worth less than nothing the faith of the holy church is all we need we no longer put any trust in magic or necromancy but as soon as the clerk recalled the details of this book his heart leaped he said quietly to himself that his poor brother would soon be cured of his woe i am sure he said that there are ways and means of creating magical illusions conjurors can do it after all i have often heard it said that at royal feasts the magicians have summoned up lakes and rowing boats within the great hall they have sailed up and down between the tables they have conjured up fierce lions about to spring they have turned a hall into a meadow of sweet flowers they have created fruitful vineyards and stone castles and then in a puff they have made them all vanish that is how it seemed at the time so this is my plan i will return to orleans and see if i can find some old scholar who is familiar with the mysteries of the moon and who knows how to practise natural magic and by these means my brother will one day possess his wishedfor love i am sure that a good magician will be able to remove from human sight all of those dark rocks ships will be able to come and go along the coast of brittany at least for a week or so then my brother will be relieved of his suffering dorigen will have to keep her promise to him or else be dishonoured for life there is no need to make a long story out of this he went straight to his brothers bedside and acquainted him with the details of his plan aurelius was so heartened and excited by the scheme that he rose immediately and took horse to orleans with his brother all the way there he exulted at the thought of being permanently cured of his pain they were two or three furlongs distant from the city when they came upon a young scholar riding alone they greeted him in latin whereupon he astounded them with his first words i know why you have come here he told them and without more ado he informed them of their plans the brother of aurelius asked him for news of the other scholars at the university and having learned that they had all died he broke down in tears aurelius himself alighted from his horse and followed the young magician to his house in the city here he and his brother were nobly entertained with all kinds of meat and drink aurelius had never seen so comfortable and wellstocked a house before they sat down to supper their host conjured into their sight extensive forests and parks filled with wild deer aurelius saw or thought he saw stags with great horns he had never seen beasts so great he saw one hundred of them torn to pieces by mastiff dogs and another hundred wounded to death with sharp arrows when the wild deer had disappeared he saw falconers standing by the bank of a great river their birds had just killed a heron and look there were some knights jousting on a plain and what is this there was dorigen before him dancing aurelius seemed to be dancing with her too he could hear the music yet at this point the young master clapped his hands and all the illusions vanished into thin air farewell the revels all were ended they had seen such marvels as tongue could not express but they had not moved from his house they were still in his study surrounded by his books they sat there the three of them in silence then their host called out to his squire is our supper ready yet i asked you to prepare it more than an hour ago when i brought these gentlemen into my study master the servant replied it is ready whenever you want it it is ready now we will go and eat at once then these lovers like my friend here need to rest between dances then after supper they began to discuss the fee that the magician would require he was supposed to remove all the rocks along the coast from the mouth of the river gironde to the mouth of the seine what would that cost he said that it would be difficult involving many problems all things considered he could not accept less than a thousand pounds god knows even at that price he was working cheap aurelius was too elated to argue with him a thousand pounds is nothing if i had the whole round world i would give it away for such a blessing we have a bargain sir we are in agreement i swear to you that you will be paid in full but lets get to work at once let us start tomorrow certainly the magician replied you have my word on it so on that happy note aurelius retired to his bed and slept soundly through the night at last he had some hope for the future he could see an end to his sorrow on the following morning the three of them rode off to brittany and arrived in good time at their destination the old books tell me that their journey took place in the cold and frosty month of december the sun had declined and grown old in the summer it burns as brightly as polished gold but in this season it is as thin and light as beaten silver the frost and sleet had destroyed the flowers of the garden and the fruits of the field the god of winter sat beside the fire quaffing mead from his drinking horn and feasting on the flesh of the boar all around him echoed the cries of noel noel in the days and weeks that followed aurelius did his best to encourage and defer to the young magician he begged him to do everything in his power to work the miracle and deliver him from grief otherwise he said he would take his sword and kill himself the clever young magician felt such pity for him that he spent all of his time night and day trying to find the answer how was he to create such a grand illusion it was no easy matter to make it seem to dorigen and everyone else that the bleak rocks had disappeared or that they had descended into the earth this was high magic indeed yet at last he thought that he had found the way he took out his astrological tables for the year and calculated the proper time for the deception it was an act of diabolical wickedness of course but he prepared for it assiduously he drew up the values for all the positions of the planets and he measured the paths they would take in the heavens he devised charts for the distances and the proportions involved then he set up his astrolabe and divided the sphere into the equal houses he followed the zodiac i am no expert in astrology so bear with me then he singled out the eighth and ninth spheres and marked out the various mansions and degrees he knew where the moon would be and where the fixed stars would shine he understood the pattern of the constellations these were pagan times he knew all the tricks and japes of the heathen astronomers people were easily fooled in those days by such an evil scheme but it worked he hit upon the right formula and for two weeks it seemed to the world that the dark rocks had disappeared they were nowhere to be seen meanwhile aurelius had been in a state of panic and uncertainty he did not know whether he would win or lose his love he was waiting for a miracle when he knew that it had occurred and that the ragged rocks had vanished from sight he went immediately to the magician and fell down at his feet to you my lord he said i owe everything i was a woeful wretch but you have saved me thank you master together with my lady venus you have rescued me from a life of cold care thereupon he went to the local temple where he knew that he would see dorigen and there she was with much trembling he approached her he greeted her timidly and then began to speak my dear lady he said whom i most love and fear in all this world i would never do anything to hurt or displease you but i cannot disguise my love for you i could die here at your feet i cannot begin to tell you of my misery yet i know that i must either express my feelings for you or perish on the spot even though you are innocent of any crime you are killing me but even if you have no pity for my plight take care that you do not forfeit your honour relent keep your oath for the sake of god in heaven and save my life you know well enough what you promised me understand that i claim nothing by right and that i am entirely dependent on your grace you know that in a garden on a spring morning you made an oath to me on a certain subject you gave me your hand on it if the rocks were gone then you would grant me your love i was and still am unworthy of it i know that but you should not renege on your promise i am more concerned with your honour than my life i swear it i have done as you ordered if you dont believe me go to the shore and see for yourself you must do as you like of course but once again i beg you do not forget your oath living or dead i will be yours for ever it lies in your power to decide my fate i know only this the dark rocks have gone he took his leave of her and she stood there astonished all the blood drained from her face she had never believed that it would come to this she was trapped how could this happen she asked herself how could he have performed such a miracle or monstrosity it is against the course of nature she returned to her home in sorrow and perplexity she could hardly make her way back for two days she wept and wailed she cried aloud and on occasions fainted away it was pitiful to see her she could confide in no one of course and as it happened arveragus was away from home she could speak only to herself and in the privacy of her own chamber with pale and sorrowful face she uttered her lament alas dame fortune i am caught upon your wheel you have trapped me unawares and there is no escape there is no conclusion for me but death or dishonour i must choose one or the other the truth is that i would rather forfeit my life than my honour death would be preferable to the loss of virtue and the loss of name i would be quiet and sinless in the grave have not many noble wives and young maidens killed themselves rather than sacrifice their bodies i know many examples when the thirty cursed tyrants of athens slew phidon at a feast they ordered his daughters to be stripped naked and brought before them they were forced to dance and perform like prostitutes slipping in their fathers blood so that the foul lust of the tyrants could be satisfied god curse the wicked men the poor maidens were filled with shame and horror and rather than lose their virginity they broke away and rushed to a well in a nearby courtyard they plunged in and drowned themselves then the old books report the tale of the fifty spartan virgins captured by the people of messene so that they might violate them of course the maidens all willingly chose to die rather than to assent they would rather suffer death than dishonour why should i not join their company the tyrant aristoclides desired a young virgin stymphalides and ordered her father to be killed one night the maiden went at once to the temple of diana where she clung to the statue of the goddess and refused to move no one could release her grip from the sacred image and so she was killed on the spot if these young girls died gladly for the sake of their chastity why should not a wife follow their example why should i not defend myself from the foul desires of a man can i not learn from the example of the wife of hasdrubal who killed herself within the walls of carthage when she realized that the roman enemy were about to take the city she took her children and walked willingly into the fire she would rather be burned alive than ravished by roman soldiers did not lucrece kill herself after she was raped by tarquin she could not endure the loss of her good name that was too great a shame for her the seven virgins of miletus sought selfslaughter rather than submit to the men of galatia i could repeat more than a thousand stories of this kind let me see when abradates was killed his beloved wife cut her wrists letting her blood mingle with the blood and wounds of her husband as she did so she called out i have made sure at least that my body will not be defiled but why should i provide more examples when it is obvious to me that many women decided to kill themselves rather than risk dishonour and degradation there is only one conclusion i will die like them i will be true to my husband arveragus i will embrace my fate with the courage of the daughter of demotion do you remember her dame fortune and then there were the two daughters of cedasus that was another sad story the theban virgin killed herself when under threat from nicanor oh yes and another theban maiden did the same thing she was raped by a macedonian soldier and took her own life to redeem her virginity it was not too high a price what shall i say about the wife of niceratus who slit her wrists for the same reason the lover of alcibiades chose to endure death rather than to leave his body unburied and what a wife was alcestis she agreed to die in order to save her husbands life what does homer say of penelope too she was known throughout greece for her chastity i could go on and on when protheselaus was slain at troy his wife could not endure another day noble portia could not live after the death of brutus she had given him her heart and now she offered him her life artemisia famous for her faithfulness was honoured throughout the lands of barbary oh teuta queen of ilyrica your married chastity is an example to all wives i could say the same thing of billia rhodogune and valeria so dorigen wept and lamented for a day or so with the fixed intention of killing herself at the end but then on the third night her husband came home unexpectedly of course he asked her why she was crying at which point she cried all the more alas she replied i wish that i had never been born i have made a promise i have sworn an oath then she told him the whole story there is no need for me to repeat it here he listened to her with good grace and answered cheerfully is that all he asked her is there no more to tell me dorigen no thats it isnt it enough well wife you must know the old saying let sleeping dogs lie all may yet turn out well of course you must keep your promise to aurelius that goes without saying so great is my love for you that i would rather die than allow you to break your word honour is the highest good of humankind but then he began openly to weep upon pain of death dorigen i forbid you ever to mention one word of this to anyone i will cope with my grief as well as i can dont show your feelings either to the world a sad face will provoke comment and rumour then he called for a squire and a servantgirl accompany your mistress he told them you will soon find out where to go so they took their leave and attended dorigen they did not know where they were going and arveragus himself said not a word about his intentions no doubt many of you would consider him to be a simpleton for placing his wife in such a compromising situation but listen to the story before you come to any conclusion she may have more luck than you imagine wait until the end it so happened that aurelius head over heels in love with dorigen happened to meet her in the busiest street of the town she had to go that way in order to make her rendezvous with him in the garden he happened to be going in the same direction he had kept watch on her and checked on her movements whenever she left the house whether by accident or design therefore they encountered one another in the high street he greeted her warmly as you would expect and asked her where she was going she replied in a distracted and almost mad fashion i am going to the garden where else thats what my husband has told me to do he has ordered me to keep my word aurelius was astonished by her reply yet he felt pity for her guilt and obvious grief he also felt sorry for arveragus who believed so strongly in the sanctity of the oath that he was unwilling to allow his wife to break it so he felt compassion and perhaps shame he weighed up the matter and decided that it was far better for him to forgo his lust than to perform a wretched deed principle came before pleasure so he addressed dorigen with a few wellchosen words ma dame he said send my greetings to your husband tell him from me that i recognize his graciousness towards you i see your distress as well i understand it he would rather endure any shame than see your oath violated in turn i would rather suffer any woe however great than come between you i release you from your promise ma dame i renounce any claim i have upon you i tear up any pledge or covenant there ever was between us you have my word upon it i will never take issue with you i will never remonstrate with you or rebuke you and now i must say farewell to the noblest and truest wife in the world yet i will say this before i leave every wife must beware of large promises remember the plight of dorigen and i know this much a lowly squire such as myself can be as honourable as the truest knight goodbye she fell down on her knees and thanked aurelius for his generosity then she went back to her husband and told him what had happened you can be sure that he was pleased he was so gratified that i cannot put it properly in words what can i add in any case only this arveragus and dorigen spent the rest of their lives in married bliss there was never a word of anger between them he treated her like a queen she was always loyal and faithful i will say no more about them yet what of poor aurelius he had lost everything so he cursed the day he was born oh god he cried i owe a thousand pounds of gold to the magician what am i going to do i am ruined i will need to sell everything i own and roam the streets as a beggar i cannot stay here and be a source of perpetual shame to my family my only hope is that he will be merciful towards me i will suggest to him that i pay the debt by instalments year by year on a certain day if he is kind enough to agree i will never let him down so with aching heart he went to his strongbox unlocked it and took out about five hundred pounds of gold he presented the money to the magician and asked him if he could pay the rest at a later date i have never broken a promise in my life sir he said i will repay my debt to you even if i have to go begging in my bare tunic you will get your money i swear it if you can give me two or three years i would be very grateful otherwise i will have to sell my patrimony house and all there is nothing else i can tell you the philosopher listened silently and solemnly did i not make an agreement with you yes sir you did most certainly did you not enjoy the lady as you wished no alas i did not why not tell me the whole story so aurelius went through the entire sequence of events there is no need for me to repeat them is there arveragus he said is such a worthy knight that he would rather die of shame and distress than allow his wife to break her oath then he told the magician all about the anguish experienced by dorigen at the thought of being unfaithful to her husband she would rather have lost her life she had made her original promise quite innocently she had no knowledge of magic and illusion so i felt sorry for her sir arveragus sent her to me without conditions and i freely returned her to him that is the gist of it the scholar answered him very gently dear brother both of you acted with honour and magnanimity you are a squire he is a knight i hope to god that a scholar can act just as wisely a magician can also be a gentleman you know so sir i acquit you of the thousand pounds it will be as if we had never met or made an agreement you are as new to me as that flower rising out of the earth i wont take a penny from you for my work you have paid me for my meat and drink that is enough so farewell good day to you and with that he mounted his horse and went on his way now fellow pilgrims answer this riddle which one of these gentlemen was the most generous let me know before we ride any further will you heere is ended the frankeleyns tale the physicians tale heere folweth the phisiciens tale there was a roman historian tells us a knight called virginius he was a worthy and honourable man with plenty of money and plenty of friends he had only one daughter however a beautiful girl without equal in the whole world dame nature had formed and moulded her with such care that it was as if she were ready to proclaim look at my work here i nature have created a perfect creature in exactly the manner i wished who could counterfeit this beauty who could possibly imitate it pygmalion himself could do no better even though he laboured at his forge or at his easel apelles and zeuxis would do a whole lot worse however well they tried to use their pen or brush no sculptor could match me either god above has given me the power to make and unmake all the creatures of the world i am his representative on earth i can paint and play just as i please all things under the moon are susceptible to my sway i ask nothing for my work of course i am in perfect agreement with my superior in heaven i do all things in honour of him above that is why i made this perfect beauty that i imagine is what the dame would say this girl in which nature took such delight was just fourteen years old just as the dame can paint the lily white and bestow the blush of pink upon the rose so did she apply her skill to the little limbs of the infant before she was born the sun turned her hair golden like the rays of the morning even so she was a thousand times more virtuous than she was beautiful there was nothing lacking in her nothing i cannot praise she was chaste in body and in soul she was a virgin in spirit as well as in flesh she was humble and patient never straying from the path of virtue she was always sober and respectful in conversation too and although she may have been as wise as pallas athene she was measured in her speech she did not put on airs and graces she never tried to be clever she was the perfect female in other words always evincing modesty and grace she busied herself with her womanly tasks hating sloth and idleness before all else she did not pay homage to bacchus either she knew well enough that wine as well as youth can provoke excitement you do not throw oil or fat upon the fire there were times in fact when she feigned illness in order to escape vain company she was uneasy at feasts and parties and dances where there were bound to be intrigues and amours those are occasions when youths little more than children grow up too fast it is dangerous for them as all experience tells us she will be mature enough when she becomes a woman and a wife not before then there may be some of a certain age among you here who are governesses to young girls dont take anything amiss i am only telling you the truth you have been chosen to instruct the daughters of noble families for two reasons as you well know either you have kept your chastity and set a good example or you have fallen into sin and know all the signs of frailty you know the old dance and have forsaken it for ever so for gods sake teach your charges to stay out of trouble a poacher is the best gamekeeper after all a thief knows how to secure his own house so keep them safe you know best how to do it do not wink at any vice lest you yourself be damned for wickedness then you would be a traitor to the whole household of all the sins in the world the worst is the betrayal of innocence it is unforgivable and listen mothers and fathers i am addressing you also you must safeguard and defend all of the children in your care be careful not to give them a bad example make sure that you chastise them properly otherwise they are lost you will pay dearly for their sins i can assure you of that the careless shepherd loses many sheep the wolf comes out of the wood and destroys the lambs i could think of other examples but i must get on with my story this young maiden virginia did not need any governess to teach her virtue her own life was itself a study in virtue a book of goodness in which every page set an example to modest virgins she was so honest and prudent that her fame spread throughout the country where she was acclaimed for her beauty as well as her graciousness all that loved virtue also loved her of course there were certain envious people who resented her happiness and wished her nothing but misfortune or tragedy saint augustine has described those miscreants very well so virginia went into town one day with her mother in order to visit one of the temples there that was the custom it so happened that the town magistrate who was also the governor of the region caught sight of her as she walked past him he could not help but notice her his heart beat faster he was at once infatuated with her beauty and he said to himself i want her and i will have her so the foul fiend entered him whispering to him that he might take this young girl by trickery and deceit he would not get her by force or with money they would do no good she had many friends after all she was also well defended by her own virtue that would never allow her to surrender to him so after much thought he sent for a man of low degree living in the town he knew this man to be a subtle and bold villain ready for anything in the utmost secrecy he told this man the story of his lust and confided in him his plans if you repeat this to anyone he said you will lose your head when the man agreed to help him the judge was delighted he showered gifts upon him so between them they hatched a conspiracy to take the virginity of the young girl it was an elaborate plan which i will explain to you in a moment the judges name was appius by the way he is well known in the history books i am not making this up the churls name was claudius so claudius went back to his humble home and appius returned full of anticipation for the delights in store he could not wait a day or two later this false judge was sitting in his courtroom giving his verdict on various cases when claudius came before him and stood in the well of the court i seek justice he said i have a petition i am filing a suit against virginius he was the father of the girl if you remember if he denies the charge then i will bring evidence against him do me justice sir i have truth on my side the judge pretended to reflect upon the matter in the absence of the defendant he said i cannot come to a definitive judgment call him to the stand then you will get your justice so virginius was brought before the judge and the following accusation was read out to him heretofore and henceforward i will right aptly show you sir judge that the defendant has willingly and maliciously done wrong to your plaintiff claudius to wit that against all equity and all law and all feeling this defendant stole from me under cover of night and darkness one of my servants bound to me by duty and obligation she was very young at the time i also declare that this defendant did willingly and maliciously claim this young girl to be his lawful daughter i will bring forward witnesses to testify on my behalf sir judge whatever he says the young maid is not his daughter return her to me sir and uphold the law virginius looked with horror upon this villain of course he was ready to swear that virginia was his child he would have proved it in trial by battle as suits a knight he would have brought forward witnesses too to testify that the man was lying but he did not get the chance the judge refused to listen to any more evidence he was an old man in a hurry he cut virginius short and then delivered his verdict i have decided that the plaintiff has suffered wrong and can now claim back his servant wherefore sir defendant you no longer have the right to keep her in your house bring her forth and place her in my custody justice must prevail at all costs that is what happened the noble knight virginius was forced by a false process of law to place his daughter in the hands of a lecher the judge would soon be all over the young virgin after the verdict was delivered virginius returned home and sat down in the hall then he called for his daughter with ashen face and piteous countenance he looked upon her he felt such pity for her that he could not express it but he knew what he had to do daughter he said dearest virginia you must suffer one of two fates you must choose between death and eternal shame i wish that i had never been born you have not deserved this what have you done to warrant the knife or the blade oh dear daughter ender of my life i have tried to bring you up in peace and tenderness you have never once been out of my thoughts you were my first joy but now you must be my last woe you are a gem of chastity now dearest one you must suffer your death in patience that is my sentence on you i do it out of love for you virginia not out of hate or anger but you must die i must cut off your head to save you from a far more terrible fate i curse the day when that false judge appius first saw you then he explained to her what had happened in the courtroom i need not repeat it oh dear father have mercy these were the first words of virginia as she wrapped her arms about his neck then she burst into tears dear father shall i die is there no solution no remedy none dearest daughter there is no escape then give me time at least to lament my fate jeptha gave his daughter time to mourn before he killed her god knows that she had committed no sin her fault was to be the first one to greet her father after he had returned victorious from war he had vowed that if he triumphed he would slay the first person to come through the doors of his house it was his own child virginia then fainted on to the floor when she had recovered she looked up at her father i thank god she said that at least i will die a virgin kill me before i am polluted in the name of god do it now so she begged him to take up his sword and slay her softly then once more she fainted away with sorrowful heart virginius picked up his sword and cut off her head with one stroke then according to the story he picked it up by the hair and took it to the courtoom there he laid it on the judges table when appius saw it he ordered virginius to be hanged immediately but a thousand people gathered in sorrow and pity for the knight all of them knew or suspected that the judge had twisted and broken the law they had noted the false demeanour of the churl claudius who had brought the charges in any case appius was a notorious lecher no one trusted him so they marched against him charged him and threw him into prison he killed himself in his cell claudius was sentenced to death by hanging from the nearest tree but virginius pleaded his case so well that the churl was instead sent into exile that is pity for you otherwise the villain would have died all the other guilty parties were taken and executed immediately this is how sin is repaid we must all take heed no one knows the course of gods will no one knows how or where he will strike the worm of conscience may be nourished by a wicked life and then bite however secret however well hidden vice will get its reward the simple man and the scholar have this in common they do not know the time or the nature of their departure from this life so be warned give up sin before sin gives up you heere endeth the phisiciens tale the pardoners prologue heere folweth the prologe of the pardoners tale our host began to swear as if he had gone crazy my god he shouted by the blood and body of christ that judge was wicked and so was the churl they deserved to die as do all false judges and plaintiffs and the beautiful girl was murdered by her own father her beauty came at too high a price thats for sure i know one thing i will say it over and over again the socalled gifts of fortune and of nature can be fatal her beauty led her to the slaughter it is a most sorrowful story we are the darlings of fortune and nature as i said just now at our peril they cause more harm than good so my good master you have told us a sad tale but let it be it does not matter sir physician i pray god to keep you alive and well i pray that your glass vessels and urinals are sparkling clean that your purges and ointments are efficacious that your medicine bottles are well corked and that your old books are on the shelf god bless them all then you are properly set up you are a goodlooking man i must say more like a bishop than a clerk did you notice how i enumerated all the items in your box i dont know medical terminology but i know about health and sickness that story of yours almost gave me a heart attack i need some medicine right away or at least a draught of strong ale then i will have to hear a merry tale to drive away the sad image of virginia he turned to the pardoner my good friend he said tell us a funny story i want some fun of course i will the pardoner replied but first of all i need a drink isnt that an alehouse over the way i feel like a pie too but then others in the company began to remonstrate with the host we dont want any dirty stories let him give us a morality tale let him teach us a lesson or two if thats what you want the pardoner said but i must have a drink first i need time to come up with something honest when he came out of the alehouse he mounted his horse and turned to them all lords and ladies he said i am used to preaching in churches as you all know i take great pains with my delivery so that my voice rings out like a bell i know my theme off by heart of course it is always the same do you know what it is greed is the root of all evil first i tell them from where i have come it might be rome or jerusalem they dont know the difference then i show them my papal indulgences oh before that i make sure that they all see the lord bishops seal on my papers that is just to protect myself from interfering clergy who might try to prevent me doing christs holy work they are so jealous some of them then i really get going i tell the congregation about the indulgences offered by cardinals and patriarchs and archbishops i mutter a few words of latin to spice up my sermon and beg them to pray on their knees for their salvation i get out of my sack the glass cases that hold the relics of the holy saints a collar bone here and a wrist bone there here good sirs and dames i might say is the shoulder bone of one of the sheep led by jacob in the hills of beersheba listen to my words wash this bone in any well and the water from that well will cure your cattle of any murrain or blight it will heal snakebites and kill intestinal worms bring your sheep to the well when they drink from it their scabs and sores will fall away from them they will be uplifted listen to me carefully if any one of you should drink a draught of the well water once a week just before dawn your stock will thrive and multiply there will be more lambs than you can count that is what genesis in the holy book tells us you can read the passage for yourself chapter verses to and ill tell you something else the water will heal suspicion and distrust if a man should fall into a jealous rage just let him mix it with his soup he will feel the difference he will never accuse his wife again not even if he sees her in the company of a priest or two do you see this glove of knitted wool if any man puts his hand in this glove his harvest will be bountiful it could be wheat or it could be oats it makes no difference just make a small offering of silver to me the crop will flourish mark my words there is one thing of which i must warn you good ladies and gentlemen if there is any man among you who has committed a mortal sin too horrible to confess if there is any woman among you young or old who has been unfaithful to her husband such folks cannot come up and make an offering to my relics here they do not have the grace they do not have the power but if the rest of you wish to make an offering then come forward now i will absolve you of your sins i have the bishops authority to shrive you so by these deceits i have earned at least a hundred pounds as a pardoner i stand like a priest in the pulpit i preach to the dolts i beseech them i use every trick in the book i can tell them a hundred lies and never be found out i lean forward and stretch out my neck just like a dove perched on the rafter of a barn my hands and tongue are working so hard that it is a joy to see me in action i tell them to forsake the sin of avarice i tell them to be charitable especially to me i am only interested in their money you see not in the state of their souls i dont care what happens to them once they are dead they can pick blackberries as far as i am concerned i will tell you something else many sermons and devotional homilies spring from bad intentions some preachers just want to flatter or to entertain some are motivated by hypocrisy or vainglory or hate if i cannot get at my enemy directly i will sting him in a sermon i will wound him in covert ways so that he cannot fight back no i say i will not name the enemies of us pardoners that would be too low but of course the congregation know exactly whom i am talking about they can tell from my looks and gestures that is how i retaliate against those who defame me i spit out my venom under the cover of holiness i seem virtuous but seeming is not being i will tell you the truth in one sentence i preach only for money i want their silver pence that is why my theme has always been and always will be the same greed is the root of all evil it is suitable dont you think i preach against the very vices i practise it saves time and even though i may be guilty of that sin i persuade other folk to repent with much wailing and lamenting but that is really not my intention i will say it one more time i preach only for the cash you have probably understood me by now so i tell them tales of old times taken out of books the lewd people love a good story that is the only way they can remember anything do you really think that i am going to live like a monk when i can earn money so easily i have never even considered the idea truly i can preach and beg in all sorts of places i never intend to work i am not going to make baskets or thresh wheat for a living i never beg in vain i always get my reward i am not going to imitate the example of the apostles in other words i want meat and fine clothes and bread and cheese and of course money i will take it from the meanest servant or the poorest widow in the village even though she has to deprive her children of food i like to drink and make merry too and i make sure i have a whore in every town listen to me ladies and gentlemen in conclusion you want me to recite a tale to you i have had a draught of the landlords best ale in that hostelry and i am ready to tell you a story that will really entertain you i may be a very wicked man but i can relate a highly virtuous tale it is one of the stories i use in my sermons after all so be silent i will begin the pardoners tale heere bigynneth the pardoners tale there were in flanders three young people who loved to play around and amuse themselves they used to dance and to fight to haunt taverns and brothels everywhere they went came the sound of harps and lutes and guitars they played dice night and day they ate and drank to excess so in the temples of the devil they sacrificed themselves to satan they rolled in the sty of abomination their oaths and blasphemies were terrible to hear they swore on the crucified body of our lord saying that the jews had not tortured him enough they encouraged each other in every excess and sin they paid for dancing girls slim and shapely as well as young streetsellers singers bawds confectioners any occupation designed to stir the fires of lechery and of gluttony they are the officers in the army of the evil one this is the first lesson according to the bible itself lechery follows in the wake of wine and drunkenness do you remember the case of lot who in his cups had intercourse with his two daughters he was so drunk that he did not know what he was doing and do you recall herod he drank so much wine at the table that he allowed his wife to cut off the head of john the baptist if he had been sober would he have condemned an innocent man to death seneca has a word or two to say on the subject as far as he is concerned there is no difference at all between a madman and a drunkard the only difference is that madness lasts longer gluttony is a cursed vice it is the cause of our confusion on earth it was the reason for our damnation until it was paid for by the blood of christ upon the cross yet at what a high price gluttony has corrupted the whole world adam and eve were driven out of eden as a result of their greed condemned to a life of labour and of woe as long as adam fasted he was happy in paradise there is no doubt about it but as soon as he tasted the forbidden fruit he was cast into the lower world of shame and suffering we all ought to cry out against gluttony if you knew how many diseases and complaints afflict the greedy man you would be more temperate you would maintain a proper diet and enjoy good health alas the open mouth and the eager appetite men must labour north and west east and south on land and sea and in the air to satisfy the stomachs of greedy men who crave more meat more wine more everything saint paul has summarized the matter very well meat is for the belly and the belly is for meat but in good time god will destroy them both no words can tell no tongue can name the horrors of gluttony a man then turns his mouth into a public toilet a sink into which is poured the filth of alcohol then he spews it out again the apostle has recorded his lament many are walking on this earth he said who are enemies of christ crucified i tell you this in sorrow their fate is death everlasting if their belly is their god they will be condemned belly stomach words for a stinking bag of flesh filled with shit and corrupted filth from either end comes a foul wind sustenance is found for you at great cost and hard labour the cooks have to grind and pound and mince turning one dish into the likeness of another just to satisfy you they have to extract the marrow from the bones just so that you can swallow the sweetest juices they have to concoct spices out of herbs and leaves so that they can make a sauce to stir your appetite yet you who live for such delights are as good as dead your vices have killed you drunkenness is just as foul a sin alcohol provokes violence and creates misery it sours the breath it disfigures the features who would want to embrace a drunk he snores loudly and mutters broken words oh you drunkard you fall down as heavily as a stuck pig you have lost your tongue as well as your selfrespect drunkenness is the graveyard of intelligence and decency never trust a man who is lost in drink never confide in him so good people keep away from the red and the white wines that are sold in fish street and cheapside spanish wine is the cheapest and the worst it seems to get mixed up with other wines until it becomes quite overpowering its vapours go straight to the head i do not blame the vintners for this of course god forbid my father was a vintner it must happen naturally somehow two or three glasses are enough the drunkard may then think he is at home in london but in fact he has been transported to a vineyard in spain he is lying among the grapes burbling nonsense so lords and ladies listen to me all of the great deeds and victories commemorated in the old testament were performed by men who practised abstinence they never touched liquor they prayed to almighty god instead read all about it in the holy book in contrast think of attila this great king and conqueror to his manifest shame and dishonour died in his sleep from too much drink he was bleeding at the nose in fact a military man should live soberly remember what was commanded of lamuel was it samuel no lamuel it is in the book of proverbs give not to kings oh lamuel give not wine to kings for there is no secret where drunkenness reigns there is no need to say more on that subject so let me turn to gambling next to drunkenness gaming is the worst vice dice are the mothers of lies they are the cause of deceit of cursing of perjury of blasphemy and even of manslaughter they waste time and money and furthermore to be known as a common gambler is deemed to be a great dishonour the more exalted a man is in rank as a gambler the more infamous he will become a gambling prince would be unfit to frame a policy he would be considered incompetent in public life once upon a time the philosopher stilbo was sent from sparta as an ambassador to form an alliance with corinth he travelled in great state but on his arrival he happened to find all the greatest in the land grouped around a gaming table as soon as he could he returned to his own nation i am not going to lose my reputation he said to his rulers or bring shame to my own people by making an alliance with gamblers send other wise envoys if you wish but on my honour i would rather die than negotiate with such wastrels we spartans are a glorious people we cannot allow ourselves to be associated with them i for one could not sign such a treaty so spoke the wise philosopher take the case of king demetrius the king of persia sent him a pair of golden dice to signify his scorn for him as a wellknown gambler demetrius had no thought for his honour or his glory as a result he had no reputation in the outside world the great lords of the earth can surely think of better ways to spend their time than in dicing now dear pilgrims i will turn to perjury and the swearing of false oaths that is another subject treated by the old books cursing is a great sin in itself of course but perjury is greater still god almighty has forbidden swearing of every kind we know that on the authority of matthew jeremiah also touched upon the subject thou shalt swear in truth he wrote in judgement and in righteousness profanity is a wretched thing do you recall the three commandments concerning the duties owed to the almighty the third of them is this thou shalt not take the lords name in vain this is more important than the taking of life or any other enormity in order of significance it lies third every schoolboy knows that i tell you plainly that violence and vengeance will not be strangers in the house of a blasphemer who cries out by christs passion or by the nails on christs cross when he plays at dice he calls out to his opponent you have five and three i need seven by the blood of christ give me a seven and then he exclaims by the bones of christ i will stab you to the heart if you play false with me this is the fruit of the cursed dice curses anger perjury and murder so for the love of christ who died for us forsake all oaths now i will get on with my story these three young scoundrels whom i mentioned at the beginning were sitting in a low tavern long before daybreak they were drinking together when suddenly they heard the chink of the handbell that announces the carriage of a coffin to the grave one of them turned to his servant go outside he said and find out whose corpse it is try to remember the name sir the boy replied that isnt necessary i knew about it two hours ago it is the body of an old comrade of yours he was murdered last night very suddenly as he sat blind drunk upon the bench outside the tavern a thief called death sneaked up on him death is killing everyone around here he took up his spear pierced the drunk through the heart and silently went on his way he has killed another thousand during the recent plague i think master that you should be careful not to come too close to him it is better to beware such an adversary thats what my mother taught me death is the constant enemy mother of god the landlord said the boy is right death has killed thousands of people this year why he has slain an entire village a mile or so away from here with every man and woman and child gone into the ground i am sure that he lives there it would be wise to be wary of him sirs forewarned is forearmed by the blood of jesus one of them exclaimed are we all so frightened of him i will search out this fellow named death in every street and every quarter i swear that i will teach him a lesson what do the two of you say are you with me let us hold up our hands together and swear that we will act as brothers in the quest for death the slayer will become the slain this very night so help us god so the three of them swore an oath to be true to one another and to live or die in pursuit of their fraternal cause so these newfound brothers jumped up from the tavern bench as drunk as skunks and made their way to the neighbouring village where death was supposed to dwell on the road they uttered many oaths swearing by christs bones and blood that they would tear death to pieces once they had got their hands on him they had walked about half a mile and were just about to cross over a stile when they were stopped by a poor old man he saluted them very humbly god save you your reverences he said the proudest of the three laughed in his face who do you think you are old man he asked him why are you all wrapped up in rags except for your face havent you lived long enough isnt it time to die the man looked into his face and answered him patiently i have walked all over the world and still i cannot find the person i seek i have met no one in town or city or village who will exchange his youth for my age so therefore i grow ever more aged counting off the years that god has willed to me death himself refuses to take away my life so i walk on a restless wanderer through the world with my staff i knock upon the earth calling out dear mother let me in open the gate see how i grow feeble i am nothing but skin and bones dear mother let these bones rest within you i would gladly exchange my box of treasures for the comfort of a winding cloth around my corpse yet mother earth will not help me sirs so you see me standing before you with pale and withered face but gentlemen it is not right that you insult me i have done you no wrong in word or deed have you not read the holy book it is the duty of the young to stand in reverence to the old white hairs demand respect do not injure the old in case you are harmed when you reach the same age that is all i have to say to you god be with you wherever you may travel i must go on as before you are going nowhere you old fool one of the three said to him by christs passion you are not getting off so lightly you just mentioned that false traitor death who has killed all of our friends in the neighbourhood you have my word on it if you are spying for him you will pay for it tell me where he is otherwise expect the worst i swear it on the body and blood of jesus you are in league with death arent you in a conspiracy to slay all of us young people young gentlemen the old man said if you are in such a hurry to find death turn up this crooked path here you will find him sitting under a tree in an oak grove i left him there only a minute ago i assure you that despite your threats death will not run away from you do you see that tall oak he waits there may christ who saved the world save you the old man then went on his way so the three wastrels with loud cries ran towards the oak tree and what did they find there they found piles of gold florins newly minted heaped on the ground they reckoned that there were more than eight bushels of this treasure they forgot all about death he was the last thing on their minds they thought only of this glittering hoard of coin so fresh and bright that it dazzled their eyes the three of them sat down beside it in amazement the worst of them spoke first brothers he said listen carefully to what i have to say i may joke and play about but i have a good head on my shoulders i know what im talking about fortune has granted us this treasuretrove it is ours to spend as we like in joy and festivity all life long easy come easy go who would have thought for gods sake that this would be our lucky day we must find a way of carrying this gold back to my house or to yours of course we are all in this together only then can we be sure of it but we cannot move it in daylight we will be accused of theft and hanged straight away from the nearest tree no it has got to be done by night we have to transport the gold carefully and quietly so that we arouse no suspicions this is what i suggest we cut sticks and draw the one who draws the longest will run back into town and purchase bread and wine for us the other two will keep watch over the treasure as long as he comes back quickly with provisions and says nothing when he is in town we will be able to carry home the gold tonight to whatever place we think best do you agree then he picked up three sticks and bidding them to draw in turn put them tightly within his fist the youngest of them chose the longest stick and so according to the plan he ran off towards the town as quickly as he could as soon as he was out of sight the one who had conceived the plan turned to his friend you know that you are my sworn brother he said in a low voice so i will tell you something to your advantage we are alone he has gone into town you saw him there is plenty of gold here to share among the three of us no doubt about it but what if i arranged it so that only two of us would benefit wouldnt that be a friendly thing to do the other one was puzzled how are you going to do that he knows that the two of us are guarding the gold until his return what are we going to do what are we going to tell him if you swear to keep this secret he whispered i will tell you in a few words what has to be done i swear i will never betray you listen closely then two people are stronger than one is that not so when he comes back get up as if you were about to play pretend to wrestle with him and at the same time i will stab him in the back you must use your knife on him too then we will be able to share out the gold between us my dear friend just you and me we will be able to indulge ourselves why we will dice all the day long so these two scoundrels agreed to kill their friend and newly sworn brother the youngest man who had gone into town had also been considering the situation all he could see and think of were those glistening piles of coin lord he said to himself if only i could keep all that treasure for myself no one in gods world would be more pleased and happy it was at this point that satan the foul enemy of mankind whispered to him that he should procure poison and feed it to his two friends when a man is living in such sin as he was the fiend is permitted to tempt him even further so he determined there and then to purchase poison and do murder without compunction or regret he went to an apothecary in the town and told him that he wanted to buy poison to exterminate some rats he said that he also wanted to get rid of a weasel that killed the chickens in his yard as well as all the other household vermin that creep out by night well sir the apothecary replied i have the very thing i swear to god that this arsenic will kill anything and everything a creature has only to take a tiny piece the size of a grain of wheat and it will die it begins to work after a few minutes it is strong and violent and as i said it is always fatal excellent i will take it so the apothecary made up a box of the poison for him the young man went out into the street and walked into a tavern here he ordered three bottles of wine into two of them he put the poison while he left the third for his own use he intended to spend the entire night in carrying the gold back to his own house after he had finished preparing the poisoned draughts he returned to his friends beneath the oak tree do i need to state the obvious the two of them just as they had planned stabbed the young man to death when they had murdered him they laughed let us sit down and drink one of them said we deserve a rest after we have got through this wine we can think about burying him he opened one of the bottles and put it to his lips chin chin open another one so they refreshed themselves or so they thought they were drinking poison of course and soon died i dont think any medical expert could describe in detail all of their suffering it was unutterably horrible death had caught them after all two murderers and a poisoner oh cursed sinners filled with malice and wickedness you have been fattened with gluttony and lapped in luxury you have thrown the dice for the last time blasphemers your curses against christ have come back upon you your swearing your pride and folly have destroyed you why is mankind so false to its creator who purchased its redemption with his own blood now all you good men and women learn from me and beware the sin of avarice forgive us our trespasses that is the prayer so i have come here to pardon you just give me

some money then i will let you kiss the relics one by one unfasten your purse sir i will do no such thing our host replied may christ curse me if i give you so much as a groat you would tell me to kiss a pair of your dirty underpants and swear that the shit came from a saint by the holy relic of the true cross i wish i had your greasy balls in my hand rather than your fake papal bulls lets cut them off and enshrine them in a hogs turd thats where they belong the pardoner was so angry that he could not say a word he just glowered in silence i really cant be bothered to make fun of you our host said i will have nothing to do with an angry man the knight saw that everyone was laughing at the pardoner and so he rode to the front of the procession enough of this he said no more now sir pardoner recover your temper smile and you sir host make amends to our friend here kiss him on the cheek in token of amity and you pardoner respond in kind with the kiss of peace this will be a love day we will go on our way as before with good cheer and laughter so the host and pardoner were reconciled and the pilgrims went on their way rejoicing heere is ended the pardoners tale the shipmans tale heere bigynneth the shipmannes tale once upon a time a merchant dwelled in saintdenis a town just north of paris he was rich enough to pass as a wise man in the worlds eyes he had a beautiful wife too who liked good company she was gay and carefree that sort of woman costs her husband a great deal of money he had to spend more than she earned in compliments and admiring glances she went to every feast and every dance enjoying those pleasures that pass as swiftly as shadows on the wall i feel sorry for the man who had to pay for them all the poor husband has to clothe his wife wrap her in furs and festoon her with jewels and all for the sake of his own reputation meanwhile she dances to her own tune if he decides that he is not going to foot the bill considering it to be a foolish waste of money then the wife will just get someone else to pay or else she will borrow the money and that is dangerous this good merchant peter by name had a splendid house and welcomed more guests and visitors than he could count he was generous and she was beautiful do i need to say any more i will get on with my story among these guests of all types and degrees there was a monk he was about thirty years old at a guess he was goodlooking freshfaced and virile he was always under the merchants roof he had been invited there in the first days of their friendship and was now treated as a familiar companion i will tell you the reason this young monk and this merchant had both been born in the same village each one claimed the other as a cousin they proclaimed their common bond all the time and swore eternal friendship they said that they were brothers as much as cousins they were as happy in each others company as larks on the wing this monk john was generous to a fault and never failed to reward all of the servants in the house he was agreeable to everyone from the meanest servingboy upwards and spared no expense he gave gifts all around so of course he was always welcomed the members of the household were as happy to see him as birds welcoming the rising of the sun i am sure you get the idea it so happened one day that the merchant was preparing himself for a journey to bruges where he had some business to arrange he was going to purchase some fine lace i think so he sent a message to john who lived in paris inviting him to spend a day or two with him and his wife before he set out for bruges come to saintdenis he said and be entertained so the monk requested leave of his abbot to go on a journey it was easily granted since john himself already held the post of bailiff in the monastery he was used to travelling and supervising the farms and granges of the house a day or two later he arrived at saintdenis where he received a great welcome who was more cherished than our dear cousin john he brought a pitcher of malmsey wine with him from the monasterys cellar and some bottles of white wine he brought with him too a brace of pheasants so i will leave the merchant and the monk for a day or two to their meat and drink on the third day the merchant before travelling to bruges was obliged to take stock of his financial affairs so peter secluded himself in his counting house to work out the income and expenditure of the last year he needed to know the amount of his profit he brought out all of his boxes of money and account books laying them down carefully on the exchequer board he was so rich in coin and credit notes that he made sure that he locked the inner door before he got down to business he did not wish to be disturbed by anyone so he sat there doing his sums all morning the monk had been awake since dawn too he had been walking up and down the garden muttering the devotions of his morning office the merchants wife came softly into the same garden and greeted him demurely as she had so often done before she had in her company a young girl who was in her care and under her charge oh good john she said what is the matter with you rising so early my dear cousin he replied five hours sleep a night is sufficient of course that may not be enough for the old or the infirm or for those poor married men who lie dozing in bed all day like weary hares who have just escaped from the hounds but dear cousin why do you look so pale can it be that your husband has been keeping you busy all night with one thing or another you need to rest i can see that then he laughed out loud but he also had the good grace to blush at his thoughts the merchants wife shook her head god who knows everything knows this that has nothing to do with it as god gave me life i swear that there is not a woman in france who is less interested in that sad game than me do you know the old song alas and woe is me i am forlorn i curse the day that i was born but i dare not tell how things are with me there are times when i think of leaving the country or of killing myself i am so full of woe and fear the monk stared at her in alarm god forbid dear niece that in your grief you should do away with yourself tell me everything i may be able to help or counsel you confide in me i promise never to betray you i swear on my breviary here that i will never repeat anything you say i will remain as silent as any stone i make the same oath she replied she put her hand upon his breviary may i be torn to pieces by wild men may i be condemned to hell itself i will never betray your confidence not because you are my cousin but because you are my true and trusted friend so they swore their oath and gave each other the kiss of peace then they started to talk dear cousin she began if i had time and opportunity i would tell you now the story of my married life i have been a martyr to that man you call your cousin no no you are wrong he replied he is no more my cousin than the leaf on that tree i only called him that so i had an excuse to visit this house and to see you i confess to you now that i have loved you from the first moment i saw you i swear this on my profession as a monk explain to me now what you have suffered at his hands tell me quickly before he returns oh dear john she said my true love i wish that i could keep all these things secret but alas she brushed a tear from her cheek i cannot stand the sight of him he is the worst husband in the world yet since i am his wife i am not supposed to reveal the secrets of our marriage or of our marriage bed god forbid i should do so i am bound to honour and obey him she paused for a moment but i have to tell you this he isnt worth as much as a fly and what upsets me more than anything is his stinginess you know well enough that a woman wants six things i am no different she wants a husband to be healthy and wise wealthy and generous she wants him to be obedient to his wife and good in bed just those six things is that too much to ask yet by christ who shed his precious blood for our salvation i have to find one hundred francs by next sunday why to pay for my new gowns and i only bought them to bring credit on him i would rather die than be shamed in public for bad debts if my husband finds out about it he will kill me anyway so please john can you lend me the money otherwise i am ruined if i can borrow the hundred francs from you i will be forever thankful to you i will pay you back of course on a stated day but i will also do whatever else you require of me anything at all if i am untrue to my word take any vengeance you wish tear me apart with horses burn me alive the monk was very courteous in his reply i have so much pity for you gentle lady that i here plight my word to you i swear that when your husband has gone to bruges i will solve your problem i will bring you the hundred francs saying that he fondled her thighs and buttocks embraced her and kissed her a hundred times go upon your way he said quietly and discreetly let us dine soon i see from this sundial that it is past nine oclock in the morning so go now be as faithful to me as i am true to you of course god forbid that i should behave in any other way so she sets off as merry as a magpie and instructs the cooks to prepare a good meal for the master and his guest then she went off to see her husband and knocked boldly on the door of the counting house who is it its me dont you think you ought to eat something peter how much time are you going to spend with all your sums and calculations let the devil take all these account books surely you have enough of gods blessings without having to count them all come out forget your bags of money for a while are you not ashamed that dear john has not had a meal all day let us go to mass and then eat my wife the merchant replied you know nothing about mens business it is too complicated for you to understand i suppose but let me explain this to you take a group of twelve merchants only two of them will succeed and prosper only two will make a good profit in the course of their careers we put on a brave face of course and make ourselves busy in the world but we have to keep our affairs secret until we are dead the only alternative is to go on a pilgrimage or just disappear that is the reason i pore over my books i have to know how to master the tricks of the world i am always in dread of failure bankruptcy and all the other hazards of business life i am going to bruges tomorrow as you know but i will be back as soon as i can while i am away i want you to be modest and courteous with everyone look after our property as carefully as you can keep the house neat and tidy you have enough provisions i am sure of that so dont overspend you dont lack meat or wine you have all the clothes you need but im feeling generous here is some silver for your purse and with that he closed the door of the counting house and went down with his wife for luncheon he had done enough work for the day so they attended a quick mass and as fast as they could they sat down to eat the tables were laid the dishes come and gone in an instant no one ate more than the monk then after the meal was over john took the merchant to one side and spoke to him very seriously dear cousin peter he said i know that you are about to take horse and travel to bruges god be with you and speed you on your journey ride carefully and be careful of what you eat your health may be at risk in this hot weather be temperate in all things what am i saying there is no need for elaborate courtesies between cousins like ourselves farewell god protect you thats all i need to say if there is anything i can do for you by day or night just let me know i am always here to help you he was much affected and put the sleeve of his habit to his eyes oh there is one other thing i have a favour to ask of you before you go can you lend me one hundred francs just for a week or two i have to purchase some cattle for the monastery our stock is getting low i will repay you promptly you have my word as a monk on it but can we keep the matter to ourselves i have to buy the cattle today you see and i dont want to be forestalled now farewell again dear cousin peter thank you for your kindness and for the hundred francs that is nothing the merchant replied consider it done my gold is at your disposal dear cousin john in fact everything i have is yours take your pick god forbid that i should deny you anything i must tell you one thing however for us merchants money is the staff of life we can get credit while our reputation is good but to be without money well that is disastrous pay me back any time you like there is no hurry i want to help you in any way i can so the merchant takes one hundred francs out of one of his chests and gives the money secretly to the monk the only people who knew of the loan were the lender and the borrower then they relaxed and enjoyed themselves until it was time for john to return to the monastery on the following morning peter mounted his horse and in the company of his apprentice made his way to bruges he arrived safely and at once got down to business he dealt in cash and credit he bought and sold he did not dice he did not drink or dance he paid attention only to profit and to loss he behaved exactly as a merchant should so i will leave him in the market place on the sunday following the merchants departure dear cousin john presented himself at saintdenis he was freshly shaven smelling of soap even his tonsure had been clipped everyone in the house saw him and welcomed him even the servingboys greeted him but who was most pleased to see him you have guessed i will come straight to the point the wife had agreed that in exchange for the hundred francs she would spend the night with him she promised that she would give him value for money and so she did throughout the night the monk was exhausted but he was happy he left at dawn wishing a merry good day to the entire household no one had the least suspicion of him so he rode off to the monastery as free from rumour as any innocent there we will lose sight of him for the moment the merchant having successfully completed his business at the fair in bruges came back home to saintdenis he was greeted fondly by his wife and together they celebrated his return he told her that the price of merchandise had been so high that he had been forced to take out a loan of two thousand gold sovereigns now he was obliged to travel to paris in order to raise the money he had some cash of course but he needed to raise the rest from his friends when he arrived in paris his first thought was of his dear cousin so in the expectation of good wine and good conversation he called upon john in his monastery he had no intention of asking him for money he just wanted to catch up on all the gossip and make sure that his friend was still in rude health john welcomed him very warmly and asked about his affairs peter replied that he had done well enough thanks be to god and had made a profit there is just one problem he said i have to raise two thousand sovereigns by next week once i have repaid that i will be laughing i am so pleased that you have come back to us in good health the monk replied if i were a rich man i would gladly give you two thousand sovereigns i havent forgotten your kindness to me the other day when you lent me one hundred francs but i have repaid you two days ago i brought back the money and gave it to your wife i put it down on your counter she knows all about it i gave her a double entry he coughed now if you will excuse me i have to go our abbot is about to leave town and i have to ride with him give your wife my fondest regards wont you what a darling farewell dear cousin until we meet again this merchant was as careful as he was astute he raised the money and handed the two thousand sovereigns to some lombard bankers who gave him a bond in recognition of full payment then he rode back as cheerful as a chaffinch he knew that he had made a profit of a thousand francs on the deal no wonder he sang and whistled as he returned home his wife met him at the gate as was her custom and all that night they celebrated their good fortune with some amorous turns in bed the merchant was out of debt the merchant was rich at break of day he embraced her and began kissing her again at the same time he fucked her hard no more she pleaded with him havent you had enough still she played with him for a little longer the merchant turned on his side after she had pleased him and whispered to her well wife he said i am a bit annoyed with you i dont want to be but i am do you know why you have come between myself and my dear cousin you have sown a little seed of division between me and john how tell me you never mentioned to me that he had paid back the money i lent to him he gave you cash in hand i believe but he feels aggrieved that i did not know about it as soon as i started talking about loans and repayments i realized that there was something wrong yet i swear to god that i wasnt referring to him do me a favour dear wife always tell me in future if i have been repaid in my absence otherwise i might start asking debtors for money that they have already given me do not be remiss in this the wife was not at all put out by his rebuke but answered him boldly enough by the holy mother of god i defy that false monk that socalled cousin john i didnt pay any attention to this bond or repayment or whatever you call it i know that he brought some cash to me but i assumed that he was giving it to me for your sake i thought that he wanted me to dress up to entertain and be entertained in your honour he has been given hospitality here often enough i thought he wanted to repay me in kind may gods curse fall upon our dear cousin but since i see you are displeased with me i will come to the point you know well enough that i always pay my debts on time i pay you your just tribute night after night i am running out of double entries should i ever fall behind in payment you may chalk it up i will soon honour the debt i swear to you that i have spent everything on fine clothes and on hospitality not a penny has been wasted dont i look a credit to you so dont be angry let us laugh and play you can play on my body if you wish bed is the best payment of all forgive me my dear husband and come beneath the sheets you will not regret it the merchant realized that there was no alternative it would have been madness to criticize her any further what was done was done i forgive you dear wife he said but in future try not to overspend keep your money in your purse i beg of you so ends my story god be with you and may you always be worthy of credit heere endeth the shipmannes tale bihoold the murie wordes of the hoost to the shipman and to the lady prioresse well spoken shipman harry bailey said by the body of christ i enjoyed that tale may you sail around the coasts for ever and a day master mariner but may that false monk cousin john have nothing but bad luck for the rest of his life let this story be a lesson to all of us a monk is nothing but an ape in a mans hood the monk made a monkey of the merchant and of the merchants wife never let one of those rogues enter your house now let us go on who is it to be who is going to tell the next story he rode up to the prioress and with as much modesty as a young maid addressed her my lady prioress by your leave if it doesnt offend you i wonder if you would be so good as to entertain us all with another tale only if you wish to naturally gladly sir she replied the prioresss prologue the prologe of the prioresses tale domine dominus noster oh lord oh lord how great is thy name how thy marvels are spread over the world the wise men of the earth praise you the little children pray to you the suckling infants proclaim you and your glory i will praise you too out of my own poor mouth i am a feeble woman but i hope to find you in my heart i hope to find words in honour of you lord and of the purely white lily blessed virgin who bore you i will tell my story for her sweet sake i cannot increase her honour of course since she is the root and source of all virtue she and her blessed son are the salvation of the world oh mary full of grace the unburned bush burning in the sight of moses you who did receive the holy ghost descending from the seat of the lord god in humility of spirit you found the wisdom of god within you your heart was lightened by the weight of the lord oh holy virgin help me to tell my story hail holy mother no one can express your magnificence or your modesty who can number your virtues who can measure your bounty you guide men into the light of the lord you anticipate their prayers and plead for them before the throne of the almighty my learning and knowledge are so weak holy virgin that i cannot express your mercy or your love your light is too bright for me to bear i come to you as an infant scarcely able to speak form my broken words uttered in praise of you guide my song the prioresss tale heere bigynneth the prioresses tale in a great asian and christian city there once stood a jewish ghetto it was financed and supervised by a lord of that place intent upon making as much profit as he could from the vile practice of usury it is evil money accursed by christ and his saints yet the ghetto was open there were no gates and all the citizens could walk or ride through its main street there was a little christian school at the end of this street where its young pupils learned the rudiments of their faith year after year the children were taught how to read and how to sing in the way of all small boys and girls among these children was a widows son some seven years old he attended school every day his mother had taught him to kneel down and say a hail mary whenever he came across an image of the virgin his mother had told him that he must always pray to the blessed lady even in a crowded street and of course he obeyed her an innocent child learns quickly when i think of him i cannot help but recall the image of saint nicholas who at the same young age did reverence to christ this little boy was seated on his bench one day studying his primer when he heard some other children in the class singing out alma redemptoris in praise of the mother of our saviour he drew closer to them listening very carefully and after a while he had by heart the words and the notes of the hymn he could sing the first verse by rote he was too young to know what the latin words meant but then he asked a schoolfellow to explain it to him and to interpret it in simple language he went down on his knees and begged him so many times that his young friend eventually agreed to translate it for him then this fellow explained the hymn i have heard that this song he said was composed in honour of the blessed virgin it is meant to praise her and to beseech her to come to our aid when we are about to die that is all i know about it i am a chorister not a student of grammar so this hymn was written in honour of the mother of god the innocent boy asked him i am going to make sure that i have learned it by heart before the christmas season i dont care if i am scolded for not attending to my lessons i dont care if i am beaten three times a day i am going to learn this song in honour of our lady so his comrade taught him the words syllable by syllable until he could repeat them without any mistakes he began with the first verse as i lay upon a night my thought was on a maid so bright that men call mary full of might redemptoris mater he mastered the notes and sang out the hymn boldly wherever he went he sang it when he walked to school in the morning and when he came home again in the afternoon he was devoted to the praise of the virgin as i have said before this little boy always made his way through the ghetto on his way to school so he sang out alma redemptoris earnestly and brightly as he passed through the jewish quarter he was blissfully unaware of his surroundings he simply wanted to honour our lady but then the enemy of mankind satan himself rose up among the jews he was full of bitter poison oh people of the old testament he called out is this right is this fitting can you allow this child to walk among you uttering blasphemy it is against your reverence it is against your law so from that time forward the jews of the neighbourhood conspired against the little boys life they hired a murderer and told him to wait in a dark alley close to the route of the child on his way to school this cursed man seized the boy and cut his throat then he buried him in a pit it was a cesspit where the jews were accustomed to squat and shit oh cursed people children of herod what will be the consequence of your evil deeds murder will out that is certain enough the blood of the murdered boy will cry out the children of god will hear the voice oh holy christian martyr pure virgin child you will now sing for ever in the halls of eternity you will be the companion of the white celestial lamb you will be one of those seen in visions by the great evangelist saint john of patmos you are one with the virgin martyrs who sing perpetually the poor widow the mother of the young boy watched and waited all that night but he did not return home at first light she left the house and with pale and careworn face she searched the streets for any sign of him she enquired after him at the school and there she learned that he had last been seen singing in the ghetto so the poor woman followed the footsteps of her child and half out of her mind with grief she visited all those places where she hoped that he might still be found she called out to the blessed virgin and begged her for help then she began to walk among the jews themselves asking whether any of them had seen her small son of course they all denied even so much as glimpsing him but the grace of jesus entered her heart and guided her to the place where her son had died she came into the alley where the cesspit had been dug in which his little body was buried oh great god whose praises are sung in the mouths of the innocent how great is thy power this is what happened this jewel of chastity this emerald of innocence this ruby of martyrdom sat up in his filthy grave and with his throat cut from ear to ear began to sing he sang alma redemptoris in a clear strong voice that could be heard throughout the ghetto all the christian people in the neighbourhood gathered together to watch this miracle they called for the magistrate at once and he arrived very quickly he heard the boy singing he gave thanks to christ and to our saviours heavenly mother before ordering that all the jews of the quarter should be arrested the child was borne on the shoulders of the crowd and carried in procession to the abbey he sang all the way his mother was carried fainting beside him no one could persuade her to leave the side of her small son she was another rachel inconsolable for loss of her child the magistrate ordained that the jews with knowledge of the murder should be put to death immediately in the most shameful and terrible way he could not countenance their unholy crime some of them were torn apart by horses some were hanged drawn and quartered evil shall they have he said that evil deserve the little child lay upon a bier before the high altar where a mass was said for the sake of his soul after the service was over the abbot and the monks made haste to bury the child in consecrated ground and as they sprinkled holy water over the bier the child once more rose up and sang alma redemptoris the abbot was a saintly man the monks were holy too or ought to have been so the reverend father began to question the boy dear child he said to him i beseech you i call upon you in the name of the blessed trinity why are you singing how can you sing when your throat is cut from side to side my throat is cut as deep as my neck bone the child replied in the course of nature i would be long dead but jesus christ has deemed it fit that his power should be known to the world he has performed this deed in honour of his sacred mother the blessed virgin that is why i am able to sing alma redemptoris i have always loved the virgin above all others she is in the light of my faulty understanding the source of grace and mercy she appeared before me at the moment of my death and asked me to sing this hymn in her honour you heard it when i had finished singing it seemed that she placed a small grain of seed upon my tongue wherefore i sing again more clearly than before in praise of mary until this seed is taken from my tongue i will sing ceaselessly she has told me everything my little child she said i will come for you when the seed is taken from your tongue do not be alarmed i will not forsake you the holy abbot then reached over to the boy and took the seed from his tongue whereupon the child died peacefully the abbot was so moved by this miracle that the salt tears ran down his cheek he fell to the ground upon his face and did not stir all of the monks then went down upon their knees weeping and calling upon the blessed virgin then they rose and with reverent hands took the child from his bier they placed him in a tomb of marble in the chapel of our lady he lies there still thanks be to god oh little saint hugh of lincoln you were also slain by the jews your death so short a time ago is still fresh in our memory pray for us sinners now and at the time of our death may god have mercy on our souls pray for us mother of god so that your grace may descend upon us amen heere is ended the prioresses tale prologue to sir thopas bihoold the murye wordes of the hoost to chaucer all of the company seemed grave and reflective at the end of the prioresss tale but then the host changed the mood by making a joke at my expense he looked at me and winked at the others what sort of man are you he asked you look as if you are trying to catch a rabbit all you ever do is stare down at the ground come closer to me thats better look up smile fellow pilgrims this is a good man you see the extent of his waist its just like mine he is a big boy i am sure that some nice young woman would love to embrace him plump though he is yet he is always abstracted he is always miles away come on man tell us a funny story the others have now it is your turn host i said dont take this personally but i dont know any stories i cant tell any stories all i can recall is an old rhyme that i learned in my childhood that will do harry bailey replied from the expression on your face i think it will be an interesting one sir thopas heere bigynneth chaucers tale of thopas the first fit listen carefully please to me and i will tell the company a funny little story at some time in history there was a knight and gent good at battle and at tournament what was his name sir thopas he lived in a far no distant country not very near the sea he dwelled in a city called hamelin famous for its porcelain his father was a rich man and grand in fact he ruled the entire land what was his name i dont know now sir thopas was a brave knight his hair was black his face was bright his lips were red as a carnation but then so was his complexion i could have said red as a rose but i will confine that to his nose how big was his nose enormous his hair was as yellow as mustard paste and he wore it right down to his waist his shoes were from the vendôme and his clothes were made in rome they were so expensive that his father looked pensive how much did they cost thousands he could hunt for wild rabbit and had acquired the habit of hawking for game he could wrestle and tame the most ferocious ox he could whip the bollocks off any contestant he was no maiden aunt there were many young virgins happy to slake his urgings when they should have been asleep but he did not so much as peep at them he was chaste as a lily and stayed so willynilly so it befell that on one morning just as the light was dawning sir thopas rode out on his steed in hope of doing daring deeds he held his lancet like a lord and by his side there hung a sword he made his way through forests dark where wolves howl and wild dogs bark he himself was after game which once more i rhyme with tame but listen while i tell you more of how sir thopas almost swore with vexation around him sprang weeds of every sort the fleabane and the meadowwort here were the rose and primrose pale and nutmeg seeds to put in ale whether it be fresh or stale or only good as slops in pail the birds were singing sweetly enough among the nightingales a chough was that a chaffinch on the wing or was it a dove just chattering he heard a swallow sing on high and then a parrot perched near by what a lot of noise and when he heard the birdies sing he was filled with love longing he spurred on his horse over briar and gorse until the beast was sweating it looked like it had been rutting with a mare thopas himself was exhausted he got down from his quadruped and lay stretched on the ground the horse was free at one bound it wriggled its arse and chewed on the grass fodder was solace woe is me thopas lamented why am i so demented for love i dreamed last night that i had caught a bright elfqueen under the sheets what sexual feats i accomplished if my dreams could come true what deeds would i do i really need a fairy queen no mortal girl is worth a bean all other women i forsake a fairy girl is all ill take in country or in town then up on to his steed he jumped in need of action with a fairy queen he rode along each hill and dale looking for that certain female then quite by chance he found a secret spot of magic ground the kingdom of the fairies in truth it was a little scary and wild and desolate he was not surprised to see a giant whose name was oliphiant he had a mace which he aimed at the face of thopas saying get out or i will give your horse a clout the queen of fairy lives in this aery abode it is not for you your horse is unwelcome too sir thopas turned red as rhubarb pie and said in angry voice i defy you oliphiant and i swear to aim my lance here where it hurts come out at break of day and i will show you my way of dealing with giants it was a good show of defiance then thopas rode away quite fast as oliphiant prepared to cast stones at him from a leather sling yet our fair knight had cause to sing when all the missiles missed their aim and were not fit to kill or maim the valiant warrior he was none the sorrier the second fit so gather round and hear the rest the giant came off second best and thopas of high renown decided to return to town he rideth over hill and dale to reach the ending of my tale it will not fail to amuse you his merry men commanded he to cheer him up with game and glee let there be a pageant in which i fight a ferocious giant then let the fairy queen appear and proclaim herself to be my dear paramour i ask no more then let the minstrels blow their trumpets and the drummers use their drum kits and the singers sing their tales of kings and queens and noble males like me of chivalry the flower ill be the hero of the hour they brought him wine they brought him spices they brought him cream and several ices they brought him gingerbread and mead they brought him damson jam on which to feed he had a sweet tooth then he decked himself in vestments fair sir thopas always knew what to wear in terms of shirts and other finery in armour he was inclined to be conservative just simple chain mail with a double brooch and ornamental nail was enough to protect him he had a bright helmet he had a bright spear there was no warrior his peer he had a fine shield to make his enemies yield and even flee the field his legs were cased in leather on his helmet was a feather it was hard to know whether he was more handsome than rich or if so which was which in his gorgeous display he outshone the day his spear was made of fine cypress but it boded war not peace his bridle shone like snow in sun and as for saddle there was none so polished in the world his banner was unfurled to taunt all foes to take him on and that is it that is the end of the second fit if you want to hear more i will oblige no need to implore the third fit now say no more i will continue to tell how thopas and his retinue fought against elves and giants and cannibals and monsters and tyrants there is no end you have heard of arthur and of lancelot but this knight could prance a lot better on his noble steed he was a good knight indeed sir thopas took the lead in chivalry so off he trotted on his charger this knight looked larger than life upon his helmet there rose a lily which looked sweet but silly the road ahead was hilly but he continued willynilly heere the hoost stynteth chaucer of his tale of thopas for gods sake stop the host said to me thats enough it is all so stale and oldfashioned you are giving me a headache with your corny rhymes where is the story here this is nothing but doggerel i beg your pardon i was very dignified will you please allow me to carry on you did not interrupt anyone else in any case i am doing the best i can the rhymes are not corny forgive me mr chaucer i must speak my mind your story is not worth a shit what is the point of it you are doing nothing but waste our time i have made up my mind no more versifying please can you not tell us an adventure or deliver some kind of prose narration which mingles entertainment with instruction gladly sir host i will tell you a little story in prose that will entertain you i think unless that is you are very hard to please it is a tale about the moral virtues of a patient and prudent wife it has been told many times before and in many ways but that doesnt bother me it is still a good story let me cite the example of the four gospels each one of them describes the passion and crucifixion of our saviour each of them has a different perspective but still manages to tell the essential truth of our lords suffering some say more and some say less some add details others are very brief you know who i am talking about of course i refer to matthew mark luke and john they have written four separate accounts but their basic meaning is the same please mr chaucer therefore lords and ladies do not be offended if i tell the story in my own way i may introduce more proverbs than there are in the original but i have the best of intentions i simply wish to increase the power of my message dont blame me if i change the language here and there i will deliver the gist of the story true and entire believe me i have no intention of spoiling the effect of this merry tale so now please listen to me and mr bailey please dont interrupt the monks prologue the murye wordes of the hoost to the monk stop stop harry bailey stood up in his saddle if that was the introduction i hate to think what the rest will be like and i am tired of stories about patient wives they do not exist take my wife for instance go on take her she is as patient as a mad bull when i chastise my servants she comes out with a great wooden stick and urges me on go on she says beat the shit out of them break every bone in their worthless bodies if by any chance one of our neighbours fails to greet her in church or slights her in some other way she makes me pay for it when we get home you fool you coward she shouts at me all the time waving her fists near my face you cant even defend your wife against insults i should be the man around the house here you can have my distaff and go spin a shift she can nag me like this all day long it is a shame she says that i should have married a milksop rather than a man you have about as much spine as a worm anyone can walk over you if you cannot stand up for your wifes rights then you do not stand for anything so it goes on day after day unless i choose to make a fight of it but whats the point i just leave the house otherwise i would work myself into a state of madness she makes me so wild that i swear to god she will make me kill somebody one of these days i am a dangerous man when i have a knife in my hand it is true that i run away from her but she has huge arms and strong wrists as anyone who has crossed her will know anyway enough of her our host then turned to the monk my lord he said god be with you it is your turn to tell a story look we are already coming up to rochester it is time for you to ride forward and speak but in truth i dont know your name what shall i call you john or thomas alban perhaps thats a good monkish name and what house do you come from sir are you from selby or from peterborough your skin is very fair and very soft you are not used to hard labour and you are not likely to be a penitent or a flagellant my guess is that you are an official of your house you are a sacristan perhaps or a cellarer in charge of all the wines am i right i am sure that you are in a position of authority that is clear from your appearance and your behaviour you have the manner of one who leads you are no novice you look strong and fit too you could look after yourself in a fight what a mistake it was to introduce you to the religious life you could have been good breeding stock a big cock among the hens if you had followed the call of nature you would have fathered many lusty children no doubt about it it is a pity that you wear the cope of office i swear to god that if i were pope i would give a dispensation for every strong and lusty monk to take a wife otherwise the world will shrink to nothing the friars and the monasteries are full of good english spunk and we laymen are nothing but drips in comparison frail shoots make a weak harvest our wills and our willies are so weak that nothing comes from them no wonder that wives queue up for the attentions of you monks and friars you have got venus on your side you dont pay in counterfeit coin you have the genuine article beneath your robes dont be cross with me sir i am only joking but of course theres many a truth in a good joke in fact the monk took the hosts jesting in good part i will play my part in this pilgrimage he said by telling you a tale or two they will be moral tales of course that is the mark of my profession if you like i can narrate the history of saint edward the confessor or perhaps you would prefer a tragedy i know hundreds of them you know what a tragedy is i suppose it is a story from an old book it concerns those who stood in authority or in prosperity only to suffer a great fall they went from high estate to wretchedness and misery their stories are sometimes told in verses of six metrical feet known as dactylic hexameters da da dum dum da da homer uses it but sometimes they are told in other metres in england we have alliteration then again they are often told in plain prose have i said enough on that subject the host nodded now listen if you wish i cannot promise that i will tell you these stories of popes of emperors of kings in chronological order i will just mention them as i remember them forgive my ignorance my intentions are good so the monk began the monks tale heere bigynneth the monkes tale de casibus virorum illustrium so i will lament in the manner of tragedy the fate of those who once stood in high degree they fell so far that they could not be rescued from the darkness when the doom of fortune has been decided no one can avert its course never rely upon prosperity that is the lesson of these little histories lucifer i will begin with lucifer i know that he is an angel rather than a man but he is a very good example to us all fortune cannot help or harm an angel of course nevertheless he fell from heaven into hell where he still resides oh lucifer son of the morning you can never escape from the flames of the inferno you have become satan how you have fallen adam behold adam lying in eden now known as damascus he was not made from human seed but wrought by gods own finger he ruled over all of paradise with the exception of one tree no human being has ever been so blessed as adam yet for one bad act he fell from grace he was consigned to a fallen world of labour and misery sampson behold great sampson heralded by an angel before his birth consecrated to almighty god while he retained his sight he was the noblest of all no one in the world was stronger or more courageous yet foolishly he told the secret of his strength to his wife in doing so he condemned himself to death this mighty champion slew a lion and tore it to pieces with his bare hands he was on his way to his own wedding and he had no weapons his wife knew how to please him with her wicked wiles and could coax all of his confidences out of him then she betrayed him to his enemies and took another man in his place in his anger he took up three hundred foxes and bound them together by their tails then he set the tails on fire with a burning torch tied to each one and with them he set ablaze all the cornfields in the land he destroyed the olive trees and the vineyards in his rage he killed a thousand men although his only weapon was the jawbone of an ass after they were slain he was tortured by a thirst so great that he turned to god for help he prayed him to send water or else he would die lo and behold a miracle occurred from the molar tooth of this dry jawbone there sprang forth a fountain of water with which sampson refreshed himself so god saved him all this really happened you can read about it in the book of judges then one night in gaza despite the presence of all the philistines in that city he tore up the entrance gates and carried them on his back he took them to the top of a hill where everyone could see them oh noble sampson fine and courageous warrior you would have been without equal in the world if you had not whispered your secret to your wife sampson never drank wine or strong liquor he never cut his hair or shaved himself what was the reason he had been told by a divine messenger that all of his strength lay in his hair he ruled israel for twenty years yet bitter tears would fall down sampsons cheeks one woman would lead him to destruction he had told delilah where his strength lay she sold the secret to his enemies and while he slept in her arms one night she took a pair of shears and cut off all his hair when his enemies burst in upon them they were able to bind sampson before putting out his eyes when he still had his hair there was no one in the world who could defeat him after he was blinded and shorn he was consigned to a cavernous prison where he was forced to labour at a mill with slaves sampson was the strongest of humankind he was a fearless judge a wise and noble man yet his fate was to weep out of blind eyes bitterly mourning his wretchedness let me tell you the final chapter of this sad story his enemies celebrated with a great feast and called sampson before them to play the part of a jester the setting was a hall of marble pillars here sampson stood his ground and took his revenge upon them all he took hold of two pillars and shook them so violently that the whole building collapsed he was killed but so were those who had enslaved him the leaders of the country and three thousand of their followers were among the dead who lay among the ruins of the hall i will say no more about sampson but remember the moral of this tale husbands must never tell their secrets to their wives their lives might depend on it hercules let us praise famous men and principal among them mighty hercules in his lifetime he was the flower of might he killed and skinned a lion he overthrew the centaurs part human and part horse he slew the harpies winged spirits of death he stole the golden apples of the hesperides he drove back cerberus the hound of hell what else he slew the cruel tyrant busirus and forced his horse to eat him flesh and bone he strangled a serpent while he was still in his cradle he broke off one of the two horns of achelous he destroyed cacus in a cave of stone he overcame and killed the mighty giant antheus he slew the wild boar of mycenae he even held the heavens upon his shoulders no man in myth or history has killed so many monsters and prodigies as hercules his fame spread all over the world he was renowned for his beauty as much as for his strength he visited every kingdom and was welcomed everywhere no man could defeat him one commentator says that he was able to raise pillars to mark the eastern and western boundaries of the known world this noble warrior had a lover her name was deianira and she was as fresh as the first day of may the old writers tell us that she was busily employed in knitting him a shirt as women do it was bright and colourful but it had one fault it was suffused with a fatal poison hercules had worn it only for a few hours when the flesh began to fall from his bones some learned men tell us that a man named nessus was responsible for making this shirt i do not know i will not accuse deianira i only tell you what i have read as soon as hercules had put on the shirt the flesh on his back began to bake and harden when he realized that there was no remedy he threw himself into the hot coals of a fire he did not want to die by poison it was too undignified so died hercules a mighty and worthy man who can trust the dice that fortune throws anyone who makes his way in the difficult world must know that misfortune and disaster are always at hand the only remedy is selfknowledge beware of dame fortune when she wants to mislead or to deceive she chooses the least predictable path nebuchadnezzar no one can conceive or describe the majesty of this mighty and glorious king no one can count his wealth or estimate his power twice he conquered jerusalem and stole all the sacred vessels of the temple he took them back with him to babylon where they were laid down reverently with his other treasures he had captured the royal children of israel and had ordered them to be castrated then they became his slaves daniel was among them and even then he was judged to be the wisest of all it was he who could interpret the dreams of the king when the kings own seers and magicians were baffled by them clever boy then nebuchadnezzar ordered a statue of gold to be fashioned sixty cubits in height and seven cubits in breadth he ordered all of his subjects to worship and make sacrifice to this golden image on pain of death anyone who disobeyed his command would be flung in a fiery furnace yet daniel and two of his young cousins refused to bow down before it the great king was filled with pride and was fully conscious of his might he believed that god himself could not challenge him or deprive him of his power little did he know this proud king was humbled suddenly and reduced to the condition of a beast of the field he imagined himself to be an ox he lay with the herd and ate their food he walked on all fours and munched on grass his hair grew like an eagles feathers and his nails became as long as an eagles talons after a number of years had passed god gave him back his reason with the return of his humanity nebuchadnezzar wept he thanked god and promised that he would never again trespass into sin he kept that oath until the day of his death god be praised for his justice and his mercy belshazzar the name of his son was belshazzar and he reigned over babylon after his fathers death yet he did not heed the warning or the example of nebuchadnezzar he was proud in heart fierce and an idolater he lived in high estate but then suddenly fortune cast him down there were divisions within his kingdom he gave a feast for all the nobles at his court and bid them all to be of good cheer he told his servants to bring out the sacred vessels that his father had taken from the temple at jerusalem we will pour libations to our gods he said in honour of my fathers victories over the jews so his wife his lords and his concubines poured wine into the holy chalices of the lord and drank their fill but then belshazzar happened to look around gesturing for a servant when he saw a hand writing very quickly on the wall there was a hand and nothing else no arm no body of course the king was aghast and shook with fear he looked with horror upon the words that had been written mane techel phares none of the wise men in the kingdom could interpret these three words only daniel knew the secret of the saying great king he said almighty god gave power and glory to your father he loaded him with wealth and honour but your father was proud he did not fear or venerate the almighty so god sent him grief and wretchedness he took away his kingdom he took away his reason he was an outcast lost to human society his companions were the beasts of the field he ate the grass and the hay exposed to the elements until the time came when it was revealed to him that almighty god has dominion over all creatures only to him belong the power and the glory out of pity for the poor man god restored his humanity and gave him back his kingdom you sir his son are also filled with pride you are following your fathers sinful course and you have become an enemy of god you drank from the sacred vessels stolen from the temple you encouraged your wife and your concubines to do the same you are worse than a blasphemer you also worship false gods you will soon feel the force of the true gods wrath you ask about the hand that wrote those three words upon the wall it was sent by god trust me your reign is over you are now less than nothing your kingdom shall be divided given over to the medes and the persians on that same night belshazzar was assassinated darius ascended the throne although he had no right or claim to it so fellow pilgrims learn the moral of this story authority on earth is brittle power and wealth are transient when dame fortune goes against you you lose everything you lose your friends too a friend made when fortune smiles becomes an enemy when fortune frowns you know the proverb well enough cenobia cenobia queen of palmyra in syria was renowned throughout the world for her nobility no less than for her skill in arms no one could match her she was of royal blood descended from the kings of persia i will not say that she was the most beautiful woman in the world i will only say that in appearance she had no defects at all from her childhood she disdained feminine pursuits she did not want to stitch or sew she ran off into the woods and joined the hunt for wild beasts she liked nothing better than to let the arrows fly she was faster than the creatures she pursued and never tired when she was older she killed lions and leopards she ripped a bear apart with her bear hands she tracked them down she sought their dens and lairs she explored the mountains all night and when she was tired she slept beneath a bush she could wrestle any young man to the ground however strong he was nothing could withstand her force it is needless to say that she was still a virgin she would lie beneath no man but her friends eventually persuaded her to marry she betrothed herself to a prince of that country odenathus by name although she made him wait a long time for the ceremony you should realize too that he was as fanciful and as wayward as she was nevertheless they were happy they lived in married bliss except for one thing she insisted that he could have intercourse with her only once she wanted to have a child that was all she wished for if she discovered that she was not pregnant after the first time odenathus was allowed to do it again just the once of course if she was with child after that then her husband was not permitted to touch her for forty weeks then he would be allowed another go it did not matter if he complained or wept he got nothing more from her she used to tell him that sex for its own sake was a sin it was lechery and a reproach to all women she bore two sons whom she brought up to be virtuous as well as learned but let me tell you the story so here we have cenobia before us esteemed wise generous without being profligate she was indefatigable in war and modest in peace there was no one like her in the wide world her way of life was affluent beyond measure she was rich in treasures she was dressed in the finest robes of gold and pearl she still loved the hunt but she also strove to learn as many languages as she could she studied books earnestly trying to discover the most virtuous form of life to cut a long story short she and her noble husband were so expert in arms that they conquered many kingdoms in the east and occupied many famous cities in lands as far away as turkey and egypt no enemy could escape them at least while odenathus lived you may read all about their battles against shapur king of persia and against other monarchs you can learn about their victories and of their defeats petrarch my great master has told the story of cenobias downfall in abundant detail he has described how she was captured and taken it had all been going so well after the death of her husband her strength and courage seemed to be redoubled she fought so fiercely against her enemies that there was not a king or prince in that region who could withstand her so they made treaties with her and exchanged gifts with her they promised anything if she would only leave them in peace the roman emperor claudius dared not enter the field against her neither did his predecessor gallienus the kings of armenia and of egypt of syria and arabia all quailed before her they were terrified of being slain by her their armies in flight the two sons of cenobia were always dressed in regal garments as the legal heirs of their father their names were hermanno and thymalao but in fact cenobia ruled yet there came a time when sweet fortune turned sourly against her the queen was not mistress of her destiny she was doomed to fall from sovereign power and to experience sorrow and disgrace this is how it happened when the emperor aurelianus donned the imperial purple at rome he decided to take vengeance upon the queen of palmyra for all the insults the empire had suffered at her hands so he marched with his legions into her lands she fled from him but eventually he caught up with her and captured her he put her in chains together with her two sons and rode back with them to rome in triumph he carried with him her chariot of gold richly jewelled and ordered that it should be driven in his victory procession so that every roman might see it then cenobia herself was led before the people wearing her crown but pinioned with chains of gold this is the wheel of fortune the noble queen once the terror and the wonder of the world was now on display to the mob she who had led her troops in mighty battles and who had conquered castles and cities was brought low she had once borne a sceptre but now she carried a distaff with which to wind wool peter king of spain oh worthy peter noble king the glory of spain fortune raised you so high but now you are remembered only for your miserable death your own brother chased you from your realm and then you were betrayed by your enemies and led into his tent where he killed you with his own hands he took over your kingdom and your possessions he was as black as an eagle in a snowwhite field peter king of cyprus oh noble peter worthy king who won by your mastery the great city of alexandria you vanquished many heathens in the course of your career you were so triumphant that some of your own subjects envied you they killed you in your bed for no other reason than your nobility thus does dame fortune turn the wheel and bring men from glory to distress bernabo of lombardy i sing of you bernabo visconti lord of milan scourge of lombardy lover of ease and delight why should i not recount your misfortunes you were raised high only to be brought down by your brothers son your nephew cast you into prison and there you died i do not know the reason i do not know the killer ugolino count of pisa who can relate the suffering of ugolino count of pisa there was a dark tower a little way out of the city to which he was consigned he was imprisoned there with his three children the oldest of whom was only five years old what cruel fortune shut these little birds within a cage he was destined to die in that prison the bishop of pisa roger ubaldini had borne false witness and had stirred up the people against him so ugolino was confined with so little meat and drink that he despaired of his life there was a certain time each day when the gaoler brought his food into the cell ugolino was waiting for him at that time when suddenly he heard the great door of the tower closing he heard the sound clearly but he said not a word to his children but he knew in his heart that they would all now starve to death i wish that i had never been born he said to himself and he wept his youngest son three years old crept upon his lap father he said why are you crying when will the gaoler bring us our food do you not have any bread for us i am so hungry that i cannot sleep i wish that i could sleep for ever then i would never be hungry please give me bread so the poor child grew weaker and weaker each day eventually he climbed into his fathers lap and whispered to him farewell father i must go now the little boy kissed him on the cheek laid down his head and died when ugolino saw that his son was dead he gnawed his arms with grief lamenting the faithlessness of fortune i am bound upon the wheel he said his two surviving children were convinced that he was gnawing on his flesh out of hunger rather than grief the eldest of them implored him father he said do not eat your own flesh eat us instead you gave us life you have the right to take it from us our flesh is yours within a day or two both of the little boys were dead in his despair ugolino also laid down and died so ended the life of the mighty count of pisa drawn down into grief from high estate if you wish to read more about this tragedy you will find it in the pages of the great poet of italy known as dante he has written a detailed account of the last days of ugolino his words will live for ever nero the emperor nero was as great a fiend as any that dwells in hell yet as suetonius tells us in his lives of the caesars he was the master of the world from east to west and from north to south his robes were of the purest white silk and were covered with fine jewels he delighted in diamonds and in sapphires he was prouder and more pompous than any emperor before he was more fastidious than a maid and would never wear the same robes twice he used to fish in the tiber with nets of gold his caprices were turned into laws his lusts were always satisfied dame fortune smiled upon him he burned rome to ashes for his entertainment he killed all of the senators of that city just to hear how they groaned in their death throes he killed his brother and slept with his own sister he made sad work of his mother too he cut open her womb so that he could view the place where he was conceived that is how little he thought of her he did not cry at the sight of her ravaged body he merely observed that she had once been a finelooking woman how could he judge of her beauty when she lay dead before him then he called for wine and drank off a draught he showed no sign of remorse when strength is united with cruelty there breed monstrous offspring in his youth nero had a teacher who tutored him in literature and morals this man was the very flower of learning as the old books tell us and he managed to impart to his pupil all the lessons of civility nero then was compliant and obedient he hid his vices very well the teachers name was seneca he ruled over nero with words rather than deeds he did not punish him but he reproved wrongdoing sir he would say a good emperor must love virtue and hate tyranny what was his reward nero ordered that the wrists of seneca should be slit as he lay in a bath nero hated any authority placed over him in particular he always felt a grievance against seneca so the philosopher chose to die in the bath his blood in the water rather than endure any more grievous punishment that is the way the emperor slaughtered him there came a time however when dame fortune no longer favoured nero she detested his pride and she knew even though he was strong that she was stronger i cannot allow this vicious man to glory in his power and wickedness i will throw him from the emperors throne and when he least expects it he will suffer a great fall one night the people of rome rose up against him when he learned of the revolt he ran out of the palace and looked for allies among his confederates but their doors were closed to him he knocked upon their gates and cried for help but they did not listen he knew then that it was over he stopped crying out and went on his lonely way the uproar of the people continued there were shouts and oaths resounding through the streets and nero could hear them asking one another where is that false tyrant where is nero he was almost out of his mind with fear he prayed to his heathen gods for help but of course they could not assist him he knew that he was about to die and he ran into a nearby garden to hide himself there he found two peasants sitting around a large bonfire he begged and pleaded with these two men to kill him and to cut off his head he did not want to be recognized and shamefully mutilated after his death then he killed himself in front of them he had no choice dame fortune looked down and laughed at his fate holofernes behold holofernes the general of nebuchadnezzar there was no kings soldier more famous or more victorious there was no one stronger in battle there was no one more filled with pride and presumption fortune kissed him fondled him and then led him to a place where his head was cut off it happened before he knew it for the sake of their wealth and their liberty men held him in fearful respect he made his enemies renounce their faith nebuchadnezzar is your god he told them you shall worship no other deity no one dared to disobey him except in one city under siege bethulia where an elder named joachim was the high priest take heed of the death of mighty holofernes one night as he lay drunk among his army outside bethulia lying in a tent as spacious as a great barn he was murdered by a woman despite his power and his strength judith hacked off his head and unknown to anyone crept out of the tent and brought the severed head back to the town the illustrious king antiochus what need is there to describe the sovereign power of this man proud in intent and evil in deed there was no one in the world like him you can read of him in the book of maccabees you can read there too all of his vainglorious words then you will learn of his ruin and fall and of his death on a bare hillside dame fortune had so favoured him that he thought that he could touch the stars with his hand he believed that he could lift mountains and command the waves of the sea of all the people on the earth he hated gods chosen he tortured and killed them believing that their god had no power over him when he received the news of the defeat of his generals nicanor and timotheus he burned with wrath and hatred he commanded that his chariot be prepared and swore that he would not leave it until he had come to the gates of jerusalem where he would wreak his vengeance but god forestalled him the almighty smote him with a grievous wound invisible and incurable festering in his guts and causing him unendurable pain yet it was a fitting vengeance for one who had inflicted suffering on so many others even in his agony he pursued his evil purpose he ordered his army to prepare for battle but as he did so god crushed his pride antiochus was hurled from his chariot by an unseen force and his body was so badly mangled that the bones protruded through the flesh and skin he could no longer ride a horse he could no longer hold the reins so he was carried everywhere in a chair of state his body black with bruising the vengeance of the lord was soon complete his festering wounds had bred maggots beneath the skin and as the wicked worms crept through the body his flesh began to stink terribly none of his attendants could bear the smell of him sleeping or waking he fell into despair weeping all the time because he knew now that god alone was the lord of creation neither he nor those around him could endure the stench any longer they could not stay in his company so he was taken to a hillside where he was left in all his agony alone among the rocks he died so this thief and murderer ended his days with the just reward for all the pain he had caused to others he was killed by his own pride alexander do you know the old song some talk of alexander some talk of hercules well everyone knows the story of alexander it is common throughout the civilized world he conquered the whole world too and every sovereign was eager to make peace with him he laid low the pride of man and beast as far as the worlds end there is no comparison to be made between him and any other general the seas and continents quaked in fear of him he was the flower of chivalry and the lord of grace he was the heir of fortunes bounty he was so full of courage that nothing could divert his progress in arms nothing that is except for the charms of wine and women he does not need my praise why should i repeat his victories over darius king of the persians and of a hundred thousand other rulers generals and commanders as far as any man could ride or travel the land belonged to alexander he owned the world there is no more to say he was the son of philip king of macedon and the first high ruler of greece and he reigned for twelve years oh worthy alexander then fortune rolled the dice against you you lost the game your own people poisoned you no tears are enough to lament your fall in you died honour and nobility you conquered the world and yet that empire was not large enough for you are there words enough to describe false fortune and the horror of poisoning i dont think so julius caesar by dint of labour of wisdom and of strength caesar rose up from humble beginnings to the highest power he was the conqueror of the western world by force or by treaty all the nations were tributaries of rome at the time caesar became emperor but then dame fortunes wheel turned mighty caesar fought in thessaly against his fatherinlaw pompey the great pompey had a vast force made up of all the eastern nations as far as the rising of the sun yet the valour and strength of caesar conquered that eastern army only a few soldiers with pompey himself escaped from the battlefield so caesar became the object of awe in the east fortune was then his friend may i take a moment to lament the fate of pompey himself he fled the battle as i said but one of his men proved to be a foul traitor he cut off pompeys head and presented it to caesar in order to win favour the conqueror of the east was humiliated in death fortune had found another victim caesar returned in triumph to rome where wreathed in laurels he led the victory procession yet there were two romans brutus and cassius who had always envied his high estate they entered a conspiracy against caesar and chose a place where they could easily assassinate him with hidden knives caesar went in procession to the capitol one morning as he was wont to do where he was surrounded by his enemies and struck many times by their blades he lay there dying in his own blood but he did not groan at any of the blows against him except perhaps for one or two from those once closest to him caesar was so proud and so manly that he maintained his honour even in death he placed his toga over his waist so that no one might see his private parts as he lay dying and knew that his fate was drawing near he would not be shamed i recommend that you read this story in lucans pharsalia or else in suetonius they will tell you how dame fortune first favoured and then failed the two great conquerors caesar and alexander you cannot trust her smile keep an eye on her look what happened to all these heroes croesus croesus once king of lydia and enemy of cyrus the great was taken up in his pride and carried to the stake where he was to be burned to death but then there descended a great rain from the heavens that quenched the flames croesus escaped but he did not pay proper respect to dame fortune until he was suspended on the gallows when he had escaped from the consuming fire he could not wait to return to war he believed that fortune having rescued him with a rainstorm had also made him invincible against all of his foes he had a dream one night that increased his confidence and his vainglory this was the dream he was in a tree and jupiter there washed his entire body then phoebus brought him a towel with which to dry himself this was a good omen indeed he asked his daughter to interpret the dream to him she was skilled in all manner of prognostication the tree you saw she told him signifies the gallows the washing of jupiter signifies the rain and the snow the towel that phoebus brought you is an image of the suns warm rays you are going to be hanged father there is no doubt about it the rain will wash you and the sun will dry you so did his daughter whose name was phania warn him of his coming fate and indeed he was hanged the proud king ended on the gallows where his royal estate could not save him the tragedies of the proud and the fortunate have the same burden they are threnodies of grief against the guile of dame fortune who kills where she might cure when men put their faith in her she fails them and covers her bright face with a cloud heere stynteth the knyght the monk of his tale the nuns priests prologue the prologe of the nonnes preestes tale hey the knight called out that is enough sir monk you have spoken justly i am sure it was all very true but a little sorrow goes a long way people cannot bear too much tragedy as for me i hate hearing about the sudden fall from fortune into sorrow i prefer to look on the bright side i like to hear of those poor folk who have attained great riches or happiness climbing up the ladder from low estate to wealth that cheers me up that is the story i wish to hear i agree with you harry bailey said one hundred per cent this monk has spoken at length about the tragedies of various people how did he put it fortune is covered with a cloud something like that but there is no point in wailing and lamenting what is done is done as you said sir knight it is not an exciting subject our host then turned to the monk so sir no more if you please you are annoying the entire company your little homilies are not exactly entertaining there is no fun in them wherefore good monk peter is your name isnt it wherefore peter i beg you to tell us something different something amusing if it were not for the clinking of the bells on your bridle i would have fallen asleep listening to you i would have slipped from my horse and sunk in the mud who cares about holofernes or croesus there is an old saying used by preachers and teachers if a man has no audience he had better stop talking of course i am always ready to listen to a welltold tale why not a story about hunters and hunting im afraid not the monk replied my heart would not be in it let somebody else tell the next story so the host spoke out boldly and rudely come towards me you the nuns priest over there tell us something that will lift our spirits be merry be daring i see that you are riding on a poor nag of a horse but that should not stop you as long as it can carry you it has my blessing so make us laugh willingly good sir the nuns priest said i will be as cheerful as you could wish so then this sweet priest began his story to the company of pilgrims the nuns priests tale heere bigynneth the nonnes preestes tale of the cok and hen chauntecleer and pertelote once upon a time a poor widow somewhat stooped by age was living in a tiny cottage it was situated in a valley and stood within the shadow of a grove of trees this widow had led a simple existence ever since the death of her husband she had few cattle and fewer possessions she had two daughters and between them they owned three large sows three cows and a sheep called molly the walls of her little house were thick with soot but this is where she ate her simple meals she had no use for spices or dainty food since her modest repast came from the produce of her farm she was never flatulent from overeating a temperate diet physical exercise and a modest life were her only medicines she was never hopping with the gout or swimming in the head from apoplexy she never touched wine white or red in fact her board was made up of black and white black bread and white milk with the occasional rasher of bacon or newlaid egg she was a dairywoman after all her small farmyard was protected by a palisade of sticks with a ditch dug all around it here strutted a cock called chanticleer there was no cock in the country that crowed louder than this bird his voice was more impassioned than the organ that is played on mass days in church his crow was better timed and more accurate than the clock on the abbey tower by natural instinct he knew the movements of the sun whenever it covered fifteen degrees across the sky he began to crow as mightily as he was able his comb was redder than the coral of the sea and it had more notches than a castle battle ment his legs and toes were a beautiful shade of azure just like lapis lazuli and his nails were as white as the lily flower his feathers were the colour of burnished gold chanticleer had seven hens in his household they were his companions and his concubines devoted to his pleasure they were as brightly coloured as he was and the brightest of them was a hen called pertelote what a gentle kind and attentive bird she was she carried herself so nobly and was so affectionate that chanticleer had loved her ever since she was seven days old he could not get enough of her you should have heard them crowing together at dawn harmonizing on the words my love has left me in those days of course the birds and the animals could all speak and sing so it happened that one morning at dawn chanticleer sat on his perch among his seven wives beside him was sitting pertelote suddenly he began to groan and moan just like someone who is having a bad dream when she heard him she became alarmed dear heart she asked him what is troubling you why are you crying out in this way you are asleep i suppose please wake up chanticleer opened one eye ma dame he replied dont be alarmed god knows i have just had a frightful dream my heart is still fluttering beneath my feathers i hope everything turns out for the best i hope that my dream does not prove prophetic tell me i dreamed that i was walking up and down the yard here when i saw a savage beast very much like a wolfhound it was about to take me in its jaws and swallow me it was a tawny colour somewhere between orange and red but its tail and ears were black it had a horrible little snout and its eyes glowed like burning coals it gave me such a fright i can tell you that must have been the reason i was groaning shame on you pertelote replied what happened to your courage now you have forfeited all my love and respect i cannot love a coward for gods sake whatever we women may say we all want husbands who are generous and courageous and discreet too of course we dont want to marry misers or fools or men who are afraid of their own shadow and we dont like boasters how dare you say to your wife and paramour that you are afraid of anything do you have a mans beard without a mans heart for shame and why are you afraid of dreams they mean nothing they are smoke and mist they come from bad digestion or from an overflow of bile i am sure that this dream you describe is a direct result of your bilious stomach which leads people to dream of flaming arrows of orange flames and of tawny beasts that threaten them bile is the red humour after all it stirs up images of strife and of yelping dogs just as the melancholy humour provokes the sleeping man to cry out about black bulls and black bears and black devils i could give you a list of the other humours and their effects but i will forbear suffice to say what cato said that wise man declared that there was no truth in dreams so husband when we fly down from our perch remember to take a laxative i swear on my life that you need to purge yourself of all these bad humours you must shit out your bile and your melancholy as soon as possible i know that there is no apothecary in the town but i will teach you what medicinal herbs to chew we can find them in the farmyard here and they will cleanse you below and above you are choleric by complexion of course with your red crest and comb beware that the midday sun does not find you full of hot properties if it does you will fall into a fever or a chafing sickness that will kill you i know it so let us find some worms to aid your digestion they can be followed by spurge laurel centaury and fumitory why are you making that face i can pick you some nice hellebore and some euphorbia i know for a fact that ground ivy grows in the garden just take a stroll there and eat some of it stay cheerful husband i beg you there is nothing to fear from a silly dream i can say no more ma dame chanticleer said thank you for your advice can i bring up the subject of cato you are right to say that he was of great renown as a teacher and that he did dismiss the importance of dreams but there are other authorities all of them mentioned in the old books who are even more learned than cato they take quite the opposite position they have proved by experience that dreams are intimations of the joys and woes that people will suffer in this existence there can be no argument about it it is a fact of life one of the greatest authors tells the following story two young men had gone on pilgrimage in sincere devotion when they came into a town so full of fellow pilgrims that they could not find an inn for the night there was not a bed to be had for either of them so they decided to split up and separately find whatever accommodation there was one of them ended up for the night in a cattlestall surrounded by oxen while the other had more luck and secured reasonable lodgings that is what luck does it favours one over another it is the way of humankind so the more fortunate of them was sleeping in bed when he was visited by a bad dream he dreamed that his companion was calling out to him in distress i will be murdered he cried in an oxstall it will happen to me tonight come and help me friend before it is too late the sleeper woke with a start and sat up in bed but when he was fully awake he turned back to sleep again it was just a dream after all but then he had the same nightmare again it was followed by a third vision when his friend appeared before him covered in blood i am slain he said behold the wide and deep wounds that cover me arise at dawn tomorrow and walk down to the west gate of the town you will find there a cartload of dung my corpse is hidden there be bold arrest the carter at once i was murdered for my gold you see then the apparition with pale face and sorrowful eyes told the whole story of his killing in the cattlestall this was no false dream i can assure you on the very next morning the man went down to the cattlestall and called for his companion the carter came up to him and told him that his fellow had already left town he had gone at dawn of course the young pilgrim was suspicious having in mind the dream of the night before so he went at once to the west gate of the town and there just as he had been informed in his dream he found the cartload of dung ready to manure the land then he cried out harrow and vengeance he told the townsmen that the body of his friend and companion lay buried here having been foully murdered he called out for justice he demanded that the authorities of the town take action there has been a murder the corpse of my friend lies here what do i need to say the people tipped the cart on to its side and there among the shit was the body of the dead man chanticleer ruffled his feathers with a little shiver of disgust before going on oh god in heaven you are just and true see how you have revealed the truth murder will out that is the saying murder is so abominable a crime that god will not allow it to be concealed it may take a year or two or three but eventually it will be revealed and seen for what it is the authorities took the carter and tortured him until he confessed then he was hanged and his corpse cut down from the scaffold so you see dear pertelote the real meaning of dreams in the same book in the very next chapter there was another true story two men were about to pass over the ocean to a distant country but the wind was against them so they decided to stay in the city beside the harbour then on the following day in the evening the wind had become favourable the two men went to their beds in good spirits in full expectation of being able to sail the next day but listen one of these men had a strange dream he thought he saw a man standing beside his bed telling him to stay behind and not to sail if you leave tomorrow he said you will be drowned there is no more to say the man woke and rousing his companion told him what he had seen and heard he begged him to postpone the journey but the fellow laughed and made fun of him i will never allow a dream he said to dictate my life you must be joking dreams mean nothing at all men may dream of owls and apes and monstrous things men dream of events that have never been and never will be but since i can see that you are determined to stay here and lose the tide i must leave you god knows i will miss your company but so it must be farewell so he took his leave and went his way then it happened i do not know how or why midway across the ocean the ships hull was breached the crew and passengers drowned there were other ships sailing with them having left on the same tide but they were undamaged therefore pertelote dear chick from such examples you may learn that there is truth in dreams i advise you not to ignore them you do so at your peril i was reading the life of saint kenelm the other day he was the son of kenelphus the king of mercia in times gone by shortly before he was murdered kenelm dreamed that he was about to be killed he told his nurse about the dream and she advised him to be careful and to watch out for traitors but he was only seven years old he was too young and too innocent to pay much regard to his dreams but all came to pass he was murdered by his own sister it is a most terrible story which i advise you to read dame pertelote my love listen to what i have to say the honourable macrobius wrote a commentary on cicero s dream of scipio in which he declared that dreams can foretell the future not all of them i grant you that but some of them then if you wish dip into the old testament and see what is written in the book of daniel about the subject you can read about joseph and about his dreams of the sheaves and of the sun what about the pharaoh of egypt ask his butler and his cook whether dreams mean anything they were rightly interpreted by joseph for good or ill wherever there are true histories of mankind there are reports of dreams and omens remember the king of lydia croesus who dreamed that he was sitting in a tree of course he was soon hanging on a gallows and there was andromache the wife of hector who dreamed that on the following day her husband would be slain in battle she tried to persuade him to avoid the field but of course the dream came true hector was slain by achilles outside the walls of troy it is a long story it is almost dawn i will say only this i know from my dream that i will suffer some kind of misfortune in any case i do not need laxatives i hate them i distrust them they are poison so my dear let us speak of merry things god has given me one great blessing it is you my chick whenever i see your lovely face with your beautiful red eyes and your gorgeous beak i am happy my fears dissolve i know it has been written that woman is mans ruin but i prefer the other saying woman is mans delight and bliss when i feel your soft feathers at night i cant fuck you of course because our perch is too narrow i feel safe and relaxed i am so full of joy that i defy all the dreams in the world and with that he flew down from his perch into the yard it was dawn with a crow and a cluck he woke up all of his wives to feast on the corn scattered on the ground he was manly he was king of the yard he put his wings around pertelote and fucked her at least twenty times before the sun had risen much higher he looked as strong as a lion he did not strut in the yard like a common bird he walked on tiptoe as if he were about to rise in the air whenever he spied some more corn he clucked some more and all his wives came running over i will leave you with this picture of chanticleer monarch of all he surveys and carry on with the story it was the beginning of may may to be exact chanticleer was strutting up and down the yard with his seven wives by his side he glanced up at the sky and saw that the sun had entered the sign of the bull by instinct and nothing else he realized that it was coming up to nine oclock so he crowed his heart out the sun he said to pertelote has climbed forty degrees by my reckoning no i tell a lie fortyone degrees my dear chick listen to the singing of your sister birds just look at the bright flowers bursting into bloom my heart is full yet in a moment ill fortune would befall him the end of joy is always woe god knows that happiness in this world is fleeting if there was a proper poet to hand he could write all this down in a book as a sovereign truth but you must listen to me and learn i swear to you that this story is as true as the adventures of sir lancelot fervently believed by all good women i will continue there was a fox tipped with black from head to toe who was a very model of slyness and iniquity he had dwelled in a forest near the old womans cottage for three years the previous night as high fortune had dictated the fox burst through the hedge that protected the yard where chanticleer and his wives were accustomed to take the air he lay concealed in a bed of cabbages until the following morning ready to seize the proud cock at the first opportunity that is what assassins do when they are waiting for their prey they hide and they plot oh false murderer lying among the cabbages you are no better than judas iscariot you are worse than genylon who betrayed brave roland you false traitor you are another synon who caused the wooden horse to be brought into troy oh chanticleer you will curse the morning when you flew down from your perch you were forewarned in your dreams that this day would be hurtful to you but you spread your wings none the less well as some wise clerks say what will be will be god has made it so there is much debate and argument on the point among the schoolmen thousands of them have disputed on the claims of free will and necessity i really dont have the wit to solve the conundrum augustine has tried boethius has tried thomas bradwardyn has tried remember him there are those who believe that all is predestined and prejudged in the fathomless mind of god but there are others who distinguish between providence and destiny it is not necessary that things happen because they have been ordained but rather things that do happen have indeed been ordained it is too much for me i am telling a tale of a cock and a fox that is all i am relating the sad story of a bird that was persuaded by his wife to ignore his dream and to strut around the farmyard the advice of women is often fatal it was a womans advice that led to all our woe i am talking about eve who advised adam out of paradise he had been happy there if i have offended anyone among you dear pilgrims take it in good spirit i am only joking consult the authors who know about such things read what they have written about women in any case these are the words of the cock they are not mine i mean no harm to any female dame pertelote and her sister birds were all merrily scratching in the sand and taking a dustbath in the sunshine and joyous chanticleer was singing more sweetly than the mermaids of the sea theobaldus in his bestiary reveals the sweetness and the purity of the mermaids song he was watching a butterfly fluttering idly among the cabbages when suddenly he became aware of the fox lying among the stalks he was not inclined to crow any more instead he cried out cok cok and started up in abject terror an animal desires to flee from its natural enemy even if he has not seen one of them before it is instinctive so chanticleer was about to run away in fear of his life but the fox began to talk to him in a mild and wellmannered way gentle sir he said dear oh dear where are you going are you afraid of your friend may i be damned to hell if i harm a feather on your back i have not come here to spy on you i have been lying here so that i could hear you sing truly you have a marvellous voice more melodious than that of any angel in heaven you have more grasp of song than boethius who wrote a book on the subject i remember well when your father an excellent fellow and your dear mother honoured my poor house with their presence i would be pleased to invite you there also as for singing my ears do not deceive me apart from your good self your father had the best crow i have ever heard his morning call was delicious he sang from the heart he used to strengthen his voice by standing on tiptoe and stretching out his neck as far as it would go he tried so hard that he became crosseyed with the effort he was so expert in the art that there was no other bird in the region who could match him he was the greatest songster i have read that book about the ass burnellus in which a cock gets his revenge upon a young man as a boy he had broken the leg of the bird on the day of the mans ordination the cock refuses to crow and the man sleeps through the ceremony yet there can be no comparison with the wisdom and subtlety of your father as i said he had no rival will you sing for me now good sir will you prove to me that you are your fathers son so chanticleer rose up and beat his wings he allowed flattery to overturn his judgement he did not see an enemy but an audience oh lords and ladies there will be many flatterers and timeservers in your retinues they will please you more than those who tell the truth but take care read ecclesiastes there may be treachery at court so chanticleer stood up on tiptoe stretched his neck and closed his eyes before beginning his song that was the moment that the fox jumped from the cabbage patch and seized the cock by the throat then he ran off into the wood with no one in pursuit destiny cannot be averted fate will have its way if only chanticleer had not flown down from his perch if only pertelote had taken her husbands dream more seriously all this happened on a friday by the way it is well known to be an unlucky day oh venus goddess of love this cock was your most fervent devotee he did everything in his power to serve you he did it all for pleasure not to fill the world with more birds how can you allow him to die i wish that i had the eloquence of geoffrey of vinsauf who wrote a famous elegy when his sovereign richard of the lion heart was killed by an arrow why do i not have the words and the learning to lament this woeful friday why cannot i express my grief for the demise of the cock in the henrun itself there was such a wail of sorrow louder than the plaint the ladies of troy made when their city was taken the poor birds made more noise than hecuba on seeing the death of her husband at the hands of pyrrhus when chanticleer was taken off they screamed and what of pertelote she was beside herself she was frantic with grief in more agony than the wife of hasdrubal who was killed as carthage was destroyed in flame she was so full of torment and of rage that she hopped on to a bonfire and burned herself to death unhappy birds you cried as much as the wives of rome when nero burned down the city they watched their husbands perish in the flames they were guiltless of any crime but they were condemned to death let me return to the story when the poor widow and her two daughters heard the crying and confusion of the hens they rushed into the yard they were just in time to see the fox racing back to the wood with chanticleer in his grip so they called out harrow harrow the fox the fox havoc havoc they ran after him and they were joined in the pursuit by the whole village there was talbot and garland and malkyn still with her distaff in her hand the dog colin sprinted beside them with his tail up the cows and the calves even the pigs were roused by all the shouting and all the barking they were all running as if their hearts would break they were yelling as loudly as the fiends in hell the ducks were quacking up a storm the geese flew backwards and forwards the bees came out of the hive in a wild swarm the noise was so great that no london mob or riot over the price of wheat could equal it they screamed after the fox they blew their trumpets and beat their drums they sounded their horns they shrieked and whooped they made so much din that it seemed that the heavens might fall now good pilgrims i ask you to pay attention see how dame fortune can ruin the hopes and expectations of her enemies chanticleer caught in the jaws of the fox trembling with fear spoke out if i were you sir he said to his captor i would turn upon my pursuers now and taunt them i would tell them to go back from where they had come for good measure i would damn them to hell i would tell them that you are safely on the margins of the wood and that i will never escape from your jaws i would tell them that i am dead meat thats a very good idea the fox replied and at that moment as soon as he had opened his mouth chanticleer leaped out and flew up into a tree alas the fox cried looking up at him alas dear chanticleer i am embarrassed i am afraid that i have given you the wrong impression i must have frightened you when i grabbed you and ran out of the yard but i had the best intentions i meant you no harm come down from that tree and we can talk about it i will tell you the truth and nothing but the truth you must be joking the cock replied ill be damned if i am fooled again your flattery wont work any more i am not going to close my eyes and sing for you he who keeps his eyes shut deserves his misfortunes that is the lesson i have learned there is another lesson the fox said bad luck will come to one who opens his big mouth at the wrong moment so this is the moral do not be careless or impetuous do not trust flatterers some of you may think this is a cockandhen story a piece of foolishness but learn the moral at least as saint paul says you ought to be able to sift the wheat from the chaff that is good advice i will leave it there lords and ladies may we all lead good lives and go to heaven heere is ended the nonnes preestes tale the epilogue to the nuns priests tale well sir our host said to the nuns priest blessed be your bum and balls that story about chanticleer was one of the funniest i have heard if you were a secular i bet you would be a bit of a cock yourself you would be thrusting with the best of them seven would not be enough for you would it what about seven times seven or seven times seventeen you could keep going look at him fellow pilgrims look at his muscles observe that brawny neck and noble chest with his bright eyes he reminds me of a sparrowhawk there is no need for him to dye his hair with red powders he has that brilliant colour naturally thank you sir for an outstanding story and god be with you then our host turned to another pilgrim the second nun and in gentle voice invited her to tell her tale the second nuns prologue the prologe of the seconde nonnes tale i speak of that nurse and mistress of all the vices known in english as idleness that gate to sin and hell we must avoid it at all costs and instead cultivate a busy and useful life we ought to concentrate on work rather than on pleasure or else the devil may take us unawares satan has a thousand snares and traps ready to entice us if he sees an idle man he creeps up with his net in an instant the man not realizing the danger is caught and damned so i beg all of you to work hard and to avoid the sin of sloth and even if we have no fear of death and the world to come reason itself teaches us that idleness is the rotten soil from which no harvest can be gathered laziness is a laggard prepared only for sleeping and eating and drinking it consumes the goods of the world the fruit of others labour i am about to tell you a story that illustrates the foulness and folly of idleness the source of so much harm to all of us i am about to relate to you the glorious life and death of the holy blissful virgin whose wreath is crowned with rose and lily flower the maid and martyr saint cecilia invocacio ad mariam oh blessed mary the flower of all virgins i call upon you first to guide my pen you are the comfort of all sinners on the earth help me to tell the story of the maidens death and how through her martyrdom she won eternal life in the mansions of heaven hail holy mother of god well of mercy balm of sinful souls in whom our saviour chose to dwell for the sake of all mankind your humility has exalted you you have so sanctified our nature that god himself chose to take on flesh and blood within the blessed temple of your body the threefold god the centre of eternal love and peace took human form all creation sends up unceasing prayer and praise to father son and holy ghost you are the spotless virgin who carried in your womb the creator of the world you are the spring of mercy pity peace and love you are the source of virtue and of bliss you come to the aid of those who pray to you but out of your benignity you help others before they beseech you for comfort in distress you go before and heal their sorrow so help me now blessed maid in the valley of the shadow of death think of the woman from canaan who told your blessed son that even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the tables of their masters i know that i am a sinful and unworthy daughter of eve but please accept my faithful prayer faith is dead without good deeds allow me the time and place to perform works in your honour and thus avoid the darkness of hell hail mary full of grace i beg you to speak a word for me in the abode of bliss where there is eternal song daughter of anna blessed one mother of christ hosanna send your light to me in the darkness of the prison of this world lift from me the burden and contagion of the flesh save me from lust and all false affections you are the haven of refuge the solace and the comfort of all those in distress assist me now in my appointed task i ask that all those who hear and read this story will forgive my lack of grace i have no skill or subtlety in narration i am relying upon the words of one who so revered the saint that he wrote down her story it is to be found in the book known as the golden legend please pardon any of my faults for the sake of the holy martyr herself interpretacio nominis cecilie quam ponit frater jacobus januensis in legenda i will first interpret the name of cecilia and expound its meanings in terms of her life it means in english the lily of heaven alluding to her virginal chastity it also refers to the whiteness of her honesty the evergreen stalk of her conscience and the sweet savour of her reputation thus she is called lily cecilia may also mean in latin caecis via or the path for the blind this refers to her teaching and her example we also arrive at her name by conjoining heaven and lia caelo et lya heaven here means holiness and lia is the name of the active life in the world cecilia may also be construed as lack of blindness or caecitate carens the meaning is easy to understand the holy saint is filled with the great light of wisdom and of virtue then again her name may be the conjunction of heaven and leos or people coelo et leos and she is indeed the heaven of the people just as we may look up at the night sky and see the moon and the planets and the wandering stars so when we observe the heavenly maid we see the shining paths of faith and of wisdom as well as the bright constellations of virtue and of good works the philosophers tell us the seven spheres of heaven revolve quickly through the firmament sending out great heat so cecilia was always swift and busy in her good works she was as perfect in form as the celestial spheres and she burned continually with the fire of grace so i expound her name the second nuns tale heere bigynneth the second nonnes tale of the lyf of seinte cecile this holy maid cecilia came from rome she was of noble family and from her cradle she was brought up in the religion of christ she studied the gospels faithfully and all the time prayed that almighty god might preserve her virginity yet it was deemed necessary for her to wed her bridegroom valerian was a young man of noble descent when the day came for their marriage she retained all of her humility and piety beneath her golden wedding gown she wore a hair shirt next to her tender flesh while the organ played and the music filled the church cecilia sang a secret song in her heart to god oh lord she prayed preserve me undefiled in body and in soul for the love she bore to christ she vowed to fast on every second and third day spending those hours in prayer night fell and the time came for bed she must lie with her husband according to custom but before this took place she whispered to him my sweet and beloved husband i have something to say to you in confidence if i tell you this secret will you promise never to betray it he made the promise of course and swore an oath that he would never reveal what she said to him so she told him i have an angel that so loves me that he protects me night and day he stands guard over my body believe what i say if he should see you touching me for the purposes of love or of lust he will kill you at once you are still a youth but you will be slain but if you love and respect me in a clean and virginal way then he in turn will love and honour you he will demonstrate his joy to you valerian guided by the grace of god spoke softly to her if i am fully to believe you dearest wife let me see this angel for myself in all his brightness if he is truly an angel then i will accede to your wish but if this is a trick if you love another man you can be sure that i will kill you both with this sword cecilia answered him at once the angel will appear to you as you wish but first you must embrace the faith of christ and be baptized go to the appian way just three miles beyond the city speak to the poor people who dwell there and repeat what i am about to tell you tell them that i have sent you to them so that they might take you to the secret abode of old and saintly urban where you are to have private conference with him for the good of your own soul when you come face to face with this holy pope repeat to him the confidence i have already imparted to you when he has absolved you from your sins then you will see the angel valerian followed her instructions faithfully and travelled to the appian way there within the catacombs he was brought into the presence of the saintly urban he told him cecilias words and at once the old man lifted up his arms in wonder he cried for joy and prayed through his tears almighty god urban said jesus our saviour the shepherd of the world and the begetter of all virtue you have sown the seed of chastity in the body of the beloved maiden cecilia she obeys you in everything and works unceasingly for the greater glory of your name she has recently taken as her husband a young man as proud and fiery as a lion but he stands before me now with the meekness of a lamb there was a short pause after these words but then there appeared before valerian the figure of an old man dressed in robes of brightness in his hands he was carrying a book printed with words of gold at the sight of this valerian fell down in fear but the apparition lifted him to his feet and began to read to him from the book one lord one faith one god one christendom one father who rules over heaven and earth these were the words of gold when he had finished reading this text the old man asked valerian a question do you believe these words to be true yes or no i do believe valerian answered there are no words more true and blessed they are the hope of humankind then the old man vanished from sight and on the spot pope urban baptized valerian when the roman returned home he found saint cecilia his wife in the company of an angel the angel had two coronets in his hand one made up of lily and one of roses he gave the first of them to cecilia and according to the old books he gave the second one to valerian keep these coronets inviolate with a pure body and mind the angel told them i have brought them from paradise they will never wither or die their perfume will never fade the sinners of this world will not be able to see them only those who are chaste and innocent will have sight of them and you valerian who trusted the word of god so readily and so fully ask what you wish of me i will grant your favour i have a brother he replied there is no man i love more i pray that you grant my brother the grace to know the truth that has been revealed to me god is happy to fulfil your request the angel said both of you will win the palm of martyrdom one day you will both partake of the blessed feast at this moment valerians brother tiburce arrived at the mansion he smelled the sweet savour of the lily and the rose and he was bewildered i wonder he said how at this time of year the rose and the lily can be in bloom their perfume is so strong and deep that i might be holding them in my hands it has touched my heart and i feel reborn then valerian came up to him and welcomed him we have two coronets he told him lily white and rose red shining brightly they are invisible to you as yet but through my prayers you are able to sense their presence you will be able to see them dear brother as soon as you embrace the true faith are you saying this to me brother or am i dreaming we have been dreaming all our lives now we must wake and know the truth how do you know this how can you be sure i will tell you valerian replied an angel from heaven has taught me the truth you will know it as soon as you renounce the false idols of heathen worship saint ambrose has written about the miracle of these coronets of flowers in the preface to his mass for saint cecilias day that wise father of the church has declared that saint cecilia received the palm of martyrdom when she renounced the world and the flesh she was thereby filled with the grace of god witness the conversion of valerian and tiburce he writes as a token of her holiness that is why the angel brought down two sweet crowns from heaven this virgin has brought bliss to both these men the world will know the worth of truth and chastity in love then cecilia showed to tiburce the folly of worshipping false idols they are made of stone and wood they are deaf and dumb they are to be shunned who does not believe this tiburce told her is as dumb as wood and deaf as stone this is the truth i now know on hearing these words cecilia kissed his breast in token of their kinship i now take you as my faithful friend the blessed maid said just as the love of christ made me your brothers wife she added so now for the same love i take you as my kinsman and dear relation now that you have forsaken your false gods go with your brother and be baptized cleanse your soul then you will see the face of the angel tiburce turned to valerian will you tell me brother where are we going who will baptize me there is a man he replied come with me now in good heart and spirit i will take you to pope urban to urban are you taking me to see him that would be strange that would be wonderful are we talking about the urban who has so often been condemned to death about the man who is in perpetual hiding and dare not show himself if he were found or seen he would be consigned to the flames we also would keep him company in the fire while we are looking for the divine world concealed by the light of heaven on earth our bodies will burn is that the truth of it cecilia replied to him calmly if life on earth were the only life my dear brother then you would be right to fear death but it is not the only life there is a better life in another place that will last eternally fear nothing jesus christ has made a promise to us god the father has created all things in heaven and earth he has given reason to mortals god the holy ghost has through grace imparted to us the soul god the son when he took on human form in the world declared that there was another life to be won elsewhere dear sister tiburce said i dont understand you have told me just now that there is only one living god now you speak to me of three i will explain it to you now she replied you know that man has three faculties of the mind namely memory imagination and judgement so in the divine being there are three persons distinct and equal then she began to preach to tiburce about the coming of christ and told him of his passion and crucifixion she explained that christ came to earth in order to save mankind and to lift the burden of sin and woe derived from the original fault of eve when she had explained these things to her brother in faith tiburce was happy to accompany valerian into the presence of pope urban urban gave thanks to god for their conversion and gladly taught tiburce the principles of the christian faith before baptizing him he had become a knight of god he was filled with such grace that he saw the angel too each day whatever he prayed for he was granted it would be impossible to say how many miracles christ wrought for them yet there came a day when the bailiff of rome found them and arrested them then he brought them before the prefect of the city almachius who was well known to be an enemy of all christians he soon divined their faith and ordered them to go and worship at the temple of jupiter he turned to his officers i order you he said to take off the head of anyone who does not bow down before the image of the god one of these officers maximus bound the two martyrs and then weeping with pity he led them through the city of rome maximus heard the teaching of valerian and tiburce and was moved by it he was given leave by the other officers to take them to his own house where the two saints preached to him and to his family all the officers were present too and all were converted to the true faith by the holy words of the gospel cecilia herself came to the house late that night accompanied by priests who baptized all those assembled there afterwards at break of day she spoke to them in a clear calm voice you are all now warriors of christ jesus our saviour renounce the works of darkness put on the bright armour of righteousness you have fought a battle against the devil and you have won it your course is almost done and you have preserved your faith now take up the crown of eternal life god almighty will place it on your heads as the reward you deserve when she had finished some officers of the court arrived to take valerian and tiburce to the temple of jupiter when they were led before the image of the god they refused to make any sacrifice to it they declined to bow down before it or offer incense to the idol instead they fell to their knees and prayed to the true god so they were beheaded on the spot and their souls rose into heaven maximus was present at their execution and afterwards related that he had seen the souls of the two saints ascending to paradise in the company of bright angels he wept many times as he told this story to others but his tears converted them all to the true faith when he heard of this almachius ordered that he should be whipped to death with cords of lead saint cecilia then took up his body and buried it beside the graves of valerian and tiburce where they shared a simple stone but then almachius struck he ordered that the virgin should herself be taken to the temple of jupiter where she would be obliged to venerate the idol with incense but the officers of his court had been converted by her preaching they wept aloud and proclaimed their belief in the christian faith we believe that christ is the son of god they told him we believe that he was god in human form we know this to be true the holy maid is his servant we swear to this even if we are condemned to death when the prefect of the city heard of these things he ordered that cecilia should be brought before him he asked her first about her rank and degree i was born and raised a gentlewoman she told him now let me know this almachius replied what religion do you espouse what are your beliefs that is a foolish question sir you are asking me two things at once thats silly why are you so impudent to me almachius asked her why because i have a clear conscience because i have come here in good faith do you have no respect for my power your power is very small the authority of any man is no more than a bladder filled with wind the point of a pin will puncture it then there is nothing you began in the wrong tone now you are being offensive do you not know that the rulers of the land have ordained that all christians will be arrested and punished but if they renounce their socalled faith they will escape any penalty your rulers are mistaken you and the other nobles are also wrong you make us guilty by passing a foolish law you know very well that we are innocent of any crime we are christians who honour the name of christ that is all where is our offence we will never renounce the cause that we know to be true and just you have a choice almachius replied renounce your faith or suffer death there is no other way when she heard this cecilia began to laugh oh sir you are a simpleton do you think that i would renounce my innocence in order to become a sinner do you not see that you are making a fool of yourself you stamp and stare you rage at me as if you had lost your mind foolish woman you do not know the extent of my power the rulers of this land have given me the power of life and death over you and everyone else how dare you speak to me like that you are puffed up with pride i speak nothing but the truth i am not proud we have been taught as christians to hate the sin of pride and if you want to hear another truth then i will tell you this you have lied you have said that our rulers have granted you the power of life and death you can take away only the mortal life you have no other jurisdiction so you can be the minister of death but that is all enough of your impudence he said make sacrifice to jupiter then be on your way i do not care what you say about me i can endure that like a philosopher but there is one thing i will not permit i cannot allow you to speak ill of our native gods oh foolish man she replied you have said nothing to me that has not been vain and illconsidered you are an incompetent officer and a presumptuous judge you might as well be blind for all the good your eyes are cant you tell that this idol is made of stone you have announced that a piece of granite is a god put your hand on it if you cannot see it taste it cant you tell it is made of stone it is a shame that all the people will be laughing at you for your foolishness it is known that the lord god is in the heavens anyone can tell that these stone images are of no use or value do you not see that they have no purpose they are cold they are lifeless her words enraged almachius he ordered his officers to take her back to her house and there burn her to death bathe her in flame he said clean her they followed his orders literally they placed her in a bath pinioned her and then lit great fires beneath her that were fed with logs night and day all that night and for most of the next day she felt no pain she remained quite cool and did not burn there was not a drop of sweat upon her forehead yet she was still destined to die in that bath almachius frustrated of his purpose sent one of his servants to slay her as she lay there he took out his sword and three times he tried to behead her but this torturer did not succeed he could not take the head from the body it was forbidden by law to aim a fourth stroke at a victim and so with drawn sword he hesitated he dared not break the law so he left her in the bath half dead her neck badly mangled and went on his way the christian followers of cecilia then flocked to her house they brought sheets and towels with them to staunch the flow of her blood she endured this torment for three days during which time she spoke and preached to them all she bestowed her worldly goods upon them and blessed them she left them in the keeping of pope urban himself to whom she spoke these words i have asked this of god almighty i have begged him to give me three days so that i might commend the souls of these people to your care and i ask you to turn my house into a church then she died pope urban removed the body under cover of darkness and buried it at night in the catacombs with the other saints then he consecrated her house baptizing it as the church of saint cecilia it stands to this day a holy place devoted to the honour of christ and of the saint herself heere is ended the seconde nonnes tale the canons yeomans prologue the prologe of the chanouns yemannes tale we had ridden scarcely five miles after we had heard the tale of saint cecilia when we came to the hamlet of blean a few miles from canterbury just as we entered the forest there we were overtaken by a man dressed in black with a white surplice showing beneath his gown his mount a dapple grey was so soaked in sweat that we could scarcely credit it it was clear that he had been riding hard for some miles the poor horse could hardly go any further its collar was dripping wet and its flanks were flecked with foam his rider travelled light however with only a bag of two pouches fastened to his saddle it was a warm spring after all i wondered who this man in black might be until i noticed that his hood and cloak were sewn together i knew at once that he was a canon of the church his hat hung down his back from a cord and he had put a burdock leaf under his hood to keep his head cool and to prevent the sweat from running down his face he had galloped fast and furiously it was extraordinary to see the sweat on him he held as much liquid as a distillery when he came up to us he cried out in a loud voice god save you all i have come all this way for your sake i rode as fast as i could to catch up with you do you mind if i join you his servant now rode up behind him gentlemen he said i saw you leave the inn early this morning and i told my master here all about you you seemed such a jolly crowd so he was determined to ride with you he likes a bit of fun im glad you told him the host replied to the boy it looks as if your master is a clever man witty too and i bet he has a few stories to keep us all amused am i right stories he has got a million of them he is very entertaining if you know what i mean i will tell you something else he is skilled in many ways he has many talents he has undertaken work of great importance too which no one else could manage unless they learned from him how to do it he may look ordinary enough but it will profit you to get to know him i bet you anything that you will gain from acquaintance with him he is a very wise man he is one of the best tell me this is he a priest or a scholar what kind of man is he he is more than just a priest sir i will tell you in a few words what kind of art he practises i cannot let you know everything even though i do work as his assistant but i can tell you this about his business he is a man of such subtlety and skill that he could turn all this ground on which we are riding the whole route from southwark to canterbury into gold and silver i am not exaggerating good god harry bailey was astounded that is a marvel to be sure but since your master is such a wise man and so worthy of honour can you explain why he is wearing such a tatty old gown it is dirty and full of holes it isnt worth a penny where is his selfrespect according to you he is worth a lot of money if he can turn this road to gold and silver why does he not buy a better gown tell me the answer why are you asking me that sir as god is my witness he will never prosper dont mention this to anyone by the way it is a secret between you and me the problem is that he is too clever for his own good when you have too much of a good thing you can overreach yourself that is his case i believe my master has misused his great gifts it is a cause of grief to me i can assure you god help him that is all i can say never mind that harry replied tell me more about this work of his since you know all about him you must also know his secrets i assume that he is shrewd as well as wily so tell me everything where do you both live we dwell beyond the walls of a town in an area full of cellars and blind alleys it is the haunt of thieves and robbers who must conceal themselves it is a place for those who dare not show their face by day that is where we live tell me another thing our host asked him why is your face so discoloured god has not favoured it i admit i am so used to blowing into the fire that the flames have changed my colour i suppose i am not one to preen myself in front of a mirror i get on with my work and try my hand at alchemy but we are always making mistakes we miscalculate the amount of heat for example we can never get to the end of the experiment and fail somewhere along the way but thats no problem there are plenty of gullible people who will give us a pound of gold or ten pounds or twelve pounds on the understanding that we will be able to double the amount i know that this may be a false promise but we still have faith in the technique we still have hope the trouble is that the science is so difficult to master although we have sworn the contrary to our customers our patrons i should say we never get it quite right i would not be at all surprised if we became beggars while this young yeoman was talking his master came close and listened carefully to everything he said this canon dressed in black was wary and distrustful of others cato has taught us that the guilty man always believes that he is the object of suspicion that is why the master drew so close to the servant he wanted to hear everything then he interrupted the boy shut your mouth he said dont say another word otherwise you will regret it how dare you slander me in the company of these strangers and blab all my secrets carry on young man harry bailey said dont pay any attention to him or his threats dont worry the boy replied i dont intend to when the canon realized that all his threats were useless he fled in sorrow and in shame ah his yeoman said now we can have some fun i will tell you everything i know he has run away has he i hope he goes to the devil i dont want to have anything else to do with him i can promise you that not for all the money in the world he was the one who led me into the false game yet i never thought of it as a game i was deadly serious believe me in its pursuit i laboured i sweated i worried i cried yet for all that i could never leave it alone i wish to god that i had the brains to tell you everything there is to know about alchemy i can only explain a small part of the art now that my master has gone i will do my best so heere endeth the prologe of the chanounes yemannes tale the canons yeomans tale heere bigynneth the chanouns yeman his tale part one i have lived with this canon for seven years but i am nowhere near to understanding the secret i have lost everything i owned as have many others once upon a time i was clean cheerful and well dressed can you believe it i now use an old sock as my hat i used to be plump and ruddycheeked now i am thin and sallow i am losing my eyesight through all the hard work stay away from alchemy at all costs where is the benefit in trying to transmute metals the sliding science has left me penniless and in despair nothing good has come of it i have borrowed so much gold that i will never be able to repay my debts let me stand as a warning to everyone else like a wolfs head if anyone were foolish enough to practise alchemy it will prove to be his undoing he will not succeed he will empty his purse he will addle his wits but there is worse as soon as he has lost all of his money through his stupidity he will try to persuade others to follow his example and try their hand at the black art misery loves company that is the proverb is it not well enough said now i will tell you all about our work when we practise in our laboratory we look very wise and learned we use high terms and rarefied phrases to explain our mysterious labours then i blow upon the coals until there is no breath left in my body is there any need to explain the exact proportions of the dark materials that we use there is always the silver of course we would normally put in five or six ounces of it we compound this with arsenic with burned bones and iron filings then we grind the mixture to a powder and put it in a little earthenware pot add a little salt and some paper place a sheet of glass over the pot sealing glass and vessel with some clay so that no air will escape from it we can change and moderate the fire at will then begins the hard labour the watching and the calculating we are supposed to purify to blend and to disperse all of the ingredients we use quicksilver too which is the name for unrefined mercury but for all our tricks and devices we never got anywhere we used lead and arsenic ground together with a marble pestle in a marble mortar it made no difference there was no result we boiled volatile spirits again to no effect we experimented with the residue left at the bottom of the flask but it did no good our labour was in vain all the money we spent was lost too there are many other aspects of the art of alchemy i cannot tell you them in the correct order i am not that learned but i will mention them as they come to me i will not be able to put them in their proper categories of course let me see there is red clay known as armenian clay although it does not come from armenia there are green verdigris and white borax then there are the various vessels that we use for our distillation and purification some made of clay and some made of glass we have flasks and retorts phials and tubes crucibles and alembics there is no need to mention all of them they were expensive enough but they were all useless have i mentioned the red waters or the gallstones of a bull then there is sal ammoniac and the arsenic and the brimstone do you find it confusing i could go on all day about the various herbs we use there is agrimony which smells so sweet there is valerian and there is moonwort so we toiled over the coals and crucibles all day and all night with the lamps burning around us the furnace was at full blast and we heated the liquids to their various boiling points we used unslaked lime as a caustic as well as chalk and the whites of eggs we had powder ground out of ashes and dog shit piss and clay we made fires out of wood and out of charcoal we sprinkled purified salt and vitriol and then mixed in alum and brewers yeast the hairs of men and of horses the grease of a sow and the sweat of a redhaired child sometimes the amalgam turned yellow and sometimes silver white we would fuse and ferment diffuse and distil let me explain to you the nature of the four spirits and the seven bodies as my master taught them to me the first spirit is mercury or quicksilver and the second is orpiment of golden hue the third spirit is sal ammoniac the moisture of volcanoes and the fourth is brimstone the seven bodies are as follows the sun is gold and silver is the moon mars is iron and mercury of course is quicksilver saturn is lead and jupiter is tin the seventh venus herself is copper whoever practises this cursed art is doomed to failure and ruin he will sell all his goods and come to no good there can be no doubt that he will lose everything so come forward budding alchemists and try your luck if you have money to burn then stoke up the chemical fires do you think that it is an easy craft to learn not so you can be a priest or canon monk or friar i promise that you will not have scholarship enough you can study all the texts night and day and still go nowhere the mystery is too deep for a layman it is impossible to unravel it makes no difference whether he is learned or not he will fail in either case alchemy is too difficult oh i forgot to mention the acids we use with the metals and oils they help in the hardening or softening of the materials they can also be used to cleanse and purify you need more than a book to understand these things no more words now i have named things that should not be named i have said enough to raise a fiend the ugliest in hell the object of our quest is the philosophers stone the magic elixir if we possessed that we would be safe from sorrow but our labours have proved worthless i swear to god that for all our craft and care the stone will not come to us the loss of time and money has brought us close to madness but still there is that hope that yearning which keeps us searching for the key if we have that we have everything so you see that the craving can never be satisfied it is a sharp spur always pressing us onward we will never let go we will never slacken the quest is lifelong in hope of future glory we are willing to forsake everything else we can never turn our backs on the metals and the crucibles although we may only have a torn sheet to cover us at night and a rough coat to wear by day we will still spend everything we have on the pursuit of the elixir these alchemists smell of sulphur and of brimstone wherever they go they stink like goats their odour is so hot and rancid that you can spot them from a mile away so you can always recognize them from their smell and from their threadbare clothes if anyone asks them privately why they look so shabby they have a simple reply if anyone knew our identities they say we would be killed for our secrets hush hush so they deceive the innocent well enough of this i will get on with my story before we place the pot upon the fire my master tempers the various metals only he can do this now that he has gone i can speak freely and only he knows all the virtues of the lead and silver he has a fine reputation among the cognoscenti believe me although there have been many times when he has come to grief how does that happen there are occasions for example when the pot explodes or falls to pieces these metals are so volatile and violent that they can pierce the walls we have to strengthen the stones with lime and mortar they sink through the floorboards or they fly up to the ceiling sometimes they just lie scattered on the floor the expense is terrible i have never seen the devil but i am sure that he is somewhere in that room with us there could not be more violence or anger or strife or sorrow in hell itself when the pot exploded everyone blamed everyone else everyone started to fight some said that the pot was left on the fire for too long some said that the bellows were not strong enough then everyone looked at me because that is my department not true said a third the metals were not mixed correctly bollocks said a fourth stop squabbling and listen to me the fire should have been kindled from logs of beech not logs of oak that is the reason i could never tell who was right or wrong i only know that the argument went on and on enough said our master what is past cure is past care i will be more vigilant next time i am sure that the pot was cracked that was the cause of the trouble well let it go dont get depressed about it cheer up its not the end of the world is it then all the debris was swept up in a heap we put some canvas sheeting on the floor and piled the debris on to it then we picked through the pieces of metal and chemicals looking for anything we might retrieve look one of our number said there is some of the metal it is not intact but we can still use it again things may have turned out badly this time but we will succeed in the end we have to trust our luck no merchant is prosperous all the time there will be occasions when he loses his cargo at sea and there will be occasions when he sees it safely landed all right our master said you have made your point i will make sure that everything is done properly next time if i am wrong then lay the blame on me there was something the matter i know that much then the argument began again one man said that the fire was too hot for example hot or cold it never worked we never got the desired result however hard we tried still we carried on with the madness we were lunatic with greed and desire when we were all together we looked on one another as solomon the wise have you heard this proverb all that glisters is not gold not every apple is good for eating however sweet it looks so it was with us the greatest fool among us was deemed to be the wisest the most honest and honoured was in fact the biggest thief you will learn the truth of this before i leave your company just listen to my tale part two there is a canon do you know the man i mean who would infect with his presence a town the size of nineveh or rome no one would be able to describe his infinite tricks and subtleties you could live a thousand years and not be able to fathom all of his craft no one is his equal in falsehood he is so sly in his use of words so slippery in his language that he can make a fool of anyone he talks to he could beguile the devil even though he is one himself he has duped many people and will carry on deceiving them as long as he lives yet this is the curious thing men travel for miles to consult and converse with him little do they realize that he is a swindler in disguise if you like i can explain it to you my story is of a canon as i said but i beg other canons not to believe that i am slandering their brotherhood there is a rotten apple in every barrel god forbid that a whole order should be tarnished by one mans sins it is not my intention to defame you good sirs only to chastise one of your number i address my story to everyone not just to you you remember well enough that among the twelve apostles there was only one traitor judas by name why should the other holy men have shared his guilt only he was culpable but i will say this if there is a judas in your house get rid of him at once it will save you shame and embarrassment later so do not be angry with me for telling my story just listen there had lived in london for many years a chantry priest who earned his living by saying masses for the dead he was so sweet and how can i put it serviceable to his landlady that she would not hear of him paying anything for his board and lodging she even bought his fine clothes for him so he had plenty of ready money to spend there was gold in his purse let me now explain to you how that gold fell into the hands of the malicious canon the canon came one day to the priests lodging and asked to borrow some money can you lend me a gold mark he asked him i only need it for three days then i will repay you if i let you down i give you leave to hang me from the nearest tree the priest took the coin from his purse straight away and gave it to him the canon pocketed it thanked him and went on his way three days later he promptly returned the money much to the surprise and delight of the priest well really the priest said to him i dont mind lending you money good sir if you repay it so readily you are true to your word that is clear enough how can i refuse you anything in the future what you never thought i would trick you did you please honesty is my middle name i will always keep my word to the day i die god forbid that i should ever lie to you or deceive you it just wont happen believe me when i say that i have always paid my debts i have never let anyone down there is not a false bone in my body he lowered his voice a little since you have been so good to me i will let you in on a little secret you have been kind to me and i will be kind in return i am willing to teach you if you are willing to learn the secrets of my work as an alchemist if you watch carefully i can assure you that you will see a wonder is that right the priest replied go ahead for gods sake i will do it if you wish for no other cause but to please you of course do you see how this villain lured his prey he granted the priest a favour the priest had not asked for that kind of favour bodes no good i will prove that to you in a moment and so this false canon this root of iniquity took great pleasure in betraying good christian people the devil planted wickedness in his heart god give us the grace to withstand his wiles the poor priest had no idea of course he never saw the trap being laid for him oh silly innocent man you will soon be blinded by avarice unfortunate priest you have lost your way all unawares you are falling into the clutches of a fox who will trick you and deceive you let me hurry on now to the conclusion and to your confusion i will display your folly and stupidity and i will reveal as far as i am able the wickedness of the man who led you forward do you think i am talking about my master not at all i am talking about another canon a hundred times more skilful than the man i serve he has betrayed more people than you can imagine it is impossible to describe all of his falsehoods whenever i talk about him my cheeks grow red with shame well they would grow red if they could i know well enough that i have no colour left in my face the glow left my cheeks when i first began working among the stinks and fumes anyway listen to the false canon sir he said to the priest get your servant to buy some quicksilver tell him to hurry two or three ounces of the stuff will suffice when he comes back with it i will show you a miracle something you have never seen before of course replied the priest right away so he ordered his servant to go to the apothecary and purchase three ounces of quicksilver the boy rushed off and returned very quickly with the material he gave it to the canon who laid it down carefully the canon then asked the servant to bring some coals and to start a fire this was promptly done once the coals had started burning the canon took a crucible from the folds of his cloak he showed it to the priest take hold of it he said i want you to do this for yourself pour into this crucible an ounce of the quicksilver in the name of christ we will make an alchemist of you yet there are very few people to whom i would confide my secrets i will show you how to harden this quicksilver in front of your eyes i will make it as fine and as durable as the silver in your purse you can test it with your teeth if you like if you prove me wrong then you can reveal me as a liar and a fraud to the whole world i have a powder here in my pocket that will do all it cost me a lot of money but it is worth it it is the agent of all my work as you shall soon see tell your boy to leave the room by the way and shut the door behind him no one else must learn our secrets so the silly priest obeyed him got rid of the servant and closed the door then they set to work at the bidding of the false canon he put the crucible on the burning coals and blew upon the fire with all his might then the canon sprinkled some white powder into the crucible i dont know what it was chalk powdered glass something like that whatever it was it was worthless it was only there to fool the priest the canon told him to pile up the coals in token of the great love i bear you he said i will show you how your own two hands can work the miracle god save you a thousand thanks replied the priest who was now busily stoking up the fire while he was occupied the false canon this foul wretch this servant of the devil took out from his sleeve a piece of charcoal made of beechwood a little hole had been drilled in the side of this coal which the canon had filled up with metal filings he had then sealed the hole with wax so that none of the silver could escape he had made this device a few hours before and had brought it with him i will tell you later what other tools he carried with him to deceive his victim he wanted to rob the priest of everything before he left him it angers me when i talk about him i want to catch him i want to trap him but he is here and there and everywhere he is so various he is as fluid as quicksilver itself now listen carefully to what followed he hid the hollow coal in his hand while the priest was bent over the fire dear friend he said you are doing this wrong let me have a go i do feel sorry for you too sweating like a pig here take my handkerchief dry your face while the priest was wiping his eyes the canon quickly slipped the coal into the middle of the crucible it was soon burning away merrily just like all the others let us stop for a drink the canon said we deserve it all will be well now i know it sit down for a moment and rest when the hollow coal was ablaze of course the silver filings blended together and flowed into the bottom of the crucible the priest knew nothing of the trick and assumed that all the coals were alike he could not see the deception the canon had practised on him now the alchemist saw his opportunity come over here sir he said and stand by me i know very well that you do not have a mould for the metal can you go outside and find or purchase a block of chalk i will carve it into the proper shape at the same time can you bring with you a bowl or pan of cold water then you will witness the wonderful workings of the art i know you trust me but to be doubly sure i will not leave your sight i will accompany you everywhere you go so they left the chamber carefully locking it behind them they found the materials and to make a long story short the canon carved the chalk into the shape of an oblong mould how did he know how to mould it when the priest was not looking he took a bar of silver from the sleeve of his gown and fashioned the mould around it then he concealed the silver in his sleeve once more it weighed no more than an ounce you will hear more about this bar later on for his next trick the canon poured the material from the fire into the mould and then plunged it into cold water he turned to the priest and asked him to feel the interior of the mould you will find silver there i believe of course he did these were the silver filings hidden in the coal of beech now fired into one ingot what else could they be so the priest did as he was requested lo and behold he brings out a rod of fine silver gods love be yours he told the canon mary mother of god and all the saints bless you let their curse strike me if i do not become your servant and assistant teach me the subtleties of this noble craft i will be your man for ever hold on sir priest let us try this a second time once you have learned the details you will be able to repeat the experiment on your own why dont you take another ounce of quicksilver and cast it in the pan with the silver bar do what you did before quickly so the priest poured in the quicksilver scattered the powder over it and set the pan over the fire then he blew into the flames on the instruction of the canon and waited for the outcome he desired in the meantime the canon was getting ready to fool the priest again he took out from his pocket a hollow stick in the end of which he had secreted an ounce of silver filings he had secured the end with some sealing wax just as he had done with the piece of coal while the priest was busy with the fire the canon once again sprinkled some more powder into the crucible and stood waiting expectantly you have seen the measure of his falsehood have you not may the devil flay his skin may god desert him in his last hours then he took the stick and began stirring the coals of course all fell out as before by which i mean the filings of the silver fell out as soon as the wax melted they ran out of the crucible and soon became liquid metal what do you think happened gentlemen the priest was fooled by the same trick twice the idiot was so pleased by the sight of the silver that i scarcely have the words to describe his delight he was delirious he gave himself up body and soul to the deceiver yes the canon said i may be poor but i have a certain wisdom and i prophesy this there is more silver to come do you have any copper in the house of course i know where to find some well sir hurry up and get it so the priest went off found the copper and brought it back to the canon as soon as he had it in his hands the canon carefully weighed out an ounce no pen can describe no tongue can tell of his wickedness and false seeming he was the minister of lies and deception he seemed friendly enough to those who did not know him but in thought and deed he was a fiend it wearies me to list his crimes but i do it only to put you on your guard against him and others like him this is what he did he put the ounce of copper into the crucible and placed it upon the burning coals once more he cast in his white powder once more he asked the silly priest to blow upon the fire it was all a trick of course a piece of showmanship to fool the gullible then he poured the molten copper into a mould and plunged it into cold water there was a hiss steam arose at that moment the canon quickly took out from his sleeve the silver ingot he had made before and put it in the water whereupon it sank to the bottom of the pan as the water trembled to and fro he was able to remove the copper and conceal it the priest intent upon the fire had seen nothing the canon now took him by the arm well sir he said if this hasnt worked then i blame you i need your help here put your hand in the water and see if you can find anything go on so the priest plunged his hand into the pan and of course retrieved the ingot of silver hey presto the canon smiled at him and said well brother let us take these silver ingots to the nearest goldsmith and get them assayed i am sure they are the genuine article but i want to have them tested all the same so they visited the local goldsmith and laid their silver on his counter he tested the three ingots with fire and hammer they were silver all right of course they were who could have been happier than the foolish priest no nightingale in may no bird upon the wing could be so blithe no young girl could have been more ready to dance and sing no knight could have been more lusty or fearless the priest was now desperate to learn the secret of transmutation how much will it cost me he asked the canon to learn the formula i must have it for gods sake tell me i must warn you the canon replied it is not cheap there are only two people in england who know the secret one of them is a friar in oxford the other one is me no one else i dont care how much it costs just tell me it is expensive as i said i can let you have the formula for forty pounds at that price it is a bargain if you were not such a dear friend of mine i would be charging you much more so the priest went back to his chamber and took out his strongbox he counted out forty pounds and brought the money back to the canon in exchange for the secret recipe it was a great deal to pay for a fraud and a delusion sir priest the canon said i dont want any great fame in fact i prefer to remain unknown so i beg you let this be a secret between us if other people knew of my gift why i would be the object of hatred and of envy i would be a dead man god forbid you dont need to tell me that i would rather lose all the money in my possession i would rather go mad than betray you thank you thank you from the bottom of my heart now i must bid you farewell sir goodbye good luck the canon gave the priest the kiss of peace and left him the priest never saw him again he soon discovered that the socalled formula was useless every experiment failed and every session ended in tears he had been completely fooled the canon was a master of the black art of treachery consider gentlemen how people in every walk of life strive for gold there is so great a desire for it that it has become scarce i could not count the numbers involved in alchemy for example they are led astray by philosophers who speak in misty terms they never understand a word of their jargon their minds are addled they chatter nonsense like magpies they never achieve anything if a man has enough money he will easily learn how to turn his wealth to nothing this is the only transmutation that takes place mirth is replaced by sorrow full purses are changed into empty purses the hopes and happiness of those who have lent money are turned into curses and bitterness they ought to be ashamed those who have been burned should flee the fire i have one message for those of you who dabble in the false art abandon it leave it before you are ruined better late than never if you lose everything i am afraid that it will be too late seek but you will not find you will be like blind bayard blundering everywhere not seeing the snares and traps in front of him can he stay on the high road of course not he crashes into rocks and hedges that is the way of alchemy too if you cannot see with your eyes try to use your inner sight try to be guided by reason and judgement rather than staring wildly around for any portent you may think you are wide awake but you are sleepwalking to disaster so put out the fire smother the coals give up the pursuit if you dont believe me believe the writings of the true alchemists themselves you have heard of arnaldus of villanova in his treatise on alchemy the rosarium philosophorum or rosegarden of the philosophers he makes this statement no man he writes can mortify mercury without the help of its brother sulphur the father of alchemy hermes trismegistus put the same point he taught that the dragon could be slain only by the death of its brother by the dragon he meant mercury the dragons brother is also known as sulphur both of them issue from the influence of the sun and the moon from gold and from silver and therefore he wrote in warning let no unlearned man attempt to practise this art if he has not understood the words of the philosophers he is not fit to experiment he is a fool and a charlatan the work of the alchemist is the great secret of the world the mystery of mysteries one of platos disciples once asked him a pertinent question it is recorded in the theatrum chemicum if you care to look it up tell me sir the disciple asked him the name of the secret stone you must take up plato replied the stone known to humankind as titan what is that it is also called magnasia i am afraid sir that i am not following you these terms are unknown to me can you tell me the nature of this magnasia it is a liquid made out of the four elements can you tell me the source of this liquid can you tell me its root no certainly not the true philosophers have sworn never to divulge the secret in speech or in writing it is so dear to christ that he has forbidden us to reveal it to anyone he will only allow it to be told to those whom he holds most dear it is a form of holy revelation that is all i have to say so i conclude from this that god himself guards the secret of the stone what is the point therefore in persisting abandon your quest you may alchemize all of your life and still end your days in suffering whoever makes god his enemy will pay dearly for it if he goes against gods will he merits severe punishment at that point i must stop farewell to you all may god send every true man comfort and consolation heere is ended the chanouns yemannes tale the manciples prologue heere folweth the prologe of the maunciples tale do you know the village of harbledown called by everyone bobupanddown it is on the outskirts of blean forest about two miles from canterbury itself this was the spot where our host began to play the fool dobbin is in the mire he said help me pull him out have you ever played that game is there any one of you who can rouse that fellow at the back i will pay good money to see his eyes open a thief could rob him and tie him up without him noticing he is fast asleep look at him he is close to falling off his horse he is the cook from london isnt he roger that is his name roger of ware can somebody please go and wake him up i insist that he tells us all a story it may not be worth much but it is a good penance for him our host rode up to him wake up roger god help you what is the matter with you why are you dozing in the daylight were you bitten by fleas all night were you dead drunk were you lying with some whore whatever you did you did too much of it the cook then tried to rouse himself he was palefaced and puffyeyed i swear to god he replied that i was suddenly filled with utter tiredness i would rather sleep than drink a barrel of the best wine from vintry the manciple then rode forward if it helps he told the cook i am quite ready to tell a story in your place if our fellow pilgrims dont mind and if our good host permits it i can begin at once i dont think you are in a fit state your face is pale you look dazed and if i may say so your breath smells horrible you really are not well the manciple turned towards the rest of us you can be certain sirs that i will not flatter him just look at the way he is yawning look at that gaping mouth of his as if he were about to swallow us all close your mouth man your foul breath will infect the whole company have you got the devils hoof in there you stink what a fine fellow you are do you fancy a quick joust or wrestling match i dont think so you are too drunk to fart this little speech enraged the cook he shook his head he gnawed his lip he stared hard at the manciple but he was too drunk to say anything words failed him then he fell off his horse he lay helpless in the mud as some of the pilgrims tried to lift him up there was much shoving and pushing much tugging and heaving before they got him back into his saddle he may have looked as pale as a ghost but he was heavy enough if only he had kept hold of his ladle and never uncorked a bottle he would have been a better horseman thats for sure harry bailey came up to the manciple you can see for yourself how drunk he is he could no more tell a story than my horse i dont know whether he has been drinking wine or ale but the effect is the same he talks through his nose and did you hear that sneeze he has a bad cold as well i dont suppose he can keep on his saddle and talk at the same time he can hardly ride a straight line if he falls from his horse a second time it will be very difficult to hoist him up again so sir please take his place tell us a story i must mention one thing though before you begin i think you were unwise to criticize him so publicly one of these days he may pay you back and lay some small charge against you he may find fault with your accounts for example or with your expenses i know that he has dealings with you trifles can sometimes cause a lot of trouble god forbid that should happen as you say it is not difficult to point out small mistakes i would rather pay for his horse than get into a legal tangle with him i didnt mean to upset him honestly it was a joke and do you know what i know how to calm him down here in my satchel i have a flask of good rhenish wine shall we have a bit of fun roger of ware will gulp this down in a second just see if im wrong he cannot refuse a drink the manciple was not wrong the cook took up the flask and drained it in a moment he really did not need the wine of course he had drunk more than enough already then he returned the flask and as far as he was able thanked the manciple thashwasgood our host laughed out loud i am convinced now he said that we will have to take strong liquor with us wherever we go it is a sovereign remedy for strife it turns fights and arguments into lovefeasts blessed is thy name bacchus god of wine you can make the greatest enemies the best of friends i will worship you from this time forward now sir manciple we turn to you will you tell us your tale i will with pleasure the manciples tale heere bigynneth the maunciples tale of the crowe when phoebus lived upon the earth as the old books tell us he was the most gallant knight and most lively bachelor of all he was also the most skilful archer he killed the serpent python as the great snake lay sleeping in the sun he accomplished other great deeds with his bow you can read about them in those old books i mentioned he was also an expert musician capable of playing any instrument his voice was so exquisitely beautiful that it ravished the ear amphion the famous king of thebes whose singing raised up the stone walls of his city could not rival him he was also the most handsome man that ever was or ever will be in the world what need is there to dwell on the details of his beauty it is enough to say that he was matchless he was also a very gentle worthy knight of peerless renown that is why this flower of honour this phoebus always carried with him his bow it was a token of his victory over python but he was also looking out for sport and adventure now in his house he had a crow he kept it in a cage this bird was as white as a swan by the way it was whiter than snow or the fleece of a lamb phoebus fostered it and taught it to speak so well that it could mimic the voice of any man or woman it heard and it sang so sweetly too more melodiously than the nightingale it was a joy to hear its notes at this time phoebus had a wife whom he loved more dearly than life itself night and day he did his best to please her and delight her he had only one fault he was a jealous husband and if he could he would have kept her under lock and key he was afraid of being cuckolded as would be any man in that position but all precautions are useless a good wife innocent in thought and deed should not be watched or doubted if the wife is not so good you cannot hold her down i take it as a law that you cannot restrain a woman who wants to roam every writer concurs on that subject back to my story so phoebus does all he can to please her hoping that all his attentions and all his affection will stop her from chasing after any other man but god knows that you cannot thwart the course of nature you cannot crush the force of instinct put any wild bird in a cage you can feed it give it water hang little bells from the bars attend to it in every possible way it will make no difference it will still wish to be free the cage might be made out of gold the bird would still prefer to be in a wild wood feeding off worms and dirt it will try as hard as it can to escape it desires only its liberty i give you the example of the cat you can feed it with the choicest meats and the richest milk you can make a bed for it with the finest silks as soon as it sees a mouse it forgets all about its creature comforts it is not interested in cuts of ham or beef it wants only to eat the mouse nature holds dominion need knows no law think of the shewolf when desire moves her she wishes to mate with the foulest wolf she can find that is her appetite i have cited these examples to prove the faithlessness of the male not of the female we all know that men lust after the lowest of the low their wives may be beautiful and noble and loving it makes no difference they want fresh meat they delight in novelty they sicken at the thought of their virtuous wives phoebus apollo was different of course but for all his innocence he was deceived his wife had fallen for another man he was of low reputation and far beneath phoebus in every respect it is the kind of situation that happens all the time and is always a cause of grief and misery so whenever phoebus was away from home his wife invited this man to come and fuck her fuck her sorry that is vulgar i suppose i should apologize but it is the truth plato said that the word should always fit the deed if i am going to tell my story properly i need to use the appropriate terms i am a plain man of plain speaking and there really isnt any difference between a common woman and a lady of high degree if she is free with her body they are both steeped in sin oh there is one difference the highborn lady is deemed to be a lover while the common woman is called a slut in truth of course one lies as low as the other they are both on their backs in the same way there is no difference between a usurping tyrant and a thief or outlaw they are exactly the same alexander the great was once told that a tyrant who burns down homes slaughters his enemies and destroys land is acclaimed as a great general and leader a smalltime thief who does not have armies and who can only rob a few houses without doing much damage is damned as a rogue and criminal but i am not a great expert in such things i cannot quote you chapter and verse so anyway the wife of phoebus stripped this man and fondled him you can imagine the rest all the time the white crow was sitting in its cage and watching the whole thing it did not even chirrup but as soon as phoebus returned home it sang out cukoo cockoh cuckold what is that song phoebus came over to the cage i have never heard you sing so loudly before it does my heart good to see you so cheerful but what is the song it is a true one phoebus i know that much for all your virtue for all your beauty for all your faithfulness and honesty for all your music get on with it bird you have been deluded and deceived a man of very little reputation a man who cannot be compared to you in any respect a man with the worth of a gnat go on has been fucking your wife i saw him with my own two eyes what more need i say the crow told him what had happened in great detail it told him how his wife had betrayed him time and time again phoebus turned away struck with grief thinking that his heart was about to break he took up his bow and plucked an arrow from its sheath with that he killed her on the spot there is no more to say then he fell into a frenzy he smashed all of his instruments his harp his lute his gitern and then he broke his bow and arrows when he had finished he turned once more to the crow in the cage traitor he screamed at it with the tongue of a scorpion not of a bird you have destroyed my happiness damned is the day when i was born i wish i were dead and my dear wife you were the source of all my bliss you were always true and faithful to me i am sure of that now you are lying here dead in front of me you were innocent werent you how could i have been so blind so stupid how could i have committed such a crime against an innocent and virtuous woman what was i thinking my senseless anger has struck down a blameless victim distrust has destroyed us both every man beware of haste believe nothing without strong evidence do not strike before you know the truth consider very carefully what you are doing anger and suspicion are not enough they lead you into the dark that is why i phoebus apollo now wish to kill myself then he turned to the crow villain false bird you used to sing sweeter than a nightingale you will never sing again these fine white feathers will turn to black you will be dumb unable to speak for the whole span of your life that is how traitors are punished you and your offspring will be black for ever your breed will be silent except when you croak in warning of a storm your cry will remind the world of wind and rain that is your punishment for the death of my wife phoebus reached into the cage and pulled out all of the birds white feathers one by one then he struck it dumb depriving it of speech and song before he drove it out of the house may the fiend take the bird and that is why ladies and gentlemen all crows are black so take heed of this story and remember to think before you speak guard your tongue never tell a man that his wife has been unfaithful to him whether you are right or wrong he will hate you for it according to eminent scholars solomon had learned discretion at an early age but as i said i am not a learned man my mother is my real teacher once she said to me son for gods sake think of the crow curb your tongue and keep your friends a loose tongue is more destructive than the devil you can cross yourself to ward off the foul fiend god has given you teeth and lips to restrain the tongue use them and use your head too think before you speak the loud mouth often comes to grief no one has ever been punished for saying too little do not hold forth except of course in praise of god and his saints what was i saying yes restraint is the first virtue that is what small children are taught every day that was the lesson i learned too too many words are bad for you what is a rash tongue it is a sword that wounds and kills just as a knife can cut off an arm so can a tongue sever a friendship god hates a jangler read the wise sayings of solomon read the psalms of david read seneca they will all tell you the same do not speak just nod your head and stay silent pretend that you are deaf even if some gossip tries to spread rumours the flemings have a saying the less chatter the more cheer if you have not said a wicked word my son then you have nothing to fear if you say something wrong or foolish you will never be able to take it back again what is said is said it flies into the air and cannot be caught you will become a victim of your own verbosity spread no news and start no gossip whatever company you keep high or low restrain your tongue and think about the crow have i said enough heere is ended the maunciples tale of the crowe the parsons prologue here folweth the myrie words of the parsoun by the time that the manciple had finished his story the sun was low in the sky it was by my calculation no more than twentynine degrees in height and my shadow stood out before me it was four oclock and a spring evening was about to descend upon us travellers we were riding through the outskirts of a village when the host reined in his horse and addressed us good lords and ladies he said our work is almost done we lack only one tale according to my reckoning we have heard from every class and every degree in the course of our journey my ordinance has almost been fulfilled there is only one person left to entertain us i hope he does it well he turned to the parson who rode a little behind him sir priest he asked him are you a vicar or a parson do you have your own church or do you serve another speak the truth please it doesnt matter what rank you hold as long as you can tell a good story you are the last open up sing for your supper let us see what you are made of i can tell by your appearance and your expression that you are good at this kind of thing tell us a good oldfashioned fable will you you will get no fable from me mr bailey the parson replied do you not recall the words of paul to timothy he condemns those who stray from the path of truth and who invent lies or fantasies why should i give you chaff when i can offer you good wheat so if you wish to hear morality and virtuous matter i am your man if you are willing to give me an audience i will do my best to mix instruction with delight but i am a man of the south i cannot call a lady a bonny wee thing or tell you something canny i cannot lay claim to being much of a poet either so i will tell you something pleasing and suitable in prose now at the end of our journey i will bring matters to a conclusion may the saviour guide me and inspire me to lead you to jerusalem our pilgrimage on earth is an image of the glorious pilgrimage to the celestial city with your permission i will now begin my story what is your opinion there is one other thing i am no scholar i am sure that there are some among you who are more learned and able than i am i can offer you only the substance the essential meaning and i am perfectly willing to be corrected we all agreed to this it seemed good to us that we should end our journey with some virtuous text we were happy to hear the parsons soft voice at the end of the day so we asked our host to entreat him to continue sir priest he said god be with you give us the fruit of your contemplations but you must hurry the sun is sinking in the sky give us much matter in a short space may god help you in your task good man now please begin so the parson rode before us and began his story we had entered a forest our sweet lord god of heaven who wills that all men have full knowledge of his godhead and live in the sweet bliss of eternity admonishes us with the wise words of the prophet jeremiah stand upon the old paths and find from old scriptures the right way which is the good way on this pilgrimage upon the earth i held my horse back as the pilgrims made their way among the trees the evening fell and the birds of the forest were silent i could still hear him speaking of the right way to jerusalem the celestial when i dismounted and walked into a small grove there i went down on my knees and prayed chaucers retractions here taketh the makere of this book his leve i make this request to all of those who hear or read this little treatise if there be anything here that pleases them they should thank our lord jesus christ from whom proceeds all virtue and all wisdom if there be anything here they dislike i beg them to ascribe the fault to my ignorance and not to my will i would have written better if i possessed the gift of eloquence the bible tells us that words must be used to instruct us that has always been my intention so i beseech you for the mercy of god to pray for me to christ our saviour plead with him to forgive my sins and especially my transgressions in the writing and translation of books of worldly vanity i now revoke and condemn these books troilus and criseyde the book of fame the legend of good women the book of the duchess the parliament of fowls and those stories of the canterbury tales that may be construed as sinful i also recant the book of the lion and if i could remember them many other books i renounce the songs and lecherous lays that i have written down in the hope that christ will forgive my trespasses grant me mercy oh lord but for the translation of the consolation of boethius for all the saints lives for all the homilies and moral tales that tend to virtue for all these i thank christ and his blessed mother beseeching them and all the saints of heaven to pray for me now and at the hour of my death send me grace so that i may repent my sins and save my soul grant me true penitence confession and absolution in the merciful name of our saviour jesus christ king of kings and priest of priests who redeemed the world with his precious blood may i be one of those saved on the day of doom qui cum patre et spiritu sancto vivit et regnat deus per omnia secula amen i rose to my feet and walked back to my horse heere is ended the book of the tales of canterbury compiled by geoffrey chaucer of whos soule jhesu crist have mercy amen
