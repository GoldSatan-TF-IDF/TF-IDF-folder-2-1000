the heresy of dr dee john dee papers by phil rickman john dee the early history born in john dee grew up in the most volcanic years of the reign of henry viii at whose court his father was employed as a gentleman server john was eight when the king split with rome declaring himself head of the church of england and systematically plundering the wealth of the monasteries recognised by his early twenties as one of europes leading mathematicians and an expert in the science of astrology john was introduced at court during the short reign of henrys son edward vi when edward died at only sixteen john dee was lucky to survive the brief but bloody reign of the catholic mary tudor mary died in and was succeeded by the protestant elizabeth who would always encourage johns lifelong interest in what he considered science but others saw as sorcery caught between catholic plots and the rise of a new puritanism he would feel no more secure than queen elizabeth herself who was fending off the marriage bids of foreign kings and princes began what biographers have seen as john dees missing years a dangerous period especially after the mysterious death of the wife of dees friend and former student lord robert dudley thought by many to be the queens lover part one all my life i had spent in learning with great pain care and cost i had from degree to degree sought to come by the best knowledge that man might attain unto in the world and i found at length that neither any man living nor any book i could yet meet withal was able to teach me those truths i desired and longed for john dee i source of darkness it was the year of no summer and all the talk in london was of the endtime even my mothers neighbours were muttering about darkness on the streets before its time moving lights seen in the heavens and tremblings of the earth caused by satans gleeful stoking of the infernal fires tales came out of europe that two suns were ofttimes apparent in the skies on occasion three while in england we never saw even the one most days and when it deigned to appear it was as pale and sour as old milk and smirched by raincloud now all too soon autumn was nigh and the harvests were poor and id lost count of the times id been asked what the stars foretold about our future if we had one each time id reply that the heavens showed no signs of impending doom but how acceptable was my word these days i was the astrologer whod found a day of good promise for the joyful crowning of a woman who now less than two years later was being widely condemned as the source of the darkness by embittered catholics this was and the prunefaced new biblemen even the sun has fled england they squealed gods verdict on a country that would have as its queen the spawn of a witch these fears given heat by false rumours from france and spain that elizabeth was pregnant with a murderers child gods bollocks as the alleged murderer would say but all this made me weary to the bone how fast the bubble of new joy is pricked how shallow people are give them shit to spread and theyll forge new shovels overnight all the same you might have thought after what happened in glastonbury that the queen would seek my help in shifting this nightsoil from her door but no shed sent for me just once since the spring all frivolous and curious about what i was working on and had i thought of this and had i looked into that sending me back to spend in her cause far too much money on books burn too many candles into pools of fat explore alleys of the hidden which i thought id never want to enter only to learn within weeks that heavy curtains had closed around her court death having slipped furtively in the worst of all possible deaths most of us could see that although not the queen apparently who could scarce conceal her terrifying gaiety dear god as the silence grew i was left wondering if the endtime might truly be looming and began backing away from some of the more foetid alleyways though not fast enough as it turned out ii rooker september mortlake it was to be the last halfwaybright day of the season but the scryer had demanded darkness shutters closed against the midafternoon and the light from a single beeswax candle throwing shadows into battle on the walls and this dithering now poor goodwife faldo looked at me over the wafer of flame and then across the board to where the scryer sat and then back at me this is my brother her hands falling to her sides and even in the small light he must surely have seen the flailing in her eyes john she said lamely john faldo i said at once and then seeing the eyes of my friend jack simm rolling upwards realised why this could not be so that is her husbands brother thinking how fortunate it was that will faldo was out with his two sons gleaning from his field all that remained of a dismal harvest had he been with us the scryer might just have noted that master faldo was plump with red hair and a head shorter than the man claiming to be his brother or he might yet see the truth when he uncovered what sat before him it made a hump under the black cloth as might a saints sacred skull my eyes were drawn back to it again and again unaware that the scryer had been watching me until his voice came curling out of the dark you have an interest in these matters master faldo a clipped clarity suggestive of wales echoes of my late tad in fact jesu i met his gaze for no more than a moment then looked away towards the crack of daylight betwixt shutters the faldos dwelling firmbuilt of oak and riverbed daub was but a short walk from mortlake church which had the shutters been open would have displayed itself like a warning finger the truth is i mumbled that im less afraid of such things than my brother which is one reason why im here and um he is not the scryer nodded appearing well at ease with his situation too much so it seemed to me the narrow causeway twixt science and sorcery will always have slippery sides and in his place i would ever have been watching the shadows but then that as you know is the way i am i studied him in the thin light not what id expected a good twenty years older than my thirtythree greying beard tighttrimmed to his cheeks and a white scar the width of his forehead wellclothed in a drab and sober way like to a clerk or a lawyer only the scar hinting at a more perilous profession hed introduced himself to us as elias and i was told hed been a monk were this true it might afford him protection from whatever would come certainly his manner implied that we were fortunate to have his services and the other reason that master faldo is not with us he smiled at me with evident scepticism i was silent too long and it was the goodwife alert as a chaffinch who sprang up my husband he knows naught of this hes working the day long and falls to sleep when he comes in i she lowered her voice and her eyelids a fine and unexpected piece of theatre i was too ashamed to tell him shed already paid the scryer with my money id also been obliged to meet his nights accommodation at the inn more than i could readily afford especially if i were to make a further purchase served me right for starting this game and involving the goodwife in the deception brother elias smiled at her with understanding so the treasure you want me to find would be your wedding ring goodwife faldo let out a small cry hastily stifled with a hand how could he possibly have known this by natural means i stiffened only for a moment it was no more than a good guess he must ofttimes be summoned to locate a womans ring or a locket it was what they did what happened goodwife faldo displayed her fingers one with a circle of white below its joint i must have taken it off to clean out the fire ready for the autumn laid it on the board where youre peering among the shadows on the board as if the missing ring might be gleaming from somewhere to betray her and then forgot about it until the night and it was gone you think someone stole it id not want to think that we trust our neighbours nobody here bolts a door but yes i do fear its been taken been many years in my husbands family and has a value beyond the gold can you help me not me alone goodwife not me alone brother elias speaking with solemnity and what seemed to me to be a first hint of stagecraft goodwife faldos stool wobbling and the candlelight passing like a sprite across her coif as she sat up like many women my mothers neighbour was much attracted to the hidden yet in a halffearful way the joy of shivers i can only pray she said unsteadily that whatever is summoned to help you comes from the right quarter this ill admit was a question id primed her to ask no one should open a portal to the hidden without spiritual protection there are longestablished procedures for securing this i wanted to know if the scryer knew them oh it must needs be godly elias assured her confidently if its to find this ring for us however his wellfed face became stern i must make it clear to you goodwife that if the ring has been stolen and we are able to put a face to the thief then its your business not mine to take the matter further thats er i coughed is another reason why im here me the fighting man dear god and what are you master faldo the scryer said but not as if he cared whats your living i shrugged i work at the brewery the biggest employer of men in mortlake tell him you work at the brewery jack simm had said to me earlier and then looking at my hands dealing wiv orders and you the scryer turned to jack were once i think an apothecary in london once jack stubbornly folding his arms over his wide chest as though to ward off further questions get on with it the scryer cupped his hands over the blackdraped object before him drew a long breath as if about to snatch away the cloth and then stopped its not mete pulling his hands away from the mounded cloth stowing them away in his robe a scowl split jack simms lambswool beard what i regret its not mete for me to go on brother elias said the crystals cold speaking with finality where most of his kind would be smiling slyly at you while holding out their grubby hands for more money maybe it came to the same eliass apparel showed hed already prospered from his trade yet i felt this wasnt only about money the air in here had altered the hearth looked cold as an altar the room felt damp i became aware of the fingers of both my hands gripping the edge of the board as the scryer reached to the flagged floor for his satchel we should light a fire jack simm said halfway to his feet angry but elias didnt look at him if you want this to have results he said quietly then i must needs go back to the inn and rest a while ill return shortly before nightfall that is if you wish to continue with this comedy was that what he thought did he suspect falseplay look i wanted to say if weve insulted your art i beg mercy but i feared youd be a rooker backstreet scryers i thought all they sought was a regular income that they had no aspiration to walk in the golden halls of creation and know the energies behind their art i thought that all that mattered was that it worked and if it didnt you faked it i want to know where the fakery begins to separate artifice from natural magic i want to watch what you do observe your methods and i want to know where to obtain the finest of shewstones should i identify myself accept a loss of face no i held back watching him shoulder his satchel and make his stately way to the goodwifes door wondering if hed return or vanish with my money oh he said mildly i have one question he opened the door and the light washed over him why am i summoned to mortlake from outside came the scurrying of birds why mortlake the scryer said when mortlakes surely home to a man more qualified than i he looked at each of us in turn or is the good dr dee too busy conjuring for the queen these days to waste his famous skills in service of his neighbours jack simm glanced at me i knew not how to respond dr dee jack said doesnt scry hmm not yet anyway iii call them angels jack simm was a gardener now hed abandoned his london apothecarys shop during marys reign when the agents of bishop bonner had been scouring the streets for signs of protestants and witches alike and anyone else who might be deemed an enemy of the catholic church like many a poor bastard whod burned in bonners purge jack had been neither but the scent of roasting flesh singes the soul and he had a young wife and so chose to pursue his trade in a quiet way from his home on the edge of the village growing herbs in other peoples gardens as partpayment for his services growing certain mushrooms for me to bring about visions not that theyd worked but that wasnt jacks fault id tell him he had no need to be a secret apothecary any more it was a new reign everything was changed for the brighter kept telling him all this but he was wary yet particularly wary when about four weeks previously id asked him to find me a good scryer and perhaps a shewstone for sale for pretty much the same reason id wanted the mushrooms you aint a complete fool dr john jack had said but youre ever running too close to the bleedin cliffedge wed been walking the pathway through the wood behind his dwelling an unusually muggy day a sneer of a day a taunt at a drear summers end my shirt had been sweated to my spine while my boots were yet soaked from the puddles look id been aware of the scrying profession most of my life my tad ofttimes making mock of it all furtive foreigners and gypsies whod gaze into a stone or a mirror and tell you where your missing property might be recovered or how many children youd have or if you underpaid them exactly when the children could expect to inherit your worldly goods rookers to a man and they ofttimes conduct their trade through an apothecary who takes a cut of the fee i could find you one no problem jack had said when i was in town we mustve had a dozen or more of these bleeders in the shop wanting me to put em in touch wiv the sick and the bereaved or anyone who needed somebody to talk to the dead on their behalf intercede wiv angels id kick their arses down the street and been cursed for it a few times but im still here aint i hed been gazing out between the heavy dripping trees towards the swollen river and his voice was damp with disdain why he said thats all im asking i aint getting it dr john ive watched men and woman staring into stones and seeing fings i cant see and if i cant see it you know what im saying everythings open to abuse i said but youre a a whatsit naturalphilosopher a man of bleedin science well exactly i said knowing the science behind crystalgazing makes all the difference i could have told him then precisely why i was of a sudden interested in the art of scrying but although i trusted him more than most it wasnt the time and id have to admit that id been as sceptical as he was until at the university of louvain id been given sight of a rare manuscript by the scholar and cabalist johannes trithemius of spanheim which explained why certain stones if used with knowledge and reverence could give access to the very engines of heaven a stones a stone dr john never dismiss whats beneath your feet jack crystals will absorb and reflect celestial rays if employed at certain times on certain days under specific planetary configurations theyll open up the inner rooms of the mind to levels of existence normally denied to us jack kicked a lesser stone into the grass spirits is it i sighed a very loose word ofttimes misused three spheres jack this earthly plane and above that the astral where earthbound spirits linger the place of ghosts and above and beyond all the supercelestial the overrealm the furnace room of heaven as a scholar of hebrew id studied in depth the cabala which through mystical symbolism offers a stairway to the sublime it makes logical mathematical sense and although jewish in origin can be practised just as effectively through christianity the christian cabala would be my shield against the earthbound spirits and the kind of demonic entities which might enter a shewstone and possess the unguarded scryer as distinct from the higher spirits the good spirits call them angels in europe i said the shewstone is seen as a legitimate method of penetrating the higher mysteries in england its yet a joke at best at worst the devils own mirror you told them this in europe hell no not for me to confirm their opinion of england as a land of philistines or to confess my own ignorance id read and reread the works of agrippa and what i could of trithemius but my personal experience was at best thin and always would be until i seized the nettle and took steps to acquire my own shewstone a good one a good crystal with which to carry out experiments but what kind what colour how big these were fundamentals i ought to have known about but did not for opinions varied youre an innocent soul dr john jack simm standing among the roots of a venerable oak and facing me like a father hands sunk into the pockets of his jerkin you fink fings is different now nobody gets burned the queen smiling all gracious oh yea folks can believe what they like long as they keep it to themselves like we aint heard all that before times change jack kings dont change nor queens its religious freedom one day then in a blinking its all about how to prove you aint a witchs daughter the queens mother anne boleyn executed by the queens father for treason and adultery had been possessed of a sixth finger and a furry growth on her neck how much evidence did you want now hows the queen do that jack said she makes war on witchcraft and her advisers look around for somebody wellknown to execute to make it look good a dead twig had snapped under his boot making me start as he sprang away from the oak forefinger aimed at my chest go on tell me its wivout bleedin precedent and you may mention the late king harry i wanted to laugh but it wouldnt come this queen was different this queen had an acute intelligence and questing mind fascinated by alchemy and the cabala this queen was powerfully protestant while celebrating the mass in deep privacy heresy id shrugged all science is heresy now can you help me hed paced a slow circle around the oak yea well hed said at last i suppose you oughter have somefink to take your mind off whats happening downriver hed meant london becoming known in europe as satans city and not at this moment a good place to be if you were a friend of robert dudley iv the smoke of rumour when brother elias had made his stately departure to the inn we ate bread and goatcheese with goodwife faldo it had been jacks idea that she should play the pigeon so that i might observe a scrying without giving away my identity goodwife faldo whod once taken my mother to see a cunning woman in the hope of asking my dead father if there was money hidden anywhere had agreed at once to accept me as her brother for the day after our meal she said shed walk out to the meadow to suggest to her husband and sons that rather than disrupt our sitting they might eat at the inn tonight i gave her my last shilling to pay for their meat and small beer and then jack and i walked down to the riverside where casks of freshbrewed ale were being loaded into a barge the air was cooling fast these evenings and the ambering sky above the distant city was smutted and heavy from first fires and the smoke of rumour i hadnt ventured into london for more than a week but the gossip had been drifting down to me like black flakes from a lampscorched purlin the city all atremble in the glitter of a dangerous lightning what were they saying when you were in town i asked one reason id come to trust jack simm he was a man of intelligence but without ambition without ambition what a blessed state that must be ofttimes my mother had accused me of it far from the truth of course i did have ambition though it related not to the attainment of high office so much as the acquisition of high knowledge not easy however without the level of protection that only wealth and position could provide thus far the queens patronage had given me freedom to pursue my studies but not the means for the fingers gripping the royal purse were famously held as tight as the rectal muscles of the ducks upon the river having calculed by the stars a smiling day for her coronation id hoped for secure office but nothing had come and if things went wrong i could soon as jack had warned be dangerously out of favour in many ways the daggersout world of political advancement was far simpler than mine wed moved away from the beerbarge back into the wood but i still kept my voice down low what were they saying about lord dudley you really want to know in truth i suspect not but here it is nobody i spoke to from the pieman to the pamphletseller finks he didnt murder her although the pieman reckoned killing your wife to make room for the next one is only part of a great tudor tradition so hes just getting in some practice for his future role as oh god enough of this you asked yes i said wearily i asked id barely seen robert dudley since hed journeyed with me to glastonbury in search of the bones of king arthur through which to strengthen the queens majesty as arthurs spiritual successor a quest with mixed success ive been hearing all about your journey to the west shed said on my one visit to the court since that mission the horrors of it lord robert was so very appreciative of your assistance in this matter my assistance highness thats what he said john shed laid a white and fragrant hand on my arm hes told me everything the lying selfpromoting bastard hes never been mightily popular since she made him master of the horse has he jack simm said the lavish festivities the arrogance the preening behind all that i said not without doubt is a man of integrity whos seen much death the execution of his father the duke of northumberland for the support of jane grey the shortestlived queen in history then his own confinement in the tower under a death sentence later withdrawn and all this time coming closer to the queen than any man grown up together locked away in the tower at the same time during her sisters reign always an understanding betwixt them and the carnal attraction as master of the horse he took her hunting knew how best to entertain her make her laugh which she loved to do little doubt theyd have wed if jack shrugged maybe hes seen so much of death its trivial to him now man who has his wife pushed down the stairs to get his paws on the queen not proven nah and never will be after they bribe the coroner hell walk away in a pomander haze but it wont make no difference will it still be the dog turd on a platter of sausages and the closer you are to him he was right of course but dudley and i went back too long though only a few years older id been appointed by his father to teach him mathematics and the mapping of the heavens and he it was whod sought my astrological advice on the coronation date now in the lowest alehouses and some higher places too by all accounts they were saying john dee had taught lord dudley the blackest arts of sorcery to win the queen for satan never underestimate the malice of the common man i sank my hands into the pockets of my doublet and in one found a hole i could never forget that while in glastonbury and rendered delirious by a fever my friend had confessed that hed wished his wife dead and now she was found at the foot of some stairs at a house called cumnor place in berkshire where she was staying with friends dumped there by dudley because the queen wouldnt have wives at court least of all his my hands felt cold bess and me were twin souls dudley had said when he was recovered from the fever as if convinced that a marriage to the queen was ordained by the heavens though hed never dared ask me to confirm it through astrology dear god never in all history had there been a better reason for a man to kill his wife and whats your thinking jack jack simm leaned against an ash trees bole smiling faintly i fink if the angel of the lord come down on top of the tower and proclaimed that lord dudley never done it and while hes here that dr john dee aint a sorcerer theyd all be waiting for his bleedin wings to drop off thank you jack now ask me why the scryers had to go back to the inn to warm his crystal were a shewstone to be used to reach the angelic extensive preparation would be needed days of purity fasting abstinence from alcohol in this instance i could think of three more practical reasons for the departure of elias to the inn he wants to ask what john dee looks like what apparel he wears and if will faldos brother works at the brewery but hes not quite a rooker is he or if so certainly of a higher grade than the lowlifes who hang like ravens around the taverns of southwark well jack said he did come recommended by a chaplain of the bishop of london did he now a good apothecary is ever wellconnected oh hes wellpatronised thats why he costs you still want me to ask him if he has a fine crystal to sell for an unnamed customer of yours yea yea dr john look he wont learn noffing at the inn this is mortlake and hes a stranger they all remember your old man whatever he done and they like your mother and as long as youre welcome at court they like you the wizard in his cave they try not to fink too hard about that or the owls what goes woo woo but they aint forgot when the queen come to visit you at candlemas and how much the inn raked in refreshing all the pikemen and the boys what carried the banners and the rest dont make light of what you done for mortlake dr john i shook my head bemused just dont bleedin ruin it now jack simm said v the ingle a waxing moons the best time for it this was what id read and it makes good sense to anyone who has stood on the edge of a tranquil pond and observed moonlight shivering in the water even more to those of us who watch and chart all the bright spheres of the heavens reflected light as above so below to hold a perfect crystal sphere in your hands is to enclose earth and heaven dear god to what level is this the truth the suns last stain lay upon the river when the scryer returned with his woodframed cloth satchel this time we truly had need of the candle and i leaned into its halo to watch him unpack his bag carefully taking out his treasures all swathed in layers of grey and black cloth have you eaten brother goodwife faldo asked goodwife he said softly one must needs fast before a scrying which could be true fasting prepares the body and keeps the spirit light and permeable this mans pomp and solemnity continued to imply a degree of learning id not expected i watched him laying out his bundles on the board his back to the empty ingle and the door to the winderstair then i stiffened when from the most shadowed end of our bench jack simm spoke and did you find dr dee all dark in this simple square farmhouse hall except for the white of jacks beard and the goodwifes coif i felt her black cat rubbing his head against my left calf and reached down to stroke him as if this discussion was no concern of mine the scryer looked up his eyes still if i were looking for dr dee id be disappointed not often here these days it seems appears to spend much of his time in the low countries giving lectures when hes not at court teaching magic to the queen so now you see jack said not looking at me why us lowly folk have no dealings wiv him though we do see his mother goodwife faldo said i made murmurs to the cat brother elias took out the shrouded stone and set it down before him and lowered the satchel to the stones behind his stool hard to believe that bodged place is his family home they say appearances have little value for the doctor jack said not a man for whom a display of wealth if wealth he has the house is very tidy inside goodwife faldo said very tidy indeed a man with neither wealth nor honour elias had unwrapped a pair of eyeglasses which he balanced on the bridge of his nose without looking up youd think given his position as the queens primary advisor on the mysteries hed be sir john by now i could almost hear jack simm inside my head screaming at me to say nothing hes good to his mother goodwife faldo said firmfaced and she to him apparently goodwife from what im told without his mother hed have no roof over his bed brother elias chuckled absently and then looked up at last but then thats no affair of mine lets now proceed shall we the stone lay before him still covered father elias placed his palms together above it closed his eyes oh god author of all good things strengthen i beseech thee thy poor servant that he may stand fast without fear through this work enlighten i beseech thee oh lord the dark understanding of thy creature that his spiritual eye may be opened to see and know thine angelic spirits descending here into this crystal he laid both hands upon the shrouded stone and my stomach tightened as if hed touched me for id read these words this entreaty written them even oh be sanctified and consecrated and blessed to this purpose that no evil phantasy may appear in thee or if they do gain ingress they may be constrained to speak intelligibly and truly and without the least ambiguity for christs sake amen and forasmuch as thy servant here desires neither evil treasures nor injury to his neighbour nor hurt to any living creature grant him the power of descrying those celestial spirits or intelligences that may appear in this crystal my hands went cold upon my thighs below the board top id translated it myself in the past year from unpublished writings id borrowed in antwerp and whatever good gifts whether the power of healing infirmities or of imbibing wisdom or discovering any evil likely to afflict any person or family or any other good gift thou mayest be pleased to bestow on me i threw a glance at jack simm but could not make out his eyes enable me by thy wisdom and mercy to use whatever i may receive to the honour of thy holy name grant this for thy son christs sake amen amen goodwife faldo said faintly outside the leaves on the trees were astir the evening shaking with the last birdsong when the scryer bent to his bundles i now knew exactly what hed unveil i saw an ebony pedestal and a golden plate and knew it would carry the engraving of the divine name tetragrammaton and the names michael gabriel uriel raphael the four archangels ruling over the sun moon venus and mercury a continued tightening in my chest a cool sweat upon my face and forehead trithemius had written that the names and characters must be drawn in order the names of the seven planets and angels ruling them with their seals or characters let them be all written within a double circle with a triangle silence now and an odd sense of sacrament i watched elias place the crystal still shrouded upon its pedestal becoming aware of goodwife faldos rapid breathing this being done thy table is complete and fit for the calling of the spirits i watched the scryers hands pulling away the cloth and saw for the first time the sphere what had i expected scrying crystals id seen some during my work abroad but id been a mathematician sometimes a teacher sometimes a student therefore interested only in their perfect geometry there hadnt been time then to approach their deeper mysteries nor had i been entirely convinced of what was said of them a stones just a stone at what point this night i became afraid im not quite sure to a scholar fear arrives with a certain shame akin to the shame a soldier feels holding himself back from the heat of the fray as his comrades are cut down before him not that id know unlike dudley ive never been a soldier the kind of knowledge i hold having preserved me from bodily conflict a bargain with the crown which decrees i must stride out wearing knowledge like armour the questing mind thrust forward like to a sharpened blade soon blunted tonight id set out from my mothers house believing that my own knowledge would far exceed that of the man i was to meet now i knew it wasnt so and i suppose the fear came out of this yes im a man of science and natural philosophy skilled from years of study in mathematics geography celestial configuration theology and so on and no i dont believe this is the endtime far from it in fact signs everywhere i look are telling me that this is the beginning of a new enlightenment an explosion of spiritual light such as the earth hasnt seen since the days of old greece and the ancient egypt of thricegreat hermes who walked the night sky as if it were his kitchen garden as above so below eliass hands were lifted and for a brief moment it was as though the candleglow shone from the hollows of his palms below them the true source of it a small planet of light it was no bigger than a cider apple beryl i guessed a gemstone which comes in several colours and the shewstone possessed all of them now a lucent brown like the brown of an eye now the soft ambered pink of a womans cheek it was as though the wan light had been expanded by some substance in the air making everything more vivid and i considered how this might be done what theatre the scryer might employ to render us all dizzy with delusion i watched his plump hands as they spread apart either side of the stone as if they were holding light like some solid object i watched his lips forming words i could not hear and thought him to be summoning some spirit from the ether i wanted to kill my fear by rising up and screaming at him tell me its name and then time had passed maybe faster than i knew in a hollow of muttering and liturgy and elias was whispering not to me but to goodwife faldo hold out your hand when she held it up hesitant he reached out quickly and seized her wrist and pulled her into the light and i halfrose fearing for some reason that he would feed her fingers into the candle flame but his own hand fell away and hers stayed in the air as if held there by strong light as if detached from goodwife faldo at the elbow had she met his eyes did he have the ability which ive marked in others to hold her in thrall or even all of us i shook myself blinking wildly fearing that long minutes may have passed in a state where my senses were not my own i saw that the scrying stone was duller now but seeming to quiver like to a toad on the boardtop and i didnt notice that the ringless hand had gone until i heard jack simm draw breath sharply as if aware of an alteration in the air did i feel that too maybe i found i was gazing not at the shewstone but into the ingle where a fire of logs and coal would soon be lit that would last all winter long the warm core of the house where a stewpot would hang the air pungent with cooking herbs grown by jack simm and the mellow crusting of bread in the sideoven but now in this thin uncertain peripheral time between seasons it was only a mean cavern of illdressed rubblestone and cold a cold reaching out of the ingle along with a stillness which could be felt like to the rancid waxen stillness of a stone chapel where a corpse lies before burial i liked it not i tell myself i dont fear death but the presence of the dead conveys no sense of peace to me and there can be no beauty without life clack something wooden falling to the floor a stool rolling away under the board and the cat rushed between my ankles and i heard a poor cry of the kind made without breath and saw that goodwife faldo was backed against the wall by the shuttered window her face shadowlined and stretched in agony her coif dragged back and she was pointing at the maw of the ingle and whimpering like an infant as if in another world the hands of elias were held apart two inches from the globe as though his fingers were bathed within its aura he said with mild curiosity tell me what you see goodwife i followed her wretched gaze heard her hoarsened voice death in what form oh my dear lord both hands over her face peering through her fingers the candleglow cold as a haloed moon her voice was held in my head and then faded as if it had lain down and died there panicked i lurched to my feet and tried to follow her gaze into the ingle all i saw there was packed rubblestone fading into the blackness of soot nothing more nothing jesu have i ever felt more worthless than when i stood there sightless hearing the returning voice of goodwife faldo an arid panting does this mean death for us oh please god make it go away please god father ive two sons one moment her body was bowed over in anguish upon a sob and then she was twisting around squirming upright and stumbling into the ingle where i could hear her fumbling about and then the muffled clang of the bread ovens door when she emerged her hands were clasped together as if she held a baby bird holding it out to elias hands shaking please she whispered i beg mercy brother ive sinned her shadow skating on the wall she opened out her hands and the ring clinked upon the board next the crystal goodwife faldo scrabbling after it shoulders still hunched and heaving snatching it up and ramming it on her finger losing her coif as she tumbled away across the room and dragged the shutters wide to expose the purpling dusk vi cousin it was like to the air after a storm has blown itself out the candle extinguished the hall draped in a drabness of brown and grey i felt weakened in a way i could not have anticipated and saw faces everywhere staring in from the unshuttered window and over the threshold where the door had been flung wide and one was my mothers jane dee stepping through the doorway darkgowned full of a fury seldom seen and so not easily dismissed your doing mother what have you caused a tall woman of sixty years admirably unbowed by circumstance but ever dismayed by what i did and pained that my meagre earnings were spent more on books than repairs to the house my late tad had halfbuilt however jane dee was never more formidable than when bleeding from anothers wound goodwife faldos in bitter distress yes i said tightly i know what have you brought into her house you tell me now john what have you done we were alone goodwife faldo had not returned and i looked around for elias but he too was gone along with jack simm and the shadowed faces at the open door and the window some of them melting away upon the arrival of my mother who like my father had been a good catholic but now mistrusted the miraculous was it was the miraculous ever so mean cold and squalid as what seemed to have happened here this night on second thought dont tell me my mother said i let go a sigh its gone anyway as if i knew as if i was in any position to state that what id never seen was now no more but my shivers recalled the deep bonecold which no fire can reach because its forever beyond this life beyond the air that we breathe and i did not want to look again into the ingle and see nothing believing her family will perish for her sins my mother was saying any sin this night i said almost angrily is mine john she said sadly as if i didnt know that the way shed spoken to me when i was six years old mother i said wearily i beg mercy but it wasnt dont beg mine beg hers yes yes ill do that gladly for goodwife faldo was a good and generous woman and i must needs make it clear to her that there was nothing for her to fear and would have tried to explain it to my mother if id thought that for one silent minute shed listen it had been no more than wed deserved i knew that now and profoundly regretted involving goodwife faldo in this conceit even the protective prayers intoned by brother elias would have been ineffective because our sitting was built upon deception any summoning not grounded in full honesty attracts only that which thrives on lies confusion and all the lower longings of humanity which remain undissolved by death and i knew id get no sleep this night if id failed to find out what form it had taken what theyd all seen and i oh blood of christ had not here my mother drew something from a fold of her gown this was delivered placing on the board a thin letter with a seal which oh my god i recognised at once i picked it up and knew the paper of all the times for this to be delivered mother when did this arrive not ten minutes ago its why i was coming to find you amid all the clamour and upset i carried the letter to the window and broke the seal tension quickening my blood as in the fading light i read dr dee there is a need to speak with you on behalf of our cousin my barge will dock in mortlake tomorrow at eight unsigned yet i knew my heart all aquake that it was from mistress blanche parry my elder cousin on my fathers side but that the cousin referred to in the letter was someone to whom neither of us was related this term had been used before to disguise the identity of she whom blanche served as senior gentlewoman it was significant that this was far from a formal missive it meant i was to be consulted in confidence mother the messenger hes not waiting for a reply my mother who also knew that seal shook her head and then found a strained smile any kind of summons to court would renew her hopes of me finding a stable income she was of good family and had barely spoke to me for a week after i turned down the offer of a permanent lecturers post at oxford i shall go now john left too quickly with neither cloak nor lamp youd best come home when youve brought your small comfort to goodwife faldo when she was gone i took several long breaths and then knelt before the ingle alone here now and held in dread for all my bookfed knowledge of what i could not see i said a fervent prayer to banish all unwanted spirits from this house and then espying under the window the coif shed by goodwife faldo i picked it up and left this end of the village was quiet now the sky pricked with first stars over the darkening river which linked us better than any road with london i wondered if it would be mistress blanche in that barge tomorrow or the queen herself then turned knowing where the goodwife would be st marys mortlake is a modern church towered but without steeple a misjudgement in my view for a steeple conducts to earth divers rays from the firmament when worshipping here however i tend to keep opinions like this to myself a wisehead is seldom welcome in the house of god a single candle was lit upon the high altar goodwife faldo bent in mute prayer on the lowest chancel step i walked quietly along the aisle and knelt alongside her leaving a seemly distance betwixt us i held out the coif marking the dawning of grey in the strands of her freed hair a sheen of tears on her cheeks as she looked up at me a pale smile flickering in the candlelight why can we never leave well alone dr john tucking her hair into the white linen i knew what she meant but the idea of it was well beyond the imagining of a man who lives only to meddle its gone i said hoping to god i was right all gone now where a good question but this was hardly the time or place to serve up a treatise on the nature of the middle sphere back into the stone i said and the stone is back in the scryers bag where it should have stayed oh fie dr john lifting herself to the second step which she sat upon the first mention of it by master simm and i was hooked like an eel she gazed beyond me into the darkness of the nave when i was a child i loved to go into church and feel it all closing around me i felt cloaked in colours and the sweetness of the incense and all the latin like to the sound of spells being uttered more more magic than i could hold yes the church had been all about magic then if wed but known it and then the king made god smaller goodwife faldo said i looked at her with an admiration that surprised me her tearstreaked face shone like an apple in the warm candlelight i turned quickly away and looked up at the long panes in the stained window above the altar bright coloured glass reduced by the night to the dull hues of turned earth dont let them stop you dr john who the puritans the bible men theyre taking hold get one of them as king and the world will be a grey place this queen wont see that happen the queen loves magic and wonder yes so were told but she must have care as must you small people like me noone cares any more what we believe as long as we turn up at church on a sunday and say the right words i wouldnt be taken away any more for letting a scryer into my house would i frances i said what did you see i lost my mind i dont think so there was a change in the air such as ive never felt since i was a child there was i felt it the presence of something that wasnt i cant put it into the best words im only a farmers wife and i dont read very well and i tell me id hid the ring in the bread oven and of a sudden i felt a terrible guilt about that as if it was the worst thing id ever done as if id lied to god and it came into my head that i must face a terrible penance and the worst of all penance to me would be holding back tears the loss of your family i said she nodded and that was when i saw the figure of a pale man not clear at first as though made of dust motes the bones the bones were more solid and had their own she shuddered i looked for her eyes bones the bones had their own awful light as though it were not light where were these bones he was holding them one in each hand clasped to his chest death deaths heads skulls more than one how can i ever sit before that hearth again you can it wont happen again goodwife not there not ever again none of it putting it all together in my head as i spoke none of it was real only pictures conjured from the crystal which held us all in thrall changed your head around so that you took your worst fears and made them into pictures she nodded yet uncertain ephemeral i said firmly illusion nothing was there you didnt lie to god only to the scryer and you admitted it to him you put things right it took away the magic but i felt it was what she wanted to hear at this moment and theres been no plague this summer i said watching myself forming words while i was somewhere else somewhere grey and foetid and full of bones i feel so much calmer now goodwife faldo said and laughed lightly thank you dr john vii coincidence and fate mortlake high street sticky blurred lanternlight echoes of the cackle and whoop of roistering from the inn and presently the spatter of piss against a wall no place to look up at the stars or the newborn moon after walking goodwife faldo to her door i should have gone home and slept to be refreshed and fully sentient at the riverside on the morrow but how could i sleep now the inn was ahead of me recently extended to offer five bedchambers two with glass in their windows for the moneyed traveller but yet a rough place after dark i slowed my steps recalling a night when for no clear reason id been given a beating by men unknown to me although it was clear they knew who i was smash the conjurer down smash him down in the name of god soft footsteps behind me and i turned a light shining out in my path and i froze into stillness as it rose level with my face go quietly dr john jack he carried one of the candle lanterns you could borrow from the inn if you were deemed sober enough to remember where to return it i said where is he abed i assume then ill wake him up no need jack said we shared half a jug of small beer in the back room and he said it happens on occasion when the stones active spirits that manifest in the crystal can be fetched out of it and into the air astral forms apparitions creatures of the air the scryer must never allow himself to become distracted by them thats their aim he says to distract him all they seeks attention his anyway he gestured back up the street and i followed him back towards the church we stood in the shadow of the coffin gate where jack put the lamp on the ground elias has a reputation going back to days as a novice at wenlock priory up towards shrewsbury yes where he caused some concern jack paused sniffed visions i said nothing and he began to rhyme them off without emphasis as if listing ingredients for a stew holy martyrs stepping from the stained glass noises in the night words mysteriously etched on the walls of locked chambers cracks in statues well this was the time of the reform not what anybody wanted then so when the abbot finks about maybe having him exorcised hes off takes to the road where the gift of vision once kept under the board becomes his living evidently a good one when he fetches up in london sure where he has patronage if he was recommended to jack by a chaplain to the bishop of london might that not mean he had the protection of the bishop himself somebodys looking out for him thats for sure jack said i picked up the lantern and asked because i had to what did you see this night what did you see in the ingle no reply back down the street some man was retching jack ah how can we ever know what did elias see in the crystal wasnt a ring thats for sure look he wouldnt talk about it and i didnt want to come over too pushy he says it dont matter what he sees he never questions it hes only the middleman and you saw me i dunno bones hazy grey manshape wiv bones i didnt like it marked i said urgently before i could stop myself marked here snatching up the lantern holding it to my face and raising fingers to my cheeks and here keep your bleedin voice down marked how black lumps as seen in places where sheep are farmed wool gathered hell i knew this was a far cry from scientific inquiry that the last thing i should do was prompt him but i was tired and overwound who you got in mind dr john there was a man i met in glastonbury a trader in what he claimed were holy relics but they were just old bones he had hundreds of bones if they were digging up a graveyard for more burials hed be there with his bag in the end he was able to give me the intelligence i needed about the bones of arthur this was just before he died of of woolsorters disease face full of foul black spots benlow the boneman i recalled with a sick tremor how this man an obvious buckhunter had tried to attach himself to me never thought id meet a man as famous as you my lord he wanted to come to london wanted me to bring him back with me i may have implied that this would be possible you made a bargain wiv him i suppose i was in his debt but if he thought we had a bargain it was one i couldnt keep benlow crouching amid the smashed shelves of his grisly warehouse having attempted in his agony to take his own life by cutting his wrists and his throat but too weak dying eventually surrounded by the detritus of death the bones hed offered for sale as relics of the saints a rooker in every sense but in the end id felt pity for him and some measure of guilt and now he haunted me wanting me to know he was there even though i could not see him worse it seemed to me than if i could the injustice mocked me daily the learned bookman heavens interpreter cursed by a poverty of the spirit i knew more about the engines of the hidden than any man in england but i could not see except on occasion in dreams and maybe in a scryers crystal i looked up at the night sky in search of familiar geometry but it had clouded over and there were neither stars nor moon jack erm did you by chance ask him where one might be obtained a shewstone course i asked him but it aint simple dr john and it aint cheap brother elias had said there was always a few around but most of them were of little value to a scryer full of flaws and impurity the more perfect of them were hard to come by and cost more than a court banquet and might be dangerous jack simm said how for a novice he meant the more perfect ones have been used by men of power a man whats never scryed might find himself driven into madness it would take a man of knowledge and instinct to deal wiv what it might bring into the world hmm a responsibility laden wiv obligation his words of course like to a wife jack said you must take it to your bed go to im telling you what he said there must needs be a close bond twixt the crystal and the scryer so you might sleep wiv it under your bolster bit bleedin lumpy if you ask me but monks is fond of discomfort there was logic here crystal possesses strangely organic qualities crystal spheres change grow in response to unseen influences the stone in the faldos hall this night the way its colours changed the way it seemed to tremble or crouch like a toad ripples in my spine ofttimes you dont choose the stone jack said the stone chooses you he said the right one might come along when you aint looking for it and does he have one he might sell reckons hes offered crystal stones wherever he goes but most of ems flawed and theres aw jesu i could see this coming a mile off apart from his own theres only one other hes coveted in years odd that aint it go on the kind you dont find anywhere in europe maybe a treasure from some ancient people of the west a history of miracles and healing but the man who has it hell want a fair bit more gold than brother elias could put his hands on and brother elias if i dont insult you here dr john is a richer man than you jack i said sadly you are a richer man than me where did he see it abbey of wigmore not a long ride from wenlock out on the rim of wales thats where he said he seen it i did know of this abbey it was close in fact to where my father was born dissolved now of course was it your impression that elias might be an agent for whoever has the stone could be told him i was inquiring for a regular customer but i reckon he knows he was certainly asking questions about the extent of my wealth i said maybe he thinks i keep it abroad whatever it dont give me a good feeling he aint a rooker in the normal sense but its all too much like coincidence and fate i knew what he was saying but i was in a profession which dismissed neither fate nor coincidence only sought the science behind them who owns the stone he was being close on that but i had the impression it was the last abbot gone now obviously and the abbey passed through the crown and into private hands long ago easy enough to find out whose but the abbott is he even in the vicinity any more blind me you dont bleedin listen do you dr john you could sell your house and put your mother on the streets and you still couldnt afford it i dont understand none of this i dont see why the scrying stone any scrying stone is suddenly become so important for you theyve been around forever why now above the coffin gate a single planet the great jupiter inevitably had found a hole in the nightcloud as if to remind me of my insignificance and the pointlessness of concealment i could sit on the truth of this matter keep it to myself take it to my grave because oh god because the study of its properties notably in the matter of communion with angels was suggested to me by whom is it not obvious jupiter seemed to pulse as if sending signals to me and was transformed into the sun in the pure glass of a tall window in a booklined chamber at the palace of greenwich where a light merry voice was asking me had i thought of this and had i looked into that bugger jack said thats all you need i hear the french king consults one owned by the seer nostradamus which is of immense benefit in planning campaigns and winning the support of the angels do you have a shewstone of your own john will it give us communion with the angels well obviously i do highness and intend to spend some time assessing its capabilities but perhaps worth more attention john dont you think jesu dr john jack simm said you really know how to put yourself between heaven and hell and a pile of shite we all walk a cliffedge i said shell forget though wont she she got too much to worry about i blinked jupiter away of course the queen would not forget unless by design she forgot nothing yea well jack simm tossed the heel of a hand into my shoulder leave it alone eh i fear i shall have to i said good he picked up his lantern its a wasps nest go to your bed and fink not of ghosts i nodded resigned this was not a night to remember with satisfaction not in any respect thank you i said but just piss off dr john i nodded passed through the coffin gate to the churchyard and the path to our house even made it up to the rickety stilted terrace before turning around to make sure i was not followed by the sickly shade of benlow the boneman how much easier we could all sleep now that lutheran theologians had assured us that with the abolition of purgatory ghosts were no longer permitted to exist viii favoured that night it rained hard and my sleep was scorched by dreams lately id been welcoming journeys through the inner spheres and would keep paper and ink at my bedside to write down their substance upon awakening but these these i made no notes upon because i dreamed not as id feared of benlow the boneman but oh god of eleanor borrow with her green eyes and her soft body so close that i could feel its eager heat and had thrown out my arms in a feral desire one of the few dreams id wished never to awake from even if it meant god help me embracing death but i had of course awoken at once and nels warm body was gone to cold air as if shed been no more than a succubus some siren of sleep sent to taunt me i may have cried out in my anguish in the pallid dawn only the pain in my heart was real for since nel in glastonbury id not lain with a woman and before her never at all it would have been wrong to feel a bitterness about this for my waking life had been given over to study my father had not ofttimes been a wealthy man hed been proud to see me at cambridge at the age of fourteen and in order to repay him sooner id eschewed strong drink carousing and even sleep and now my poor tad was disgraced and dead and while my scholars knowledge of mathematics and the stars had brought me some small fame in the universities of europe in england i was regarded by many as little more than jesu i rolled from my bed in a rush of anger as little more than a rooker myself i had few friends not much money and no wife and oh how my perception of this last condition had changed the hollow emptiness of the single mans life was something id never felt before my time with nel a constant raw longing which for virtually all my sentient years had applied only to knowledge dear god what am i become at the breakfast board my mother said the hole in the roof that you attempted to mend last week is a hole once more holding up the painted cloth which had hung in the hall soaked through now i closed my eyes with some weariness shed probably been up since well before dawn preparing sweetmeats with catherine her only servant making sure the house was as fit as ever it could be to welcome the woman closest to the queen hardly for the first time i felt a strong pity for my mother something in that terse letter had told me it was unlikely that blanche would even leave her barge this day just as with the visits of the queen all my mothers work would be wasted its been a summer of endless rain i said and ive never pretended to be any kind of builder builders are men we should employ when the moneys there when the moneys there my mothers voice was flat you buy more books i tore off a lump of bread it was true enough but i needed books and all the knowledge therein and more all the knowledge that was out there needed to be ahead of the others or what hope was there for us another winters coming my mother pulled her robe close about her and came out with what clearly had long been in her mind by the end of the summer id rather expected you to have been favoured there could be no happy reply to this i suppose i also had expected well something by now not necessarily a knighthood sir william cecil as the queens chief minister inevitably would advise against the ennoblement of a man still considered by many to be a common conjurer what i needed far more than social status was a secure supply of money ofttimes the queen had sent for me and would receive me pleasantly and wed talk for two or more hours about the nature of things if she truly valued what i provided both as an astrologer and a cabalist then surely something with a moderate income would not be out of order something to replace the rectorate of uptonuponsevern awarded by the shortlived king edward only be to taken away in marys time more than a year and a half had passed since elizabeths coronation held on a day calculed by me according to the stars as heralding a rewarding reign and such for the most part it had been until the death of amy wife of dudley i rose brushing a few crumbs from my fresh doublet and the ridiculous venetian breeches my mother had had made by a woman in the village there was nearly an hour to spare before blanches barge was due but almost certainly shed be early a severe and efficient woman my cousin and usually disapproving of me until she wanted something my mother had insisted i should be at the riverside over half an hour before the royal barge was due to arrive from richmond palace but as i had no wish to draw attention to what i guessed would be a discreet visit i used the time to go to the inn to leave a letter for the post rider my dream of nel had reminded me of the journeyman mapper john leland who might have been her father and id gone into my library early this morning and taken down his itinerary to confirm that wigmore abbey was within a few miles of my tads birthhome nantygroes with this in mind it had seemed worth writing to my cousin nicholas meredith who lived in the nearest small town id never been to the town or met nicholas meredith but had received a letter of congratulation from him after the queens coronation on the date calculed by me this being widely spoken of at the time wed exchanged a few letters since so i felt able to ask him in confidence if he knew anything of the present whereabouts of the former abbot of wigmore whom i wished to consult on a matter of antiquarian interest it had been madness to lie to the queen about owning a shewstone and the only fortuitous aspect of the current turbulence at court was that she hadnt asked me to bring it to her yet i hear the french king consults one owned by the seer nostradamus hmm it seemed unlikely that the crystal consulted by the wellfavoured and undoubtedly wealthy nostradamus would be the kind of minuscule flawed mineral that i could afford id wondered if i might see brother elias at the inn and if it might be worth revealing my identity in hope of learning more about the wigmore stone it was a relief i suppose to find hed gone at first light which left only one other man in london who might know of the stone or at least be able to direct me to someone who did maybe i could see him tomorrow for at least i knew where he was the river lay brown and morose under dour cloud wherries busy as i waited at the top of the stone steps a black barge was moored where the beer had been loaded yesterday several men sitting in it as if waiting for cargo but the river traffic was nearly all londonbound no sign of flags or the glint of helm and pike blade nor i guessed would there be my poor mother i looked back towards the house my only home now and thought i marked her face all blurred in the window of her parlour river water lay in shallow pools around the stilts supporting the parlour and hall far from the most distinguished dwelling this even in mortlake saddening to think that several properties had once been owned by my father who had first come to london as a wool merchant progressing to the import and export of cloth this was before his appointment as gentleman server to the king who also made him packer of goods for export and that paid a good income oh an important man my tad for a while until the financial collapse which left him with a cluster of riverside outbuildings bought cheaply and linked together to form a most eccentric dwelling which yet looked temporary from the river steps i could see to one side of the house the orchard and the small pasture rented for crumbs to william faldo it was yet my aim to use part of it to extend the house for further accommodation of my library consisting at this time of two hundred and seventyseven books many of them the only editions to be found anywhere in england id offered them to the queen and to queen mary before her for the foundation of a national library of england but a monarch would ever rather spend money on war than learning unless of course it was the kind of learning that might effectively be used in war one thing was sure if there was no improvement in my situation then god help me i might have to sell books to repair the roof and find work teaching the sons of whichever of the moneyed gentry were prepared to employ an infamed conjurer dr dee two men had climbed from the black barge at the rivers edge and were approaching the steps i was fairly sure i knew them not and made no reply sent to fetch you doctor oh naturally i was wary id heard of men whod been taken aboard such vessels as this robbed and killed for their valuables and their remains thrown in the river and no the irony was not lost on me i didnt move when the first of them reached the top step i saw that he was young smallbearded and wellclad in rusted doublet high leather boots and good gloves he looked impatient the circumstances of your appointment have now been changed doctor my appointment he let a low breath through his teeth mistress blanche has been called away to attend to the queens majesty but expects to be free to speak to you by the time we reach greenwich i see well then he stood aside extending an arm to where his companions and the oarsmen waited in the black barge i had no choice but to follow him down the steps at the bottom he stood back while i boarded the barge and then leapt in after me and the oarsmen pushed us hastily from the bank too hastily it seemed to me i yet felt all was not right and stood close to the bow of the vessel sit down please doctor the young man said it sounded more like an instruction than an invitation but there were good cushions to sit on though hardly luxurious this clearly was not a cargo barge and i was not alarmed until as we moved downriver towards the steaming midden of southwark it was steered sharply away from another barge coming out of london towards mortlake this one had no flags but there were at least seven armed men aboard and one woman subduedly cloaked and gazing ahead of her when i thought to hail my cousin and halfrose i heard movement behind me and twisting round i saw the first man reaching to his belt either you hold your tongue at this moment dr dee he said pleasantly or i must needs slice it off at the root part two i have no way to purge myself of the malicious talk that i know the wicked world will use robert dudley in a letter to his steward thomas blount ix the summoning of siôn ceddol autumn the welsh border my father grew up in a modest farmhouse below the hill called brynglas at pilleth on the border of england and wales the welsh side the house nantygroes is now the home of stephen price who until recently was member of parliament for this area thus spending much time in london more than was necessary if truth be known for master price was much taken with the excitement of london life and on his increasingly infrequent returns home would tend to find the place of his birth rather dull and for the first time strange now hes home for good fighting the drabness of his life with ambitious plans for his farm but finding that life at pilleth soon brings out the negative aspects of his essentially choleric temperament hes dismayed for example when the village men wont help him build his new barn he has intentionally perhaps forgotten how below brynglas even the most commonplace activity is ofttimes governed by custom and ritual i cant he says when pedr morgan the shepherd tentatively offers him advice im supposed to be i am the squire he twists away anyway the boys the lowest kind of idiot i can hardly be seen to consult an idiot before initiating something as fundamental as building a barn master price likes to use some of the longer words he picked up in parliament this will not last pedr morgan shrugs his scrawny shoulders no doubt wishing he were somewhere else this is common on brynglas at twilight its just what he does morgan says uncomfortable you knows how it is i know how it was master price says with resignation well my thanks to you morgan but ill have men brought in from off local boys dont want my money thats their choice ennit pedr morgan nods he wont press the matter and wont be telling anybody what master price has said about siôn ceddol has no wish to stir up resentment against his master but hell it must be some godless place that london sodom and gomorrah and london thats how the new rector puts it the rectors this bonefaced bibleman and he doesnt like siôn ceddol either and thats not good at all for the rigid attitudes of a bonefaced bible man will never bend stephen price stamps irritably away and pedr morgan thin and tired most of his hair gone before its time looks down to where his wife is waiting by the bridge with their three young children she wont follow him up the slope of brynglas at close of day any more than shell pass the earthen grave of the old dead even the sheep flee this hill before sunset and price knows all that at the bottom of him but hes been away too many times hes seen the shining towers of the future and the future looks not like pilleth none of the fine towns hes seen on his travels has risen out of old fear and clinging superstition this can lead only to a mortal decay the decay that pilleth wears like a rancid old coat which no one must tear from its body lest the body itself falls away into rotten strips pedr morgan raises a hand to tell his wife hes coming down then turns briefly towards the church of st mary set into the hill halfway up and crosses himself as he always does except when the rectors there i suppose i too was inclined to be dismissive and superior when my father spoke of his birthplace putting on the accents which he would say might vary from country english to country welsh within a mile for i was younger then and deep into my studies of mathematics and greek and the works of euclid and plato convinced that all knowledge and wisdom came from the classical world long gone unaware of the rivers of the divine and the demonic which rush invisibly through and around places like pilleth and i suppose my tads fond memories of the border were shaped around the knowledge that he was unlikely ever to be going back a month has passed stephen price has new cattle in the lower field the first frosts cannot be far off yet only foundations for the new barn have been dug painfully and laboriously by himself and his sons assisted fearfully by the servants at nantygroes to his fury price has failed to recruit skilled labour in presteigne the prosperous assize town a few miles from here every man hes approached claiming an obligation to work elsewhere or some affliction that renders him incapable of heavy labour its those great shelves of rock found less than a foot down that finished it after three long days of struggle and the wrenching of a muscle in his back he finally walks out to find pedr morgan the shepherd grumpily requesting him to talk to mistress ceddol about the employment of her damned brother he says nothing to his wife who during his time as an mp preferred to live down the valley with his older brothers family joan doesnt like it here and probably hopes that all his plans will fail so they dont have to stay on the morning siôn ceddol comes the land appears luminous the shaven haymeadows all aglisten from the rain following a thunderstorm which broke over radnor forest in the early hours awakening the whole wide valley before dawn the strangeness soon becomes apparent to stephen price its as though the summoning of siôn ceddol has set into a motion some ancient engine people come as if to prepare the way first to appear is the new rector of pilleth fullrobed and carrying his prized copy of the new english prayerbook arriving at sunup he stands alone in the shorn grass the prayer book open in his twiggy hands his lips are seen to be moving although his voice is so hushed rapid and intense that nobody hears the substance of it approaching him as he knows must be expected of him price is wishing to god that father walter had not died when he did father walter was no papist but he understood the ways of pilleth the rectors look would turn fresh apples black that you of all men he says would bend a knee to satan and youd have all my cattle dead by christmas would you rector if god wills it if god wills it price thinks feeling his face redden likely well have a new rector by all souls day stephen price stands his ground for all he dismisses superstition he carries no candles for a god with all the pity of a norman baron after a few minutes the rector throws back his bony head and with the book under an arm walks stiffly away in the direction of the hillside church at the same time villagers begin appearing on the boundaries of stephen prices ground like the risen dead master stephen hes yere the housekeeper clarys at his elbow a woman who was at nantygroes long before stephen price and may even have been known to my tad clarys nods towards the lower gate that gives entrance to the presteigne road and the river bridge two figures stand behind it male and female stephen price raises a weary hand towards the gate and beckons once before thrusting the hand away embarrassed when the two people pass through one is walking an irregular path watching the ground like a dog responding to a scent its the first time stephen price has seen siôn ceddol he doesnt even know how the boy and his sister came to be in pilleth village they seem to have arrived during one of his periods in london the mad boy apparently receiving the blessing of mother marged the wise woman before her death through the sunhaze he marks a scrawny boy of some sixteen years wearing an illfitting jerkin and a red hat when the boy reaches the platter of land on which the barn is marked out he stops and turns the hat around on his head and sniffs the air like some wary animal never once looking at stephen price or anyone and when he speaks its only to the woman with him and is neither in english nor welsh but some language of his own which ranges from mumbling to screams and yelps like to a fox price has been told that many people believe this to be a faerie language yet are drawn to him its said like nightmoths to a taper already the people on the southern boundary hedge number twenty or more watching the idiot boy pacing rapid circles in the grass this is madness price mutters drawing a sharp look from the one person here who appears to understand what siôn ceddol is saying anna ceddol the boys sister who speaks both english and welsh and also it seems faerie shes approaching twentynine years and unmarried because of her brother obviously an old maid in waiting their parents are dead shes all he has and who would have the mad boy and so no one has her which is a crime against all creation price thinks marking how lovely she is in a way not of her class head held high hair brushed back and eyes wide open unafraid to the point of insolence whats he doing stephen price demands of her speaking roughly no doubt to ride over a surging of desire as siôn ceddol teeters on the edge of the nearest of the foundation trenches and then jumps down into it wait anna ceddol says if you please master price and so they all wait stephen price and his sons behind him and his servants behind them as siôn ceddols red hat is seen bobbing along the top of the trench suggesting that surely he can only be crawling along the bottom i was not of course there but i can feel the air as i write all aglow with trepidation and awe and an unnatural excitement the soul of a village briefly lit by the glow of its disease after some minutes the boy emerges crawling like to a spider from the trench kneeling he takes the hat off his tousled black hair beating it against an arm and then turning it in his hands as if to make sure its clean of mud before replacing it on his head ner he says his bottom lip thrust out sullen nothing there anne ceddol tells stephen price the boy has stepped back from the trench and now walks towards the beginnings of another his hands splayed in front of him stiffly at first and then aquiver as he reaches it its not a warm day few of those this summer but the sun is well aloft and lights the shallow trench as he drops into it then disappears from sight and theres the sound of scratting and a mist of earth flies up fetch him a scratter stephen price tosses the instruction to his eldest son annoyed that he cant take his eyes away from the place where siôn ceddol disappeared when a trowell is produced anna ceddol accepts it and takes it to her brother and returns to price thank you she stands so close that her beauty must be disturbing the hell out of him cant avoid marking the form of her breasts where her overdress is worn thin the dress is the colour of the soilspatter thrown up from the trench before a screech like to a barnowl drives the people back in a panic of excitement and now siôn ceddols on his feet again his face lit with a broad pink grin though not it must be said as broad as the grin of the earthbrowned human skull now held up clasped tightly between the boys eager hands to keep the jaw attached weeks hence when his barn is built and the summoning of siôn ceddol is raised one market day in the new bull inn at presteigne stephen price may be heard making dust of it how the idiot boy was putting on a show of searching the ground foot by foot when he knew all along where the bones lay having price is convinced buried them there the night before either him or that sister of his who ofttimes disturbs price even more and in ways hed rather not tell you about well he says in the bull to bradshaw and beddoes and meredith ent as if theyd have had difficulty finding bones on brynglas like to a charnel house this year an omen theyre saying the villagers like the weather a reminder bradshaw eases his weight upon the bench and farts dont they know of the capture of this man gethin is that not a good sign for them hell no stephen price almost laughs aloud its another sign that its all coming back the blood and the fire and theyre unprotected well itll be good for us bradshaw says theyve never recognised us in the west as the county town now were settling their score for them stephen price says nothing bradshaws from off crossed the border to swell his fortune he thinks wealth is the balm for all wounds price buys more wine he can ill afford this year to dull the fears that chatter in his head like the restless sprites that hes sure no one he met in parliament believes in blanking out the image of the skull the boy found one eyehole twice the size of the other where the blade went in the night before last stephen price woke in a sweat from a dream where he saw a man lying all cut about on his back in his own blood on the side of brynglas hill with another man standing above him twisting the squat blade of his pike round and back and round again in that left eye while the dying man screams to heaven price drinking harder to drown out the voice of the new and forbidding rector the narrow whitefaced man arching his spine peering into his face asking him master price why do you let the devil have rein in pilleth x begins in joy the cold rain was lashing us by the time i was led to the scaffold more rickety than the last time id been here some of the frame hanging loose it might bear the weight of a man but not for long clearly had not been used for some time and its poor condition seemed in keeping with the rumours id heard why did you not say where we were going angry now but the man in the rusted doublet ignored my question as he had every one since wed left mortlake we passed under the scaffold to the front door opened as we reached it by an armed servant and then up the stairs i knew the way the owner used to call it his cottage it was three storeys high and now had several newmade windows taller than a man when last id been here builders had been intensively at work on the scaffold seemingly engaged on turning this into the finest house on the strand but rumour had suggested this might not be the london home of the secretary of state for much longer was to have been another large window in the master bedroom by now the secretary said mournfully when i was shown into his work chamber foolish of me to wait for fine weather in a summer like this anything else sir william the man whod brought me loitered in the doorway until cecil raised a dismissive hand from the folds of his drab robe no no thank you fellows ill send for you when dr dees ready to leave no need i said curtly ill hail a wherry cecil peered at me sit down john i stayed on my feet behind the proffered chair the usual mean coal fire smouldered in the hearth behind me and the rain rattled the panes whenever i was here there would be rain if id refused to step into that barge sir william would they have brought me here in chains cecils guarddog eyes widened fractionally you think chains would have been necessary to restrain you taking more exercise nowadays is it bigger books i said higher shelves he didnt laugh for cecil banter was never indulged in for its own sake only to grant himself more time to think i noticed hed put on more fat since last id seen him as if to make himself harder to shift fewer than forty years behind him but youd have thought at least fifty john i regret that we havent spoken a great deal since your return from somerset with the ah remains of king arthur the queen i cleared my throat the queen believes it was dudleys mission i was there to hold his bridle while he resolved matters i wouldnt normally have passed this on but i was tired of being undervalued and thus underpaid and guessed that for the first time this man who had survived service to three successive monarchs would begin to understand oh really cecil said mildly what else would you have expected there was considerable tension this year between cecil and dudley whose star had grown brighter in the royal firmament than venus at dawn cecil meanwhile had been deemed a disappointment for his failure in negotiations with the french to regain calais for england this had ever been unlikely but the idea that it was even possible had been put into the queens head by dudley of course i said nothing the word was that cecil had felt himself abused to the point where hed tendered his resignation to the queen but then amy robsart who had become amy dudley had died and something had snapped like an overwound crossbow cecil went to sit down behind his trestle the great windows lower frames were barricaded from outside by the builders scaffold but when he leaned back tilting his oaken chair on two legs against the sill at least half the spires of london were once again at his elbows blurred by rain john would you happen to know why mistress blanche wanted to see you would you i might however i said when she and presumably the queen find out that you physically prevented the meeting taking place as arranged shell simply realise that you didnt receive the letter i gather it was left with your mother you being absent at the time how the hell did he know all this having gone off on one of your expeditions in search of the hidden cecil leaned forward until the front legs of his chair met the floor do you want to know what this visit may have been about john and what was i supposed to say to that cecil half stood to pull off his bulky black robe revealing a doublet in what was for him the somewhat frivolous colour of charcoal he tossed the robe across the wide trestle in front of him now sit down he said the people of the welsh border take a long path to the point my father loved to explain that this was because in an area ever riven by conflict between the welsh and the english they would need to know precisely where a visitors allegiances lay before entrusting him with even the most trivial intelligence id ofttimes marked this approach in the manners of blanche parry who retained her accent but was inclined to forget that the family of william cecil from whose tones all trace of welshness had long ago been smoothed had once spelled its name seisyllt did you know amy robsart john i wouldnt say i knew her she tended not to come very much to town an understatement the queen was not exactly approving of wives brought to court or even to london especially dudleys wife obviously in the absence of a dudley country mansion amy had spent most of her married life as a guest of various friends of her husband a dismal existence met her once i said on one of her rare visits to dudleys house at kew and what thought you of her at last i sat down truth was id thought amy quite beautiful also intelligent lively and warm in my view was this treason as a wife the queen would not quite compare god help me id even caught myself wishing that circumstances had been such that i might have met her before dudley youre blushing cecil said heat of the fire cecil laughed what a waste eh john as i ofttimes think about a carnal marriage starts in joy ends in tears cecil frowned id gone too far a perceptive saying of yours ofttimes retold i said in placation he made a steeple of his fingers his own first marriage may even have been a carnal union but his second one to the severe mildred could only have been founded on a need for reliability and circumspection cecil was a man long wed to his career do you know when he last saw her alive i did but said nothing remembering something else id noticed at my one meeting with amy while she was of necessity no doubt fairly compliant there was a certain equality in her union with dudley she was not nobility merely the daughter of a country squire yet seemed in no awe of the son of the duke of northumberland to his credit he seemed to like that about her it was over a year ago cecil said over a year before she died a long time too bloody long distance cecil said can bring about a cooling sometimes id never have left amy for even a week when i was called to europe id have taken her with me lets not walk around the houses john cecil let his hands fall flat to the trestle i was ever fond of robert dudley but never deluded about the extent of his ambition he wants the highest role possible for a man not born to it his whole life has been a play performed for the queen whose side hes scarce ever left and she wished him away cecil was silent poor amys fate in these circumstances saddened me more than i could say the inquest had been opened three days after her body was found at the foot of a short stairway and then adjourned sine die nobody knew how long before the jury would reach its verdict but when it came it seemed likely to be one of accidental death nobody to blame i pointed out to cecil that dudley had gone to great pains not to be seen as having or attempting to have an influence on the jury calling for men who were unknown to him to serve on it unknown is that what you think i said nothing dudley had sworn to me his wifes death from a fall had been a bitter shock to him and id very much wanted to believe that although hed said on an earlier occasion that shed shown signs of unhealth and once had told him she might not have long to live id refused to accept the dark stories dating back some months before her death that attempts had been made to poison her not that it matters cecil half turned away from me to peer out over the shiny roofs of london the queen herself is young impulsive and will remain cecil swung round of a sudden to turn his mastiffs gaze on me conspicuously besotted with a man now infamed and likely to remain so for the rest of his life but if the inquest verdict clears him of blame it doesnt matter what the inquest verdict is enough men hated him before this to make even his return to court a slight against all decency as for the thought of a queen of england wed to a murderer how does that play across the capitals of europe and if the queen thinks everyone here will forget in time then shes not as close to the mind of her country as she likes to believe i dont i was shaking my head i cant believe that dudleys a murderer well not directly no cecil spread his hands no ones suggesting he planted his foot in her spine and kicked her down the bloody stairs but whether he ordered it to be done in his absence is another matter entirely never be proven but whats that worth in europe especially if after however length of time the queen does something blindly foolish shes had suitors of her own standing in france spain sweden and keeps them at arms length at home she has the earl of arundel waiting with his tongue hanging out no hope for him surely i know theres no hope you know theres no hope but the old bladder peers blearily into the looking glass sees a face twenty years younger and tells himself its only a matter of time before the queen sees the sense of it i nodded in wry agreement it was wellenough known that cecils own choice as a husband for the queen was the earl of arran a resident of france from a scottish family with no love of elizabeths cousin mary the queen of scotland who was also since her marriage queen of france in terms of a lasting peace in the north arran had much in his favour and would be a satisfyingly severe blow to french hopes of putting mary on the throne of england but the lure of a carnal marriage twin souls since childhood the power of the heart the earl of arundel would have had dudley dead years ago i said or so its said cecil let a silence hang and the rain ceased as if hed commanded it arundels too old and too vain but hes hardly alone he said at last think of norfolk think of those who conspired to get john dudley topped and now fear roberts vengeance if hes in a position to wreak some let me be honest if hes betrothed to the queen no matter how long after his time of mourning dudley must needs be looking over his shoulder all the way to the altar indeed if a messenger was to come knocking on my door now with news that hed been cut down or shot or skewered in a crowd my hands had tightened around the seat of my chair the rain had begun again why are you telling me this what did mistress blanche want with you i dont know oh come now john who does the queen trust more than mistress blanche to conduct business of a highly personal nature and what personal business might concern you as a longtime friend and confidant of robert dudley i dont know i cant think you not that the queen might wish you to perform in secret a similar task to the one you did before the coronation the sound of rain against the good glass panes was like to a cackling laughter i felt my heart lurch you mean she might want me to choose by the stars a day thats mete for a royal wedding cecil said indeed xi dark merlin by now id learned that cecil never ventured an opinion without a degree of secret certainty it was said that his ambitious young fixer walsingham had agents at court who didnt even know of each other spies who spied on spies i leaned back gazing at the window london had misted the steeples no more than indents on a bedsheet a terrible logic here the queen for all her will and vigour was ever indecisive changing her mind three times in as many hours would make a firm decision then sleep on it and awake uncertain again dudley was no longer someone to play with she would have accepted that the urging of her heart would not be enough might well seek some indication of heavenly affirmation the design of destiny might seek a date however many months hence which the stars found fortuitous for the announcement of a betrothal which at present would be abhorrent to so many behind me the coal fire hissed as rainwater dripped down the chimney i took in a slow breath how does blanche feel about this cecil smiled and made no reply which may have been an answer in itself blanche was a cautious and watchful woman who only lived to keep the queen secure no wonder she hadnt turned her head this morning as her barge had glid past if the queens determined on this then shell try again to have blanche reach me i said what then that john is precisely why were having this discussion i cant refuse you know i cant of course you cant and if what dudley says about the coincidence of their times of birth is correct then their destinies may indeed appear interwoven oh please the trestle groaned as cecil leaned forward i have no doubts about your ability in this regard which is why i dont want you and your fucking charts within a mile of the queen at this time i see cecil leaned back folding his arms giving me silence in which to consider my situation i recalled how on our return from glastonbury id been summoned here and shown a pamphlet handed out free on the streets it was heralding a second coming the birth of the child of satan the antichrist in the new black jerusalem which was london the fastestgrowing city in europe false prophecy originating from france seedbed of the campaign to put the queen of scots on the english throne i myself had been named as some kind of dark merlin canting spells at the lyingin of queen elizabeth pregnant with the bastard child of robert dudley elizabeth daughter of the adulterous witch anne boleyn they were now saying that the queen thanks some said to the magic and prayers of the french prophet and magus nostradamus had miscarried the babe but the devil would not give in so easily i said at last what would you have me do cecil rose and put his robe back on like a judge about to pass a hard sentence as i see it there are two approaches to this problem one is for you to spend some time with your charts and return with the information that the stars at present are frowning on the prospects for a union of two people born under their particular signs which as ive already said would be unlikely yes sir william i spent more than a year teaching mathematics and the elements of astrology to dudley one of the subjects he showed most interest in what im saying is that to convince dudley and even the queen whos far from ignorant of planetary movement that the stars disapprove of their match or might better approve of them under some heavenly configuration not due to take place for say five years a lot could have happened in five years the queens infatuation might have lost some of its fire or equally it might be proved beyond all reasonable doubt that dudley had not killed his wife who could say i shrugged if it was not the answer she sought im far from the only astrologer in england all it needs is for one of them to go to another and my competency would be called into question also my integrity and all of my past work and worse than that all right well go no further down that road examined and rejected this leaves the second path from which you disappear cecil rose sweeping his robe behind him and picked a single lump of coal from the scuttle with tongs and dropped it on the fire i mean on one of your ventures in search of the hidden we spoke of this earlier wouldnt be the first time would it were you to be gone even for a matter of weeks that might be sufficient oh i felt a momentary relief for one instant in time id thought hed meant that it was to be permanent and the air betwixt us had seemed of a sudden cold with menace do you have a matter of ah science requiring your specific and immediate attention i dont know maybe preferably in some place at least two days ride from london dear god this man thought he could move anyone around like a chesspiece to suit his purposes which of course he could after a period when his advice had rarely been sought amys death looked to be putting him back where he was certain he belonged and maybe he was right i could think of no one at this time who was fit to replace him replacing the tongs cecil went back to his chair methinks this expedition of yours should begin at once would you agree sir william which means you wont be lying at your mothers house tonight but my mother i rose to my feet my mother has need of me the fabric of the house wants repair the roof leaks id used this one before but it was no less true for that your skills extend to roofing john id hardly think so but well see to all of that ill have a number of men dispatched to mortlake to mend whatever needs mending your mother will scarce know youre missing he was right my mother would be in delight bastard my barge will take you back briefly to collect your bag but ill want you away by nightfall thats impossible two days then maximum sir william if the queen thinks im making distance between myself and my problem not yours two days and stay out of london meanwhile the discussion over cecil rose enshrouded in a damp dismay i stumbled out onto the cobbles and knew not which way to turn the strand once the home of senior churchmen was now rosy with the new brick of londons richest homes not a place which the secretary his building work yet incomplete would want to leave the rain had stopped and the brightening sky had brought out the chattering wives of the wealthy with their servants and pomanders though this was hardly an area where nostrils might be assailed by the stink of beggars amongst the throng i espied the unsmiling unseasonably furwrapped lady cecil out shopping with their two glumfaced daughters suspecting shed be among those who considered me little more than a common conjurer i turned back to walk the other way and thus glimpsed a man discreetly sliding through cecils doorway dark bearded dark clad and instantly admitted to the house unmistakably francis walsingham the oxfordshire mp known to serve the privy council on a confidential level a coolly ambitious man whom i was more than inclined to mistrust the very sight of him made me wonder if i were followed and i pulled down my hat threw myself into the crowd and then slipped into an alley where i stood with my back to the rainslick brickwork and found myself panting fear very likely id persistently refused the offer of cecils barge recalling the man whod been beaten robbed and drowned if it could happen once this year then it could happen again and whod question it you think me suffering from some persecution sickness all i can say is that you werent with the secretary this day a man whod felt himself slipping into the pit and now was scrambling back up its steep and greasy sides and was therefore less balanced and more dangerous than ever hed been i thought of dudley once his friend fellow supporter of elizabeth from the start and then dudley drunk on his status at court unable to do wrong in the queens eyes had seen himself as her first advisor damaging cecil now dudley was sorely damaged and cecil would seize his chance to what thrusting myself from the wall a sweat on my brow i followed the alleyway into another this one ripe with the stench of rotting meat i waited listening for running footsteps above the distant bustling and chattering the barking of dogs the cries of street traders the grinding of cartwheels and the clacking of builders hammers on brick and stone no one coming i walked on through the mud and stinking puddles across an inn yard and along a mews with its more friendly stench of horseshit until i saw the glitter of the river i stood beneath an iron lamp on its bracket cecils voice in my head do you have a matter of ah science requiring your specific and immediate attention there was a man i would have visited on the morrow on the morrow i was now commanded to be out of london i walked with no great enthusiasm out of the mews to hail a wherry to take me not to mortlake but across the river into southwarks seething maw not a place ive ofttimes visited having little taste for gambling whoring bear baiting or streettheatre but then i didnt have to go far after leaving the wherry a solid building close to the riverbank like to a castle or my old college in cambridge but still a place i feared like all gaols as a result of having myself been held in one at the mercy as it happened of the man i now thought to visit but there are gaols and gaols and it might have been jack simm who once had described the marshalsea as the finest inn south of the thames now the official residence of the former bishop of london known in his day as bloody bonner xii blood and ash shutting the door behind us with his heel he set down his jug of wine on the board and then rushed to clasp my right hand john my boy letting go the hand stepping back and inspecting me beaming and my god youre still looking like a boy some alchemical eternal youth thing youve contrived in truth i must look as worn and weary as i felt i removed my hat he was just being kind yes yes i know kind bishop bonner i still could barely look at him for long without recalling some poor bastards crispen feet black to the bones in the ashes of the kindling or the savage flaring of hells halo as the hair of another protestant took fire id ofttimes wondered how many nights bonner might lie awake in cold sweat accounting to god for all the public burnings hed ordered during the years of blazing terror after mary had restored the roman faith how many nights probably not one even now in a bright new reign when stakes were used more for the support of saplings he seemed to believe that thered been a moral substance to what hed done how could i possibly have grown to like this monster and what think you of my dungeon john his grin displaying more teeth than he deserved its not the fleet is it i said bonner sniffed you might think it looks not unpleasant my boy but you arent here when the brutal guards come at nightfall and hoist us in chains from iron rings on the walls inevitably i looked up at the conspicuously unbloodied walls until his laughter seemed to crash from them like thunder haw haw haw then i heard a key turned in the lock on the door and spun around dont worry bonner said they lock me in for my safety ill see you get out before the weeks end anyway i smiled cautiously we had history bishop bonner and i when first wed met it had been in my own cell back when i was falsely accused of working magic against queen mary and also of heresy the good man id shared it with was already become cinders and even though id overturned the primary case against me in court id no cause to believe id escape the same end but edmund bonner had been curious about my reputation as a scholar of the hidden wanted to know what mystical secrets i might have uncovered at the catholic university of louvain and so against all odds id been allowed to live even serving for a time as his chaplain the inevitable guilt that haunted me tempered by the discovery that just as bloody mary was said to have been surprisingly softhearted bloody bonner had a learned and questing mind and was god help me good company wild tales abound he said of what you and lord dudley found in glastonbury cant tell you about it ned you know that pah he waved a hand it can be of no consequence now anyway as long as dear bess was happy with you she was far from happy with bonner yet even now all he had to do to regain his freedom was to recognise her as supreme governor of the church while admiring his steadfast refusal i guessed that in his own mind he already was free only the bars outside the window glass were evidence of a prison almost everything else was recognisable from the cramped chamber hed occupied while under house arrest at his bishops palace the chair and board the looking glass and the books on the shelf with thomas aquinas prominent yes it was fair to say the marshalsea had not the squalor of the fleet none that could be seen anyway established to confine maritime offenders it now also housed debtors and those convicted of political crimes and thrived upon a strong foundation of corruption prisoners with money could buy good meals and wine and others without money were allowed out by day to earn some to hand over to their gaolers for edmund bonner it was a life of no conspicuous discomfort hed expressed joy at my visit offering to entertain me in the cellar where wine was served but there were too many of his fellow prisoners in there some with their wives who came and went unchallenged especially if they brought money impossible for us to talk with confidence here so taking with us a jug of wine wed gone upstairs to his cell there was a stool for me to sit on while bonner clad in the robe of a humble franciscan monk poured wine for us i was told eyes aglint with mischief as he stoppered the jug that after the demise of dudleys poor wretched little wife had become known the queen would be seen around the court all in black attire as was everyone at court with a dance in her step and a lovely joyful smile upon her face that remained immovable for days is it still there his own face which with his history you might imagine moulded into a permanent rictus of hate was as ever plump and benign as he handed me a cup and lowered his bulk to the edge of his pallet i understand that the smile i said is now a little strained he nodded looking me steadily in the eyes i also heard that some days before your friend dudley was widowed the queen confided to the esteemed spanish ambassador bishop la quadra that lady dudley would very soon be departing this life have you heard that too yes and wished i hadnt when it first came to my notice bonner said i couldnt help but wonder if it was you whod happened to see this impending tragedy in the stars i considered this unworthy of reply but it didnt stop him because as you must see john the only other possible explanation of the queens foreknowledge of the death of amy dudley is that she was herself party to the disposal of the woman preventing marriage to her childhood sweetheart there are many explanations i said firmly and one is that the spanish ambassador is lying a bishop of the roman church as part of his campaign to win the english queen for the spanish king again well yes bonner nodded indeed it was my hope too that shed see what god wanted of her and choose philip of spain for herself her sisters widower was that ever truly on the cards was for him and think of the benefits wed be back with rome before the years end and id be brought out of here in glory and made archbishop of canterbury for a moment he looked almost serious and then a belch of laughter made his body rock in truth i suppose ill die within these walls never mind he took a slow sip of wine but methinks you didnt come here to discuss the arrangements for my funeral or the marriage prospects of the queen then what i sipped some prison wine which proved better than ours at home wigmore abbey i said wheres that in the welsh marches not far from where my father was born ah yes of course it is or was is it was so i believe never went there john horrible journey i hear best thing your father did getting out of that wilderness or youdve been born into a life of penury and ignorance he sat for some moments peering into his cup then looked up and beamed ah he said its come to me now john smart i waited guessing it had not come to him at all it had ever been there in the catacombs of his impressive mind last abbot of wigmore got himself reported to tom cromwell on a list of charges as long as my cock what charges as i recall simony on a grand scale smart was littering the place with newmade priests while also growing rich on the sale of abbey treasure what a rogue the man was hunting and hawking with his canons poking maids and goodwives over quite a wide area ah i see your ears are already awaggle abbey treasure gold plate doubtless what else precious stones bonner frowned methinks before we travel further down this road it would be as well for you to enlighten me as to our destination i was hesitant bonner drained his cup and placed it on the board at his bedside john i may have blood and ashes on my hands but im not known for breaking confidence i nodded what was there to lose i took my wine over to the window with its view between bars of the river and told him what i knew about the shewstone of wigmore abbey i admit to being captivated by what id been told about this wondrous crystal with its history of miracles and healing but talking to a cynic like bonner could sometimes bring you sharply to your senses and the more i heard about the last abbot of wigmore the more i wondered if he and the scryer brother elias were not as jack simm had suspected working together abbot smart an oxford graduate had been appointed abbot of wigmore by cardinal wolsey although there were rumours bonner said that hed paid for it his rise had been rapid in the years before the reform he was also become suffragen bishop of hereford and accumulating endless money most of it directly into his purse by appointing over fifty candidates to holy orders ho ho bonner said what a holy knave the man was many attempts were made to unseat him of course but he always wriggled away with the help of a small coterie of thoroughly reprehensible followers while the abbey both physically and morally was rotting around him but he escaped the dissolution with his life i said and with a pension for heavens sake but then who knows what favours he did for lord cromwell a man whod bend the law to have you hanged for stealing a spoon and sprung from a murderers deathcell if you were a friend he could use if the shewstone was amongst his treasures it seemed more than likely that he knew elias and that both were well connected and well informed in the right atmosphere and with a good foundation the power of insinuation is near limitless and may take on a life of its own what had happened during our time in glastonbury was surely talked about over a wide area of the west and beyond it was not unlikely that eliass path had crossed with that of some fellow priest even the garrulous welsh vicar of glastonbury who had known of my passing association with benlow the boneman unlikely but not impossible you truly believe bonner said as a philosopher and a man of science that its possible to achieve communion with the angelic hosts by means of a reflective stone by means of celestial rays and the human spirit theres a long tradition of it theres a tradition of reading the future in the entrails of a chicken john but it still sounds like balls to me comes from a stimulation of the senses i said like to prayer and meditation in a church under windows of coloured glass while the air is laden with incense sometimes a cloth is pulled over the head to shut out the world so that for the scryer the crystal becomes luminous like to a small cathedral of light i tried to find words to explain how attention to the lightplay within the crystal might alter the workings of the mind rendering it receptive to messages from higher spheres and bonner didnt dismiss it but would you also accept he said that a true mystic has no need of a scrying stone or any such tool of course i looked over to where his rosary hung by the window but while a mystic accepts what he receives and dwells upon it you as a man of science must needs explain the process yes i said thats how it is bonner smiled with which archangel do you seek to commune michael i said at once his ancient sigil appearing in my mind where i must have drawn it more than a hundred times in the past year to summon courage and the powers of reason which told me now to say nothing to bonner about the queens interest in communion with the supercelestial and the pressure upon me which would almost certainly resume when those deceitful mourning clothes were put away methinks he said that you imagine this stone might awaken something in you this would be the lesser of two admissions but i said nothing the great sorrow of your life bonner said is that you yourself with all your studies and experiments your extensive bookknowledge of ancient wisdom and cabalistic progression through the spheres are how shall i put this dead i said dead to the soul exaggerating in hope that hed contradict me poor boy he said id hoped hed be able to tell me more but all he could recall were this man smarts alleged crimes against both church and crown crimes for which in earlier times he would have roasted the fact that he seemed to have survived suggested he knew men of influence so where was he now still at wigmore bonner thought he might be able to find out if i could come back say in a week i supposed i could find accommodation in some part of london well away from the court and cecil but id forever be watching my back and anyone from a streetseller to a beggar might be one of walsinghams agents and why would i take the risk of discovery for something id never afford i shook my head bonner regarding me from his pallet a pensive forefinger extended along a cheek what else are you not telling me john kept on shaking my head id been drawn into circumstances id had no role in shaping however the matter of amys death and her own marriage was resolved the queen would remember that id not been here when she had need of my services and dudley dudley would also remember if he survived if a messenger was to come knocking on my door now with news that dudley had been cut down or shot or skewered in a crowd i saw cecils narrow longnosed face and dark intelligent eyes flecked for the first time in my experience of him with what seemed a most urgent need and then hed said were you to be gone even for a matter of weeks that might be sufficient for what sufficient for circumstances to alter so that dudleys marriage to the queen was no longer a possibility due to his death was i mad to think thus dudley eh bonner said as if hed tapped into my thoughts i stared at him startled poor dudley he said exiled from court compelled to keep his burrowing tool out of the royal garden do you see him these days i had a letter from him in which he told me that his wife may have fallen because her bones were made brittle through a malady in her breast hed spoken before of her illness interesting i was told that the malady related to her humour an advanced melancholy bodily she appeared in good health apart from the sallowness and loss of weight symptomatic of such a condition who told you that ah bonner shrugged youd be surprised at the people who come and go from the marshalsea however thats neither here nor there something pulsed within me and i knew what i had to do ned how do you get letters out from here theres a guard wholl collect them for a consideration and take them to a stable lad who for another consideration nothing more private than that an approach to the stableman himself is usually found safer for those of us allowed out of here hes at an inn round the corner offers a firststage posthorse service you want to send a letter if you can spare me paper and ink where to may i ask not far kew hell do that by midafternoon paper and quill are in the box under the bookshelf sealing wax and ink too if its gone hard add a little wine thank you i sat down at the board with paper and quill and ink and kept the message short asking only for a meeting bonner evidently didnt feel the need to inquire who i was writing to knowing full well who lived at kew i sanded the ink and sealed the letter it with wax he may not want to meet me at this time but at least i would have tried i assume you know what youre doing bonner said not really ill pray for you then now i know im dead but neither of us was laughing as i stowed the letter away in my doublet bonner arose and clasped my hand a final time and then brought out from his robe a single key with which he unlocked the door of his cell you have a key to your own prison for reasons which escape me bonner said i yet seem to be less than popular in some quarters it would not help the mood of the marshalsea were i to be set alight in my own cell he held the door open good luck to you john in all your quests thank you ned and should you ever come to possess the stone bonner said perchance you might bring it here one day and we shall see what we shall see i nodded and walked away along a short passage and down the stairs towards the darkness of the day xiii court clown already he was saying her ghost had been seen on those stairs at cumnor place the little stairs the tooshort stairs all in white dudley said but with a grey light around her like to a a dusty shroud walking off the top step gazing ahead of her and then then she vanishes his body stiffening as if to forestall a shiver and then he was pouring more wine as though to prove to himself that his hand was not shaking but never coming to me he said why not to me he didnt drink i dont know i said i never see them either the weak sun had begun to fade into the river at the bottom of my mothers garden a garden which like dudleys beard was less tended these days he looked hard at me his skin darkening stretched parchment held too close to a candle as though the rage in him were burning through the grief was it grief or was there a suppressed excitement how could i be sure but the rage was ever there and some of it might have been directed inwards he must have called for a horse the minute my letter had arrived five men had ridden with him to mortlake john forest his lieutenant thomas blount his steward and three men armed as though for war blount and forest were in the old scullery probably reducing my mothers larder to crumbs but two armed men were outside and one guarded the door of my private workroom where dudley and i now sat you know about these matters he said if i murdered her whys she not haunting me he spoke roughly and then sat back as if ashamed both of us silent now early evening light cowered in the murky glass behind my finest owl through a system of pulleys this owl could flap his wings and make hoot but now stood like a sentinel in the small window your men are all laden with weaponry i said one with a firearm you noticed that dudley rolled his head wearily black hair still sweated to his brow from the vigour of the ride the horses had been taken around the back to what remained of our stables but their arrival here would hardly have gone unobserved and i knew i was imperilled by their very presence i said youve had threats to your life theres ever been threats to my life im a dudley id met him just once since our return from glastonbury this was before amys death and hed displayed a feverish hunger for life it had seemed no time at all since his father john dudley earl of northumberland had hired me to teach his sons mathematics and astronomy but he was right death and the dudleys were bedfellows robert dudley was twentyeight years old five years younger than me ten years younger than sir william cecil and of an age equal to the queen to the day hed claim even to the hour twin souls would he kill his own wife for her id stared hard at this question night after night and my most brutal conclusion was yes he might if he scented destiny if he saw himself as the only man who could save the country from france and spain and a catholic resurgence if he thought amy was ill and would not live long if he dear god i must needs put this from my mind i arose and went to the window standing next to the owl symbol of athena goddess of wisdom and id rarely needed it more i was taken this morning to cecil i said watching his fingers curl the knuckles grown pale as i explained about the heralded visit to me of blanche parry and the act of nearpiracy that had taken me to the strand and some of what id learned there dudley drained his wineglass cecil believes hes doing whats best for the queen but hes fighting for his own future and that for once makes him fallible vulnerable and dangerous i said you think he scares me he should by god he should seeing now that both these men were at their most dangerous each guessing that only one of them would come through cecils served and survived thus far three monarchs i said if i were a gambling man my money would not be on you john you dont have any fucking money i said nothing the air was still the first beating of horsehooves had sent my mother in a hurry to the faldos house at one time shed been impressed by my friendship with dudley but now although she never spoke of it it was an evident source of trepidation is it true i asked him bluntly that blanche had been sent to have me choose a date for your wedding to the queen a rueful smile nothing so exact it was hoped you might find some suggestion from the heavens that one match in particular might be more propitious than any of the others and yes all right that there might be a most suitable time to announce to the people of england a betrothal he toyed with papers on my long board the rough copy made in antwerp from the writings of trithemius of spanheim lay open next to some notes for my book of the monas hieroglyph which would explain in one symbol all i knew about where we lodged with regard to the sun and the moon and the influence of the planets id been working on it in periods for nearly three years knowing it must not be hurried i said who hoped what who hoped i might do these charts well obviously mistress blanche parry would seek my services on behalf of only one person but i wanted to hear him say it he said nothing he lowered his head into his cupped hands on the boardtop and stayed thus quite still for long seconds a man widely condemned as arrogant brash impulsive never to be trusted and i supposed i was heartened that he didnt think to hide the lesscertain side of himself from me at length he raised his head dragged in a long breath the chamber was dimming fast around us we might have been in a forest glade with the owl watching us from the fork of a tree very well john dudley said lets get this over what the hell had kept us friends a fighting man and prolific lover who thrived on hunting stags and watching with an analytical excitement the baiting of bears by dogs and a bearsympathist who hunted only rare books and had lain with only one woman and could not sleep for the longing i spun away from the window you hadnt seen her for a whole year john you selfserving bastard recoiling from myself i rarely shout at anyone dudley bit off his response sat breathing hard his hands pushing down on the board mercy holding myself together and banishing an image of amy robsart whom i feared i could have loved yes i do fully understand the queens policy on wives at court she wanted he didnt look at me to see me there every day every day and every night he was silent you told me you thought amy was ill i said you told me even she thought shed die soon that was what she said yes you brought a doctor to her several robbie you ever think that was simply to test where your thought lay see how badly you wanted her soon to be dead and out of the way of your ambition do you not think it possible that the only sickness she suffered was a malady of the mind for a man of books you seem to know a surprising amount about the ways of women dudley turned his head at last towards me or was she ill because she was being slowly poisoned i stayed away because i was having her poisoned and would rather not be there to watch it happening staring at me now his eyes ablaze thats what you think id have my wife poisoned i didnt say that you did but one way or another im behind her death jesu john even id think i was behind it who had more to gain or more to lose he said nothing would only have talked of twin souls astrology or all the dangerous marriages any one of which might be forced on the queen if she got much older unbetrothed i was aware of a dark abyss below me you loved her once amy thinking that if there was any time he might leap up and strike me it was now i didnt step away would even god help me have taken the blow but he didnt move except to lean back a little on the bench a squires daughter and i was nobody in particular not then with ambition of course but in some ways just glad to be alive glad to have survived we were happy we were a pair i destroyed her i stiffened he was very still the air was fogged on the cusp of night dudleys voice toneless but i didnt kill her i didnt pay anyone to kill her this time i let the silence hang i wanted to say i believed him but the words would not quite come i could take this matter no further went and sat down opposite him and heard him swallow you know why bess trusts you john do you i had no answer to this i knew the queen believed in me and what i did she whod learned eight languages maybe more and had once told me how she saw her reign as a magical period framing a great tapestry of human progress ill tell you dudley said its because she knows that for all your extensive knowledge of the vastness of things youre a simple soul without political ambition you want only to buy more books that so makes her laugh im so glad i said to be awarded the muchcoveted status of court clown gods bollocks john dudley bringing down a fist on the board almost splitting one of its poor pine panels she has no fears about your fidelity thats all im saying and knows shell get from you only the unwaxed truth as you see it and that your visions farreaching and right now thats worth a lot so why doesnt she pay me a lot or even anything dudley looked at his empty cup but i didnt offer to refill it couldnt anyway we had no more wine now tell me the truth he said why precisely did you ask to see me what am i doing here because i would not have been able to live with myself if i returned to find youd been returned from where he looked up quickly where are you going i saw no reason to avoid the truth i told him i must needs fulfil a promise to the queen in relation to her professed interest in scrying through a shewstone spoke aloud it sounded almost foolish but he if anyone would know that it wasnt he was already nodding she talked of that she was enthused when was this not long ago avoiding my eyes which seemed to confirm a longheld suspicion of mine that thered been a least one meeting between dudley and the queen since amys death a guarded meeting no doubt away from court hooded figures in a palace garden a covered barge on the river i told the queen id acquired a crystal sphere and would be working with it and that id report back to her i saw dudley looking around the darkening workplace you wont see one here i said god knows ive been trying to find one dudley began to laugh you mean one you can afford the ones i can afford would probably be useless for my purposes youre right im a clown however told him in some detail about the crystal sphere last heard of in a former abbey in the welsh borderlands finding i had his full attention so you dont know if its still there and youre fairly sure you wouldnt be able to afford it but youre planning a long and arduous ride to find out havent decided yet but the fact remains that cecil wants me out of town for a while you mean out of the reach of blanche parry cant help wondering if cecil wasnt told about the plan to consult you by mistress parry herself his fellow welshie who may also disapprove of besss taste in men shes polite to me is old blanche but ever somewhat distant uncommon that for a woman of whatever age robbie shes distant from me and im her cousin cousin half of wales is your cousin look at that bastard isnt he a cousin the notorious villain thomas jones thomas jones who robbed his betters on the road almost openly is he your cousin betrothed to my cousin joanne and i dont ask what he did or to whom he was young then reformed now anyway a scholar with a doctorate and given a royal pardon dudley snorted bess is quite ridiculously tolerant towards the welsh perhaps because she is welsh she is not welsh her grandfather was welsh partly so you think cecil might try and have me slain do you the sky momentarily was shadowed by a flock of birds going to roost the dimmed window glass turning dudleys fine doublet from its mourning indigo to black he likes you i said but he might not shed tears over your corpse his lips tightened vanishing into his onceproud moustache now straggled and uneven i had a servant die john couple of days ago a kitchen maid spasms of the gut and dead within an hour i ordered all the meat in the house taken out and buried youre thinking poison if i died from it people would say it was no more than divine justice he stared up at me his face twisting into wretchedness in an instant the way a childs does they can all say what the hell they like now im exiled from court and nobody visits me for fear theyll come away soiled by secondhand guilt maybe pushing himself back from the board the benchfeet squealing on the flags you can summon amys spirit into a fucking shewstone to tell us precisely how she died did i mark tears in his eyes finally tears for amy tears for himself did he even know the difference what should i do he said at last not for me to say robbie were acting on different stages now youre still my friend i suppose i nodded though id rarely been less sure of it xiv god and all his angels shed been in a wild mood that day the day not so long ago when theyd talked of knowing the future and having communion with angels red hair all down around her shoulders the pale sun on her pale face a faerie light in her amber eyes and dudley wanting her so badly that hed fallen to his knees in the island garden at richmond burying his head in the grass twixt her feet remembering now how shed insisted that god and all his angels must surely be on her side our side dudley had wanted to say but didnt telling me hed been thinking of all theyd come through both of them losing a parent to the block imprisoned side by side in the tower not knowing if they too would end up there but how will we know shed said and he recalled her voice grown thin when what we do fails to please them and god and all his angels begin to turn away how will we know when evils at the door do you see dudley said to me do you see where this goes no i said although of course i did and was filled with a mixture of alarm and excitement as dudley arose and picked up the smaller of the two globes given to me by gerardus mercator with whom id studied at louvain holding it up to the last of the light as if it were a symbol of his destiny spirits dudley said a shewstone can bring forth spirits good spirits evil spirits i watched him slowly turning mercators globe geography is one of my lessdangerous obsessions im a cabalist i said and also a christian therefore any spirits called into the stone by me must needs be touched by the angelic good enough dudley said so far go on the queen knows her reign could see the meeting point of science and the spiritual a wondrous thing if barriers are not raised against it ah that old question of religion not an old question at all i said ruefully when i was a boy mystery was all around us christ was fullmanifest in the mass every baptism was an exorcism of evil spirits the world vibrated with magic and and if men like me sought divine inspiration in the cause of making new discoveries it would be a long time before someone cried heresy except possibly the pope i nodded sadly we get rid of the pope and what happens in no time at all weve gone too far the other way christ is not manifest in the mass its all theatre lets strip it away the new biblemen cry not for us to ask questions the will of god is the will of god and you either accept it or you go to hell you explore nothing jesu i im a protestant robbie i believe in the church of england and yet know it could take us back centuries both of us knew where the queen stood on this there would be no persecution of catholics if they worshipped privately or shed be persecuting herself tell me how it works dudley said the shewstone i dont fully know how it works i know that planetary rays are drawn into the stone through ritual and the focus of the scryer who must needs enter an altered state to perceive the flow of messages if this french bastard nostradamus can do it dudley said then you can do it dear god id wish for a half of his confidence id met nostradamus just the one time and didnt believe him a rooker not entirely envied him id have to admit for his standing at the french court and the monetary favours that came his way the way he was venerated and left to experiment unmolested by church or crown were both reaching for the same things i said though my own feeling is that his prophecies are a little too poetic not the best poetry either and shaped to the french cause dudley was yet nursing the globe this clever stone does nostradamus have one dont know he claims hes a natural scryer who needs only to look into a glass of water to connect himself to channels of prophecy but im a scientist and must needs have proof scrying stones have been around throughout history but only now do we have the means and the knowledge to subject them to proper scientific study what are we seeking here john we i sought a careful answer knowledge of the hidden engines that power the world the workings of the mind of god jesu that wasnt careful at all was it the mind of god john dudley took breath in a kind of shudder and i endeavoured to back away i just dont believe we can do anything of significance alone all great art comes through divine inspiration advances in science the same told him what id gleaned from bishop bonner about the former abbot of wigmore john smart bonner you consulted bonner and the fat bastards going to keep his mouth stitched i believe he will youre an innocent john dudley shaking his head in feigned wonder all right tell me about the mysteries of divine inspiration i told him that while we could hardly aspire either side of the grave to a direct approach to god there were intermediaries angels archangels gabriel michael just names robbie just names for whatever moves the celestial forces which make us what we are just names for the controlling good enough for me john how much does this man want for his stone probably more than i have in the world i looked away in sudden apprehension heard dudley stand up but not presumably he said more than i have oh god help me shutting my eyes in dismay had this been what id been hoping for all along was this in truth why id writ the letter to him in bonners cell all right well both go dudley said you and i well make a good bargain with this man in the noble cause of expanding the queens vision we the way we brought back the bones of arthur her stone dudley said dedicated to the queens majesty but as youre the only one who knows how to make it speak you can keep it here and study it and caress it in your bed whatever it takes and bring it regularly to bess at richmond or windsor present to her whatever you see within it or consider it advisable to see what i drew back across the chamber hard against the door to the library something twisted like a knife in my chest i began to panic robbie we dont know he still has it we dont i thought you were of the opinion that the scryer had deliberately conveyed to your apothecary friend just enough information to tempt the infamous dr dee what if its a rook then we have the abbot brought back and thrown in the fleet jesu john i have to do something im sick to my gut of confinement at kew everyone regarding me with halfveiled suspicion barred from court for the sake of appearances whats the matter with you suddenly you dont think yourself worthy to know the mind of god listen to me it felt as if the surging of his energy was taking away the air and i found it hard to breathe a half moon ridged by cheap glass shone behind the owl and dudleys voice rose in the darkness as if from the hollows of a dream talking of responsibility towards his heritage all that his father had died for the beheading of jane grey and all the other cruel deaths the ashes of martyrs from which elizabeth had arisen like the fresh and glistening spirit of a new age repeating her words from the island in the garden at the palace of richmond how will we know when what we do fails to please them how will we know when evils at the door and over this i heard the voice of brother elias the scryer repeating the exhortation of trithemius of spanheim and whatever good gifts whether the power of healing infirmities or of imbibing wisdom or discovering any evil did i sense in dudley this night a manner of madness the haste with which hed seized on this had made me wonder if truly he did fear for his life if he remained in london feared public assassination or a sordid squirming death by poison or even a faked suicide if so what id told him about cecil would scarce heighten his confidence of survival unless unless across the board his shape had almost gone to black and only the savagery of his smile shone through to show me he was afire five days later sunday as i returned with my mother from church a letter was delivered to me by dudleys senior attendant john forest who along with thomas blount his steward seemed to have replaced his murdered servant martin lythgoe in the position of mosttrusted the letter was to detail our itinerary through gloucester and hereford to the welsh border we shall be riding with a judge sent to preside over an assize court trial at presteigne in the border lands in sombre attire we should be inconspicuous in this company it seems likely the judge will be returning to london within a few days which should give us ample time to conduct our business until the company leaves knowing of your problem i should be glad to accommodate you here at kew please tell forest if this is what you wish we were to travel with a judge on his way to preside over a trial i guessed dudley would be blind to the irony still it seemed a good and safe way to make the journey presteigne county town of the new shire of radnor was within a few miles of my fathers old home and my cousin nicholas meredith lived in the town the invitation to stay at kew also made sense as long as i didnt leave the house and yet that evening as the suns last amber strips tinted the river i packed a bag with a change of doublet and my handscribed copy of the writings of trithemius relating to the rituals of scrying outside cecils builders who had arrived this day to begin repairing my mothers roof were packing up their tools loading them on to their cart as it was pulled away i stood in my workplace next to the owl feeling lost and solitary last night id lain too long awake trying to divert my thoughts from the coming journey by thinking of nel borrow who in my mothers eyes would have made a most unsuitable wife what cecil would call in contempt a carnal marriage as distinct from the most dangerous of all marriages which beckoned dudley in writing to him from bonners cell id followed only my conscience but was now become part of the engine which powered his determination to wed the queen in the belief that it was right for england and thus for the world your highness the archangels gabriel and uriel both send their respects and what look to be dread warnings of what may happen if to gratify the political ambition of others you turn away from love oh you might think my part in it would be no more than smoke for everyone who calls me a sorcerer theres another who scorns me as a pretender to powers i dont have and they god help me may be closer to the truth was i then supposed to remind dudley that for all my learning i could not make the leap from the written page into the void that the birthcharts id drawn were craft not prophecy the dreams id so assiduously written down upon awakening were invariably mundane that even the ghost which had travelled in my baggage all the way from glastonbury to london was apparent to everyone but me that i was afraid to my gut that if we acquired the shewstone of wigmore it would not speak to me and would that anyway stay his hand last night after my prayers id told all this to eleanor borrow wherever she lay nel who would forever be a part of my past the full truth of this broke as if the walls of our poor house were collapsing around me and i stood with my back to the window and the owl and found myself to be weeping part three the shameful villainy used by the welshwomen towards the dead carcasses was such as honest ears would be ashamed to hear and continent tongues to speak thereof holinshed chronicles xv the hill of bones and ghosts october brynglas at pilleth on the welsh border a single eye looks up at anna ceddol through a veil of shivering groundmist and all the rest is blood shes saying who is he as if anyone could be sure you must imagine anna ceddol clutching her woollen shawl tight across her breast but refusing to look away down the valley the early sun hangs amid rusted coils of mist at first she could not understand what all the fear was about pedr morgans wife drumming with both fists on her door as the sky grew pink a dead man found on brynglas wouldnt be the first this year nor the twelfth all those forlorn heaps of browning bones turned up by the plough all ragged with the remnants of leather jerkins and makeshift armour too many the dead are removed upon an old cart kept in a tumbledown sheep shelter halfway up the lower slope taken for reburial with small ceremony in the field beside the church where even after a century and a half their descendants come to pray and visit the holy well but anyone can see whats different about this one likely been yere all night pedr morgan the shepherd says but no longer than that thats the point isnt it the stink of blood and shit will be wafting up at anna and still i imagine she does not turn away his face has been split open with a spade or an axe one eye hanging out laid upon the remains of a cheek while the other has been taken most likely by a crow the naked chest and stomach have also been ripped and plucked by scavenging birds or foxes bands of glistening entrails left entwined like to a scatter of dull jewellery we need the cart anna says he cant be left here much longer or therell be nothing left of him she looks up at the church our lady of pilleth miraculous cures were once recorded here under the statue of the holy mother above this shallow cauldron of empty hills that was before a thousand men were shot and hacked to death before the sacred spring ran brown with blood and the church itself burned there are more bones in the earth here than tree roots and no one wants to build over an unknown grave which is why they send for siôn maybe shes recalling how when she was pulling on her shawl this morning her brother began to howl piteously his fingers clawing at the empty air as if the terror of goodwife morgan was making divers pictures around him which he must needs rip away anna has left him squatting by the fire wrapped in a sheepskin and hugging himself he didnt want to go with her as though he already knew what was here just as hed known what lay in the foundations of stephen prices new barn siôn ceddol a miracle in himself no sign of his apparel the shepherd shakes his head closing his eyes as though cursing the circumstance that had him born here as he ofttimes does aloud in the valley fresh smoke spouts from the chimney of an oakframed house where new braces support an upper storey nantygroes where my father rowland dee was born below the hill of bones theres more see pedr morgan says faintly and anna ceddol stares at him he turns to where the man with the ruined face lies on his back half under a thorn tree its roots and bole are covered with vicious brambles some of which have been dragged across the lower part of the body as if to conceal its male emblems pedr morgan pulls some of the brambles away to reveal a leg twisted at the knee id not have my wife see this anna ceddol almost smiles shes grown used to being treated not as a normal woman this she knows is because of the tasks she has to perform in the care of her brother their parents died within a year of one another and so anna has never married too old now at twentynine shell say unless some widower is in need of comfort in his dotage but theres no hope of comfort with siôn in the house sixteen years now and terrifying to most theres evil here pedr morgan says anna ceddol has borrowed pedrs knife to cut away more brambles when she glances up from the corpse the shepherd is turned away looking down the valley she says nothing and bends to the brambles working patiently and her hands do not tremble she disregards the smells seemingly unaware of the grace with which she undertakes such a foul task both her hands bleeding freely from wrenching carelessly at the brambles she slides a knife under a thick stem bristling with savage thorns and lifts up it comes all of a sudden bringing with it smaller shoots and all is peeled away from the dead mans thighs oh anna says of course shes heard the tales still told in the alehouses of presteigne tales spat out like bile from the gut about what happened after the battle between mortimers cobbledtogether army of untrained english peasantry and the hungry welsh serving their forkbearded wizard on windy nights they say the last cries of dying men still are heard bright threads of agony woven into the fabric of the storm this hill of faith and death this holy hill soiled by slaughter and an old hatred that never quite goes away because this is border country and its air is ever ajangle with bewildered jostling ghosts anna ceddol sees the dead mans mouth is a mash of shattered teeth though nothing parts them but a bloody pulp betwixt his thighs however anyone can tell thats not done by the crows xvi pikehead i was thrown back at the sight of several dozen men with pikes and crossbows and a halfconcealed firearm or two and a dozen laden carts all gathered under a whelkshell sky in the field beyond london bridge seemed at first like an advance guard for the queen and it was only when i left the wherry that i marked the absence of flags music or any hint of merriment and saw that the shabbyclad man approaching me was dudley dr dee he shook my hand with formality master roberts remember me first id seen of him since that night in my workroom when id taken up his offer for me to lie at his house in kew until our departure for wales hed been absent the whole time a bedchamber had been prepared for me and my meals made daily by the servants while i spent long hours in solitary bookstudy no one in the house appeared to know where dudley had gone master roberts the name hed been known by on our mission to glastonbury at the end of the winter an indication that discretion was to be exercised on this journey for him if not for me and yet jesu i surveyed the clattering assembly with dismay this was his idea of discretion before i could question it dudley led me across the welltrodden field away from the throng we stopped close to the bridge itself where it was quiet i said have the trumpeters been delayed the crowpicked head of a man had fallen from one of the poles and lay in the grass near our feet i wondered if it had belonged to some executed traitor i might recognise winced and looked away as dudley kicked the head down the bank then grinned all this its not for me you fool close up i realised that shabby had been a wrong impression if the mourning purple was gone and had not been replaced by his customary gilded splendour his leathery apparel was still of good quality country landownerclass at least except for the exceptionally beautiful riding boots possibly a small gift from the queen at a time when there were no thousandacre estates to spare its for the judge dudley said sixty armed guards he explained it seemed the trial in radnorshire was for some welsh felon of whom an example must needs be made dudley said a london judge had been requested by the council of the marches in ludlow to make sure it was handled efficiently and robustly well i knew what that meant but a london judge was that usual it is dudley said when the local judiciary fears for the health of its wives and children and safety of its property the man on trial was the leader of plant mat a brotherhood of violent cattlethieves highwayrobbers and killers lodged in the heart of wales well organised controlling trade smuggling goods from france running several inns at which travellers were habitually robbed or held for ransom ive never heard of this plant mat children of matthew dudley shrugged its wales where they seem to be regarded as heroes for the obvious reason that theyve been preying whenever they can on the english or so they claim hence the guard procured with the full agreement of cecil id guess despite his being welsh i tensed that means cecil knows were travelling with them of course not were here through blounts connections thomas blount his steward was a former attorney theres a handful of others also travelling with us dudley said all of them wellinvestigated no doubt to make sure none are too shall we say too welsh when he smiled i saw that his moustache had been trimmed close to his face his beard cut back to little more than stubble hardly distinguished but it was wise enough under these circumstances a ransom for lord dudley would be not inconsiderable sure youre quite happy with this robbie welsh banditry gods bollocks john dudley sniffed in contempt and began to walk back up the field come on we need to fix you up with a horse oh and while i remember if anyone should ask dr john dee is journeying as he often does in pursuit of old books and also to inspect his familys property in the borderlands assisted by his old friend master roberts the antiquary that sound plausible to you highly plausible and it had worked in glastonbury several dozen significant rare books and manuscripts in my library at mortlake had come from the libraries of dissolved monasteries when religious houses are plundered for treasure either by common thieves or the crown the books are ofttimes flung aside as worthless i caught him up who knows the truth nobody knows the truth john though obviously legge knows who roberts is and can think what the hell he likes about my reasons for getting out of london for a while i stopped grasping his arm legge the judge christopher legge sir christopher legge if you paid proper attention to the lists youd know these things dudley scrutinised me history here in a way five years back when id been accused of conjuring against queen mary several false charges had also been levelled against me by a lawyer name of ferrers now himself held in suspicion after a printing press producing pamphlets full of french lies about the queen had been found on his premises ferrers had oiled his way out of the fleet by convincing the court hed had no knowledge of the treasonous intent of a man renting his premises it seemed unlikely hed yet have links with christopher legge who as a young attorney had helped process evidence against me for presentation to the star chamber evidence which being qualified in law and so conducting my own defence id assiduously broken to dust legge was now a judge he must be a couple of years younger than me maybe not even thirty wed never spoken and there was no reason to suppose he bore ill will towards me if ever he had but for the duration of this journey id try to avoid him nonetheless hell be on the privy council one day from what i hear dudley said if he survives the trial why would he not just something i heard he laughed and i took the remark as being not too serious taking this opportunity to ask him where the hell hed been while i was lying low at his house in kew later dudley said he walked away robbie dudley stopped ten or so paces short of the first cart looked over a shoulder and lowered his voice to a hiss cumnor i was at cumnor rapidly i caught him up was that advisable to my knowledge until now hed never been back to the house where amy died since she was found would not have been seemly might have suggested he had traces to cover on the surface hed behaved impeccably only sending thomas blount to record the circumstances on his behalf why i said why risk it with the inquest still in process could be months before the inquest returns its verdict im to be held in purgatory till then and was it worth it did you learn anything too much ahead of us i could now see sir christopher legge would not have marked him if i hadnt known he was here hed changed narrow features which had been gawky when last id seen him had hardened like a newforged pikehead introduced to cold water he was enclosed by a dozen attendants and minor attorneys but was somehow distant from them all well i said to dudley still unsure how far i trusted him ill tell you when theres privacy he began to walk up the riverside field towards the company of men and horses his gypsys skin seemed darker under the pinkveined sky of a sudden he turned back theres an evil here john he said xvii a sense of the ominous when first i was known as the queens astrologer my services were in big demand mainly from ambitious people wanting my name on their childs birthchart in the euphoria following the coronation there were more of these requests than i could easily deal with but a few others and they still come on occasion related to the lesseasily defined aspect of my role adviser on the hidden and therein lies a dilemma these approaches are as youd expect more discreet and come from men who feel their homes or their families to be cursed by enemies or menaced by demons and ghosts coming to me as if im believed equipped to dispel a nameless evil in the name of the queen dear god ofttimes ill make an excuse and walk away knowing theres confusion about the nature of my profession while im no sorcerer neither am i a proper priest when i was made rector of uptonuponsevern during the short reign of the boy king edward it was a lay appointment designed to provide a firm income so that i might pursue my studies and also eat later i did take holy orders and during marys reign could have passed as a catholic priest hence my time as bonners chaplain but it seemed to me no more than a formality little better than having conveyed a quiet gift of silver to someone like the former abbot of wigmore even my mother fails to understand this and will on occasion berate me for giving up an income for life but dear god i dread to think how many useless blessings have been given by unholy priests invested for money what you must needs know is that i never believed myself to have been called to it and thus have ever refused to accept responsibility for the cure of souls or the redemption of unquiet spirits a priests approach to the unseen must needs be singleminded he must deem all ghosts satanic attacking them with a passion assailing them with missiles of liturgy and must never let himself become diverted from his task by tantalising and forbidden questions what is this does it exist only in my mind or has it a chemical reality what can it tell me about the afterlife what knowledge can it pass on about the hidden nature of things the questions of a natural philosopher a man of science who may have a firm grounding in divinity and a full devotion to god but should never in this world don the robes of a practising priest so i must have shown little enthusiasm when as we came towards hereford one of the minor attorneys a young man called roger vaughan rode alongside me and asked if i were here to offer spiritual counsel it was the close of our third day on the road such a company as ours with ten carts and sixty armed men for heavens sake would not hope to make good progress neither did my relations with vaughan get off to the most promising of starts siarad cymreig dr dee id picked up enough of the language from my tad to know what he was asking but best for it to stop there no i said my father spoke some welsh but i dont and never having been to wales before never oh vaughan was a solemn young man with a halfgrown gingery beard and a mild welshness in his voice i knew his family was longestablished on the border claiming descent from princes as of course did the dees now he was telling me hed been in london to study at the inns of court indeed i was also hoping to study with you dr dee but i was told you were away i do spend a deal of time away which is one reason ive never had the time to visit wales why would he want to study with me although qualified in the law id never practised it except in my own defence i steadied my horse before a small pond with all the cattle drovers passing through here youd surely expect these roads to be among the best in england youre also interested in mathematics master vaughan astrology perhaps i suppose to a level but that was not what i that is youre said to be better qualified than anyone in other areas of knowledge the boy was almost as hesitant as id been at his age i said you mean in matters of the hidden such matters vaughan said tend to provoke sneers at the inns of court but not to someone born and bred in the border country some areas of life are not so easily manipulated as the law i said he laughed i knew of the vaughans through word of the red book of hergest a manuscript in the welsh language now nearly two hundred years old containing the essence of the mabinogi the old welsh mythology full of ancient wisdom and symbolism in fact a good reason for one day learning welsh your family still has the red book on occasion attempts are made to have it taken deep into wales but we resist the vaughans were ever concerned with our heritage even have as you may have heard our own curse spectral hound foretelling death in the family however this matter the trial that is affects my family not at all yours however what please understand im not trying to pry or to intrude in any way vaughans face was now redder than his hair im simply approaching you as a neighbour your family home being but an hours ride from mine i had to shake my head master vaughan my family home is at mortlake on the thames i was born in london oh im here with my colleague to seek certain antiquities the proximity of nantygroes is purely coincidental but if youre saying theres a problem there not as such no vaughan was looking directly ahead to where a spire had pierced the western clouds god the evasiveness of these border folk well not so much nantygroes itself as the nearby village pilleth which stands to the side of brynglas hill the site of the battle the battle in which the english were erm slaughtered i stared at the churned mud ahead of us itself like a battlefield by the welsh led by owain glyndwr and his general rhys gethin vaughan said my tad had spoken of this though not in any great detail owain glyndwrs campaign had begun as a dispute over the ownership of land and developed into a bitter war against england glyndwr had declared himself prince of wales and laid waste to the border and its strongholds but this was a hundred and fifty years ago in the time of king henry iv i remembered from my cambridge days learning how as a young man owain glyndwr had been well known at the english kings court he was cultured well educated well qualified in the law and also it was said in aspects of the hidden no one who knew him would have expected him to become such a ruthless and merciless opponent a place where a thousand men have been slaughtered vaughan said is not exactly the easiest place to make a home but surely nantygroes would have been there in some form or other before the battle however the village was not only isolated farms existed before and no one lived there for years afterwards but then a few dwellings were built to house farm workers and their families and of a sudden he urged his horse forward as if to outrace an error calling back over his shoulder the wind whipping at his words when you meet members of your family please dont mention my approach to you i caught him up but the conversation was dead ahead of us the spire was become the body of what i guessed to be herefords cathedral close by were the walls and tower of the castle reddened not by the sun as there was none but by the nature of the stone itself roger vaughan looked up as an arrowhead of wild geese passed overhead as if this might be an omen perchance therell be occasion to talk again dr dee he said it had been a curiously muted journey from the start each night wed lain not at inns but at the country houses of welloff landowners justices of the peace and county sheriffs the guards all fed and bedded in their outbuildings the horses accommodated in their stables everywhere we were expected and bedchambers prepared the talk over dinner was ever friendly but ever cautious each morning as we set out there was for me a sense of the ominous accuse me if you like of living in the shadow of imagined persecution but i could not believe that only judge legge knew of the presence amongst us of a suspected wifekiller believed to have bedded the queen i watched dudley riding ahead with his man john forest and the captain of the guard he must have been known to at least one of the owners of the houses where wed lain steps would have been taken to ensure discretion hed yet told me nothing of what hed learned at cumnor place what he learned that implied evil did dudley prefer to ride at the head of the company because he was disinclined to be surrounded by unknown men with no cause to wish him a long life unknown armed men i flinched as a vision of the imagination ripped through me riders all bunched together and then separating leaving one man dangling from his horse dragged by a boot in the stirrup through a river of his own blood and the next to die the next would be me the infamous conjuror said to trade with demons who would if ferrers and legge had succeeded have gone to ashes five years ago dear god if id dwelt on this for long enough i might have turned my horse around and galloped like a madman back into the heart of england too late now as if dropped from the sky the city of hereford was strewn about us a damp untidiness of fenced fields and holdings and timbered shops and dwellings around a triangle of highspired churches a frontier town and a frontier in my life i felt now as i had these past three days to be on an illmade road leading not to the roots of my family but into somewhere far more foreign than france or the low countries for at least i could speak their languages guiding my mare between footdeep puddles and mounds of rubble which had once been part of the old walls i followed the train into a wide street where people were gathered to watch us one spired church lay behind us the cathedral ahead the last one in england on the rim of twilight its stones glowed the colour of the shewstone elias had unveiled before goodwife faldo i thought of the wigmore stone and could no longer understand how the desire for it had lured me here there were surely other stones to be found as potent as this one across the famous river wye a long line of hills lay on the western horizon the mynydd ddu black mountains where wales began the light from a nowinvisible setting sun had bled into a symmetry of cloud which hung above these mountains like halffolded wings gilded feathers in a holy light as we rode on they came apart xviii transcending the mappers craft we lodged that night with the bishop of hereford at his palace by the eastern bank of the wye deep and fastflowing after this drear summer of persistent rain as ever in a city new to me i would have welcomed time alone to uncover its libraries and antiquities id marked the onceproud norman castle falling into ruin as leland had hinted in his itinerary greenery up the walls parts of the tower gone to rubble sheep grazing the onetime courtyards why am i ever drawn to ruins but no time for closer study salmon had been brought up from the wye for our evening meal in two sittings in a nearmonastic whitewalled refectory as ever it was polite but unjovial most of us tired and aching from the ride the talk was of little more than hunting and as soon as i could slip away i did suppressing fatigue i cornered one of the canons and asked if i might speak with the bishop his name was john scory once protestant bishop of chichester deprived of his status in marys reign redeemed by elizabeth yet sent out here into the wilderness which seemed not much like redemption to me i was received into a crooked chamber with panelled walls of dark oak but no bookshelves only a bible betwixt pen and ink and a wad of cheap paper on a narrow oaken trestle a window was fallen open to the greying river scory plaincassocked below his station pulled out an uncushioned chair for me and went back behind his trestle lit not by a candle but an oldfashioned rushlight possibly an indication of how brief he expected our discussion to be forgive me dr dee but do i recall you as bonners chaplain once for obvious reasons this is not something i normally include in my curriculum vitae particularly when dealing with protestant bishops i sought the short answer better than being burned for heresy bishop oh indeed but why would bonner choose to employ a man so narrowly spared from the flames do you mind the question he was a wiry man of middle years lowvoiced for a bishop he sat back in his chair fixing on a pair of glasses as if fully to observe the quality of my response i believe i said that this was to enable bishop bonner to tap into what id learned in what you might call the outfields of divinity oh keeping a pet magician in the sallow light a wry smile was shaped in scorys lean face i do beg mercy dr dee but bonners a man who holds fast to his beliefs if hed signed to the queen hed be back on the streets and the fact that he didnt and he isnt suggests he feels safer living quietly behind bars i said i wouldnt pretend to understand him but behind the history of terror theres a questing mind i dont know why given his deplorable history but i can find things in him to like which makes me wonder about myself he peered at me through his glasses then snatched them off and a full smile at last broke through youre clearly an honest young man dr dee as id heard also its said wondrous with numbers more than conversant with the law expert in geography the arts of navigation scorys eyebrows rose a fraction and then he came forward both elbows on the board so what are you doing in such alarming company alarming biggest bloody hangingparty ive ever seen in this part of the world scory fumbled in a locker under the board and produced a good candle which he held to the dying rushlight until it flared evidently the discussion was not to be as brief as id expected bishops have never been chosen for their nearness to god but unless like bonner their working lives are over most have kept close to prominent sinners theyll bully harmless parish priests without mercy but in dealing with influential laity ever walk on eggshells not scory curiously he was proving to be a man who gave not a shit for status theyre hardly going to offer him an amnesty dr dee no i said erm whom believed to be a certain prys gethin truly i said id never heard of this man though the similarity of his name to that of owain glyndwrs general had not passed me by scory was silent for quite a while through the opened window i could hear a rising nightbreeze on the river scory moved back from the candle to study me why do i have the feeling that you dont know what the hell im talking about ah i shrugged uncomfortably thats because im not part of the judicial company just a fellow traveller more and more mysterious so what do you want from me dr dee why would the queens advisor on all manner of extraordinary matters want to keep a tired old cleric from his bed well assuming your diocese includes the town of wigmore in the west i wanted to ask what you knew about the abbey there whatever might be left of it not much gone to ruin since the reform like most of them the abbots house is become a private home the abbot yes i said the former abbot was called john smart what of him ive only been here a year therefore never encountered the man in person only by reputation scory wrinkled his nose why do you want to know about smart i gather that after the reform he was reported to the late lord cromwell for a number of crimes and thats unusual simony i heard and lewd behaviour with local women and misappropriation of abbey treasure and which of these might interest you scory said slyly perchance oh let me think the treasure bishop i said its clear you have your own ideas where my particular interests lie however well yes i do dr dee but if what ive heards correct were not necessarily talking of gold plate on that ground it may well be that our definitions of treasure would to an extent correspond scory said would you like to see some of mine before you retire treasure a very rare treasure to my mind and id certainly welcome your opinion as an authority in geography navigation and other matters response from the clergy to what i do falls into two groups those who damn me as a sorcerer and those who wonder if my work and theirs might one day converge men like bonner this is even though he kept his interests secret while publicly damning sorcerers and protestants to hell and scory carrying a ring of keys he led me out through a back door of his house and across the shadowed green to the cathedral itself and into this vast redwalled oven of a building simpler in form and lessadorned than some id been into a few lanterns were lit and scory unhooked one and i followed him across the misty nave and out through another door and into a cloister where another lamp met us whos only me tom my lord bishop a shadow said taking our visitor to see the treasure treasure my lord scorys laugh mingled with the jingle of the keys as he unlocked a door to our right and held the lantern high i followed him into a square cell with one shuttered window and no furniture except for a wide oak cupboard on the wall facing us id show you our library too scory said if i wasnt too ashamed how so disordered one day well raise the money to pay someone to examine and list the books id do it for nothing if you had two years to spare he handed me the lantern and reached up to unlock the cupboard on the wall meanwhile anything you can tell me about this at first the doors jammed and then yielded and sprang open together and by god it was treasure couldnt take it in at first hidden away for years scory said thought to be papist magic my god the whole world was spread before us how old at least three hundred years have you ever seen its like before dr dee he held the lantern close slowly moving the lights around a thousand figures and images etched in black upon a skin stretched over a wooden frame i saw what seemed to be biblical figures surrounded by a monstrous bestiary of birds and fishes serpents and dragons horned creatures and haloed men robed and naked amid a maze of towers and rivers and seas hills and islands all of them neatly labelled in latin and enclosed by wedges of text a map of everything of the world as it was then known was it made here nobody knows where it was made or who made it or how it came to be in hereford admittedly a world thats less than the one known now or more i said thinking i could spend weeks in study of it the knowledge weve gained is more than equalled by the knowledge weve lost i stood transfixed marking the figures of a mermaid and a lion with a mans crowned head and symbols i did not understand yes primitive compared with mercators globe yet i felt in the presence of something far transcending the mappers craft evidently the welsh border had more secrets than id imagined you should know that it does inspire a level of fear even amongst some of the canons here they say too much contemplation of it invites madness im told thereve been attempts over the years to burn it to a crisp id guess there is an element of the occluded here so for the present i keep it locked away does it speak to you scory moved the lantern and the shapes on the map seemed to shuffle like playing cards into different patterns well i said i doubt it was made by one man more likely some closed monastic order look i pointed at the centre of the map where something of evident importance was represented by a cogged wheel the centre of the world scory said jerusalem i nodded that could be of significance i stepped back halfclosing my eyes and new configurations began to form in the candlelight bishop were the um poor fellowsoldiers of christ and of the temple of solomon ever active in hereford the knights templar scorys eyes widened well not in the city itself but yes there were several templar communities within ten miles of here my god dee jerusalem obviously was the centre of the templar world they guarded the city against the saracen for many years had their headquarters on the site of the temple and its said had access to its most ancient secrets some of which might well be i glanced at the map enciphered here id put extra locks on this cupboard and on the door thats assuming you do not consider the templars to have been um satanic scory smiled part of my duty here dr dee is not to condemn but to protect what exists until such time as it might be interpreted well he let out a breath what you say makes remarkable sense id never thought of the templars this is ah better than papist magic i think potentially beyond value i said which is why id recommend you make it even more secure i will and ah some men if i may say so might have chosen to keep such a deduction about the maps origins to themselves why would they its in the best place he put out his hand thank you dr dee he said as we walked back to the palace scorys mood was far more open he told me hed once been a dominican friar possibly a reason hed been given hereford where until the reform the blackfriars had been popular residents in the heart of the city hereford might seem a lowly post after chichester but more important for being on the rim of wales the significance of which was made clear to me from the start the importance of keeping wales on the queens side the queens proud to be a descendent of king arthur of the old britons a descent beyond dispute dr dee scory said with what might have been mock gravity her grandfathers progress from out of wales to the english throne is surely confirmation of the prophecy that arthur would rise again and alls been quiet on the border ever since it has more or less still recovering from the damage inflicted during the glyndwr wars and yet now theyre sending a small army to convict and hang one man one welshman curious dont you think i dont know enough about it no he stopped looking out over the river moonlit now and then walked down towards its bank the wye flows through a strange and individual place dr dee more so over the border they have their own beliefs which continue regardless of the church whether it be catholic or protestant oh it seemed to me that one could either respond with a bonnerlike ferocity or with a tolerance bordering on the spiritually lax towards what i followed him down to the edge of the river a strip of silvery linen unrolled from the hills i chose tolerance he said which is why i suspect that the behaviour of your abbot smart reflected no more than his own response to his bucolic situation he feasted he hunted he chased after women and caught some well id be a fool to say thats not how some of my fellow bishops have behaved and the abbey treasures such an extravagant way of life will ever demand a certain wealth scory said do you know what they were these treasures never gone into it whats the treasure you seek a gemstone said to have been at the abbey and you think youll find it now a gemstone which is now apparently for sale ah scory smiled now that sounds like smart what kind of gemstone we think a beryl we the friend whos travelling with me and that would be come now dr dee think yourself into my situation here i am leading my quiet life learning my welsh to talk to the neighbours when of a sudden im invited to accommodate a company including a prominent judge the queens astrologer and another man who despite his dull apparel i recognise from my time in the south as none other than the queens master of the horse scory leaned into the candlelight at the very least i sighed it is who you think yes not the most popular man in london at the moment for reasons youre doubtless aware of but i believe falsely accused did i believe that the candle in the lantern had gone out and i was glad of the relative dark nevertheless a man not short of gemstones id guess scory said what choice did i have i told him the beryl was famous as a spiritual device and heard him laugh the magician arises youve come all this way for a fortunetelling stone in the cause of um scientific study i was beginning to feel like a prating prick the way such stones have been studied in europe he shrugged ill grant you that im hardly in a position to dismiss miracle and magic when we have here in the cathedral the shrine of one of my distant predecessors whose boiled bones seem to have cured thousands and still draw pilgrimages he meant st thomas cantilupe my library had several manuscripts on the tomb of this most famous bishop of hereford and other healing shrines where tapers were lit and the bodies of the sick measured to the saints indeed scory said so a small brown stone dedicated in the names of several prominent angels which not only foretells the future but gives off healing rays so you know of it ive heard of it but its all gossip and myth and legend and i know not where it might be found but i can tell you that if smart has it it wont come cheap unless you or more likely lord dudley are in a position to ah apply some physical pressure that was never my intention i said honestly do you have any idea where smart might be found assuming hes still alive oh hell be alive unless the borders ridden with some vengeful plague ive not yet heard of how did he escape well at least imprisonment when the charges against him were presented to cromwell i was thinking of poor pious abbot whiting of glastonbury whod been hanged drawn and quartered for less blood of christ dr dee scory said i didnt know until this night how you yourself escaped the stake at the hands of bonner and no i dont know where smart is though i do hear word of him from time to time if i were to say his back hunched in deliberation he walked along the moonlit riverbank looking down at his entwined fingers what can i tell you except as the rest of them are going to presteigne why not begin your inquiries there the abbey of wigmore owned most of that town at one time when i told him my cousin nicholas meredith lived there scorys laughter went skimming over the wye like a hail of pebbles and meredith i was about to say owned much of the rest and now appears to own even more oh yes he might be a very good man to talk to bishop i get weary of saying i dont understand but no no no scory moved away separating his hands and wiping the air betwixt us youll get no more from me on this particular bag of adders all ill say is its worth remembering that presteigne still has its share of dark alleys anyway you might see me there you the judge has asked me to give evidence to his court come along dr dee past my bedtime and past yours too if you dont want to fall off your horse tomorrow evidence in the matter of witchcraft scory said the river licked at the bank below my thin boots like the sound of quiet sardonic laughter and i turned away from it and followed him back to his palace xix dungheap for a while the land was all red soil as if the earth itself had been stained by the blood shed in the glyndwr wars and the bitter battles through which the tudors rose all was heavy under luminous grey cloud as we rode past the remains of castles with towers like broken teeth and bared mottes from which the stone had been stolen to build the farms in the valleys and then the road was gloomed with forest to either side dim as a church aisle at dusk as we made our quiet and watchful way into wales one day youll go back boy one day my tad rowland dee all for wales but he never went back welsh towns and villages id learned that they were all stark and windflayed their stone houses long and low and slitwindowed as much against the weather as attack hard cold houses occupied by the race of strong sinewy men my father had spoken of bending to the wind like hawthorn trees boy and no less prickly my tad describing all this to me as a child as though he too had been raised as a man of the mountains as he was neither sinewy nor hard i recall wondering if hed been sent into exile for being insufficiently welsh it was only when the road emerged from the forest and we crested a hill and i was at last looking down upon my familys local town that i saw the dispiriting truth of it i urged my mare ahead to join dudley who was riding alone having bid his man john forest to remain in hereford to receive any mail which might arrive from london and bring it on to presteigne dudley had told me that thomas blount at kew was on constant watch for anything new which might emerge in regard to amys death and something had happened something he could not even whisper about inside this quiet company of judicial strangers john dudley calling to me with unnecessary volume as if to ridicule the silence of the company behind us will your letter have reached your cousin yet who knows can we ever rely on the post if not well hope for an inn plenty good beds in an assize town all those fastidious fucking lawyers to accommodate i felt the chilled silence of the attorneys behind us by now the wind had died back but no one spoke above the measured clop of hooves and the creaking of the wellladen carts on the pitted track below us across a quiet river was tended pastureland farms and old cottages with frames of gnarled grey oak and this town this welsh town if the ghost of my tad were with us i only hoped its face was red lying low at the centre of the welltamed land snug as a groundnesting bird was this bright and modern country settlement its buildings elegantly structured with red brick and new timberframing i marked a proud towered church with a flag of st george and sensed a glow about the place a glow of wealth contentment what the hell i called across to dudley we didnt turn back upon ourselves somehow this is wales what did you expect didnt expect it took so much like like england more like england than anywhere weve passed since hereford and that was england i looked out as if cheated towards wooded hills maybe wales was a country of the mind that was never reached actually im told it gets wilder the further west you go dudley said this is an english town in a way grown rich on the wool trade one of the canons in hereford was telling me its even on the english side of king offas dyke maybe a town built as a statement of future intent the county of radnorshire its few sizeable settlements small and farflung has no history beyond the act of union in king harrys reign there are no ancient princes of radnorshire no great old families no ancestral castles yet lived in this is a county not as old as me established quickly out of expediency but if its county town was any indication of prosperity nobody here would go back to the old days it was like to a holiday i was aware of a billowing excitement cheers and halloos bright flags drooped from ropes strung across the streets from gable to gable all lurid against a sky swelling with unshed rain of a sudden my mare was rearing in fear at the sudden blast of jollity and i bent to calm her as our company thinned out to be fed into the town widening again as we entered a broad street leading down to the church and a bridge over the river i marked a bakers shop two alehouses a tannery with a yard a blacksmiths and an apothecarys all well built with good signs to a gale of cheers we came to a forced untidy halt about halfway down amid a confusion of roadside stalls selling apples plums cherries and cold pies a juggler in a jesters cap sent up a spray of coloured woollen balls while children tried to catch them a smell of strong ale was loaded into the air and on the ground a great whooping press of townsfolk roiled and roared from the consumption of it and i was reminded of the queens coronation the happiest day of my life get this rabble from behind me a cultured voice high and thin with fury piercing the euphoria like an ornamental blade my lord its bring out the sheriff sirrah at once i looked over my shoulder saw a press of armed guards around the judge and his men turning back to the street i marked faces at windows with and without glass and then dudleys horse was pulled alongside mine you do know what this is about some kind of harvest festival its for us well not us the judge i saw roger vaughan the lawyer sliding from his horse elbowing through the crowd towards a big walled and gated house set back from the street there was an inset door made small by a weight of ivy set into the high oaken gates and vaughan began to hammer upon it a smittering of blood on his knuckles before it was opened wheres the sheriff the door was open barely a crack and the voice from within no more than a mousesqueak so i heard not a word of it above the noise of the crowd when vaughan came back the door was already being latched against him and the calm hed shown on the road was gone my lord im the sheriffs gone with a couple of dozen men to fetch the prisoner from from where hes kept a horse was prodded out onto the cobbles guards forcing the crowd back and the judge sir christopher legge looked down they dont have a gaol here its not the strongest and theres fear that gethins brigands will attempt to free him hes been kept in a dungeon in in another place until the trial forget the trial a mans voice from the street just hang the fucker whoops and laughter vaughan accepted the reins of his horse from one of the judges men stood like he knew not where to put himself clearly hadnt expected this a single raindrop stung the back of my hand resting on the mares neck remarkable judge legge rose up in his saddle he was not tall and his tight leather riding jerkin emphasised how lean he was almost skeletal his bladed face shadowed by a widebrimmed leather hat and what pray are we supposed to do until the sheriff returns my lord i this i take it is the sheriffs house it is my lord but i believe i do believe that i was told by my clerks that id be lying here for the duration of the trial legges voice seemed to prick at words like a bodkin i do believe that i was told that now you are the he flicked a wrist with impatience local man i forget vaughan my lord vaughan yes well perhaps you could go back vaughan and tell the sheriffs servants to throw open the sheriffs doors and the sheriffs gates and he leaned forward to the side of his horses head peered down at vaughan his voice brought down to a hiss get us the hell out of this human dungheap ill do that now vaughan said good of you the sky was like to dark purple silk all stretched legge leaned back in his saddle and looked up at it with irritation as if he might deflate it with his bodkin i do believe its about to rain he said and by god he was not wrong xx old itch it was as if the sky had split like a rotted water butt releasing the kind of rain that joins clothing to skin in seconds a rain that blinds we watched its torrent in the milken glass in the parlour at the rear of the bull inn forming rivers on the sills dripping to the flags it was not yet five in the afternoon the splattered street empty now according to vaughan the bull was the best of the seven inns of presteigne dudley and i had been told wed have to share a bedchamber though not id been glad to discover a bed a back parlour plain but wellscrubbed had been given over for our use and that of some attorneys who were not accommodated at the sheriffs house including vaughan who came to join dudley and me and a jug of small beer explaining that the more senior lawyers were presently taking instruction from legge evidently he wasnt expecting that dudley said i mean the crowd not the weather nor i master roberts vaughan said for which ill be held responsible for sure i said youre here to smooth the judges path interpret the ways of local people sent to him by one of my tutors and making a cock of it not the way of the border is it i said all this fanfare we dont normally make a big noise about anything vaughan said letting the border into his voice and we dont take sides till we knows wholl win well i knew this less from my father than my dealings with cecil and in particular blanche parry whod walk thrice around some matter before dropping hints as to where she stood on it and even then you wouldnt really know this towns changed see vaughan said new wealth and most of it from england big families in the wool trade come in from ludlow experts in clothmaking brought from flanders and all the money from the great sessions bedchambers and good food and wine for the lawyers and the judges like i say it ent england but it ent wales either he lifted his cup about to drink then lowered it again as for free pies free fruit free a fresh mutton pie buys a good helping of merry cheer in place of fear he looked over to the window a pool was spreading on the flags where rain was oozing between two badlyset panes dudley leaned forward on the bench youre saying the merchants and the clothiers paid for that show of welcome for legge so he doesnt think hes come into a hostile wales hes here to scratch a twentyyearold itch is what it is quick trial nice long hanging itch i recalled what bishop scory had said about the biggest hanging party hed seen hereabouts vaughan blinked you do know i take it why the sessions came to presteigne should we i said preparing myself seemed to me that the welsh border was like to a clinging midden rotting history into legend so the twain could not easily be separated twenty years ago vaughan said all the courts were held at rhayader out west he looked at me in query id never been to rhayader but knew of it a town on the edge of the banditriddled wilderness which vaughan said now had been more or less ruled by the brigand gang plant mat there had been some resentment it seemed over the way justice was administered by the english judiciary with only english spoken in court plant mat fed upon it vaughan talked about the year four years after the act of union when plant mat lodged in the neighbouring county of cardigan were extorting regular payments from landowners to the west of rhayader if you didnt pay up theyd burn your winter straw and if that didnt work itd come to blood your stock then your family i marked the suppressed rage roiling in dudleys eyes as vaughan talked about a judge sent to rhayader for the sessions an old man and devout hed ride to church before taking his seat in the court one morning they were waiting for him in an oak grove by the river plant mat took him down vaughan said murdered him the kings justice dudley finally driven to outrage was there no retribution for that they knew where to hide master roberts its their country there mayve been a hanging or two but no one knew if theyd got the judges killer after that it was deemed unsafe for judges to sit at rhayader driven out bowing to this scum so that was why the court was moved here to the softer lands on the edge of england and this man gethin is the leader of plant mat wheres he caged a dungeon at new radnor castle not much left of the castle since the glyndwr wars but still the safest prison we have about an hours ride i said if that but they ent gonner do it in this weather theyll want to see where theyre going and who else is on the road or in the hills if the rain ent over well before nightfall theyll fetch him on the morrow wont please sir christopher if it prolongs his stay but what can they do the queens judiciary running in fear of petty outlaws dudley sat shaking his head in disgust am i alone here in finding that a complete humiliation this place might look like england master roberts vaughan said but it ent give us time vaughan dudley smiled and i sighed and poured more beer for us all prys gethin master vaughan prys the terrible prys the fierce is that his real name probably some puny little turd with a withered arm dudley said two good arms master roberts vaughan said but only the one eye his real name well who can say but clearly hes too young to be the son or even the grandson of rhys gethin dudley looked blankfaced for a moment as the association of names registered upon him prys mr roberts ap rhys son of rhys dr dee your house your family home nantygroes under brynglas the hill of pilleth christs blood vaughan dudley slammed down his beermug the battle of pilleth i didnt share dudleys fascination with all manner of mortal conflict human and animal but i knew that an army hurriedly raised by edmund mortimer the marcher lord had been outwitted and crushed by the welsh with terrible carnage but all this was a century and a half ago theyre yet finding the remains of the pilleth dead vaughan said turned up by the plough a dark place it is holds terrors yet i dont much like where i live but id not live there and which side dudley asked me head atilt was your fathers family supporting john i do believe the dees were there at the time oh yes they must have been there but god help me i didnt know which side theyd been on or if any of them had died in the battle of pilleth hill of ghosts vaughan said ive heard it called that i wondered which side his family had been on he sounded welsh spoke welsh and yet the house hergest court was if only by a short distance in england beg mercy i said but i dont yet understand how this is linked with prys gethin glyndwrs long gone theres no welsh army any more not as such no vaughan drank some beer wiped his mouth but the ole welsh families who ran with glyndwr they still dream and some still hate the english and dont feel obliged to live by english laws plant mat see the first of them were likely men who ran with glyndwrs army and for them it was never gonner be over and as glyndwrs general the man leading the welsh in the rout of the english on brynglas as his name was rhys gethin see the cold rain rolled down the panes and only dudley laughed smalltime outlaw affecting the name of a famous warlord shrouding himself in old myth to frighten the peasants no smile from vaughan the boy sat silent watching the unceasing violence of water on illfitting glass me i understood at once what local superstition this would arouse and didnt feel it misplaced the land remembers only wished now that id listened harder to my fathers tales asked a few more questions but then i never thought id ever come here i sought to quench it all the same one hundred and fifty years ago this man must needs be what a greatgrandson or no relation at all more like just a man who wants folk to think him possessed of a vengeful and stillactive spirit vaughan fingered his sparse gingery beard as if there was more he might say about active spirits the thought of gethin returned to the place where he slaughtered a thousand english even if hes in chains is bound to cause unrest among the local folk not that it frightens the wool merchants but they werent raised yere and the judges from ludlow and shrewsbury fear only for their lives i said after what happened twenty years ago legge however dudley said comes with sixty armed guards and has no fear that cant be overridden by his ambition but youre right only a good hanging can end this vaughan slumped in a corner of the parlour settle you think a cattle raid one fullmoon night in the irfon valley the other side of radnor forest this was how theyd caught him been a few raids and all the talk was of plant mat so the local squires banded together and had all their men out farm hands and shepherds pigmen and rickmen long nights waiting in the woods all armed with axes and pitchforks and clubs the plant mat raiders when they came were badly outnumbered and taken by surprise for once and fled into the hills except for their leader who caught his foot in a root and twisted his ankle and the farmers boys were on him two of the squires were summoned from their beds and came out and beat him about before having him tied hand and foot to a cart they know who he was dudley asked they did when he told them stood there all bloody and told them his brothers would pay them well if they let him go hed get a message back and theyd arrange an exchange and theyd be rich men and their stock would be safe forever tempting i said for a border farmer but an insult to a squire vaughan said these two they both knew what had happened over at rhayader when plant mat were taking a slice of the farmers meat in return for not firing their buildings forevers no moren a year in wales you make a deal with these brigands they leave you alone for a few months then theyre back and worse never bargain with scum dudley said all they did vaughan said was to have prys gethin tied tighter and gagged him so they didnt have to listen to any more of his babble and then a triumphal torchlight procession through the hills of radnor forest the new sheriff evan lewis he lives at gladestry which was along the route and they sent ahead to have him roused and evan lewis joined them on the road to new radnor castle where prys gethin was dragged down from the cart standing there under the full moon they were in high spirits mabbe a bit drunk as you might well be if youd brought the bane of radnorshire to justice one of the squires thomas harris by name had stepped up and spat in the prisoners eye well not in his eye exactly as gethin only had the one what harris spat into was the shrivelled skin around the empty socket of the eye that was gone prys gethin had not wiped it away although he could have done they saw his hands were freed from their bonds how was that possible vaughan drank some beer and was silent for a moment as if unsure how the rest would be received stood there blood and spit on his cheeks pointed at the two squires whod beaten him tied him down spat into his eye socket stood there in the light of the full moon and cursed them by turn low in his voice pointing with a curled finger cursed in welsh dudley looked unimpressed terrifying but i noticed vaughans eyes and the bleak way he was staring into his beer within a month he said thomas harris was dead of a fever that came overnight and the other hywel griffiths he drowned in the river when a new footbridge collapsed in high wind i hoped dudley would not laugh and he didnt id be the last to deny the power of a curse especially if the victim knows hes cursed this wind vaughan said was sudden fierce and unnaturally shortlived came and went in a matter of minutes taking with it the little bridge and a mans life and another myth was born dudley said sourly myth roger vaughan for all his schooling in london and oxford was a man of the border yet his accent strengthening with his anger thats how you sees it is it master roberts so i broke in the charges will be cattlethieving and witchcraft vaughan said murder by witchcraft ha so this was where scory came in what evidence i wondered would he give to strengthen the case against this felon not easy to prove i said not these days the last witchcraft act introduced by king henry having been repealed after his death everyone had expected it to be replaced by something less random but it hadnt happened yet whatever jack simm might say about the queens need to prove that she was not like her mother goodwife faldo had been on firm ground when shed said in mortlake church that she no longer feared imprisonment for inviting a scryer into her house but where a death was involved well id heard of cases where evidence of circumstance had been enough to hang a woman it was usually a woman where proof of dark threats had been given and fear of witchcraft would never go away even in london there would have been unrest under these circumstances out here with all the terror of the glyndwr war yet within local memory it would have a considerable power to disturb glyndwr studied magic i said vaughan was nodding and is said to have used it with clear intent dr dee as you likely know it was said he could arouse spirits to change the weather arouse storms and the like to gain advantage on the battlefield so a sudden wind blowing down a footbridge dudley said would suggest this man was simply calling on the same dark powers not too difficult to make out a case for it master roberts especially before a man of legges abilities i said was rhys gethin said to have dark powers i dont know he was killed in battle three years after pilleth vaughan drained his cup but what a victory that was against all odds and he was glyndwrs best general and they did burn down the church of the holy virgin before the battle oh god its all a nest of wasps so youre saying the local judges might be in fear for more than their lives like i said dr dee this ent england and it definitely ent london although plant mats never been known to work so far east the guards yere to make sure sir christopher legge stays safe before and during the trial and the hanging if he stays for it as for any kind of danger that dont involve physical attack legge has fairly advanced lutheran leanings as i understand it dudley said the lutheran scholars are in the process of effecting a severe reduction of what were allowed to be afraid of aye and the handful of men who own this town now are all firm reformers too vaughan stood up peered at the window it ent stopping is it better face the wrath of sir christopher tell him his trial ent gonner start tomorrow he flinched as did i at a sudden cracking of glass the loose pane had fallen from its leading or been blasted out by the force of the rain and now smashed on the flooded stone flag shards of glass were skittering through the spill as a second pane fell out ill send the innkeeper vaughan said if i can find him none of us had commented on the uncommon ferocity of the rain which looked like preventing the sheriff bringing prys gethin from new radnor this night it had after all been a wet summer xxi rowlys boy cold in the parlour now with that jagged hole in the window and water beginning to pool around dudleys fine riding boots when we were alone he stood up regarding me sideways dark eyes aslant i dont think that should we get involved in this john did i suggest we might he snorted like a stallion you eel i was watching your face all that talk of glyndwrs magic and altering the weather and the curse of prys gethin john dee in the land of merlin a pig in shit as for this boy vaughan mmm i nodded hes sitting on eggs hes a lawyer but also borderraised and he doesnt think free pies can cure fear mortimers army would have been drawn from places like presteigne the presence in the town of another gethin so called and in chains freed himself from his bonds on the road to new radnor i said so that he was able to point the finger in malevolence jesu dont you start dudley rubbed his hands together to make heat gives me shivers this place somehow even more than glastonbury how far to wigmore from here seven miles eight you werent thinking of riding there in this first light i was thinking dudley said assuming we arent all drowned by then i shook my head no real use in riding out to wigmore until we have a better idea of exactly what were looking for i gather there are people we might talk to in this town first it was the first chance id had to tell him what id learned from john scory in hereford dudley listened without interruption only the occasional raised eyebrow you saying the bishop of hereford knew of the stone but not where it is or the former abbot but he did say presteigne would be a good place to start looking not least because much of the property here once belonged to the abbey and then gathered in by the crown and the crown would sell it off i dont see how thered be a connection any more just telling you what he said he also thought it worth talking to my cousin nicholas meredith who also seems to be a substantial property owner i was recalling how scory had laughed on learning that meredith was my cousin when a man appeared in the doorway bearing a broom and glowering at the remains of the window gods blood profuse apologies my masters the glaziers art is yet in its infancy round yere he began sweeping the shards of glass into a corner with his broom then gave up and tossed the broom across the parlour ill have it shuttered hell not get paid for this wiping his wet hands on his apron straightening up and jabbing a thumb at his chest jeremy martin keeper of this inn a powerfully built man of late middleyears dense grey hair winged back behind his ears least therell be no broken glass in your bedchamber this night my masters although wouldnt that be because its yet without any kind of glass dudley said jeremy martin grinned on the list that is glass in all the windows next year sure to be proper glass i ent been yere long enough to do all as needs doing but thisll be the finest inn in the west fore long can i replenish your jug my masters on the house picking up the beer jug he sniffed it with suspicion holy blood youre drinking ale you have a flagon of my ole cider masters and ill tell you you ent gonner go back to this bats piss in a hurry dudley looked pained one virtue of high social status hed been known to remark was that it spared you the crude predations of the serving classes master martin i said would you happen to know where we might find nicholas meredith wont be far away hes in town friend of yours my cousin youre his cousin from london you ent a lawyer then i no not as such martin took a step back into the pooled water inspecting me from head to feet and back again holy blood you ent his eyes widened and then his arms were thrown wide as if hed embrace me rowly dees boy the man who holy blood you knew my father rowland dee all the talk was about him at one time how close he was to the ole king how wellfavoured and now its his son and the ole kings daughter holy blood i tell you master meredith when the pamphlets come from london after the crowning hes in yere reading it all out his uncles boy calculing the stars for the new queen well well do he know youre yere i wrote to him but no he doesnt not yet aye i thought hed known you was coming wed neverve yeard the last of it so you ent nothing to do with the judge i assured him we were merely travelling with the judges company while inspecting manuscripts from disassembled libraries taking the opportunity to make a visit to my familys old home nantygroes master stephen price hes there now see you know master price he was down london mp for radnorshire whys he living at nantygroes building a new home down the valley by the ole monastery grange gotter keep his family somewhere meanwhile so hes only renting it master nick likely owns it yet and much of this town not as much as master bradshaw big wool merchant jeremy martin beamed wool cloth and the law my masters as good a foundation as youll find anywhere used to be religion now its wool cloth and the law the rain stopped not long before twilight within half an hour a piercing red sun lit the street and dudley and i walked out into a town that you could feel to be growing around you signs of building on a scale i hadnt encountered since leaving cecils house in the strand piles of bricks everywhere and frames of green oak for new houses poke into any alleyway and youd find old barns and outhouses being converted into business premises we edged around a puddle the size of a duckpond the sun floating there like an orange i dont see i said why this town makes you shiver dudley looked across the street where the ground rose towards a castle fallen into ruin on its green mound much of its stone already plundered i do mistrust sudden wealth as distinct from inherited wealth he didnt rise to that the sun spread a glowing hearthlight over a wall of new brick and a stout man in clerks apparel crossed the street in front of us bearing a pile of leatherbound documents its in a hurry this town to leave something behind dudley said dont you feel that poverty perhaps he eyed me why so frivolous tonight thats frivolous dudley frowned the ostler whod stabled our horses led two more past us towards the entrance to the mews at the side of the bull it was not hard to imagine my tad here carousing with his friends on the hot summer nights of old i felt sad tell me about cumnor place i said no reply doors were opening people threatening to throng the streets i waited until we could no longer hear the clitter of hooves better here than back at the inn i said you never know whos listening at the door of a bedchamber wed come to the corner of the wide street leading down to the church and the sheriffs house all was yet quiet here if theyd brought prys gethin from new radnor another crowd would have formed in no time but the street was empty at the bottom just past the church a stone bridge over the river carried a narrow road into the hills where a castle occupied a gap in the forest probably back in england i dont know what to do about it dudley said about what exactly he stopped glanced behind him to where the lurid sun was down on the horizon poking through the layered clouds like the tip of a tongue betwixt reddened lips the murder of my wife beyond all doubt now xxii so she wouldnt die cumnor place barely three miles from oxford hardly a demanding ride from kew and now his wife was dead and buried dudley had finally made the journey i wondered how hed felt but didnt ask the house was a century old but recently made modern by dudleys friend and his wifes last host anthony forster it had been divided into a number of fine apartments one of which had become the home of amy dudley ten years of marriage no country house of her own and unwelcome in london town so that the queen could pretend she didnt exist not that she was alone at cumnor there were retainers perhaps half a dozen of them a small itinerant household so where was this retinue on the day of amys death why at the local fair amy it seemed had ordered everyone everyone women and men to go to the fair would hear no word of dissent id heard about this before and had not liked what it implied it had been a sunday and the day after the queens twentyseventh birthday which dudley who arranged the festivities might have claimed was also his for his wifes birthday he would have sent a present my mother had heard gossip in mortlake village about amy being so stricken with darkness of mind over her husbands neglect that shed ofttimes determined to make away with herself and yet not so very long before that she seemed in good heart dudley had been told of a letter dated august which shed sent to her london tailor william edney with instructions for the styling of a velvet gown she was not frugal with her clothing having spent nearly fifty shillings on a spanish gown of russet damask and she urged edney to make haste to get the latest gown to her had she really wanted a new gown in which to throw herself down eight steps to a far from certain death yes a mere eight stone steps and not even a straight flight a bend in it apparently the only sequence of events i could imagine begins in an instant of blinding despair as amy stands at the top of the stairs maybe with an image all aflame in her mind of dudley and elizabeth dancing together on their birthday and in her anguish she hurls herself with some violence from the top step to the stone flags below which sat well with her ordering of everyone to the fair so that she might be alone no one to stop her broken her neck dudley gazing down the sloping street and doubtless seeing stairs stretching away into a black mist thats what i was told what everyone was told including tom blount his steward whom hed sent to cumnor in his place so that he might not be seen as attempting to interfere with the inquiry you thought shed killed herself i said my first thought yes because she didnt want to stand in your way his eyes closed yet you told me earlier this year that she believed herself mortally ill from what she told me but what if she was lying i thought that if a wife of mine had suggested she was dying of some malady id not leave her side must needs stop thinking like this i was not robert dudley had never been blinded by an allconsuming sense of destiny there was yet more to this some private matter which even as one of dudleys oldest friends id never be told nor should be i supposed did you tell the queen what amy said in my head the voice of bishop bonner heard that some days before your friend dudley was widowed the queen confided to the esteemed spanish ambassador bishop la quadra that lady dudley would very soon be departing this life dudley having told her was the only reason i could think of for the queens terrifying foresight the only reason i dare allow myself to think of no reply hed gone to sit on the remains of a stone wall where part of an old house was being taken down blount told me a report had been written about the state of the of amys body he couldnt get a sight of the document when its put before the coroner its content should be made public when no dates set for the resumption of the inquest knew i could demand to see it though if i pulled rank and you thought that wise god no didnt even try but did have a quiet meeting with anthony forster well if it was your house youd want to know everything wouldnt you forster of course had not been there either when amy died but yes hed want to know we arrived the day after two servants had seen her ghost at the top of the stairs forster said the rest of them were afraid to go into that part of the house day or night but you went there oh yes i saw the place the chances of falling to your death from those stairs are slight but her neck was broken yes and she was found at the bottom of the stairs but there were he thought for a moment whats never been talked about is that there were other injuries dints in her head which may have been caused by hitting the stone but one was a good two inches deep what does that suggest to you something sharp maybe the sharp edge of a stair had the feeling i was clutching at reeds here oh john come on it might also suggest she was struck a twoinch dint speaks to me of a blow from a a sword blade if you saw that stair then youd know nothing else explains it and yet tom blount says he understands from his inquiries that the jury is not disposed to see evidence of evil dudley stood up and faced what remained of the sun i only hoped he wasnt seeing it as i was the clouds like reddened lips had become the slit of an open wound so that the sun a sun which this day had scarce lived looked to be dying in an ooze of sticky blood i said anyone seeing the entire household apart from amy at the fair would have a good idea that she was alone might this be a robbery was anything taken no im telling you somebody killed her john somebody went into cumnor to kill her no doubt left his face looked very dark against the low light the gipsy they called him those who sought to dishonour him and the change wrought by the butchery to his beard and moustache made this seem not unjust without those trademark facial twirls even a friend might take some time to recognise lord dudley lets bring this into the air i said you think someone killed her to damage you i know it who make a list but if it was someone who wanted to make sure you would not wed the queen surely it were better than amy lived ah well you would think that wouldnt you but then perhaps you wouldnt he turned sharply and began to walk quickly away back along the route wed come across the street towards the castle mound me striding after him and then he called back over a shoulder suppose someone killed her so she wouldnt die what he stopped panting at the foot of the castle mound yes all right i may have told bess what amy had said about having a mortal illness maybe a sickness of the breast i dont know exactly what i said but why the hell she had to tell that scheming bastard la quadra who yet wants her for the king of spain or some muffin appointed by spain to snatch england back for rome shed have told the spanish ambassador simply to give spain the message that marriage to you might no longer be out of the question she probably regretted it as soon as it was out both of us knowing the queen was sometimes inclined to speak with insufficient forethought even on matters of world significance and meanwhile la quadra blabs dudley said the man has a mouth like a slop pail how many people have told you what the queen said hed started to climb the castle mound between shadowy stacks of broken masonry and bushes of broom and gorse snatching at handfuls of grass calling back at me jesu john are you not seeing this yet if my wife had died of natural cause close to dark now bats flittering overhead and and dear god yes i was seeing it now i followed him up the mound tripping over a slab of masonry picking myself up my hands slimed with mud and dew dudley shouting back at me too loud if it was a natural cause then id be not only free but blameless yes for his enemies the worst of all situations so if amy was to die in an unnatural way before her time however short that time might be i reached the flattened top of the mound just as the last of the sun dull as an old coin slid down into the western hills sootdark hills which gave a sense of the real wales its isolation its secrecy killed so she wouldnt die god dudley was facing me with hands on hips if her death is unnatural then im yet free but in most peoples eyes far from blameless even if nothing can be proved against me what are you going to do robbie try not to get killed as well i suppose a good many men would feel justified in doing it if im seen to have escaped justice for the wilful murder of my wife if someone had killed amy expecting dudley to be held responsible and then to walk away in shame retire to the country to live out his years in the comparative seclusion of the english squirearchy then they knew him not as i did he ran fingers across the wreckage of his beard life seems as dark to me now as when i was in the tower awaiting the block but if you were to find out who killed amy how through a fucking shewstone he raised both hands ah mercy look even if it were possible to discover the killer it would rather depend methinks on who it was there were names i wouldnt say out loud beyond the walls of my own home what a wasps nest this country was become it was cold on that mound i knew not whod built the castle or who had destroyed it maybe glyndwr but there was a feeling of hostility here we were not wanted i looked down at presteigne how tidily it sat glimmerings as tapers were lit behind the windows of the wealthy lets go back dudley said i followed him feeling sad to the soul what if amy had been lying about her illness to see what response shed get from dudley what if she was suffering from no more than a malady of the mind grown out of a profound loneliness a plea for love answered by death xxiii dark alleys we walked back into the town me in a grey fog to find that a crowd was gathered around the sheriffs house pitch torches blazed either side of the gates their reflected flames riffling like lilies on the puddles where a group of men had dismounted ostlers hurrying to take the horses the sheriffs company was back and without prys gethin i saw vaughan addressed by a redfaced man in a muddied jerkin and moved closer to listen his humour roger vaughan muttered something and the redfaced man groaned threw up his hands then turned and addressed the crowd too foul it is see not safe to make the journey before nightfall not with a prisoner the welsh want back evidently this years sheriff evan lewis his promise to ride out again to new radnor on the morrow brought a sour response a man asking with sarcasm what would happen if it was pissing down again let him go is it evan so hell catch a cold a rope of damp pennants fell from the darkening sky evidently cut down made a mocking garland around the sheriffs hat lewis wrenching it away shouting over a river of laughter well hold the trial at new radnor then that what you want is it i turned to dudley that even possible hes jesting you think hed deprive the goodfolk of presteigne of an entertainment theyd waited twenty years for this talk of curses talk of curses gods bollocks john looks to me that plant mats brought nothing but good fortune to this town given it the great sessions and now a good hanging they should throw a feast for the bastard before he dangles id found it interesting though the way the sheriff had said the welsh wanted gethin back as if it was accepted that presteigne was not truly wales admittedly we hadnt been long in the town but id yet to hear someone speak the language evan lewis scowling passed through his own gates to face the judge dudley turned away in the direction of the bull and i was about to follow him when someone stepped purposefully between us dr dee by a torchs fizzing light i marked a man of about my own height perhaps a few years older and fairer of hair and skin clad as a country gentleman in fine leather jerkin and boots that stood well in footdeep puddles nicholas meredith he said my god we were trying to find you i held out my hand he didnt take it and it was knocked aside by a fellow pushing past nicholas meredith braced himself against the sheriffs wall i smiled good to meet you at last cousin i received a letter from you this morning dr dee the border accent was in his voice but so also was an education replying to it at once with proper civility well yes evidently a waste of my time why would you write to me knowing you were coming here and saying nothing of that cousin nicholas i wrote before i knew id be coming telling him about the providence of the judicial company thinking hed understood when the dazzle of the pitch torch made it seem as if he was smiling in fact he was not youve made me look a fool dr dee fetching up without a word taking a chamber at my inn your inn i didnt even know that we were simply told it was the best inn in presteigne my i made a gesture towards dudley this is my colleague master roberts an antiquary we were both your letter my cousin didnt even look at dudley suggests youre here in search of treasure of a kind well well nicholas meredith jutted his chin his short beard was combed to an elegant point how like your father no mistaking his expression this time id seen too many sneers a low growl from dudley that knave my cousin meredith said i had no response was held in shock not two hours ago the innkeeper had talked of my cousins pride in my fathers position at king henrys court all the talk was about him and me too all this mans letters to me had been invariably cordial i dont understand i said at last the innkeeper said you spoke well of my father how close he was to the old king im sure he was nicholas meredith said close enough to pocket the spoons a long hissing breath came out of dudley but he was yet ignored a few men had made a half circle around us in the way that men do scenting the approach of violence meredith raised his tone you think were so removed from london dr dee that we hear nothing of what goes on there you think we know nothing of your fathers crimes you think we werent dishonoured by him i know not what youre in your illwrit letter my cousin said you ask if i know of the whereabouts of a gemstone formerly the property of the abbey of wigmore possibly misappropriated hah methinks how can this man talk so loftily about the misappropriation of church treasures when his own father my father was a kind man i said softly a generous man particularly with the property of others im not good at conflict have no ready store of oiled ripostes i stood in silence aware of a greater gathering of onlookers and dudley at my shoulder forgive me for intruding john but why dont we just beat the piss out of this muffin i could feel how badly dudley wanted this to become a fight if only to relieve himself of weeks of storedup rage and still nicholas meredith behaved as if he wasnt there were you about to deny that rowland dee when churchwarden at st dunstans in london stole church plates left in his charge dudleys right hand was at his belt where hed keep a dagger no i said quietly dudley stiffened nicholas meredith smiled you asked about abbot smart my letter when you receive it on your return will tell you hes long gone probably into france youll learn that nobody here has seen him for years so if youve somewhere else on your treasurehunting itinerary i suggest you depart for it at first light as he turned away my hose was soaked at the groin by a splash of firebright water thrown up by his boot in my haste to avoid a further exchange id walked the wrong way and we found ourselves down by the church and the river a mean river compared with the wye and the bridge was wooden and creaked when i stood upon it but at least we seemed to be alone doesnt matter if its true dudley was hissing you dont let any man who spoke thus walk away undamaged it does matter i said matters to me my father sullied his status as churchwarden at st dunstans he sold plate that certainly wasnt his to sell hed lost his place at court and his business was ruined through no fault of his own id guess im sure he would have made good when his fortunes improved oh for gods sake john every family has some knavery to hide i looked down at the moonlit river swollen by the downpour and not far below the bridge timbers he was not a thief he was a proud man and he paid for the best education i couldve had i wish id been able to earn enough money to ease his old age but he died and now i dont earn enough to support my mother in the way she once was used to youve not done badly under the circumstances given that he doesnt seem to have left you any money or even a house he left me an education which you spend all your life expanding is that life come on lets get back see how this looks in daylight dudley began to walk back up the street quieter now fewer lights i no longer feel happy to pass the night in my cousins inn i said well were not spending it in a fucking field besides another word with the smarmy innkeeper might not go amiss methinks why would he lie its what innkeepers do when youre paying for meals and a bedchamber but it would be worth finding out if merediths been blackening your name all over town only two of the judges guards stood with their pikes outside the sheriffs house no one troubling them the pitchtorches were burned low the ropes of pennants gathering into loops and thrown over the wall near the top of the street a man walked past us and sniggered dudley lurched towards him and i seized his arm no you want a reputation as a fucking betsy by morning john must needs think or will we even still be here by morning think well of course why dont you consult one of your books on how best to respond to an insult to your family never going to let this go was he but i was thinking of something else he said abbot smart had not been seen here in years that he was probably in france would indeed have been useful to know that before we came its not the impression i had from the bishop of hereford i recalled john scorys words exactly i dont know where smart is though i do hear word of him from time to time you think meredith was lying scory was spare with actual facts but more generous with hints he implied that my cousin might have things to hide he said presteigne despite its appearance was a place of dark alleys i told you there was something wrong here you lose religion and let a town become ruled by commerce and greed dr dee a man drew level with us at the corner of the street dudleys elbows bent one hand forming a fist this one he said ill deal with now if i may have a word dr dee the moon showed me a man who though shortish was yet built like a brick privy make it very quick fellow dudley said the man didnt move as though the word quick had little meaning for him only i overheard your cousins tirade see dudley starting forward but the man was standing his ground like a bull in a meadow and was surprised he said at how he spoke seein as when i was in london i heard naught but good words of you and knew of your father when he was at nantygroes and i was a child down the valley he was ever merry and as you said generous especially with apples as i recall thank you i said thank you master stephen price then you lease nantygroes from nicholas meredith and i wondered well it would seem a pity if youd come all this way without seeing your fathers birthplace found myself nodding grasping at a friendly hand and as ill be riding back there at dawn no wish to watch all the paidfor glee at the arrival of the welshie in chains so if you wanted to ride back with me id deem it an honour to show you around the place and your companion of course he wants something dudley said in darkness the shutters were up at the window but left open dudley had the fourposter id taken by choice the truckle pulled from under it though hed tossed me an extra pillow in a bere i doubt price means us ill i said and i would like to see the house and its situation maybe the only chance ill ever have if its owned by my cousin dont mind riding out with him alone its but a few miles could be back soon after noon i was about to suggest it let meredith think hes driven you away would give me chance to ask a few questions while the towns in holiday mood over the trial be a pity to leave emptyhanded youre yet determined to have the stone ive faith in your learning john and if frances poisonous prophets making use of scrying its our duty ill let it be known im an antiquary collecting gemstones and prepared to pay good money for intelligence about smart well keep away from my cousin i could deal with the likes of your cousin in my sleep its interesting though john whats behind it whys he want you out of here whats he not want you to find out is there money here youre entitled to property dont raise my hopes money and the dees his approach to you seemed a little too conspicuously aggressive as if he sought to draw you into public conflict i should call him out big books at dawn dudley said goodnight john i lay in the truckle bed next to the door a haloed moon was visible where the shutters had been left open so id awaken at first light and i looked for known stars wondering why we were here what the future might hold for dudley if hed ever find out how amy died and at whose hands and if that would free him or expose him to more threat on the rim of sleep i found myself considering if it might even be true that the queen carried dudleys child so many months had passed since shed summoned me how many others had seen her in that time among the stars i saw images of elizabeth walking alone in the private gardens of richmond all big of belly gazing out to the fabricated island where robert dudley had lain his head betwixt her feet if hed stopped at her feet i saw him as he was an hour ago when first hed seen the ripebosomed young woman who had shown us to our chamber and turned out to be the innkeepers wife a movement in his jaw a tightening of wires i shut my eyes on the stars wrapping the sheets twice round me because of the cold knowing not that id slept until i awoke to dudleys scream xxiv all heavy with old death there were two families of ducks on the goodsized pond in front of nantygroes sheep grazed the land down to the river and more sheep were on the opposite bank until the valley floor was lost into woodland beyond which was the hill a pale and almost luminous green under the heavy sky the hill of ghosts be glad when i dont have to see it every morning stephen price said or watch it under the last lights and when will that be one year mabbe two fair bit of work to be done on the new place yet he stood firm on this land short thickbuilt weathered of face and showing more confidence than he had in presteigne last night as he spoke of the house his family was rebuilding in the next valley a former abbey grange monaughty from the welsh for monastery an easy walk from here but its aspect was different keeping an air of the holy stephen price said wed like it to be he glanced back at nantygroes three four times this size bigger families in the years to come as you doctors learn to stop disease leaving empty cribs not that kind of doctor master price or well not beyond a small knowledge of anatomy ah he nodded his big squarish head and led me along a path towards the river and a new barn of green oak though obviously of the gentry he spoke simply in a farmers way as if with an inborn sense of the rudiments of life which the time hed spent in london could not take away if the new house was a monastery grange i said would that mean for wigmore no no abbey cwmhir in the west wigmore land stopped at presteigne thats english see wherever they draws the boundary this is where wales begins id tried to feel it tried to feel the weight of my ancestry back from my grandfather bedo ddu an ebullient man whom my father said had ordered the font filled with wine at the baptism of his first son back through llewelyn crugeryr who had a castle and prince rhys ap tewdwr which would give me common ancestry with the queen all the way back my tad would insist to arthur himself out of presteigne the country had changed a darkening of the soil but a lightening of the hills close shaven by sheep although there were no jagged peaks you could sense the rock under the green the bones of the land the ruins of a small castle stood like a skeletal fist across the river and a small grey church was tucked into the hill of pilleth with a cluster of mean houses below i saw all this but felt no pull of the heart found no sense of my tad in the house which lay behind us a solid dwelling of timber and rubblestone with a good hall and inglenook and a new chimney an old housekeeper had been making flat cakes on a bakestone with dried currants and shavings of apple welsh cakes i guessed my tad used to say proudly that hed taught the kings cooks how to make them for the royal table id told the housekeeper this and shed given me one to eat and said she remembered master rowly when he was a boy him and all his jests but the taste of the welsh cake brought back only memories of mortlake at the riverside i turned to stephen price you said you recalled my father i well recall him too young mind to know him as a man i was sent away to an uncle up at llanbister to be tutored as you might say in the arts of marketing and butchery when i came back master dee was gone to london sought to look him up when i was down there for the parliaments but he was dead by then must have been strange i said coming back from london to this wilderness it was the first time id seen him smile it found shape as slowly as his way of speech never thought of it that way dr dee not till i came back that first time after three weeks in london couldnt settle back to it not for a while so quiet after london that you were listening to your own breaths did nicholas meredith ever live out here not that id know presteigne boy see presteigne it ent london but it aims to be he sighed i dont enquire into the doings of master meredith or how he got his money ent my business and im living in a house that belongs to him and plan to carry on leasing the farm after we moves out to monaughty but the way he was to you last night spoke of more than i could understand i looked him in the eyes left me mystified also i said injured too id reckon come all this way and your own family dont wanner know you i suppose a pensive tightening of prices lips you must needs have care he said at last big man in presteigne now him and bradshaw ole john bradshaw down from ludlow with all his wool money and the lease on most of the abbey property from the crown so presteignes yet owned by england and the council of the marches gets its bidding done by the wool men who are also the magistrates and so on you getting the picture do you know anything at all of the last abbot of wigmore john smart you keeps coming back to that dr dee hes the reason im here hes said to have in his charge a gemstone a crystal stone a beryl i believe which i and my colleague hope to acquire from him for my research on the queens behalf everything i do i said honestly and more than a little sadly is for the queens majesty what you do relating to the hidden one day it will no longer be hidden open to everyone thats my hope thinking of my library which anyone who could read was free to consult not that many did you think thats wise dr dee that all should be known stephen price was watching me it seemed that dudley had been right this man wanted something from me perhaps what vaughan had hinted at on the road to hereford and in his border way was taking the long route i however continued to be direct and honest what im seeking master price is a stone through which i believe knowledge can be obtained the kind of knowledge that cant be learned from books or tutors only by the lifting of the mind its said to have healing qualities and is in the possession of john smart do you know him knows of him thats all a holy knave by all accounts babbies everywhere you know if hes yet about never had cause to he dont enter my life i got enough troubles some of the ole monks they never went away abbots you dont see much of them but he could be around if price knew more it was clear he felt not safe in the discussion of it he folded his arms rocking to and fro at the rivers edge looking up for a hint of sun to work out the time i said you think theyll have brought their prisoner from new radnor sure to you said last night that you had no wish to watch all the glee i think you said paidfor glee time off work free pies a holiday a fair to cover up fear he eyed me feel it did you in presteigne not to any great extent pies are working then ennit he looked up at the hill a pale green wall before us steep sides a flat top nothing works yere brynglas hill and pilleth the village whats left of it he took in a long breath as if he was absorbing something of the humour of the place there was no village left even before the battle see just nantygroes and a couple more farms a way off when they thought the battle was forgot my ancestors set aside some ground east of the hill to build houses for a blacksmith and woodsmen cottagers to work the land then they rebuilt the church that was burned down and pilleth was become a proper village mabbe for the first time seventy folks there at one time they reckon mabbe twentyfive now i waited in silence recalling vaughans words a place where a thousand men have been slaughtered is not exactly the easiest place to make a home price looked up the hill towards the church which brynglas held as it were to its breast when i was told as a boy he said that you wouldnt find no sheep up there after sundown i never questioned it the sheep wont sleep on the hill nor anywhere twixt the hill and the river as a man riding to london i never thought about it it was just ole country lore in london id be with men whod laugh or mabbe men such as yourself whod say but whys it true and in pilleth it just is price stood solid as a boar his back to the river this is a hard place to live i been told nobody should be living yere at all but the folks at pilleth theyve learned how to withstand what has to be withstood and i thought they were stronger for it but now i ent sure i never quite seen the truth of it till i went away and come back and even then it took a while well london you know what thats like the biggest noisiest city in the world aye and back from london you think youre a big man mp for radnorshire but whats it mean less than it sounds youre rarely called to parliament and your vote dont count for moren a fart privy council opens a window and its gone and then you come back home with all your big ideas to find theyll pay more heed to an idiot boy as talks to the dead cause thats real for them thats there what i said carefully some matters some matters are as hard if not harder for men of intellect to discuss as they are for the uneducated looking out over the pale brown river and thinking of dudley as hed been this dawn as i dressed and prepared to leave for nantygroes dudley mumbling about bad dreams but sleepily not in the way he had some hours earlier no screams no sweat no panting no jesu hes gone who sitting up on his high bolster clutching the bed curtains you didnt see him standing beside your bed no holding death john in his hands and me i was no better keeping my voice steady the words coming out as if spoken by someone else it was a dream a bad dream thats all knowing then rolling over staring out at the cold stars that hed be back to sleep long before i would whos the idiot boy master price the sky hung low like a soiled pillow that might suffocate all below it twenty people left in that grey community under the hill and one of them talking to the dead price stood beside the brown and roiling river breathing heavily this boy latest in a long line of strange folk as fetches up in pilleth like it was ordained but i chose not to believe big man back from london full of new ideas man with his eyes open full wide we got ourselves a new rector and his eyes is full open too least to some things to others his eyes is shut tight one of the new breed a bible man lutheran to the core and he dont like what he sees most of all he dont like the boy the idiot i call him an idiot because theres no harm in an idiot but to the rector hes gone to satan because he talks to the dead because he finds them dr dee he finds the dead on the hill he puts out his hands and the ole dead its like they reach out to him you mean the dead from the battle stephen price stared down into the muddy river a mewling hawk glid over us the battle when it was fought they reckon it was a summer just like this not much of a summer at all the ground all waterlogged not much of a harvest omens folk seeing omens everywhere like theyre seeing now with the return of rhys gethin prys and hes a common bandit aye but is he i dont see omens but i dont feel good about pilleth and im the squire of yere and my family goes back likely longer than yours and its my responsibility and it ent presteigne its a lonely place all heavy with ole death you cant buy off fear in pilleth with free pies oh god here it was coming out backwards and sideways and from under the feet in the old border way i made a stand master price some people think in truth im not a priest im a scholar a natural philosopher a man of science i study i cant i know what you do dr dee i once talked to another mp who knows you francis walsingham you talked to walsingham he came to me one time asking about your family well the bastard would wouldnt he francis walsingham traded in intelligence most of it passed to cecil in the event of it being required to measure me for the gallows drop most complimentary about you dr dee told me how much the queen relies on your advice reassuring only to a point if it had suited his or cecils purposes walsingham would just as easily have painted me black id thought to write to you as a local man kind o thing price said and then yere you are like you been sent by no flinging up my hands i came in search of a stone for my experiments for knowledge for healing healing aye thats whats needed dear god i was digging my own pit master price i have to say this ofttimes but i dont undertake the cure of souls the squire of pilleth stood with his back to the flattopped hill a stubble of thorn bushes around its summit half concealing the tower of the church a church my tad had said was dedicated to the virgin mary whose role was now reduced by the new theology as represented by this new vicar but not i guessed for stephen price clearly much heartened by the thought of a new family home grown from a monastery grange keeping an air of the holy all im asking dr dee is for advice like you give to the queen youre a clever man master price no im a worried man theres things i dont understand and the dead are rising as never before a place with more dead than living is that good i stared at the ground probably not come with me price said come with me up the hill at least xxv thrown from the body my tad had entertained me as a boy with tales of the glyndwr wars i can see his face now reddened by the fire his eyes bulging like a clowns as he relates how the rebel leader calling himself prince of wales rose against the english king henry i v destroying all the border castles in his path oh the romance of it a romance conspicuously missing from stephen prices account of the battle of brynglas as we set off up the hill price making a handgesture at the steepening slope before us imagine a thousand dead and dying men hear their hoarse whimpers many more dead men than there are sheep yere now arms and legs and guts and hogsheads of blood imagine the sorely wounded crawling through the plashy pools of blood tad had claimed once that the dees were descended from the same family as glyndwr well who of note were we not descended from but why dont i remember him ever speaking of the battle of brynglas in a way stephen price said it was almost separate from glyndwrs campaign it was about the welsh and the mortimers the arrogant norman marcher lords with their impregnable castles and their contempt for the welsh the last true britons the lowly welsh hated the mortimers hate beyond our understanding in these modern days if the castles had been impregnable i said would there be so many bald mounds the length of the border or so many wellbuilt stone farm buildings stephen price chuckled bleakly looking back we could see my fathers birthplace seeming the size of a candle box and a smaller farmhouse the other side of the bridge both part of the original nantygroes estate the english army on that june day must surely have assembled somewhere close to whatever kind of wooden bridge had crossed the river there and the dees had they just sat and watched from their farms or had they taken part the previously unconsidered question of whose side my family had been on was writ now in illuminated script across the deep grey sky they say edmund mortimers army was a ragbag of peasants hastily recruited price said but that wasnt it he knew the welshman was on his way down from the north and reckoned to crush him for good and all grind him into the ground mortimer had two thousand in his army including a core of welltrained fighting men his own and the men brought along by the knights supporting him and then there were the archers welsh archers many of em mortimer pulled his bowmen from both sides of the border no it was at least a halfwayproper army yet slaughtered by half as many welsh dont sound likely do it till you know what happened rhys gethin he had his own archers and rage on his side see and cunning price pointing to the rounded top of the hill almost violently green now against the charcoal sky evidently no hay crop had been taken from brynglas this year no armour to slow them up price said fast on their feet mountain men like goats over the hill by there i can show you a dip you cant see from this side all full of trees and bushes and thats where they hid out the night before with their women too day of the battle they all come to the top of brynglas but they didnt come down see didnt charge if theyd charged into mortimers army theydve been carved up into pieces and it would have ended here they simply waited forcing mortimers boys to charge up the hill to attack and it dont matter how strong your legs are a charge up yere steeper than it looks feeling the pain in my bookmans calves already what in gods name was i doing here price looked back the way wed come a full charge up yere in full armour on a day in june even a bad june full into a hailstorm of arrows with the slope behind them havoc boy bloody havoc i began to see it i could see dead and wounded men falling back on those behind who could only go on their faces soaked with the spurted blood of their falling comrades and then what happens price stopped a sheep track had become a muddied footpath this is the worst of it as the dead englishmen start to fall back in greater numbers mortimers welsh archers marching with the english of a sudden they all turns round these welshies bowstrings pulled hard back he did the motion one arm outstretched the other withdrawn to the shoulder and they all put their arrows into their own side and at that range boy they dont miss they does not miss i must have winced as if an arrow had rushed with crippling force into my own chest a planned treachery some say that some say they just seen the way the battle was going and changed sides yet all at once as if they was all moved by the same muscles i was glad he didnt ask me what other than an act of prearranged military precision might have caused several dozen welsh archers to act as one several of the knights died and edmund mortimer himself was taken prisoner when the welshies finally come charging down hacking through what was left oh the bitterness and shame of the allpowerful mortimers the only time the name of pilleth has ever been yeard in london all of europe come to that and the dees which side were they on price shrugged never that simple even the norman mortimer after he was took prisoner the king of england wouldnt pay the ransom so all mortimer done he just changed sides married one of owains daughters in the end no border easier to cross than this one on which side might elizabeths own family have fought with which side would it look best now for my kin to have allied itself the big old families they just goes on stephen price said the small men the farmers and peasants forced into fighting theyre the ghosts as walks the battlefields and the sad dreams of the widows for as long as they lived we were nearing the church now a squat grey tower and nave hard against the hill the bones are everywhere in the soil he said down the valley far as nantygroes as i discovered quite recently far as the mortally wounded could crawl like farming a churchyard it is what do you do when you find the bones this was like pulling rotting teeth how hed ever debated in parliament was a mystery to me they gets buried again he said with suitable prayer and litany we have a place just by yere pointing to the side of the church where the land was level men of either side they goes in together with prayer upon prayer and do the dead then rest i asked he looked away i wondered about the betrayed dead impaled on the arrows of their comrades imagined myself blood welling in my mouth helplessly gazing over the reddening shaft of the arrow through my throat into the merciless face already misting over of a man id marched with up this hill nobody likes to dig out a ditch up yere for fear of what theyll find price said if a mans bones are unearthed all work stops till the whole bodys been dug up and reburied or or the ghost will haunt the man who fetched up the bones if so much as a sheepshelter is to be built efforts are made to be sure it ent built on some mans bones else thered be no luck there neither and thats when they send for the boy to find the bones before they rise how often does this happen the dead rising of late too often this summer in all the rain thirty or more its the wet bringing them up now the swelling of the ground my voice tailing off there would have been many a wet summer since the track had steepened under the church and i stopped on a small promontory offering a vast farreaching aspect to the emptiness of the west i marked two horsemen down near nantygroes not moving as if they were watching us they might have been outriders from some longgone army how would you know when a man was a ghost is it easy i said to separate one body from another not really not much else left apart from ole brown bones all the valuables wouldve been stripped off the corpses where they lay within days of the battle and that wasnt all price sucked in his breath stared up at me almost angrily the matter of it is dr dee some of the dead they werent whole thats whats said werent whole for very long after they died xxvi blades edge standing by the sheriffs gate dudley finds himself meeting the sardonic gaze of the outlaw prys gethin as the prisoner is conveyed to one of the holding dungeons behind the court other men knowing the story of the curse and the subsequent deaths might look away at once but dudley is dudley the role of master roberts dropping from his shoulders like a cheap cloak hes giving the man a hard stare a falcon watching a pigeon except this man is not a pigeon anyone can see that its market day in presteigne soon after i left with stephen price dudley heard the sounds of stalls being erected in the streets and went out to find the sheriffs men assembling at the junction for the ride to new radnor castle the sheriffs men and more the judge was obviously taking no chances this time hed sent most of his guard with them roger vaughan was watching them set off and dudley went across the street to join him if anyones planning an ambush master roberts theyll need a small army aim is to start the trial this afternoon swear the jury in at least not wasting any time would you wheres dr dee gone to find his family master meredith vaughan looked surprised only what i yeard not a big town this is it wasnt gossip master roberts i was there near enough not as you had to be that close master meredith sounded like he wanted it to be yeard far and wide so i noticed also mabbe letting it be known that this is no time to have a natural philosopher in town dudley smiled that was the phrase he used natural philosopher conjuror vaughan said makes me sick to recount it but because its of some importance im putting this conversation together from what dudley has told me trusting that he was as strong in his defence of my profession as he insists not that this was necessary with roger vaughan its used in contempt that word but it conjuror bad word in london meant badly by meredith but it ent always bad in these parts hides a deep need in mabbe not all of us but enough yet we got a few working conjurers round yere master roberts and even more the further you gets into wales what ent always easy is to find the ones as knows what theyre doing seems to me a man like dr dee who approaches it with learning and also has the ole skills mabbe thats exactly what we need right now old skills way i sees it vaughan said a man wouldnt study the hidden as assiduously as dr dee does unless he was trying to make sense of his own strange qualities dudley who knows better than anyone the sad truth of this tells me he held his silence the conjurors and the cunning men they yet make a good living in these parts no question vaughan said better now than before the reform i reckon this was always a catholic town see and the catholic church carried some of the old traditions along with it least in these parts it did the protestants the bible men in particular they makes fewer allowances for us to know whats happening to us just accept it its the will of god the cunning men and the wise women they provides what we used to get from the church you employ one yourself master vaughan no but im hoping that dr dee will be able to give me some advice when this is over and what what think you he can do here dudley marked the way vaughan was looking around before he spoke for this was not safe talk not even on the edge of wales but there were only the market traders assembling their stalls for the sale of fresh meat and fruit and fruit pies and honey fish from the rivers wool fleeces and woollen garments from the local workshops he saw men rehanging the ropes of pennants pulled down last night by those angry at the delay in bringing prys gethin to justice mainly men on the streets few women fewer children despite the flags there was no conspicuous gaiety its on a blades edge ennit vaughan said dudley a man who ever relishes a blades edge tried not to show his heightened interest how so ent sure master roberts i was born and raised yere and it ent stable it ent balanced you goes away and you comes back and somewhere twixt hereford and yere the air changes things happen as dont happen anywhere else or they happens faster so you dont see it coming the way sometimes you dont see a storm till it breaks things yere can change in a lightning flash so if you got a circumstance dudley says vaughan had begun to look flushed with embarrassment having perhaps started something he no longer wanted to finish dudley prompted him the trial of a man linked or felt to be linked to local history aye recent history and not so recent it all stirs something inside not just peoples feelings but the feeling of the whole place does a place have feelings some places you can sense it more than others vaughan said dunno why mabbe dr dee can tell you but when you try and cover it up with new ways industry trade too much wealth too quick youre risking something going off like fireworks the ludlow men the bradshaws the beddoes they come in pulling men like meredith behind them the ambitious local families and the greedy keeping the church out of it far back as they can that ent good maybe vaughan was raising matters with dudley with the intention that they should get back to me johns gone to his old family home dudley told him with the man who lives there now price hes got a good head on him the people of pilleth need that ent easy living on a battleground not that one anyway battle like any other dudley said ive seen stopping himself thinking that no antiquary would have seen nearly as much fighting or as much death as lord robert dudley that is collecting documents takes me to places thatve seen conflict i know what happened at pilleth vaughan looked at him do you no offence master roberts but i doubt you do this was a border battle in every sense the welsh they knew what they were fighting for the mortimer army didnt put that together with the power of the place and anything can happen and it did why did the welsh bowmen on mortimers side start killing their own comrades because they were fucking welsh dudley thought but said nothing if you ask them even now vaughan said they wouldnt be able to tell you easy to say that vaughan no one likes to admit to plain treachery dudley marked a quick and angry movement in vaughans eyes master roberts i once talked to a man whose great grandfather was a soldier at pilleth an archer a legend in the family after the battle he went back to his farm and never picked up his bow again didnt trust himself that was what was told to me didnt trust himself to fit an arrow draw back his arm and know where that arrow was going dudley would have smiled making no comment but dont think hed dismiss this as folklore and nonsense i know this man and his mind is far from closed to matters of the hidden i think he said to vaughan doubtless with a deceptive diffidence that you spoke of the power of the place if you ask me im also sure that roger vaughan had a good idea by now of the true identity of master roberts i dont believe that judge legge would have gone out of his way to conceal it a holy hill vaughan said brynglas whats it mean the blue hill behind the church theres a holy well dedicated to the mother of our saviour many people have been healed there and even more killed dudley said brutally well there you are master roberts healing power can be turned around dr dee would know that dudley frowned you seem to know a good deal about it for such a young man vaughan laughed and dudley tells me there was a high wild edge to it im a vaughan the boy said my whole familys haunted three hours have passed it would not have been the plan to bring prys gethin into presteigne on market day dudley thinks but after losing a day to unforeseen rain they could hardly afford to lose another the cart highsided is close to the front of the procession hands and feet in rusting manacles hes sprawled lazily in the straw at the back as though its a royal coach with his greyblack hair back over his ears his one eye cold and steady only taut skin and a ridged scar where the other one used to be dudley for a moment admires his nerve the way he tells me he once admired a oneeyed stag cornered by the hunt returning his gaze with an old warriors arrogance that dudley recognised at once and let him escape with a kind of joy that surprised him prys gethins one eye has a rare brilliance and intensity as if it no longer ever blinks he looks at dudley as though theyre old friends dudley is aware of the smell of hot pies and gravy he can hear whoops and cheers and halloos from the people assembled for the arrival of the prisoner the crowd is swelled by those here for the market many from out of town but the whoops and cheers and halloos seemed muted compared with yesterday when there was no prisoner to hear them two men colourfully dressed as jesters wearing masks arrive out of the throng carrying ropes woven into hangmans nooses which hopping like frogs they dangle in front of the occupant of the cart one of them is so encouraged by the mild uncertain laughter that he leans into the cart tightening and loosening his noose and then tightening it again and cackling until prys gethin inclines his head and smiles gently youll die within the week friend he says drily in the perfectly rounded english of a priest making a pronouncement from his pulpit but he hasnt even looked at the sneering clowns his gaze has not shifted from dudley xxvii likely a sin theres a story mabbe youllve heard how the welshie women who followed rhys gethins army they come down from the hill when it was all over with knives come with knives all gleeful and laughing set about the remains of the english stephen price gazed over the humps in the field bordering the church where the risen dead had been laid to rest below us was the cluster of houses id seen from nantygroes with pens for chickens and pigs and a handful of people about their tasks and all the distant sheep like maggots on decaying meat normal enough to cut the apparel from the slain price said take the weaponry and the leather maybe i knew what was coming maybe i had heard it somewhere the privy parts he looked away down the hill stuffed them into their mouths so theyre hanging down kind o thing a mockery if theres any worse humiliation for a man then i ent yeard of it i winced hatred of the norman marcher lords see taught from birth to hate and the hatred hangs in the air yet close your eyes by yere and stare into the full sun and all you see is black thats what they say never tried it myself i kept my eyes full open not that there was sun this day when did the church catch fire before the battle glyndwr would burn any church as paid tithes to england and the english seen the smoke and flames from the house of god like a sign before the battle rebuilt now but its a sad place id marked how the more he spoke the more his accent deepened as if he was retreating not so much into his own past but pilleths he looked into his hands as if the geometry of the land was etched there used to be a place of pilgrimage shrine of the virgin behind the tower next to the well the holy well a healing place for the eyes mainly for clear sight no one comes now no one gets near the well the rector dont hold with it papism i sighed thinking there should be a middle way hearing bishop scory in hereford talking of how old beliefs yet held sway on the border it seemed to me that one could either respond with a bonnerlike ferocity or with a tolerance bordering on the spiritually lax i chose tolerance isnt this yet bishop scorys diocese i said to price scorys a man of moderation why would he appoint a puritan stephen prices laugh was arid mabbe he didnt belief can change in a blinking mabbe the rector had a moment of revelation educated man used to be a canon in hereford the ole boy who was yere before him father walter he used to have to hop over the big words in the bible but by god he was the man for this parish hed do a sunday worship with hands still wet from pulling a new lamb in your barn a practical man aye new rector talks of a calling first sign of the way things were going was when an ole boy widower living alone goes to him real scared by what he seen asks for the ghosts to be sent away from his door rector shows him a face like stone and tells him the devil makes them see things as dont exist and to fall down on his knees and pray for the forgiveness of his sins he must be an inspiration to you all i said price sat down on the little promontory the hills around him like rough blankets the horizon broken by the distant castle mound with its forked fingers of stone see this this ent a bad place thats the thing good light good shelter and you can see the weather coming and all the families yere owns their own land village as should be five times the size it is but folks dont come and the folks thats yere theres no good fortune price looked up the slope of brynglas towards the little church tower take the thomas boy fine boy good farmer and then hes telling his mother he cant see no future yere hangs himself in the oak wood rector denies him burial in the churchyard for his sin now he lies with the ole warriors and no cross well that ent right that makes nobody happy except the rector he dont know what happiness is likely a sin price raised his eyes to mine im the squire what should i do id seldom felt more useless a student of the hidden who observed and took notes for all the books hed one day write a collector of manuscripts an aspirant to alchemical transformation and a maker of owls that flapped their wings and went woowoo look i said its a battle site when men die in fear and torment embittered by treachery and then their bodies are abused and left to rot where they fell then spirits may linger and theres an air of unhappiness which might last many years its come back he said what has we buried another few days ago hed dropped his gaze to the ground and his voice to a murmur buried him at night me and morgan the shepherd well i had to do most of it pedr morgan he wouldnt touch it but he done the digging never told the vicar i said a few prayers for what that was worth i came down from the mound stephen price kept on talking softly to the grass i was thinking at first as wed do what we sometimes does when its moren a few bones when its a man put him on an ole bier and take him into the church we leave em there overnight covered in sacking and then take em out for burial well clear soon enough we couldnt do that with this un why normal things to alert the coroner and the sheriff about old bones and mabbe the sheriffd raise the hue and cry kind o thing and itd be all over the county and beyond and nobodyd get caught and thatd only make it worse price looked up all torn as if killed in battle this man but dead no moren a day naked we never found his apparel or his cock you hid a murder all gone he said as if he hadnt heard me a bloody black hole nothing in his mouth not much mouth left face was carved up beyond recognising master price let me get this right you are saying this was done by human means not crows nor foxes well gods blood what was i supposed to do dr dee nobody knowed about him except pedr morgan and mistress ceddol and no local man was missing far as i could ascertain not yere not in presteigne not in whos mistress ceddol sister of the mad boy who finds the dead she ent mad not by any means her and morgan comes to me me stephen price of pilleth the squire bad summer nights full of ghosts best tell stephen price of pilleth ask stephen price of pilleth what hes gonner do about the man carrying the spirit of rhys gethin back to brynglas ask him what hes gonner do about a dead man with no cock master price what would you do dr dee i didnt know i yet couldnt think why he was telling me a stranger a student of natural philosophy theres nothing of the hidden about a man freshkilled i said though given what was done to him and given when it was done you might be talking about supporters of plant mat out to revive old fears price nodded soberly a good reason it seemed to me not to go to the sheriff hue and cry the spreading of terror is it your feeling that this might be plant mat putting out a warning of what might happen if gethin hangs if nobody knows there wont be no terror so you buried him drags him into the ole sheep shelter covers him with straw and then we we come at night and takes him out and pedr morgan digs a grave by candlelight and we buries him and yere he lies here where we stand not yere be too obvious we couldnt leave no sign of a burial price considered for a moment before jerking a thumb behind him down the valley towards the river theres an ole tump down there beyond the trees nobody goes there tump grave of the ole britons down by the river he pointed other side of the wood down the western slope an ancient burial mound nobody goes near them you know that always been superstition about ancient mounds warning tales of what had happened to treasure hunters who had plundered them usually finding nothing we dug a deep hole in the side put him in prices voice of a sudden was raw as bone pedr morgan he was frit to hell but we didnt have no choice he was still turned away from the river as if he could not bear to remember what hed done it was yet unclear to me why id been told why share the secret of a misdemeanour with a stranger but stephen price wasnt letting go he insisted we should walk to the village or what remained of it leading me on the path towards the church until it divided and the cluster of grey cottages was revealed gradually through thinning trees already shedding their rusty leaves and at last with a strange heartlurch i saw it rowland dees wales where men were bent to the wind like thorn trees their skin scoured raw while the light everchanging but ever cold was chopping their world into jagged shards of anguish xxviii the jury a crab when threatened may move sideways dudley disgusted to find himself alarmed slips into an alleyway pulling out a kerchief scrubbing at the unexpected sweat hands flat on a stone wall forehead pressed into a patch of damp moss he draws long breaths until his foul fear is reborn as fury but the single eye of prys gethin is yet boring through him a dark diamond turning in bone its not the youll die within a year thats affected him there have been times when hes been told hell be dead within the hour its the words that followed none of which he understood hes been cursed in french and cursed in spanish and the spittleslicked tirades barely reached him before they went to vapour gethins language he knows is far older in these islands than his own and comes out like clotted honey every opaque sentence an incantation it annoys him the way a common brigand hides his villainy under a cloak of false patriotism assuming a resonant name and the glow of dark magic around a longdead national hero dudley reminds himself why hes here prays silently feeling around himself as ofttimes ive advised him a whitegold protective light i hold this to be angelic light but dudley i suspect sees the glitter of the english crown he and the queen twin souls born he yet insists in the same hour of the same day under the sign of cancer the crab dancing together with effortless elegance iridescent like dragonflies on the water peering with delight into the pools of one anothers minds but dudley never wants to hear bess using words like those which issued from that prison cart regardless of the trail of horseshit left behind by her grandfather he doesnt want to believe that the woman he desires more than long life is in any respect welsh prising himself from the stone wall he stands warily at the top of the alleyway watching a goodwife of presteigne bartering for bruised apples a foretelling of his death will ever send him in angry pursuit of something lifeaffirming within moments hes marked the woman wearing a green velvet gown easily the most expensive in the market and the kind of french hood once favoured by the queens mother carrying an empty basket over an arm buying nothing dudley watches this woman for no more than a minute before wandering over to stand quietly next to her at a stall selling pomegranates from the holy land at once shes aware of his presence and with a twist of the hips is looking up into his eyes a true feel of autumn today master yes dudley says it may rain again a good day to be indoors preferably upstairs dudley says in case of flood ever a sensible precaution dudley nods soberly at the wisdom of this are you with an attorney mistress not at the moment they havent caught me yet she looks him up and down her gaze lingering on those exceptional riding boots now he can smell her perfume and her interest you live near here mistress within a short walk she smiles the condition of her teeth suggests shes no older than he is he moves his purse around to the front of his belt its a good day for a walk dudley says and off they go together dudley priding himself on his ability to mark a whore from thirty paces you know whats different about you master modesty forbids me to ask you can make a woman laugh thats rare shes not the first to have said that yet i feel she lays a finger on the tip of his nose that something unfortunate has happened to you today did you quarrel with your wife before you left london i dont have a wife ever any more oh well she strokes his cheek youll find another dudley is lying on his back he cant place her accent it isnt local to the area but he thinks its welsh and in view of what theyve just been doing that pleases him whats your name he says amy when his muscles lock into rigidity she leans over him in the bed what did i say he doesnt answer he looks up into her face shes nothing like his dead wife her eyes are far apart her mouth is wide and her hair hanging now over his cheeks is more the colour of the queens he lets out his breath he smiles a good living is it mistress with all the attorneys and the judges at the great sessions some sessions are greater than others she says clever too and who pays for your time apart from attorneys you ask a lot of questions what about the wool merchants from ludlow you ever had old bradshaw up here him she gives a yelp of amusement he wont even be seen walking past my door what about nicholas meredith master roberts she says if its intelligence youre seeking which may be used for some nefarious purpose you must needs know im a woman who keeps her secrets an element of mystery in my trade is she touches the tip of her nose with a forefinger of the essence her house is twixt two workshops down an alley close to the centre of town the ceiling of her bedchamber is very low and of a sudden in the scored and fissured black beams he sees the dark leathery face of prys gethin a knot in the wood has become that one eye dudley feels a pressure in the centre of his forehead he turns away towards amy the whore pulling the sheet from her left breast and lowering his face you only paid for once she reminds him not that it lasted particularly long ill pay for thrice if you talk to me she pushes him gently away and sits up her smile fading who are you i dont think youre an attorney dudley says im an antiquary whats that a man who likes old things well thank you and you mistress are too clever to be a nun no she says pushing back her ginger hair im simply too clever to be a nun in bristol or london here im like the ironmonger the apothecary the blacksmith the fruiterer yes i did mark your ability to squeeze a pair of plums thats a common farmers jest she rolled away from him in a few years ill be forced to marry a farmer or somebody and the past will be the past but if that doesnt happen ill always have money and the means to make more i might start a school my father was a schoolmaster in brecon that would explain much dudley persists what about priests find absolution by marrying a priest or a former monk have you known monks in the biblical sense or otherwise what about the former abbot of wigmore hes approached it too quickly her eyes narrow the chamber is lit by a single glazed pane under the eaves and she blocks it with her body rising up im an antiquary dudley says im told he may have some relics for sale you would expect she laughs incredulous youd expect the abbot of a monastery taken by the crown to be selling holy relics twenty years afterwards dudleys at once excited the mans about not a holy relic mistress as such i and my friend have an interest in a certain gemstone which we believe the former abbot has its value is purely historical you have the money you know i have the money how long she asks will you be here an hour and a half later with a sense of returning strength and wellbeing following a lunch of beef and gravy at the bull dudley walks back into the marketplace and marks roger vaughan entering through the sheriffs gates with documents under an arm hurries to catch him up its beginning master vaughan jurys being sworn in you want to see the guards are preventing people from using the main entrance lest the entire town should come to watch vaughan leads dudley down an alleyway and soon theyre in a cloisterlike passage where the slit windows are barred down the middle at the end of it an oak door hangs ajar and theres much commotion the courtroom is bigger than hed expected in a place like presteigne like to a barn with lowhung rafters as though a loft has been removed perhaps a barn was what it used to be a one end steps lead to a structure like to a long pulpit where presumably the judge will sit although theres yet no sign of sir christopher legge or indeed the prisoner vaughan guides dudley to a corner near a platform with bars around it which extend well beyond headheight its empty a procession of men is winding from a doorway halfway up the courtroom vaughan says hell leave it to one of the local jps to swear in the jurymen and so it turns out the jp is snowyhaired and vague and barely looks at the members of the jury as in turn they swear upon the bible that they will consider all the evidence laid before them and return a fair and honest verdict the jp looks uncertainly around the court and an attorney in robes leans over and whispers something dudley is marking each of the jurymen with a slow and faintly incredulous smile as the old jp announces that the trial of prys gethin for murder by witchcraft and cattle theft will commence on the morrow at ten of the clock hmmm vaughan says as the courtroom clears theyre taking no chances are they i counted seven dudley says that would be about right a safe majority the fear is that a jury of all local men that their families would be threatened that retribution might be made against them even years later never feel safe again also i expect that seven extra members of legges guard will come in quite useful if gethin tries to escape however important it may be that all possibilities of an acquittal for prys gethin should be sealed like cracks in the masonry robert dudley as an english gentleman yet finds it distasteful that sir christopher legge should feel the need to bring his own jurymen and however much he now wants the swift disposal of the man who slipped him a smiling curse from the back of a cart dudley begins to wonder for the first time what might be hiding behind the façade of this small provincial trial xxix betwixt the living and the dead dear god my father had me trapped walking towards the village he was with us all the way i saw him sitting before our christmas fire mellowed by good wine telling me about my forebears all the way back to arthur all for wales my tad all for this jesu poor pilleth all grey and cowering huddled under the hill waterlogged paths separating the mean sunken homes with their mud and rubblestone walls their rotting roofs smokeholes in the ridges and maybe a dozen small shuttered windows there was a glow of life here but only as from a rushlight which burns feebly and lives not long and the shade of rowland dee said hed be in london for five years at the outside goodwife thomas laughing shrilly just enough time for him to scrape some of the gold off the streets he used to say scrape the gold off the streets oh i could hear that the way hed say to my mother a proper tapestry one day janey telling you now i am as gods my living witness youll be ripping down the ole wall hangings by new year you mark my words girl my tad a goodlooking lively boy for whom everyone knew pilleth and even presteigne were too small and then hed be coming back see to put glass in all our windows goodwife thomas said glass master glass for the likes of we well we knew wed never see him again but he was never thrifty with his dreams how true that was i brushed aside a small bitter tear as if it were a fly goodwife thomas sparsehaired and thin as a rib was laughing again saying she could see some of him in me so mabbe hed come back after all master rowly my but youre a goodlooking boy too dr dee have you no wife trying to press upon me a slice of her bara brith but seeing how little of it remained and knowing how few berries the summer would have yielded i refused with many thanks saying id eaten too well at nantygroes a mean wood fire burned beneath a stewpot childrens faces peered out of the smoky gloom stephen price had said the thomas family lived in pilleths best house a long house with barn attached for the animals not that there were many now when a dwelling was abandoned its fabric was plundered to strengthen the others dr dee advises the queen price said he can help us i felt nearsick what the hell had walsingham told him about me tell him about your grandson wariness washed over me with the realisation of who her grandson must be the old woman bowed her head he dont want to know our troubles i want him to know price said hes one of us rowlys boy hes studied these matters he can see what we cant because were too close to it he turned to me in the weeks before his death the boys dreams were troubled he saw the church afire again and the graves stephen goodwife thomas said no more didnt he say he saw the old graves opened and awoke and wouldnt go back to sleep for fear of what he seen coming from the graves please stephen the old woman leaning forward on her bench the rector he said the devil had got in him and we must not speak of it the boy took his own life and thats one of the worst of sins wiping her eyes with a cloth and i want to pray for his soul but i dont i dont know where it is behind her a child had begun to sniffle from outside in the misty distance there came a yelping cry like to a vixen but i knew it was human you see price said as we walked to the wooded end of the village you see how things are theyre afraid even to call out to god we passed two ruined hovels whose roofs had long ago been burned only the blackened walls remaining i was thinking that nobody id met in pilleth not the thomases nor the lewises nor the puws none of the small farmers who had known him had made reference to my tad as a dishonest man nobody gave indication that they had any knowledge of what id been doing in london only well well duw duw this slowsmiling surprise at meeting rowly dees boy after all these years gareth puw who was also the village blacksmith said hed heard the new queen was ofttimes to be seen around london and was very friendly to the people and had i ever seen her myself i admitted that i had said she was fair of face and full of good humour and left it at that there was a quiet civility amongst these people a hospitality i knew they could not afford but no merriment even the children looked wanfaced and listless and the air was chill and the clouds hung like smoke from a damp fire the sense of a community closing in upon itself i guessed doors would be barred at sunset tapers lit in windows for those who could afford them but they would not talk about what stephen price wanted them to talk about the whole village will die around them he said and they wont question it on the edge of the village a door opened as we approached it and we heard a thin wailing from within and then a man emerged a narrow man in a long coat childs gone master price he said without preamble he was built like a broken archway face white as plaster stephen price sighed one left the narrow mans voice was from his nose the one they thought would go last year but yet hangs on the lord god decides as ever i saw prices body quake and thats all you got to say is it what would you have me say mabbe the lord god got more time for some places than he got for others price said with bitterness a distant smile ill pray for you too master price the man looked briefly at me and pulled his black coat around him and moved away with high pecking steps like a raven as the door was barred from within i said thats your rector matthew daunce gone back to his lair in the trees above the village god i said it was set tight into the hillside itself framed by thorn trees whose twisting branches were grown over its walls its roof was well mossed and its open doorway like to a crack in the rockface this squat and crooked dwelling had not been visible during our ascent of the hill wed had to pass through the village and stand within a small wood of stunted oak to see it unobserved was this here when the battle was fought i asked price here but not lived in its said once to have been the cell of an anchoress living alone here for many years but that was long before the battle when there was just a shrine the anchoress looked after the shrine and when she was gone the brambles took over thats what its called the bryn as if its part of the hill itself his face twisted for years it was ty marw i looked at him the house of death charnel house when someone went in after the battle they found it filled to the rafters with driedout bodies in the end they got taken out and buried with the rest but nobody wanted to live there until mistress ceddol came yere with her brother i was in london at the time learning about parliament and how it all worked was this woman told of its history when they came to live here youve met the local people dr dee i nodded theyd tell her of course they would she must be a remarkable woman or very desperate for somewhere to live made it habitable mostly by herself last summer a better summer than this she and the boy lay nights under bentover saplings covered with sheepskins while she worked had i been here idve found them shelter in the outhouses at nantygroes i think it was the puw brothers who came to help in the end first pilleth people to go inside the bryn for generations and then gradually more of them came to help shed insist on paying them with what she was earning through the sale of potions and ointments shed made from herbs and sheep fat to sell at the apothecarys in presteigne where did they come from the woman and the boy somewhere north of here shropshire mabbe driven away from home shell readily admit because of her brother her father couldnt live with his wailing his sudden rages ramblings in the night especially when their mother died not long after he was born as if to prove the nuisance of it there came that vixen shriek from within the little house within the hill it sounded like followed by a womans laughter a smittering of slow rain began to rattle the crispen oak leaves and price led us into deeper shelter her patience with him appears endless the sister brought him up no choice people are afraid of him stricken from birth with some malady of the mind and yet possessed of this talent he told me how the boy had found a skull in the foundation for his new barn price dismissing it as rookery until just over a week later hed given instruction for a new field drain to be dug and nobody would sink a spade until siôn ceddol had been sent to walk the peggedout route the boy had stopped three quarters of the way to the last peg where subsequently a whole skeleton had been unearthed in the oak wood i carefully prised away a bramble which had coiled like a monks manacle around my wrist the path through the wood ended at the bryn it was all too clear that this was our final destination and the reason id been brought to pilleth the bryn was either the cause of the sickness or in some strange way its possible solution whatever siôn ceddol was possessed of price didnt understand it and was afraid of where it would end especially under the eyes of the new rector daunce whenever the boys called out to search for bones hell know and hell go there first and mumble his prayers into the ground and then walk away and have no part in what follows preaches on a sunday about the devil in our midst but he dont name names not yet but he sows unrest where once there was acceptance acceptance theres always been a wise woman yere or a cunning man the last one died about five years ago mother marged blind in both eyes blind to the world but there was a calm around her after she died her ghost was said to walk through the village every night just beyond sunset me i think they just wanted to see her with her hands out in benediction a comfort but when the boy came she was seen no more a successor most of the cunning people they got something wrong with em blind or deformed they need your help and they give it back in kind siôn ceddol he cant talk in english or welsh the sounds that come out of him all with dribbling and swivelly eyes people say its the faerie tongue most of the time he cant even walk a straight line but he walks twixt the living and the dead and theres no fear in him finds the bones ent only the bones hell show you where to dig for a well you tell his sister what you need she gets through to to where he is and when he understands hes straight to it like a digging dog and theyre paid in meat and clothing and a few yards of land and the help to manage it and if he wont go in the church after he shit hisself in there once well theyll stand outside and shell join in with the hymns and prayers and the boys scampering around the churchyard like a rabbit making his noises a harmless idiot the rector wont see it that way i said no price said he dont i looked out between the wet trees at the low crooked rockhouse once called ty marw built into brynglas hill grown into the hill a slow spiral of smoke curled from the hole in the roof meeting the steady rain now i wanted badly to know about this boy if he did what they said he did and how i can make an introduction if you like price said i sensed he didnt want to didnt even want to be here now that hed shown me the place have you ever been in there i said he shook his head foolish ennit ill go alone i said see what i can see and come back to you i felt i was misleading him because this was little more than scientific curiosity on my part a scrabbling amongst the thickets of the hidden i marked the relief in his eyes with a certain horror the door of the bryn was black with damp it was opened as if id already knocked upon it and a woman stood there as if she knew i was here though i was sure she couldnt see us for the trees and oh my god why had no one warned me about her xxx more than water we are moved i know this according to the configurations of the stars and the interplay of planetary rays we are moved like chesspieces on a board and ofttimes i think of myself as the knight placed with an oblique mathematical precision but unpredictably the knight who never knows which direction hell be made to face next my names john dee i said standing betwixt the oak wood and the doorway anna ceddol looked at me with small curiosity siôn ceddol scowled and picked up a stick the rain fell upon the chessboard my father was born down at nantygroes i know she said theyve talked about you in the village my my tad left many years ago to live in london its the first time ive been here the royal conjuror is it anna ceddol said no apparent malice or even an awareness of saying anything that might cause offence of a sudden i was weary of denying it i may even have nodded the rain was seeping uncomfortably through my jerkin anna ceddol held the door wider youd best come in youll be soaked thank you i left my wizards hat in my saddlebag in the stable at nantygroes she didnt smile the boy siôn ceddol kicked sulkily at a thorntree root about half an acre of ground beside the cottage had been cleared of brambles bushes and undergrowth some of it had been cultivated for vegetables with rotted horseshit spread on top before the winter some appeared good pasture but there was no stock on it no chickens pecked the ground i went in the boy followed me picking up a bundle of small sticks from beside the door he wore a bright red hat pulled down over his eyes i went into the wood to shelter i said seeing the rain about to come on she shook her head as if disappointed that id lied so glibly i felt a weight of shame id not lie again stephen price brought me i said the bryn was even lower than it had seemed from outside my height which comes from the men of kent on my mothers side made it impossible for me to stand even with bent neck anna ceddol pointed to a threelegged stool by the fire which was on a raised hearth against one wall with the smokehole above two large upright stones backing on to the wall might have been supports for an ingle beam had there been one rainwater fizzed on the red embers although i guessed the hill rising so close behind the cottage would be shielding us from the worst of it master price thought i might talk to you i said and your brother for a moment anna ceddol appeared to smile and then it was gone fleet as a clouded moonbeam well perhaps not your brother i said that is master price doesnt come here his wife would not like it ive not met his wife me neither a quiet woman or so they say sits before the kitchen fire goes out to listen to the priest on a sunday and then goes home and worries quietly no particular expression in her voice except maybe a resignation her overdress was the colour of sacking its hem frayed and flaked with mud gods tears why had no one warned me about her id seen women this lovely at court but their faces were paled their lips reddened like cherries they were ladies this was a woman with all the timeless beauty of an unadorned statue long face full lips heavy hair a sense of grace about her and although she was slim and lithe a certain weight she said can i fetch a drink for you dr dee we have good water from a spring i regret if i insult you but they say that the water in london no no its true the water in london kills she inclined her head her eyes were vividly blue although her hair all bound into a thick braid was dark as rich earth i was somehow glad when she turned away and went to a pitcher which stood amid the rushes on the floor leaving me sitting in the feebly sparking firelight listening to my own fraught breathing the bryn from the outside it had looked like the worst of hovels but as my eyes grew accustomed to the dimness i saw that the inner walls were all scrubbed and the rushes on the floor clean and dry the boy sat in a corner beyond the fire quiet now but watching me the way a cat does the chessboard expanded and shrank in my fogged head mistress i said at last i confess i know not what im doing here surely she said you were sent to see if were drenched in evil mistress i sooner or later wherever we go this is what happens alls well till something goes amiss and were blamed and then well move on theyre good people here but it cant be long now before were made to go not without regret mind after all the work weve done to make this a home she gave me water in a wooden cup i drank tentatively at first and then jesu liquid alchemy from the rocks water from eden your brother found this one of his less disturbing skills and our most gainful i suppose he has an instinct for where best to sink wells farmers ever think they can do it but not many can anyway she shrugged the rector wont have it in his font ah i said the rector anything that cant be explained its either the will of god and must not be questioned or the work of satan and must be destroyed and hes our closest neighbour i watched her solemn face there was a silken calm behind it that i found almost eerie what also surprised me was the eloquence of her speech id expected a woman living in such humble circumstance with an idiot brother to be uneducated barely coherent it was clear now why stephen price found her alarming and the rector held in the ligature of lutherism feared the demonic listen i said i know not what they say about me in the village what youre told to your face is seldom whats in peoples minds but my tad came from here and i doubt theyd mean me harm and stephen price against all his inclinations he believes this place cursed by its history and thinks with all my fabled learning that i might at least be able to direct him to a cure i doubt i can do that but now i i do feel driven to try found i was leaning from the stool my voice rising in urgency anna ceddol stared at me with an evident consternation that reassured me of her humanity i fell back under the weight of my own inadequacy i consider myself a natural philosopher a man of science half of london maybe more than half yet thinks me a sorcerer and not so many years ago i was close to being burned for it and you know the bitter truth of this mistress ceddol i can rhyme off the theory for hours but i cant do what your brothers said to do nothing approaching it then perhaps she said you should thank god for that mistress i dont thank god for that my whole life is focused towards a need to enter the hidden and i know now that it cant be done by books alone not by all the books in the libraries of the world all that the books can hope to do is make sense of it i drained my cup of the sublime water that siôn ceddol the idiot had found in the rocks of brynglas i yet need something of which to make sense i said some of my longheld despair doubtless showing itself to a stranger in a house like a cave my brother she smiled at last though it was smirched with rue does it not occur to you that when the circumstances of birth leave a child damaged or crippled in his body or his mind then sometimes god will make amends by giving him other gifts i think i said carefully that this is not always true no she looked into the fire i suppose not sometimes i wish god had left him alone with his ills weve been driven from too many towns at first they value him and then when theres water enough for everyone its more than water isnt it mistress ceddol drew a bench across the rushes so that she sat opposite me the fire betwixt us the boy crawled across the floor and nestled close to her skirts looking at me wideeyed but silent the dead she tossed back her dense braided hair like a ships mooring rope what do you want me to say that the dead have been kinder to him than the living look what happens with the bones thats not happened before only here the obvious explanation being the large number of bones here i said so close to the surface now looking away though because i knew it was more than the physical fact of broken bodies absorbed into the hill this countryside reeked of the numinous why else had it been chosen for a shrine to the holy virgin its spring sanctified probably to more than one god what im saying anna ceddol squeezed her eyes shut her calmness lost for a moment to exasperation and what ive said to others is that the bones are not the dead only whats left but what of the man who was found more recently dead and cut about with no warning the boy let out his vixen shriek and i sprang back in alarm almost toppling the stool siôn ceddol grinned anna ceddol pressed down upon his red hat and he squirmed and giggled and she laughed for his benefit but addressed me in a darker humour her eyes steady and intense he didnt find that man he wouldnt even come out that day he was afraid and clung to the fire but no look at him hes ever in his own place and a big part of him is missing he feels no responsibility no obligation to any of us when he shits i wipe his arse and change his napkin he expects it and always will he doesnt understand he feels no need to understand anything beyond his own needs other people dont matter to him never have never will not the living nor the dead her face as calm as ever but behind it pulsed an old and constant sorrow always on the edge of despair sweet woodsmoke caught in my throat and made me cough and i felt sorely shamed by my concern with in comparison such small frustrations listen hes tired now she said maybe if you can come back tomorrow here if you come back in the morning i can show you what he does and you can judge for yourself whether its the devil in him siôn ceddol was sitting up now still giggling reaching out his arms i thought at first to me but his eyes were on something to the side of me where smoke hung over a stack of cut logs the boy reached out to the space above the logs making kittenish noises if there had been heat from the fire there was none now anna ceddol said sharply no her brother began to pant his hands held out before him as though he held a holy chalice the fires cold red embers shone in his eyes hes tired mistress ceddol said you should go another oak wood bearded the lower western slope of brynglas an old wood where some trees had boles with the girth of the late king harry i hesitated on its threshold if there had been a path through it it was long obscured the sky would go dark soon i should collect my horse from nantygroes and ride back to presteigne but the rain had stopped and something beckoned something beyond the wood i went in as to a country church the branches above me like twisted rafters the crunching of acorns under my boots there ought to be pigs here but nothing moved except a man who felt himself drawn deep into something he did not understand surrounded by people who thought he should anna ceddol i felt a profound sadness for her situation and more than a little desire of her body which i could only regret for she was in need of better than that and i had a sense of what this boy was about and if only for mistress ceddols sake must needs prove it tomorrow who was i fooling it was as much for my own sake or as i might claim for the furtherance of learning the boy had found a link to the land something of another sphere that was channelled through him the oaks shone dully from the rain and the old churchiness of the wood was as strong as if it were perfumed with incense i thought of priests ancient priests in robes of deathly black with hair in disarray as tacitus would have it the druids the priestly class of ancient britain made demonic by the invading romans who would slaughter them on the isle of mona in the northwest of wales surely demolishing a shining spiritual engine for was not merlin himself a druid ever the fate of the magician to be demonised and put to the sword sooner than id expected i emerged from the woods cloister onto a plateau of land overlooking low ground suggestive of marshland to which i at once slid down for against the darkening sky id seen it normally id need no alerting to a manmade bump in the land ofttimes they hold a promise of treasure which as ive said almost always comes to naught this tump was low and regular too small and shallow to be a castle motte it was nothing in itself and yet as i crossed the low ground towards it it seemed to sing to me that is i was sure i could hear a low humming in the air maybe the sound of my own excitement for ancient earthworks tantalised me made my hands tingle and i knew not why found myself murmuring a prayer in latin as i stood at the foot of the tump the grass on its sides was clearly of a different colour to the turf of the land on which it sat i stood looking up to the summit where another oak tree grew like an emissary from the wood what was it about these lonely old graves the graves of men who were here i believe before the romans before arthur of a race who lived according to an old magic linked to an arcane knowledge of the sun and the moon and the planets but who lacked the means or the ability to write any of this down these were men whom im sure would have known some of what pythagoras knew but by instinct men whose remains ofttimes no more than cremation dust in a pot vessel were too meagre for such an upheaval of earth this was the treasure the old knowledge the ancient wisdom the tumps were like books made of soil and turf if only we could read them whatever guardian rose up to frighten those who would dig into the tumps in vain search of gold and ill confess that i was once inclined to be amongst them was perhaps in defence of old secrets it was easy to climb to the summit where the oak tree stood like a bent old blackfriar i stood with a hand on the tree and looked all around and my breath caught in my chest even from such a modest height the view was immoderately enhanced the shape of the nearby river could now be seen a gleaming eel brighter than the sky gathering light from a source i could not see the river lugg lugg how might this be spelt could it not be a local pronunciation of lugh an old british god of light and the harvest was this the holy river of lugh was the sloping oakwood the remains of a sacred grove of the druids the presence of a holy well near the church on the hill that rose before me was a further indication that this had been a place of worship older than the christian church and i could see now that the tump on which i stood was set into a curve of the river the sacred river which it seemed to me was like to its own shape indeed it seemed at that moment as if the whole valley had been formed around this tump when i came down it was on the other side nearest the river and i was marking the dints where it had been invaded by stephen price and morgan the shepherd a body introduced where a body was not meant to lie a violated body a kind of sacrilege i thought as the air of the place was pulled around me like a damp old cloak xxxi a popular knave in presteigne the night was alive with lights and the wailing of a fiddle and flute band which was led i saw by the chief ostler from the bull in a yellow hat with a feather plucking at a battered lute and so many more people this night the constant clatter of shod hooves messengers likely from the council of wales at ludlow coming to feed and water their horses and take meat before going back on the road new pitchtorches were set to burn all night outside the sheriffs house and extra guards had been posted outside the roistering was not a paidfor merriment something had taken fire if all this was over the trial of one man it still made not full sense to me despite what roger vaughan had said about the scratching of an old itch i wondered as i led my horse into the mews at the bull to what extent the wound had been inflamed by the manner of the deaths of the men whod brought prys gethin out of radnor forest lights against the perceived darkness of witchcraft sorcerer at the entrance to the mews something stinking slapped into my left cheek a childs screech was followed by an ooze of grown mans laughter as i winced plucking at the mess of rotting fruit on my face clearly my cousin nicholas had not been inactive this day quick footsteps behind me in the mews and i froze my horses hot breath on my neck no way of knowing how many of them were in the shadows or if they were all children no use in hiding a voice more welsh than any id heard in presteigne or pilleth seen your faces now boys a voice familiar to me and heres the thing it said if i see your faces again this night and theres no one about i shall have no choice but to drown the both of you in the river leave you floating facesdown all the way to hereford a pity but there it is cannot abide impoliteness in the young silence then the voice came back quieter with perhaps an edge of amusement i think theres a horse trough just behind you john gods blood i found the tank and bent to it splashing the cold water on my face and rising dripping thomas jones the small surprises life throws at us eh keep me going they do how are you boy this was a man high on the list of people id not expected to meet in this town but then again youre here as a friend of the accused i said ha to plead for his life perhaps thomas jones who was betrothed to my cousin joanne peered at the approaching ostler lying with the horse tonight is it john or have you come into money living off my rich friends i said as usual i thought maybe it was that you can buy me dinner then im yet unsure how my cousin joanne whom id encountered but rarely had come to be enamoured of the man known in his own country as twm siôn cati thomas son of john and catherine is all it means but its said to ring like mocking bells in west wales where he was known as a scholar and also a thief thief listen i know not and take care never to ask what he stole according to the legend his victims tended to be knavish landowners some of the proceeds of his crimes were it is said fed to the victims hardpressed tenants while leaving some behind for the purchase of his books id guess though never asked especially since thomas jones dr jones now had with little explanation been granted a pardon by the queen maybe through petition of his family to cecil or even blanche parry who really knew how or why such pardons were granted but robert dudley when introduced was predictably sceptical of the provenance of this one you expect me to dine with this sack of shit glaring at thomas jones from a corner of the parlour at the bull where candles flared from the walls and men i recognised as legges attorneys were pressed amongst welldressed men with a merchant air and serving girls bore jugs of ale and cider twm siôn cati looked hurt hed gained some weight since last id seen him and his hair was longer his beard shaven close his doublet of a warm russet colour with threads looking suspiciously gilded was the kind of garment that dudley himself might have worn were he not in mourning or the guise of master roberts i did not know and yet dont if there was history common to these men or whether dudleys disdain might even hide a wellburied respect i might even have derived some amusement from it had circumstances been different for it was clear that thomas jones had a good idea of my companions identity and dudleys attitude would confirm it this mans a renowned knave you do know that john former knave thomas jones said stiffly and youre telling me this piece of gangrenous welsh pus is your cousin soon to be master roberts by marriage thomas jones tossed a handful of groats on to a tray and snatched up a mug of cider and may i say john your antiquarys manner of speech tutored him myself i said is sadly typical of the vulgar way the grasping lower orders when exposed to a little learning choose to express themselves these days thank god i say that such a man will never be seen within a mile of the queens majesty if i were in a position to order it dudley murmured id be obliged for the good of the country and all of us to see you hang youll stay for that masters the hanging the big shiny face of the innkeeper was before us likely no more than a day after the trial and then well sell some ale sure to thomas jones looked dubious wont they torture him first find out where the others are wont they want to crush whats left of plant mat once and for all you could be right master could be right likely be dusting off the rack at new radnor as we speaks might have to build the gallows a few inches higher the innkeeper was near doubled up with merriment dudley said you actually trust this man jones in a way i probably do but i wish i knew why he was here it had not been possible in the suffocatingly crowded inn to discuss anything of significance dudley had said hardly a word soon after our supper thomas jones had disappeared to wherever he was to lie this night and dudley and i had taken a jug of cider to our chamber lit a candle closed the shutters against what remained of the revelry hes here dudley said because he knows prys gethin why else robbie he was pardoned by the queen only because she likes to appear magnanimous towards the welsh and because hes a popular knave that of course is assuming it was her own decision which i tend to doubt and who can be sure that jones isnt one of them plant mat dudley had told me about coming face to face with prys gethin chained in his gaol cart of his conviction that hed been cursed by the man i knew not what to think for any number of reasons dudley was in a peculiar state of mind i just i dont like the feel of this john im yet failing to understand why a judge of the eminence of legge is sent here complete with jury to make sure that one man is seen to be tried and goes to the gallows with all ends tied its too much theres something happening behind it hed also told me about the whore hed lain with why was i unsurprised to hear of this and his belief that she might lead him to abbot smart and the wigmore shewstone and you trust her i said i know women shell want more of me what are you doing id found paper and ink in my bag and spread them out upon the board under the candle drawing a map from memory of brynglas hill and the valley leading down to the river lugg wishing i was in my library with lelands maps where all might be measured against what was known and recorded so many possibilities here did the ancients believe that dedication of the river to the god of the harvest might ensure fertility in the valley i drew the ancient burial mound in the rivers curve and the church with its prechristian well and shrine and betwixt them the oak grove dudley was peering over my shoulder a mug of cider in hand whats it mean all these heathen sacred places all clustered together the river and the hill its clear that in the time before christ some places were seen as more suited to worship and communion with the beyond places where there might be passage through the spheres one to another dudley took a step back cider spilling over his wrist beg mercy john i may have asked the wrong question what i meant was what the fuck does any of this matter i looked up at him perhaps vaguely i dont know i need to think on it but its clear is it not that the battlefield was chosen by glyndwr and rhys gethin and glyndwr studied magic and would see the power in this place jesu dudley said wearily you never change do you this is all because some failed mp from the rear benches asks you to explain why his village is dying on its feet my fathers village your fathers dead and it was so much his village that he took the first opportunity to put it a threeday ride behind him and never go back to the dismal hole i shook my head id fought against it and lost for reasons id refused even to explain to myself i felt no particular kinship with it at first felt nothing of my tad there and then mysteries appeared as important in their way as as the shewstone i suppose as important to the queen possibly not your mysticism leads you by the nose dudley said so pilleths dying villages die all the time from the plague or the river dries up or one more day youre going back maybe not more than half a day dudley thrust his face up to mine can it be that youve forgotten why we came here youre leaving me to find the shewstone while you waste another day trying to restore the reputation of the fucking dees give me one day robbie i said just one day maybe i shouldve told him about the ceddols maybe if hed known there was a startlingly beautiful and mysterious woman in pilleth he would even have come with me maybe some people would not have died so cruelly maybe but i said nothing when i crept from my truckle at first light my head was all full of writings about a man called agricola who i thought might answer the mystery of siôn ceddol and dudley was yet sleeping in the high bed the early ostler was saddling my faithful mare when of a sudden he climbed the ladder to his loft and returned with a fold of stiff paper left for you last night master john the message said we must needs talk boy alone and with some urgency had there been any sign of thomas jones on the streets of presteigne as i rode out i would of course have stopped maybe i should have asked him where he was lodging maybe maybe maybe dear god part four that he the said abbot hath lived viciously and kept to concubines divers and many women that is openly known that the said abbot doth yet continue his vicious living as it is known openly that the said abbot hath spent and wasted much of the goods of the said monastery upon the foresaid women articles to be objected against john smart abbot of the monastery of wigmore in the county of hereford to be exhibited to the right honourable lord thomas cromwell the lord privy seal xxxii given back now that we were well into autumn the mist was dense and speckled with white and gold showing that the sun was yet alive somewhere the boy was running ahead of us into the mist arms flung wide flapping like the wings of a groundhopping bird not entirely of this world id have sworn that sometimes anna ceddol said as we pursued him up the hill i think i can see lights around him little winking lights at his shoulders people talk of foreshadows of the endtime lights in the sky prophecy in dreams voices in the night footsteps in empty rooms the dead among the living i hear of these things all the time i draw glyphs and sigils and mark wondrous geometry in the night sky to calcule how celestial configurations might alter our humour yet how can i know what is real and what is imagined he spun redcrested amongst the curling leaves swirling in the energy of autumn he was of nature she said the woods would feed him he would wind himself around the twisted trees occasionally snapping off twigs which would come alive like extra fingers twitching and dipping although not so much now he seemed to find that unnecessary now she said as though he could conjure invisible twigs and follow where they led natural magic you took it up there anna ceddol had stopped halfway up the slope drawing her woollen shawl around her the church tower had appeared above the trees i looked at her worried i thought to take it somewhere he might not normally go was that wrong the secret shed said earlier is in making him want to do it he has no care for how you regard him will show no real love for any of us only need which is not the same he feels only for himself and ofttimes its hard not to think the worst of him not she said if it proves something to you but i saw she was anxious once you understand you can feel only pity the pity that you know hell never feel for you you cant teach him to obey commands like a dog because a dog wants to please and he doesnt care you have to know when to catch his attention and point it at what you seek what he was seeking now on brynglas hill was an earthbrowned thigh bone anna ceddol had presented it to me while he was outside his favourite bone the first he found here a few feet from our door i could never take it to be reburied because he wont be parted from it sometimes he holds it next to him as he sleeps id asked her what she wanted me to do with it and shed bid me take it and hide it anywhere then come back which was what id done it had felt unreal walking through the mist carrying a thigh bone before me like a talisman to leave in a place where id felt it would be in the care of a higher presence returning to the bryn id heard his vixen scream and the angry toppling of wood from the fireside pile and wondered how anna ceddol could go on living with this year upon year he was already near as tall as her would soon be bigger a grown man with a grown mans urges and living alone with his sister dear god in heaven when hed registered that the bone was gone id watched him running from the hovel hands clawed face contorted in rage staring at me with a clear and focused hatred anna ceddol watching him impassive used to this his humours changing faster than clouds in a windy dawn we stood and watched his red hat bobbing in the grass do you never go to town mistress when ive something to sell you have no cart no horse nor stabling for one no need horses wont rest at the bryn ewes wont graze chickens escape when i go to town we walk its not far on a fine day why wont animals live here at the bryn id have thought youd know master ill put it another way then how can you live here youre clearly an educated woman how came you here i she bit her lip her hair was not braided this morning and the breeze blew it back i drew breath her beauty unnerved me you dont have to tell me i said beg mercy she said i called you master its doctor isnt it you treat the sick also i treat nobody and nothing i said and cure even less the doctorates something i picked up in the course of a long education which will never finish no she said i dont have to tell you anything tomos ceddol her father had laboured on her grandparents farm good looking and her mother had fallen for him and determined to marry him against her own fathers wishes annas mother had been the youngest of six had tomos ceddol expected some kind of dowry had he expected to be rich wed to a big farmers daughter whatever he was soon embittered not a good marriage anna ceddol said and my mother as soon as i could understand was telling me i must never make the same mistake to marry below me my father had to go farther away to find work my grandfather wanted nothing to do with him while he was away my mother taught me to read secretly if hed known hed have beaten her and then my mother died of the summer plague and we were left alone with him how old was your brother very young we didnt know then that he wasnt as he should be some time had passed before it became clear that siôn was not as other children crying in the night that didnt stop nor pissing his bed his sister washed his sheets daily and made more in secret or her father would have had him sleeping on straw soon tomos ceddol was become ashamed of his son could not bear to look at him spent as much time away from the house as he could hed come home drunk so as to get to sleep he said but ofttimes the noise was too much hed awake in a tearing rage and hurt siôn one night he took him out to the barn i found him kicking my brother where he lay and i pulled him away and he hit me until i knew not where i was the next day i loaded a handcart and took my brother away where could you go she shrugged kept on walking until we were too far away for my father to find us id robbed him see she looked at me eyes wide open and unmoving took all the money he had in the house well hed no cause for complaint it would have cost him more if wed stayed where was this where did you live a good distance away youll excuse me dr dee for not saying where if he hasnt drunk himself to death in a ditch by now i dont want him finding us did you know by then of siôns qualities she shook her head we came down the border village to village for some years for some time i had work caring for the small daughters of a widowed gentleman who paid a village woman to look after siôn by day it seemed a good situation until i learned that i was expected to marry him he was older than my father and i anyway it was back on the road until the money was all gone i waited then another rich man took us in looking at her was it any surprise all the rich men would be waiting in line he gave me money and offered me a house to live in in presteigne generous i said it was a good dwelling behind one of the clothing workshops too good to be given without demands on my time they were walking out of town when a man and his family stopped and gave them a ride on their stock cart pedr morgan shepherd of pilleth returning from taking fat lambs to market theyd spent the night in his stable shed asked if there was anywhere she might find work and somewhere to live for a while the rest is of small import save that it took time the people here are slow to befriend a stranger but at least there are no rich men save master price rich men have not been good for me nor poor men it sounds like except for pedr morgan who had lost his finest fleecing shears must have fallen off the cart in one of the fields he had no idea which been searching for a fortnight and more taking annas advice hed shown his old pair to siôn ceddol who had found the missing shears within an hour within a week hed found two new springs in the hillside wells were sunk the ceddols given food and offered dry barns to sleep in and then anna ceddol had happened upon the bryn where nobody wanted to live and could be hers for nothing and then siôn ceddol had found the thigh bone the first of hundreds of body parts wheres he gone i said all the time shed been talking the red hat had been bobbing above the yellowing grass no sign of it now he wont be far away she said where did you put the bone you might as well tell me i told her id gone up to the little church finding it empty and then walking around the side had come upon oh jesu anna ceddol said already she was running up the hill lifting her skirts her breath coming hard i caught her up mistress it was the best test of him i could think of a place hes not used to going a place he might avoid though quite close i needed to know how i thought you understood it was almost a scream the most emotion id seen her show and made me sick to my heart listen i said running alongside of her panting please i think i do understand i think your brother possesses rare natural skills of a kind which are yet fully explicable by emerging science id like to to help him develop them thats not possible she stumbled on the mist gathering more densely around us her head was lifted to the obscured sky and her lips were moving in what looked to be rapid prayer as we came up to the churchs grey walls the tower was darkly garlanded in mist which seemed to hide no sun trees bending away into the sloping churchyard a cawking of crows and ravens intimate in the fog and mingled with them a kind of liquid wailing which sent anna ceddol sobbing in relief forward in a rush to follow the church wall to the holy shrine of our lady of pilleth id been in a hurry when id brought the bone and now saw the shrine and holy well as if for the first time the greenslimed rocks the steps down to the springfed pool the stone wall built around it making it look like an open tomb on her ledge against the church walls the mother of our saviour was smirched by the grime of neglect abandoned behind the body of the church almost certainly older in its origins the shrine of the holy virgin had been given back to nature and the bone given back to siôn ceddol he sat with his legs overhanging the pool rocking from side to side the dripping thigh bone in his arms a gurgling in his throat he could i suppose have found it by accident but why would he even come this way and id hidden it close to the edge of the well where bushes concealed the shallow water and covered it over with silt and sodden leaves it was conclusive enough for me i turned to his sister i do understand him i know what he does as if this were all that mattered oh the blindness of science i went down to the holy well where rough steps sank towards the water the mist gathered above it like a soiled veil siôn ceddol clutched his bone to his chest and looked up at me as though hed never seen me before and snarled his face twisting like to a gargoyles and then he makes mockery of god christ no turning slowly to see the rector in his long black coat everything happening as though darkly ordained for my undoing he is a walking blasphemy matthew daunce said anna ceddols eyes closed her shoulders falling the shawl dropping to her elbows oh dear god oh christ what had i done what had i set in train here no i said you know not what youre saying i stood up mistress ceddol its best if you go and the boy her eyes moved from the rector to me and she took the boys arm and pulled him to his feet he writhed and she held him and the bone and dragged him away and looked at me please i said go you also the rectors face was a ball of white light in the mist now i know who you are you are not wanted here youre filled with dark sprites the filth oozes from you i said nothing watched the ceddols backing away anna dragging the boy with his thigh bone bumping off the trees leaving me staring into the rectors pointing rigid finger go with your whore and her demonic sibling his forefinger twisting as if to bore a hole between my eyes go on before i call upon the lord god to hurl you out no i said the word emerging fainter than id wanted for i found i had no breath could almost see it leaving me fading into the mist as from the woods below the church the horrific faerie vixen shriek of siôn ceddol tore the morn into dark strips xxxiii the single eye dudley has tried several times to meet the single eye of prys gethin determined to send back the curse to its source by force of will like most of those around the queen hes seen the advantages in a mild study of practical magic and is prepared for an exchange of black chemistry across the already tense courtroom but never once does he entrap the welshmans gaze gethin stands limply in a corner of the prisoners dock which is close to the centre of the courtroom hands manacled behind him two armed guards his companions in the wooden pen the jury seated along the wall to his right access to the court not surprisingly is limited dudley has gained his place by following roger vaughan into the attorneys enclosure five of them in there with their books of notes hard to see what function they each perform but the judge will have his reasons sir christopher legge is nothing if not coldly efficient and such men as him dudley freely admits are necessary the law is not about humanity already the roughbeamed former barn has taken on an air of london banners are hung on the wall behind the judges bench of green oak reflecting the queens majesty a royal authority something to be feared yet its all too big for this petty affair and dudley is tormented with suspicion the judges bench rises several feet higher than the attorneys to its right and the seats to its left which soon begin to be occupied by a handful of men who vaughan says are the jps from radnorshire and neighbouring counties come to see how its done dudley whispers how real justice is administered certainly no one will have seen it done like this before vaughan tells him a trial here rarely takes longer than half an hour twenty cases might be heard in a morning im thinking this will go on most of the day gods bollocks dudley thinks only a royal trial matches this he draws in a steadying breath and tries again to catch the eye of prys gethin but gethin is looking down his face without expression has he been tortured dudley wonders for the names of his fellow brigands in plant mat is he cowed from a night of beatings nothing evident outside the sound of a massing of people a dull roar but in here the public gallery along the back wall is big enough only for about two dozen dudley marking one of them at once thomas jones of tregaron why is this bastard here whats his interest who let him in what have they told you vaughan im a child in this they tell me nothing only ask me questions about local matters and how people feel about them they are at one end of the attorneys bench and vaughan glances warily towards the other where one of the older lawyers might only appear to be consulting his notes dudley gets the message and keeps quiet observing a man in a bishops mitre attended by two clerics entering through the main doors and approaching the bench where two men in dark robes are arranging large books before the judges throne the bishop inclines his head and hell its john scory of hereford theyve brought the bishop of hereford here to represent god whose judgement is yet final of course in an english court as if to confirm this the morning sun at last breaks through filling one of the high windows and the air shimmers with dust motes the bishop goes out again a robed usher enters calls for silence and for every man to stand and theres a communal shuffling and then sir christopher legge slips in through a small gothicpointed door behind the judges bench only after the prayers to a just god are delivered and the charges read out is prys gethins redstubbled chin seen to rise from his chest and through witchcraft did bring about the deaths of thomas harris and hywel griffiths in the county of radnorshire on the night of september th in the year of our lord there were other charges relating to the stealing of cattle enough on their own to stow gethin in the deepest cell for many a long year perhaps even hang him how do you plead master gethin legge barely glancing at the accused the sunbeams from the high windows create dusty cloisters in the air above the dock and the jury box a silence legge looking mildly irritated what have you to say master gethin if you wish to make plea in your own tongue we have an interpreter glancing at roger vaughan prys gethin looks the judge full in the face ill not require an interpreter my lord having spent considerable time in england i plead not guilty to all charges legge nods what else would he expect the prisoner clears his throat and if i may be permitted to say at this early stage my lord my name is not gethin but gwilym davies gentleman farmer of carmarthen something ive been trying to tell your minions who seem strangely predisposed not to listen dudley sits up hard and for just a moment his eyes meet the prisoners one eye where he sees laughter flaring like raging flames xxxiv adversary such was the density of the fog now it was as though the rector and i were set in wax his body was like to a scarecrows but his face shone as marble i looked at him and saw an effigy from a tomb dressed in castout apparel and his eyes were lit id swear with madness the air was grown thick as a damp grey blanket around the forlorn shrine the walls of the church were now as far as i could see shivering in my cheap jerkin i felt that this was no longer a normal autumnal mist but a fogging of the senses i breathed in its bitterness and spoke with insistence let me tell you about siôn ceddol there is nothing his voice coming back at me like a horsewhip that you can tell me about siôn ceddol nothing that will change my opinion of him as an inhuman carrier of demons who should never have been born into this world youre wrong who are you to tell me what siôn ceddol does i said religion has no bearing upon it religion has a bearing on everything are you a fool as well as well as what standing at the top of the steps where siôn ceddol had sat my breath was coming harder if a place of healing is a place of inherent power there was no sense of healing here now only the power and that was a cold power with none of the promise of transcendence implied by an old sacred site within the quaking mist i was aware of an ancient conflict shafts of darkness and light twisting like blades as well as what i said quietly say it i shall not you know what you are and appear to live with it but i dont have to i do not have to tolerate your presence here get yourself away from my church conjuror there i said that wasnt so hard was it get out of here his narrow body jerking in fury elongating like a shadow no i said not before i tell you the truth about siôn ceddol hed turned away from me so that i was speaking to his back how much do you know about water divining of the devil he told the fog i shook my head with confidence a human faculty known since early times which may soon be explained by science but only now are scholars finding it can be applied to more than the finding of water though the fact that siôn ceddol can find water as well as bones is surely proof that hes riddled with demons dont waste my time i would not give up spoke to the rectors back about the great natural philosophers paracelsus whom hed have heard of as a healer even if he disapproved and the german georgius agricola of whom he probably would be ignorant this is the man whos become the best known diviner in europe who began with water but then extended his art to finding metals and ore for mining using the same fork of hazel which twisted and turned in his hands when he stood over an underground spring id learned about agricola at louvain and of course had tried it myself to no avail before sending a report on it to cecil suggesting he might strike a bargain with one of the german experts to establish a mining enterprise in england cecil had seemed interested but id heard nothing since and assumed hed dispatched spies to europe in the hope of acquiring the knowledge for no cost you dont see it do you daunce said you do not see the obvious a demon enters a man and gives him knowledge he could not otherwise possess causing his limbs to move on their own snatching his body from the reins of his mind ive watched that creature seen its eyes go white as its hands burrow in the earth to bring up the dead its becoming known that the mind can be attuned to whatever it needs to unearth and what if there is no mind his rage throwing him back to face me the brain of that monstrous boy will ever be in ruins and ruins are where demons walk unchecked turning away his head again in contempt it was like talking to the rocks but at least id told him what i believed to be the truth maybe hed think about it though probably he wouldnt i said wearily what are you doing here daunce you hate this place you distress its people theyre not theologians eager to embrace the rigid tenets of lutherism theyre not going to change their ways with a snap of the fingers the word of god will change their ways it had long seemed to me that the word of god as filtered through a puritans rigid liturgy would change nothing for the better i thought of the boy who hanged himself because he could see no future here who might normally have gone to his priest for advice and the old man who did go to daunce with his fears of night walkers and was told it was the devil making him see what was not there i said does bishop scory know of your way of thinking but if i thought to put him in fear scory that heretic a man who worships the lewd and the sacrilegious in a secret chamber in the cathedral itself i realised he must mean scorys treasured map of the world scory himself having said some canons had been in fear of it and wanted it burned daunce unsurprisingly must have been one of them i didnt pursue this but id not give up what progress can we ever make if we put everything we dont understand at the door of the devil if a man sees the ghost of his dead wife and we tell him that was not your wife that was an image wrought by the devil to torment you the truth is not always easy to face he said calmly but faced it must be and there can be no ghosts of the dead because the lutheran faith has decided theres no purgatory all papist myth and must be revealed as such stripping away these fondly held archaic beliefs is bound to cause a small period of pain before the clear light is seen well of course hed see it as a challenge a mission slicing through all the layers of the place with the clean cold butchers blade of the new puritanism i glanced at the statue of the virgin in her grotto in the rocks above the water marking the green slime on her brow and her robes all smirched with slugtrails and dead insects whatever power was here now the virgin was no longer the source of it you cant be said to have taken care of her rector he didnt look at the shrine or i dont think he did his eyes were no more than smudges in the fog a papist conceit perpetuating an old evil id have it smashed maybe i will ill certainly be erecting a barrier to keep people away let the brambles and thorns do the rest isnt she the reason for this church our lady of pilleth a silence and then he eyed me a slight smile on his dry pale lips and who is she who is the lady who do you think she is can you not feel her i said nothing ive never felt her so strongly our lady of slime dear god i found here a long tradition of dark worship which had never been challenged this well was made by the old britons doubtless in veneration of some predatory water goddess they would have performed sacrifice here thrown the heads of their enemies into the pool i could only nod this married with my own findings from old english manuscripts the papists take a pagan well daunce said and claim it for the virgin and nothing changes because the practices of the catholic church like those of the heathens like those of the druids are founded upon magic and sorcery you of all people should know that well of course i knew that bishop scory knew that the queen herself would acknowledge that high magic was a ceremonial gateway to knowledge and was a simpler magic so wrong for a place like this the valley of the river of the god of light dotted with ancient mounds scattered with the remains of the violently killed a place where a careful balance must needs be maintained i presume you know that owain glyndwr worshipped here before the battle daunce said in his desperate need for a great victory but did he worship at the church no he burned it down he worshipped here at the pagan shrine glyndwr invoked the heathen goddess the devil in other words i said nothing given owain glyndwrs knowledge of magic and that he or rhys gethin appeared to have chosen this site for the conflict id come to a not entirely dissimilar conclusion myself but was disinclined to voice agreement with anything this man came out with invoking the power of satan daunce said and it was given to him his name was exalted all over europe for a while the devils favours last only so long as youre probably already finding out i was feeling very cold now in my thin jerkin with no hat but felt that daunce was not that he was in some twisted way beginning finally to relish this encounter he came closer to me his coat hanging limp around him like damp and blackened leaves and they worship here yet this socalled holy well dedicated to the virgin mary whos but a screen around the heathen goddess is yet a shrine to evil for ive seen i have seen them anointing themselves here at night in the heathen way who if id gone close enough to see they would have set on me and killed me god told me this ive heard gods voice in the night how do you know it was gods voice youd try and make me doubt it his whole body shaking youd make me out a madman father daunce youre alone in a place you dont understand and maybe never will youre prey to divers fears and fancies you believe everyones your enemy ive only one enemy though he wears many faces and im looking into one at this moment asking myself is it a coincidence that englands most famous sorcerer should arrive here now the adversary i reeled back adversary oh i was warned in my prayers that one would come id thought it was the demon inhabiting the boy but its a subtler devil a manifestation of one thats been here for generations dee ddu black all black as sin his face was blanched and his lips were parched i began to see where this was going rector youre your grandfather was he not bedo ddu who filled the font with wine no sacrilege worse than that at the baptism of a child when all evils expelled it was done in merriment it and the tainted wine flowed in the blood of your father who went on to steal from the church jesu whod told him that what had i walked into but it found its full flowering the rector folded his arms as if sitting in judgement in his heretical son so close now i seemed to see a white light in his eyes who stood trial for sorcery and was saved by satan in the guise of a papist monster who made him his chaplain bonner are you yet a priest of the papist church dr dee hed done his studies and found the most vulnerable part of my skin there was nothing i could say that would not make this worse how easy it must be to see everything in black and white but there was no black here and no white the mist would tell you this his finger came up let not this place be tainted by your presence take yourself away from here while you can crawl back to your london lair and when the welshmans sentenced ill visit the sheriff and have charges of witchcraft brought against the monster and his sister the great papists whore what theres no workable witchcraft law in this country i said the plant mat case was only set in train because it was an accusation of murder by sorcery and two men were dead theres been no murder here only a mass slaughter a century and a half ago a silence then daunce walked away turning back to face me only when he reached the church wall i think he said we both know better than that and what lies in an ancient grave i rose up would have raced after him grabbed him maybe thrown him in the pool but what use would that do the balance was tipped against me he knew about the mutilated man secretly buried by stephen price and morgan the shepherd and he was mad enough to loose a witchhunt upon pilleth a weight of weariness came over me and i sank to my knees in the mud xxxv the etiquette of cursing the prisoner says they told me my name was prys gethin he sounds bewildered as if the name has no significance for him the judge leans back in his oaken chair who did the gaolers at new radnor castle my lord when they overpowered me and took me to new radnor kept telling me my name was prys gethin they did all the time prys gethin would not have it any other way the court billows with whispers which are only hushed when the pikes are lifted and sir christopher legge turns his anvil head under its triangular black hat towards the prisoner so you accept that you were the man taken to new radnor castle by the sheriff and constables i do my lord but enough you have pleaded not guilty to the offences with which you are charged and thats all the court wishes to hear from you until the case against you has been heard you will therefore be silent until then is that understood the prisoner nods his head with dudley notes conspicuous courtesy and a certain grace the clever bastard it could be that his real name is indeed gwilym davies that hes known only within plant mat as prys gethin it ought to change nothing he glances at vaughan who looks a touch apprehensive as though wondering if theres any way he might be blamed for this oversight evan lewis the sheriff is called to give evidence he is a bulky brownhaired man who unsurprisingly appears slightly in awe of the london court visited upon presteigne legge has before him the sheriffs written account of what occurred when the farm workers who had lain in wait for many a long night finally surprised the band of cattle raiders and how did they know sheriff that these cattle thieves were the brigands calling themselves plant mat the eyes of evan lewis flicker from side to side with transparent uncertainty dudley casts his own gaze to the ceiling despairing of the quality of men responsible for upholding the law in these distant counties they just wait in line these farmers for their turn at being sheriff perhaps the judge says helpfully these brigands were known to boast about their activities in local taverns determined to perpetuate their legend exacly my lord the sheriffs body sags in his gratitude thats as i believe yet in the end only this one was apprehended how many others escaped hard to say my lord could have been a dozen or more but they were fortunate that the one made lame by a fall readily identified himself to them as the leader prys gethin how very generous of him my lord this was to open the way for a bargain he said his fellows would pay handsomely for his release and if he was freed they could count on their land being safe from raids in the future while if anything was to happen to him the sheriff pauses and looks around the court then every man whod laid hands on him would be cursed to hell a communal indrawing of breath in the courtroom the judge holds up papers i have here statements taken down from four of the farm men which confirm what the sheriff has just told the court i see no point in having each of them read out but they are available for inspection signed with the marks of the named individuals whom i understand sheriff were reluctant to appear before this court in person my lord these are men who fear for their lives and their families that they might be made targets of plant mat dudley smiles at legges affected faintly gallic pronunciation of the words plaunt met and also they fear his eye the sheriff says his cheeks turned a little pink legge peers in an exaggerated fashion towards the prisoners dock laughter from the jurys box the prisoner looks down so legge says what was the response to this offer of a bargain the sheriff straightens his back the landowners were summoned from their beds and would hear none of it my lord no one should make deals with notorious thieves they had him tied to a cart and taken to new radnor calling in at my farm where i was roused and realising the importance of this arrest sent at once for constables and while you were waiting for the castle dungeons to be unlocked and prepared i gather there was intercourse between the prisoner and the landowners thomas harris and hywel griffiths my lord roger vaughan comes hesitantly to his feet its um its pronounced howell what is hywel griffiths my lord pronounced howell i just thought very useful im sure master vaughan legge says with venom let us proceed vaughan sits down eyes closing in embarrassment dudley smiles legge pretends to have lost the thread of his questioning and consults his papers turning back a page how would you describe the nature of this intercourse between the prisoner and the owners of the cattle hes accused of attempting to steal well heated my lord the prisoner having failed to make a deal for his release tried to escape and was restrained it was then that he uttered curses hmm legge pinching his sharp chin consider for a moment your use of the word curses in the heat of the moment a man might shout abuse no my lord this was delivered in what i can only describe as cold blood you were witness to it indeed i was my lord i saw and heard all of it although my welsh having fallen away in recent years i was not able to understand every word youre saying that the alleged curses were phrased in the language of the welsh they were with finger pointed under a full moon which is said to give more power to yes yes i believe we shall shortly be hearing more expert testimony as to the ah etiquette of cursing was any of it delivered in the queens english enough to convince me of the nature of it which was that my neighbours thomas harris and hywel griffiths would be dead before the new moon and indeed there seems little doubt that both men were no doubt at all my lord in ways unexpected one of a sudden fever hardly uncommon in itself sheriff the other drowning when a sudden ferocious wind smashed an old and narrow footbridge over the river irfon as he was crossing it you were not there at the time i take it i was not however i was summoned within hours after the dead body was recovered from the river my home is but a few miles away see and i can testify that this particular day was one of an unusual stillness not a breath of wind in the radnor forest the judge nods extracting a paper from the pile before him i also have a statement here signed by the son of master hiewell griffiths flinging a cold glance at poor vaughan giving testimony that he was at that time burning twiggery from a treefelling not two fields distant from the point in the river where his father met his death and felt no hint of a breeze saying the smoke from his fire rose steadily throughout the morning strong evidence dudley thinks in the absence of a specific witchcraft act cases of causing injury or death by force of magic are become difficult to prove given her own interest in magic and alchemy bess might dither for years over this issue meanwhile the power of malevolence conjured through focused thought and satanic ritual will go unchecked dudley who more than once has felt himself to be the target of a distant hatred made toxic by dark arts is himself convinced that prys gethin or whoever else he claims to be does indeed have a stare of practised malignancy through that one eye and dudley also knows that where the use of magic is concerned a sense of selfbelief takes the practitioner more than halfway along the shadowed road he stares hard at prys gethin look up you bastard look up these two deaths sir christopher legge says how far apart were they in time the prisoner makes no move his head is bowed as if for the rope as the sheriff replies my lord the fever struck the night before the collapse of the bridge a hiss rushes round the old barn as if a cold river has been directed through it i think the judge says over it that it is incumbent upon this court to learn more about the practice of witchcraft along this border after our midday meal i shall call the lord bishop of hereford to give evidence in the meantime sheriff perhaps you might enlighten me as to the significance for this county of the name prys gethin xxxvi in dark arts john scory has removed his mitre and wears a small hat of an academic kind he takes the oath with a knowing halfsmile legge consults his papers then sits back in his big chair and looks up my lord bishop you are i believe my last witness scory looks perturbed not the last ever i trust sir christopher one would hate to think the fear of a welsh curse might drive you from the bench legge scowls dudley grins he rather likes scory a bishop in perhaps his last see who gives not a whit for anyone least of all an ambitious judge from london the light in here has gloomed since midday the banners fading into shadow the old barns beams and pillars giving the court the illumination of a forest clearing the judge starts again youve been bishop of hereford since last year legge frowns he evidently thought it was longer but in that time scory tells him ive studied in some detail the religious beliefs and practices on the fringes of the diocese by which you mean the area in which we now sit and some regions further west youre saying that beliefs in this area may differ in some ways from the accepted faith of the land only in the way that faith might be interpreted scory says wales and the border country are not noted as areas of religious rebellion but old beliefs die hard legge waits now dudley begins to see where the judge is going with this hell have the court presented with clear proof that wales is yet riddled with witchcraft and that its entirely reasonable to suppose that a man like prys gethin was schooled in dark arts it should make for an entertaining hour or so dudley has eaten passably well in the bull drained a flagon of the innkeepers finest cider and then emerged to find the whore amy waiting for him in the marketplace telling him that if he comes to her after courts out she may well be able to point him towards the man he seeks perfect with any luck they could be out of here on the morrow with the wigmore shewstone all packed away he has the money and the menace if required as it usually is coming out here scory says was a rather bewildering experience for someone used to softer climes i found things remarkably different from chichester in the southeast where i was bishop in in earlier times there for most people worship was seen primarily as essential preparation for the life which is to follow and is it not my lord bishop a suitably pious consternation creasing legges brow oh most certainly it is my lord scory says however in the wilder country worship and ritual are seen also as serving a practical purpose in the surviving of this life isolated country people depend far more than do we upon a relationship with the land and its elements perceiving themselves closer to the ah spirits which under god maintain the fertility of crops and stock and hold the seasons in place legges eyes close in upon the blade of his nose spirits country people inevitably are closer to what you may prefer to think of as the elements of nature not as close as our ancestors might have been but closer than most city people can imagine few have not had some experience of natural powers which have raised them up or more often reduced them to fear for their livelihoods and life itself scory pauses casts his gaze around the rustic courtroom as though it were become his cathedral the air is clouded in here now but not dark enough for candles my point is that they are constantly aware of the fragility of their lives and why a balance must be found and held and in finding this balance are ofttimes inclined by instinct to mingle the rituals and liturgy of the modern christian church with the timehonoured customs of the area which some may see as witchcraft but these simple folk what are you saying bishop the judge demands irritably that witchcraft is so deeply embedded in the religious practices of these counties that it goes unrecognised as heresy and blasphemy scory beams precisely my lord were every man or woman who practises what we might consider a form of witchcraft to be brought before a court most villages would be left derelict and the land untilled legge sits up his chair creaking this testimony has not taken the path which he or dudley would have wished and what of curses as old as time and in your experience of this area can curses yet kill in my experience scory wrinkles his nose a countryman believing himself cursed will ofttimes curl up and die you are saying the curse works i believe that in the right circumstances some curses do indeed work especially as i say if a man knows himself cursed if he falls ill hell be inclined to believe the curse is come upon him and the inflictor of the curse may issue it with this intent indeed scory says gazing into the air however i confess id find it rather harder to explain how such a man may seek to persuade let us say a bridge that its timbers are fatigued to the extent that the said bridge gives up its struggle against collapse just as the recipient of a curse is passing over it probably a gap in my occult knowledge my lord which i must needs address silence and then the sound of laughter which dudley is dismayed to discover comes from his own throat scory retains his solemnity as the laughter spreads in slow ripples through the court thank you legge says coldly i have no more questions for this witness and will shortly adjourn this hearing for a period to consider all the evidence before addressing the jury he glances disdainfully at the prisoner who yet stands as though a noose is already in place dudley eyes the doors no better time as the judge prepares to rise for a rescue attempt legge delves among his papers but before i adjourn i had considered giving the prisoner an opportunity to speak for himself on the understanding that it would be in english but now see no need for this however a written statement has been presented to the court by the prisoner writing in the name of gwilym davies the substance of which i shall now disclose the judge tells the court that the man calling himself gwilym davies and professing to be a farmer of carmarthen claims that on the night in question he and his fellows had driven a herd of black cattle to the london markets and were returning through radnor forest when they were set upon in darkness believing their assailants to be murderous robbers they fled legge said but davies being lame was captured and thrown into a cart being much beaten about by men who he says gave no evidence of being officers of the law he admits to subjecting them to a tirade of abuse after one of them spat into his empty eyesocket he denies issuing a formal death curse claims he the judge sniffs would not know how to in the dock the prisoner is nodding very slowly what unmitigated shit if there was anyone more practised in the art of cursing than this oneeyed man dudley has yet to encounter him deserves to dangle for these lies alone he also repeats his assertion legge continues that the name prys gethin was pressed upon him by his captors this being a name which as the sheriff has told us is calculed to spread a particular fear in this area of the borderlands the judge smiles thinly and sceptically before adjourning the hearing for two hours an extraordinary amount of time for such a petty case dudley thinks he leaves the court and walks down to piss in the river only wishing he could have taken the stand himself and declared how the man had cursed him here in the marketplace without a second thought the malevolence springing fullformed to his lips as if directed from some outside force but then what nest of wasps might dudley have kicked if he were to have given evidence as master roberts the antiquary walking back up the street in the dimming afternoon he marks a tall woman in a dark green cape gliding towards him from the centre of town by the finery of her apparel alone it can only be the whore calling herself amy they draw level in the marketplace now filling with people awaiting the conclusion of the trial that will scratch a twentyyearold itch the piemen gathering amy smiles reaches up quite openly and touches dudleys cheek now my lord the title delivered in a coquettish mocking way but dudley still cant help wondering if she knows who he is all the men of influence she must bed and introducing herself as amy could that enough shes a woman dudley can handle women you can take me to him now he asks of course then im in your hands time for that as well if were quick amy says xxxvii falling away i must have gone stumbling down the path like a hunchback and the hunch was brynglas hill itself and all the weight of worship piled upon it one religion grinding against another the fog before me lit with frictive sparks why is it that all faiths founder upon the jagged rocks at their extremities towards the foot of the hill the fog thinned to a mist again before revealing a sky of ambergrey and the smoke from the pilleth fires which i hurried towards and then cried out as the path crumbled before me losing my footing and the land was all atilt then came the shock of cold water treacherous mud had flung me headlong into a brown stagnant puddle god damn i lay soaked twisted and dazed close to weeping in frustration like an infant jesu what was i become the adversary truly ive never in my life wanted to challenge god only to understand some small part of his mind is that the worst kind of heresy blinking away the dirt in my eyes i thought for a moment that i saw my tad with that expression of both sympathy and scorn which all good fathers wear when a child falls and explodes into selfpitying tears and then found i was looking up into the calm weatherbrowned face of anna ceddol mistress coming at once redfaced and dripping to my feet brushing wet earth and slimed leaves from my sopping jerkin feeling more foolish than i could ever remember oh god mistress ceddol what have i done without thinking or more likely while thinking too much anna ceddol nodded towards the boy who was scrabbling among the damp ashes on the midden he does everything without thinking or at least not as we know thinking yet still achieved more than me for all my years of study a bookman who thinks only of how his learning might grow making him more of scholar but less of a man anna ceddol took my arm youre shivering come by the fire leading me inside the bryn where she propped three logs in conical shape upon the smouldering hearth drawing me towards the new flames it was coming anyway she said what was the rector sooner or later he was going to move against us he was only gathering kindling for his blaze we can stop him dont waste your time dr john ill find the sheriff tonight i said before daunce gets to him and bring stephen price down from the wall on your side hes halfway there cant deny the malady affecting the valley cant be the political man turning from the old ways if hes to have the rest of his life here he must needs face i knew not how to put it and fell back on prices own words he must needs face what is i said and that the pilleth ills will never be cured by a puritan whose answer to anything he doesnt understand is to condemn it as satanic and shut it out in that enclosure of firelight and shadows it was all very clear to me now i saw the shrine left to crumble and rot the holy well overgrown sucked back into the earth which gave out old corpses in profusion ill tell the bishop he has the wrong cleric i said yet i knew how hard it could be to remove a priest especially one who knew where a murdered mans body lay and who put it there i closed my eyes then opened them quickly what are you doing perhaps id gone rigid still lacking confidence in the close company of a woman especially when she was undoing my jerkin jesu theyll dry more quickly if you take them off mistress is this seemly peeling my shirt from my skin who can ever say does it matter drying my chest now with a cloth of sacking both her hands moving under it shed closed the door so the boy was shut out and also much of the light the smoke from the fire was sweetsmelling apple wood clouding the air with fragrance filling the head the hose i ill need your hose her long hands gently fumbling at my waist now im all wet too she said oh dear god these things happen anna ceddol said her voice small now i could barely draw breath in the dimness i saw her overdress falling away gave in to the smoke and the soft weight of a breast falling forward into my palm i slept it was a mistake when i awoke on the pallet amongst the rushes there was a smell of stew and herbs from the pot over the fire and the door was open to the dusk sitting up i marked my apparel hanging from a beam and anna ceddol fulldressed watching the boy playing with his favourite thigh bone on the edge of the hearth rolling it along the stones humming to himself like a drone of bees she smiled is it your wish to pass the night here dr john i cant im expected back at the bull in presteigne and i must needs find the sheriff thinking i could reach him through roger vaughan that vaughan would surely vouch for my sanity i stretched out my legs feeling warm and fulfilled in the simplest most physical sense she was only the second woman in this world id lain with and my life was turned over again i couldnt look at her without wanting her again wanting her forever how easy it is to fall into love yet i dont want to leave you i said im afraid of what the rector will do the rectors mad ive faced worse im not sure you have she looked at siôn ceddol rolling his bone from one side of the hearth to the other the eerie drone never ceasing people like to say hes of the faerie when he wants to find something the faerie tell him where it lies or the dead some say its the same thing that the faerie are the spirits of the dead i doubt that the mingling of spheres this i felt but what did i know i think the faerie are the essences of things the spirits of life in the land in the trees and the rivers and the rocks the rocks live some rocks you can see the life in them crystals its my aim to study this for myself make experiments i thought of the scryer brother elias in goodwife faldos hall how my attempts to observe and understand had led me only further into darkness and confusion the perceived shade grown from the shewstone that night the mention of bones drawing me at once to my guilt over benlow the glastonbury boneman when it might have been some strange foretelling of my encounter with siôn ceddol the trickery our minds perform and then i thought of something else that matthew daunce had said anna she was carefully detaching my jerkin and hose from the nail in the beams shaking them out as if they were apparel of quality rather than the rubbish i wore you neednt worry you mightve given me a child she said im barren i wasnt and glad of it ive been raped twice would have been three times but the third time i agreed and then he couldnt do it she took down the items of apparel and laid them by me on the pallet a young woman alone with an idiot boy its the least a man expects you cant go on i said you cant go on with this life i looked at siôn ceddol who seemed to have fallen to sleep with his arms around the bone with closed eyes he looked like any other boy and harmless come back with me i said to london with him she laughed theyd have him in bedlam before the week was out dont you see we can only ever live in places like this he has a skill an important skill i had a momentary crazed vision of presenting siôn ceddol to cecil as the only dowser id known who might be able to replicate the wonders of georgius agricola dont even think of it anna ceddol said the city would terrify him me as well were country people if he wanders out in the night here as ofttimes he does i know hell come to no harm what were you about to ask me i ached in my breast for her and the gloomed years ahead changing his rag every day washing the shit from him in the stream worst of all never letting him be alone with those his age particularly the maidens none of this would be so bad if she wasnt educated if she hadnt the wit to imagine what her life might have been i let go a sigh when daunce when he was in full abusive spate he spoke of you as the the great papists whore her eyes were like rock i nodded turning away from her beginning quickly to drag on my apparel its not true she said but it might have been i stopped dressing i think i told you of a rich man who offered me a home in presteigne id spent one night with him or half a night he gave me money hed been a monk at the head of a monastery john smart i stumbled half into my hose could hardly say the name he had a reputation she said even when in holy orders could not keep it in his robe i sat down on the stool by the fire to put on my boots shaking my head how could this woman consider herself so worthless that shed give herself to a man such as this even for one night siôn ceddol awake again came and sat on the rushes a few feet from me he was looking to the side of me where the tall stones rose like the remains of an ingle as if watching something he smiled he likes you anna said how can you tell thinking he hadnt liked me up at the holy well when he thought id stolen his thigh bone hes within a few feet of you she said and he isnt screaming the walls down where i didnt really want to ask her where was he when you were with smart there was a housekeeper a young woman she survived the night by plying siôn with sweetmeats my feeling was that she was one of several woman who worked for him and this was all in presteigne she nodded hes still there they say he pulls a good income from presteigne thats whats said only gossip but the same gossip from different ends of town yes hes there tell me while she told me what she knew and what shed heard of john smart and his dealings siôn ceddol gazed placidly into the smoke holding out his hands in it as though to accept a gift but conspicuously not from me his white hands swam up in the bluegrey smoke like flatfish and seemed to grasp something something heavy holding it up to look at it holding up nothing of a sudden there was no heat from the fire anna ceddol said quietly theres someone with you i stiffened the fire burned white the boy turned and picked up his beloved earthbrown thigh bone and laid it on the hearth and then pushed it forward as if he were offering it for inspection to whoever sat next to me and then sat back and waited as i shivered i should have gone then to stephen price told him what had happened this day some of it anyway but i couldnt face it needed some time to separate the truth from the madness besides i knew i had to reach the sheriff before daunce could get to him although i couldnt at this moment even remember his name i stole around to the stables at the rear of nantygroes and found my mare she knew me at once and was silent as i nuzzled her and saddled her and led her quietly out of the stable and down to the road id come back tomorrow by tomorrow i would have thought of something some way of persuading anna ceddol to return with me to london what did it matter to me that she was incapable of childbearing there was neither time nor money in my life for children i mounted up and followed the silvered ribbon of road with ease giving brief thought to what id do when we arrived at my mothers house how my mother would react to my appearance in mortlake with a beautiful woman and an idiot the truth of it i didnt care the moon rose close to full in the clearing sky and i felt hollow and sad and yet exalted wed covered the few miles to presteigne before i knew it the mare and i pounding the moonlit track as if she knew i was trying to shake something off someone even the mare knew something was wrong in presteigne starting and throwing back her head as the town houses sprang up to either side most of them with light inside even the poorer homes on the edge of town where youd have expected the families to settle down for their first sleep i dismounted and led the mare slowly toward the marketplace now abuzz with groups of people who spoke in low voices no piemen no merriment the town was aslant its balance altered the sheriffs building in darkness all the pitchtorches snuffed while only the inns were ablaze with hard light and the jagged air of a pervading rage xxxviii unholy glamour then i saw men with lanterns horses saddled men with swords strapped on and hard faces some gathered in small groups as if waiting for a leader i espied roger vaughan walking alone seeming to be going nowhere the white fattened moon illumined the sweat which spiked his hair and smeared his face like melted tallow he looked like a man newly claimed by the plague trying to absorb the awful knowledge of it ive just ridden from nantygroes i said whats vaughan shook his head blinking kept on walking until i could position myself and the horse in front of him he stopped by an abandoned stall the smell of fruit about it slippery skins underfoot i waved a hand at the crowd a hue and cry you could very well say that dr dee a young man came shouldering betwixt us sliding his sword in and out of its sheath shouting back at someone be dead before midnight if i finds him tell you that much boy whos he talking about you dont know if i knew the oneeyed man vaughan said gethin hell i took a step back hes escaped you could say that too what about all the guards his smile was crooked dr dee the damn jury freed him under the explicit guidance of sir christopher legge the jury was as good as ordered to acquit him of all charges and thats what they did a moment of waxen silence like when an ear pops the night took on a strange spherical quality as if id stepped out of it like a bubble forgive me the judge was sent from london with the specific purpose of convicting gethin that did seem to be the plan where is he wheres legge gone ridden out within minutes of the verdict with a small guard and no carts to delay them before the local people could storm the court jesu vaughan dont try to make sense of it dr dee there ent none wheres dud wheres roberts wouldnt know he was with me in earlier in court then where there was an adjournment while legge considered the evidence mabbe he couldnt get back in through the crush to hear the death sentence vaughan laughed dully bent and picked up a stray plum and hurled it at the nearest wall making a sucking phat death sentence he made gesture at the horsemen beginning to move off in groups they think to catch gethin on the road bring him back and have their own trial or mabbe just hang him theirselves they wont find him im guessing it was just young men with a need to turn anger into action the twentyyearold itch violently inflamed theyd rampage across the hills for an hour or two until the drink ran out and stagger back into town while the lights were gradually doused and the muttering about betrayal died until morning i pointed vaughan down towards the river and the church where it looked to be quieter tell me about this would you in detail he shrugged and followed me and the mare some of the ole boys are even saying the judge was bewitched he said the man known as prys gethin hed be well away back into the heartland even if the angry men of presteigne had caught up with him who among them would have risked his own life administering rustic justice to a man so firmly acquitted by the queens court vaughan leaned over the bridge barrier staring down at shards of the moon in the swirling waters of the river lugg the judge told the jury that a hundred years ago even fifty or less they wouldnt have had to think twice about their verdict but the world was in the throes of mighty change and such matters as witchcraft were become subject to new thought legge said that he must himself have undergone mighty change since the days when hed conspired with my enemies to get me burned for using dark magic against queen mary he said that the two principal witness were also the victims so called and therefore dead told the jury that as none of the men present had a proper knowledge of the welsh speech there was no evidence that a death curse had been delivered but that it was reasonable to suppose as implied by the bishop of hereford that being abused in welsh might have led thomas harris to believe that he was cursed the bishop of hereford scory scory as good as said that witchcraft was the religion of radnorshire as for the collapse of the bridge in a sudden high wind while there was much evidence of places nearby where there was no wind what testimony was there to show there had been a violent storm in such a confined area only one man could say for certain and he was drowned where did the story of the wind come from vaughan shrugged legge asked that to which there was no firm answer it was all round the villages at the time but they clearly couldnt find anyone to describe it to the court the truth is it was an old bridge the judge said the jury would have to decide whether it believed that bitter words spoken by one man could cause timbers in that bridge to weaken it to the point of collapse drawing here on the evidence of bishop scory why was scory even called ah vaughan pushed himself back from the bridge now that is of interest in itself ennit sounded like legged been expecting scory to paint a dark and damning picture of wales as a stinking midden of sorcery instead we heard of an almost benign heathenism which enmingled with the christian faith gave country folk their own practical religion which is true to an extent is it not aye course its true but it ent what you say to a court when youre bent on getting a bad man hanged a judge like legge i said never calls upon a witness without knowing in advance the nature of his testimony oh he was heard to try and prod scory back on to the path and then ending his testimony at a stroke when it was clear he wasnt gonner play ball but too late clever eh you think legge knew that scory would be showing witchcraft in a different light but pretended he didnt we had it all wrong from the start assuming he was sent here to make sure of a conviction which a local judge might be affeared to preside over when in fact he was sent to make sure of an acquittal but why well thats the big question ennit a few are saying it was done because the queen seeks to hold favour with the welsh the victims were welsh not as welsh as the accused its still against reason i said saving one man only to make an enemy of a complete county that makes not a whit of sense gotter be something we dont know ennit see even if legge hadnt brought half a jury with him he couldve turned it either way he could have asked why there were no statements from gwilym daviess fellow cattledrovers to support his story of returning from london and why were there not do you suppose because all of them knew that if the case went against gwilym they would have identified themselves as members of plant mat i nodded legge commented on the fact that neither the sheriff nor any of his constables were there when the ambush was laid wouldnt it be normal if a trap were laid to include constables the truth is that its a big patch and there ent enough constables to send out night after night week after week when theres no proof a raids to take place gethin couldve been convicted easily all the evidence was there and all the focus of legges questioning was upon conviction nobody was even called to say cattle had been stolen well none had theyd been discovered in the act ah cleverest piece of doubletwist i ever saw and the horses all saddled up in the street at the back i stood at the edge of the bridge what about you where does this leave you he shrugged i came down with legge i was his interpreter his guide to the thinking of radnorshire folk and he used what i told him oh hell aye used it to aim his final bolt at us right at the start the prisoner before he was shut up told the court they gave him the name prys gethin see his captors the sheriff who knows but legge in his address to the jury came back to that saying the name carried what he called an unholy glamour particularly in this county as if it had been introduced deliberately to give the capture of a common thief a significance it wasnt worth as if it was all a piece of elaborate theatre to heighten the status of presteigne as county town in the west see theyve ever resented it despising this place as an offcut from england i could see the logic here but why had legge become such an enemy of this town you had no opportunity to question if not legge himself then one of the other attorneys theyd cleared off within minutes of the verdict the guards and jurymen split up into pairs and took off separately me vaughan drew a rough breath two of the local boys had me up against a wall wouldve beaten the shit out of me if a couple of evans constables hadnt come over dragged them away hell look a fool too the sheriff aye nobodyll come out of this unsullied they think were all in it and half of wales here to see the humiliation a man was even pointed out to me as twm siôn cati the famous robber of the west and he got away with it too theyre laughing at us dr dee mabbe ill take the cowards way out on the morrow see the kin at hergest then ride back to london i sighed twm siôn cati is to marry my cousin hes a scholar now i um try not to think about his past he was silent a moment then he smiled no offence meant nor taken you believe gethin was wholly guilty i believe he was dr dee ive looked into the bastards eye i believe theres evil in him but then im a local boy xxxix property of the abbey green oak and clean new brick were aged by crowding shadows alleyways become caverns behind the gloss of commerce this was an old town with old ways we walked back towards a quietened market place where you could smell the pitch from the dead torches no lights in the sheriffs house hed be back in his farm the other side of radnor forest nursing his wounded reputation lights could yet be seen in the hills where the young men of presteigne pursued a quarry they must have known theyd never find i guessed it was become a game now prys gethin already become a phantom i said how did he get out of the court unmolested mabbe the same way they got the judge out vaughan stared ahead to where the castle mound loomed grey in the moonlight theres a yard at the back with a gate to an alley and back to the road out of town youd expect him to take one of the two roads west but who knows hed be safer in england tonight it deceives you this town i said so many alleyways so many hidden houses england welsh towns are simpler many of the houses and workshops were once owned im told by wigmore abbey much of the town was owned by the abbey vaughan said it was how a wool merchant like bradshaw could buy into presteigne so quickly grabbing the old abbey property from the crown as soon after the dissolution as deals could be done and is it possible i said that deals may have been done before dr dee a shout a man approaching us briskly out of the shadows forest dr dee john forest dudleys man who wed left behind in hereford to intercept any significant messages from london when the devil had he returned my master dr dee hes not with you no i havent seen him since this morning i had business at my familys home i i saw the serious gauntfaced forest glancing warily at vaughan who at once held out a hand for the reins of my mare take your horse to albarn dr dee mercy the ostler at the bull oh yes thank you hed yet go far this boy knew when to fade into shadow when we were alone forest placed a hand on his leather jerkin at the breast ive a letter here for my lord dudley from thomas blount his steward i know im given to understand that it he hesitated that is i think its of considerable import in relation to the continuing inquiries into the death of lady dudley youve been to the bull hes not at the inn although his horse is no one there i spoke to can recall seeing lord master roberts not tonight not this afternoon ive since been all over the town he was in the courtroom earlier then where in gods name is he gods bones dr dee this is lord dudley master of the horse forest smashed a fist into a palm i warned him tried to against this folly felt better when i saw all the armed men with the judge but now you know whats happened here be hard not to the place is collapsed into insanity do you have any idea where he might have gone hed be furious at the verdict i said hed want answers you think he went after the judge with one of the hunting parties i hadnt thought of that in normal circumstance dudley would have been leading them i dont know i spun around wildly hes less driven by impulse these days but you said his horse was still stabled at the bull of a sudden none of this looked good lets go back to there i said make sure he hasnt returned yet knowing he wouldnt be there thinking now of dudley telling me how the whore had implied she could put him in touch with abbot smart when hed told me i hadnt been too convinced but that was before id spoken with anna ceddol and drawn certain conclusions about the abbey property it took not long to find the narrow house in the alley dark workshops either side of it glass in its windows the moon in the glass john forest beat upon the door with a gloved fist then again louder and harder until an upstairs window set into a small gable was pushed open with some difficulty come back tomorrow her face was furrowed with shadows in the moonlight she pulled hair out of her eyes were looking for master roberts i said who master rob never heard of him you have the wrong door tall forest said not yet thirty years a fine handsome man such as you wont see around here too often then id remember go away you could hear the woman battling to close the window its iron frame grinding wait i shouted amy no reply but she left the window ajar your name is amy i said my name she said is mistress branwen laetitia swift ask anyone in this town you told master roberts your name was amy i said thoughtful now how came you by that name i never came by it for as ive just told to you its not my name now leave me alone youre both in your cups get off to your homes and sleep it off he came tonight didnt he you told him you might help him in his search for a man who was called john smart youre at the wrong house is master roberts in there still must needs we break down the door forest said holy mother do you want me to shout for a constable she turned her back to the window speaking to someone in the room not bothering to lower her voice you show them your face another half hour if you show them your face the face that came eventually to the window was plumpen whitehaired and stayed there not long i looked at forest i thought we could take it that dudley would not be in there with another man in her bed was he here earlier i asked the man were seeking i swear i know not what youre this house mistress was it once the property of the abbey of wigmore youre drunk to whom do you pay a portion of your earnings for its use i bid you goodnight masters the woman who was not called amy said and the window slammed and rattled amy forest said dudley told me that was what she called herself when he when he spoke with her she was lying of course she knew who we meant it all seemed less innocent now for the first time this night i began to fear for dudleys welfare we came out into the alley forest resting a hand on the hilt of his sword where now i was not confident about this but saw no other way i think the abbot himself xl paper kites with the younger men out on the hills the main parlour of the bull was only half full but the power behind the new presteigne was here its redveined faces flushed in the creamy light of stubby candles on a round board many a sideways glance for forest and me as we drank small beer served by the innkeeper jeremy martin whose agreeable manner was for once muted for i too had journeyed here with the judges company and my name would by now have been well blackened by my cousin nicholas meredith who sat amongst his elders and did not acknowledge me half a dozen of them all well dressed and drinking french wine forest and i took stools at the serving board and drank silently listening but our entry had dampened their discussion then the urgency of the situation broke upon me and i gave forest a nod he stood up i come from hereford with a letter for master roberts the antiquary im unable to find him does anyone here know where he might have gone nobody replied none of them said a word as if we might simply disappear if they made no response to us i looked at the innkeeper martin ent seen master roberts since he broke his fast off to the court he reckoned looks to me like the courts over john forest said with a unfortunate verdict for this town i said to the company at the candlelit board a heavyset man with crinkled grey hair set down his goblet his voice a reluctant weighted drawl an unfortunate verdict one might say for the superstitious by which you mean the local people we he said are the local people my name is john dee i said and you are bradshaw i nodded the wealthiest wool merchant in presteigne the owner of many of the onetime abbey properties half the townsmen are out on the hills i said thinking to recapture prys gethin what think you of that as a magistrate what im thinking master dee is that while we may not agree with the verdict no one can deny that the trial was good for the town never done better trade more lawyers than weve ever seen guards attendants every room taken at every inn better than a visit by the queen the lawyers he said sourly pay for their accommodation tell me i said as a man of stature here did you know how it might end did you have a meeting with sir christopher legge before the trial bradshaw sniffed your knowledge of the processes of the law seems somewhat lacking master dee my cousin nicholas meredith stirred his beard jutting anger deepening the lines of wear on his otherwise bland face you accuse his worship of irregular conduct is that what it sounds like cousin he rose why dont you just go back to london youve seen your fathers place of birth what else is here for you id hoped i said before i left to meet the former abbot of wigmore of whom i wrote in my letter to you and i told you i knew not where he was i placed both hands on the round board and i dont believe you cousin meredith turned to jeremy martin innkeeper this man offends me perhaps you might summon a constable i smothered laughter now i know i said that my mention of john smart was the main reason you were less than joyous at my arrival only gossip anna ceddol had said but the same gossip from different ends of town taking me back to the guarded words of bishop john scory as we walked by the wye the abbey owned most of it at one time and meredith owned the rest and now appears to own even more oh yes he might be a very good man to talk to having done business with smart i said around the time of the dissolution of the abbey have a care dr dee bradshaw said who does own this inn i asked meredith is it you of course its me in your own right or as his guise what im told is that the good abbot knowing what fate was to befall the abbey at the hands of lord cromwell might have sought to dispose of certain abbey property get yourself off my property meredith said conjurer by sale or rent before the axe as it were fell bradshaw grunted what drivel is this nothing got past cromwell divers deals were done in the confusion of reform i said deeds of property discreetly transferred ofttimes with the cooperation of the local gentry who told themselves they were only helping the true church from being plundered by the protestants the word is that abbot smart was already proficient in matters of finance after a while id guess it would not always be easy for the agents of the crown to work out precisely what the abbey owned especially out here wheres your proof of that bradshaw said for if you dont want to spend the night in the sheriffs dungeon the sheriffs gone home to sulk now listen to me although im good with numbers the fiscal side of them is not my country but im sure the office of sir william cecil scenting riches which should be in the queens treasury would waste no time in appointing accountants to unravel what we might call the discrepancies in presteigne there was a long silence tense as a bowstring what the hell kind of place was this where a disgraced former abbot could be running whores and collecting money for the tenure of houses hed corruptly removed from the ownership of the church i was aware that john forest had his hand upon his sword i had in truth never thought it might come to this i dont believe bradshaw said to meredith that this man knows anything i think he flies paper kites youll have noticed i said that i put my questions to you rather than the abbot himself knowing of his obvious need to walk in stealth in order to live a full life which for the lascivious former abbot must needs include a ready supply of womans crack throwing down the vulgarity like a stone into a placid garden pond watching bradshaw wince while deriving a little extra income from whorehouse takings i said what do you want i turned slowly the question having come from the serving board behind me wheres my friend ive already told you i know not where hes gone but id not previously seen the plumpen brownfaced innkeeper jeremy martin so far from a smile earlier he was with i think i have this right branwen laetitia swift one of your whores letty keeps her own affairs dr dee a clever woman whom men pay for more than her body which men not my affair martin said had i misheard or was his cheerful bordercountry accent fallen away no matter this was going not as well as id hoped what if these knaves truly had no knowledge of dudley i moved myself further away from the innkeeper so that i might see every man in the welllit parlour my cousin watched me in silence his face in collapse what must his thoughts have been when hed received my letter asking if he knew the whereabouts of the former abbot of wigmore and then when i arrived without warning a man with links at the highest level of government who might shatter his little world like poor glass but how dare the bastard point the finger at my father for the foolish and desperate sale of church plate in a time of dire need i stood up think on it i said if anything useful occurs to you well be in my chamber on the way out i looked at the hands of jeremy martin hands too plump and smooth to have spent years hefting barrels from a cellar thought of those hands on anna ceddol turned away xli personal dressmaker oh that was a mistake forest said and coming up here was an even worse one he went to the window pushed open the shutters to look down into the moonwashed mews no one there not even the ostler we can get out this way if needs be not much of a drop grab hold of the ivy youll be theyre merchants and dealers i said not men of violence forest swung round to face me such men live only for money and youve threatened their lifes income dr dee not to say their freedom even their necks youre alone in a strange town in the midst of nowhere if you fail to arrive back in london well anything couldve happened along the road thats what theyll say when nobody even finds your body he went to make sure the door of the bedchamber was bolted i recalled the parting words of john scory worth remembering that presteigne still has its share of dark alleys was all this well known or only to a circumspect and pragmatic bishop forest slumped back on to the truckle bed rubbing his eyes cold in here but he was sweating did i understand that aright its your opinion that the fat innkeeper is the former abbot of wigmore he didnt deny it did he gods blood forest was shaking his head hows he got away with it for so long its not as if hes invisible no better place to hide than in full view and if a mans added immeasurably to the prosperity of a town and all who live there a wall of silence will be erected about him a whoremaster too well qualified i said recalling bonner in the marshalsea poking maids and goodwives over quite a wide area if even half of what you came out with down there is true forest said its clear you cant lie here tonight nor anywhere in this town you have to get out and soon and i mean soon might be the best thing if you were to ride back with me to hereford after what about dudley after we make full sure that lord dudley is not here forest wiped sweat from his brow with a sleeve jesu how can he be away from here without a horse this looks not good dr dee is he robbed is he beaten is he what can we do you know this shithole better than me whereve we failed to search i think for a start we might open his letter no never im entrusted to bring it to him i say this not lightly what if it offers some possible reason for his disappearance or suggests something we might do somewhere we might look ive never opened my lords correspondence then ill open it i said i took a candle on a tray went out and fired it from the sconce on the landing glancing down the oaken stairs to the lower hall where another single sconce lit an oak pillar all was quiet down there too quiet maybe it made little sense at first there was a letter within a letter the outer and shorter of which was to dudley from his steward evidently written in haste and signed tb may it please your lordship i enclose correspondence recently discovered by sir anthony forster between the pages of a book in his library but not disclosed to the coroner whose inquiries were deemed to be completed i broke the inner seal and uncovered a bill of work from lady dudleys london dressmaker william edney for the alteration of two gowns well i knew of this from dudley one of the best indications that amy had been in relatively good heart within days of her death was her continuing interest in fashionable apparel the only other possible explanation was that shed wanted her corpse to be found well and elegantly clad attached to the bill was a note from edney on which some lines had been underscored in thick ink strokes presumably by blount my ladys personal dressmaker will attend upon her as arranged on the first friday of next month september it was dated august this to me was new there had been no suggestion of amy receiving any visitors on that last weekend there was another short note to dudley from blount which i read twice before passing the bill to forest who stared at it for some moments as if it might break into flames i opened my hands helpless i think you should read it all of it pushing the candle towards him did lord dudley have any idea that his wife was to be visited by a dressmaker two days before she died not to my knowledge can that be true i passed him the small paper attached to the bill my lord edney tells me that the personal dressmaker was unable to visit lady dudley being ill with a fever during the week of the appointment you will know of my ladys fondness for the spanish styles and it seems the personal dressmaker was a well qualified spaniard who had been in edneys employ these past five months and made other apparel for lady dudley but has since returned to spain i was therefore not able to establish the severity of his fever if fever there was during the first week of september forest looked up squeezing his darkbearded jaw what does it mean dressmaking is a regrettable gap in my knowledge what think you of blounts final sentence if fever there was it seems blount may have had cause to think that the dressmaker might have lied about his fever to cover the fact that he made that journey to cumnor after all perchance arriving i broke off to read the note yet again to be quite certain two days later than arranged forest thought on it longer than was necessary no one would know if that were the case he said at last the entire household having gone to the local fair the entire household having been virtually dispatched to the fair by lady dudley closing my eyes upon a hollow expulsion of breath it was all too clear that amy had gone to some considerable effort to make sure that shed be alone in the house that day for the visit of a spanish dressmaker for the purpose of him measuring her for a gown listen i forest was coughing from a parched throat i cant cant discuss this any further we should never have opened it was edney deceived by the spaniard we must needs consider the possibility of the spaniard acting independently of edney having feigned a sickness to cover his movements but maybe not independently of his country its king or his ambassador la quadra and others i could think of who were not spanish the implications were like to a blade in the gut and each name that arose in my mind was another savage twist forests face was yet a mask of bewilderment as i gave voice to the unspeakable why would amy have gone to so much effort to make sure she was alone in the house for the visit of a spanish dressmaker because as blounts letter says she knew him hed made gowns for her before she was fond of the spanish styles so how well did she know him stop forest cried out for christs sake dr dee go no further with this madness until we find lord dudley theres true darkness here darkness on every side well enough to wish to be alone with him we must needs leave this place without delay those bastards downstairs theyd rather burn it down with us inside a woman alone in someone elses house i couldnt stop now a woman whod not seen her husband for a year only heard the persistent rumour about him siring the queens child i pray you dr dee get out of here even as forest snatched up the letter and the bill bundled them together and thrust the packet inside his doublet a knock came on the door of the bedchamber one knock truly no more than a tap but in our present mood it had the impact of a mace a hiss issued from forest dont open it i said whos that my heart leaping at the thought that it might be dudley but there was no reply only the padding of soft footsteps i thought receding down the stairs but could not be sure i waited until i could hear nothing outside then brought the candle to the door as i drew back the bolt forest pulled his sidesword whispering open it no more than an inch keep your hand out of the opening stand hard against the door so i might slam it in a face but there was no face i peered through the widening gap the only movement was the flame from the sconce on the landing slanting in the draught from the opened door i went out lifting the candle into the corners no one there no one on the stairs nobody i said stumbling then as my left foot prodded something on the floorboards sending it skittering i crouched with the candle a sackcloth bundle no more than a few inches wide unexpectedly heavy i brought it back into the chamber and closed and rebolted the door placed the bundle on the board under the window in full moonlight careful forest laid his sword on the truckle pulled on his leather gloves let me do this you think something might spring out at us and you think its a bar of gold as a bribe do you i supposed that any man whod been with the dudley family as long as forest would in any situation fear a blade from out of darkness he pulled at the sackcloth which came easily away revealing another cloth underneath black holy god i said gently lifting away the corners of soft black cloth what lay beneath welcomed the moon forest stepped away what is it despite the circumstances of its arrival i was stricken with awe this i said would seem to be what we came here for xlii contempt under the candle it was a rich dark red a swollen blooddrop less than half the size of a tennis ball but more perfectly spherical after i blew out the candle there were yet lights in it lights that moved a sprinkling of them more lights than i could see in the air around us or the night sky where the moon was so closepressed by clouds that few stars were in evidence only here in the inner firmament of the stone points of white and piercing blue and a lambent orange all in fluct as i looked at it it seemed to breathe easier than could i who dared not touch it this precious portal to the hidden wondering if i could have sat in this windowspace alone and concentrated with the trithemius manuscript and the whole untroubled night ahead of me might i then find one of those fragments of light projected into the chamber in angelic form whatever planet rules in that hour the angel governing the planet thou shalt call sayeth trithemius raphael uriel i had no books or charts here i didnt know couldnt think and the night was far from untroubled so you were right john forest said mercy everything you said to them theyre in so much fear of how much you might know and who you might tell that they think to pay you off send you on your way with what you came here for yes so it would appear i took a last long look at the wigmore shewstone before covering it over with the black cloth a cloth of velvet like the one elias the scryer had kept around his i could not believe theyd let such a treasure go so easily it must go back i said what forest had snatched the stone from the boardtop clutched it ridiculously to his breast no spiritual device should ever be acquired this way i said its corrupted from the start no good will come of it not for me or dudley or the queen are you gone mad forest thrust the stone at me take it for christs sake theyll think youre silenced its your talisman itll get you out of here when youre well away throw the damned thing in the river if thats what you want i pray you put it down i said quietly john forest weighed the stone in one hand before tossing it to the other and then he shrugged and replaced it on the board looking for a moment almost grateful as if it had been too hot or too cold or hed felt its alien energy racing up his arm youd best ride back to hereford i said where dudley knows he can reach you where other letters may be waiting and you as you said maybe they think im bought off with the shewstone dr john they want you to take it and leave i cant leave not without dudley but you can and leave you alone with these bastards if im troubled by bradshaw or meredith or martin ill say ive written an account of all i know about property theft from the abbey and youve ridden with it to london and if im not back there in a week youll put it before whoever in the privy council deals with such matters and presteigne will be overrun with accountants now go forest pulled on his leather gloves and what will you do ill find him somehow ill find him hoping this sounded more confident than i felt i dragged the board away from the window forest swung himself up on to the sill looked down into the mews then back at me his head bent under the lintel all right ill go but ill ride not to hereford ludlows the place to the council of the marches where ill rouse people identify myself as lord dudleys man tell them hes missing within twenty miles of their stronghold return with a hundred armed men at least before sunrise take this town apart and if all the time hes with some other whore he stared at me you think that now no i said soberly have a care god go with you i watched him lower himself from the window gripping the ivy his feet kicking against the wall until he could jump to the ground watched him leading his horse to the opening of the mews without looking up listened to the hooves as they gathered pace id never felt so alone so useless twisted by contempt for myself and what drove me a thirst for secret wisdom disguised as love for queen and country i thought i might never unwrap the stone again the stone id thought to deliver to the queen with the promise of angelic advice on how best to exalt her majesty the stone which might procure knowledge of which islands remained to be discovered beyond the known world which unknown natural forces might be harnessed to the queens cause what had led me to think that a man who could not see might walk in celestial light the only man in the faldos hall whod caught no glimpse of even the bonemans ghost if such it was and worse how could i have brought dudley into this a man with more enemies than he could name in a year no matter that hed leapt at it like a dog in a butchers shop i was the one whod laid the scented trail hear his voice from that moment of engagement well make a good bargain with this man in the noble cause of expanding the queens vision it had come too easy the bargain was a black bargain founded upon threats and no good could come of it i gazed without hope at the shrouded stone my christian cabalism that shield against the demonic had been compromised by the means of its acquisition to begin with how had john smart known of my desire for it as id not mentioned it in my own letter to my cousin meredith it surely could only have been through the whore whod learned of it from dudley the whore whose fishmonger as we say in london was smart i wondered how many bawdy houses in presteigne were owned by this man whose shrill laughter i could almost hear go on take the stone for all the good it will do you tainted i flung myself on the floor by the truckle my teeming head buried in my quivering hands filled with dread now over dudley who in pursuit of my own ends id left alone in a town full of hostile strangers where might i even begin to search for him friendship apart the thought of returning to london without him made me cold to the spine id tell the queen almost everything for how could i not and be lucky to escape with my head let alone my occasional place at court for even though shed ever dithered over his suitability as a husband dudley beyond all doubt was the only man shed ever loved maybe the angels could tell me where to find him i stared at the blackwrapped stone and began to laugh in a crazed way which could only break asunder into weeping and then i was down on my knees in a vault of moonlight praying for inspiration to a god who seemed this night to be very far away and then the king made god smaller not the first time that goodwife faldos words in mortlake church had come back to me xliii graveyard mist no memory of falling back across the truckle but that was where i lay until the moon having shed all its cloud awoke me with its brilliance or maybe it was the whispers rising like hissing steam from the mews the light was so bright that i sprang unsteadily to my feet at first thinking in panic that morning was come slowly realising as the moons position in the window was unchanged that i could only have slept thank christ for an hour or so there was a pain in my chest from how id lain as i leaned out into the chill night and took breath after long breath hanging over the sill my hair fallen over my face and eyes john boy huh raking away my hair as he came out of shadow and stood looking up at me removing his green smallbrimmed hat and holding it in both hands at waist level thomas jones twm siôn cati plump very welsh ever halfamused the inns all locked up what kind of bloody inns all locked up before midnight what the hell are you doing here time is it maybe not yet midnight maybe just after you mean you didnt get my message oh god it all came back the note hed left for me with the ostler seemed like weeks ago i left very early this morning you should know im not a man to waste paper john beg mercy listen my friend dudley no point at all in maintaining the master roberts conceit you seen him this night or earlier you mean hes not here missing since when not sure he was silent for a moment i looked over to the stables we must surely have disturbed the night ostler in his loft all right thomas jones said as you seem to be wearing your day apparel if i were you id come down from the window unless you want to rouse everyone we cant talk like this people will think were lovers i raised myself up in the window threw a tentative leg over the sill and then slid back into the bedchamber and grabbed the shewstone from the board stowed it away in my jerkin and then before i could think too hard about it was out into the night holding to the ivy which came away in my hands halfway down and i tumbled to the cobbles stifling a cry thomas jones stood looking down at me not assisting not used to this are you john not broken into as many houses as you picking myself up hoping the moon would not expose my swollen eyes or any other evidence of how close id been to parting with my mind fetch your horse thomas jones said quietly where are we going to begin with somewhere we can talk in normal voices in relation to dudley i must have sounded like a child who knows boy i fear were close to the heart of something quite unpleasant we had disturbed the night ostler but half the money in my purse secured i hoped his silence he helped me saddle up and we went out to where thomas joness horse was tethered at the entrance to the mews riding out of presteigne on a moonbarred road that now was become all too familiar to me wouldve told you this the other night thomas jones said as we dismounted a mile from town but not in front of that cocky scut he sniffed even if hes dead i might not take that back dead i dont say that hes dead but these are not the kindest of men who he made no reply leading his horse along the side of the road without too much reference to dudleys private and public troubles id explained to him why wed come here his only reaction had been a slow nodding of his head could i trust this man you might ask well he was betrothed to my cousin and had been pardoned by the queen there were those id trust less men i said not the kindest ill get to it if youre wondering about the true nature of his knavery i know little preferring the legend of a welsh robin hood who for a brief period would prey upon the norman dynasties holding the best farmland in the far west of wales all of it stolen thomas jones would allege and who was i to argue wales was they said a land ruled at every level by brigands some of them in london now he tilted his hat over his eyes for the moon was become oppressively bright some of the company i kept in my former life john was ah you need not explain i said kind of you get to the point the point is that there is no such thing as a free pardon you mean you once thought there was i was therefore quietly approached for intelligence about our friends in plant mat who made the approach i wont answer that and it matters not suffice to say that some of your masters in london have kin this side of the border lets say i was approached by a friend who has other friends sir william cecil has family in wales does he youre now a spy for cecil how would i know that he wouldnt id thought of cecil several times on the way here my mind more alert in the open air under stars thoughts turning inevitably to the content of the letter from amy dudleys london dressmaker it was said there had been a number of meetings over the past few months between cecil and the spanish ambassador la quadra who if they had but one aim in common it would be to keep the queen and dudley out of wedlock but dear god to have amy murdered lest she suffered from some fatal malady or was of a mind to take her own life and why in gods name would cecil want to know about plant mat i stared up into the night for enlightenment compared with the twisting mesh of london politics the formation of the stars seemed constant and reassuringly familiar and were you able i asked to supply the intelligence thomas jones blew breath through his teeth why does every bastard think that if you have a history of thieving youre part of some hidden body of neckweedcontenders all known to the others even i wouldnt have dealings with plant mat so you had nothing to tell them on the contrary boy i had a great to deal to tell them particularly about gwilym davies who likes to call himself prys gethin who also calls himself a gentleman farmer and collects land with the alacrity of a norman baron after the conquest well buying some of it of course but wheres the money come from but ill get to him plant mat yes oh how the romantic legends are formed around them like graveyard mist boy do plant mat even exist now legges verdict might suggest not indeed they exist and profess themselves driven by love of their country dont fool yourself boy theres a good deal of hatred in wales for the english and for socalled welsh towns like presteigne where the old language is let rot by english pouring in looking to increase their illgrown wealth hatred despite the tudor line jesu jones were all of us ruled by welshmen now ach he waved a hand as if to swat a fly what a prime piece of english rookery that is even though most of us are content to float with it arthurian descent bollocks the truth is that wales is yet a catholic country and as long as little bess permits catholic worship shell get no shit from this side of the border except from plant mat all right let me tell you the original plant mat he said were the three children two sons and a daughter of an innkeeper in his own home town of tregaron the family had become famous robbers gathering others to them and inhabiting a cave with an entrance so narrow that only one man at a time might pass through a cave in a place laden with legend which people kept away from because it was said the devil himself climbed those rocks the cave was their whats the word in english temple certainly of some almost ritual significance they were inside the land see in the heart of wales i dont know what they did in there maybe just got drunk but the legend of that cave grew that they drew their power from the land around them thus out of the past out of their heritage theyd use a glove to identify themselves passed one to another always a sense of ritual a mystery which they encouraged for years theyd been simply robbers even if some victims had lost their lives as well as their goods but when it came to the planned murder of a judge at rhayader all wrongdoers in the heart of wales were pleased to have the assize court in rhayader see where they had control justices in their pockets and no jury that did not include a few of their own maybe they thought that if they killed an english judge the judiciary would get the message and leave them alone i dont know madness and they paid the price martyrs the sons telling glorious tales of their dead fathers and all theyd done for wales and the name plant mat was anybodys now any band of brigands who wanted to wear it like a black cloak a cloak with all the weight of heritage see they yet live in a cave pah who lives in a cave they live in good houses some with big halls and spare chambers and a bwddyn or two in the grounds for the servants like the estate of our friend gwilym davies or prys gethin he claimed in court i said that the name was pressed upon him by the sheriff of radnorshire which your english judge never questioned curious that the road was passing through what had been a long wood sporadic trees on either side and behind them thickets the stumps of felled oak and heaps of discarded twiggery all caged in brambles i stopped walking whats this about help me why are you telling me this now and how does it relate to dudley thomas jones took off his hat dont think me selfrighteous i stole i stole as a boy because my friends stole and i stole as a man because i found i was good at it and if i spread some of the proceeds among the needy it didnt seem so bad to be saving some aside to spend on books to acquire an education but dont think me selfrighteous ill do my years in purgatory resigned to it boy but prys he stood in a shaft of moonlight betwixt the trees he yet wore the russet doublet with the gold thread prys he said will one day be in the deepest chamber of hell though not it seems soon enough xliv monstrous constellations they say he once killed a man just to rape his wife thomas jones was sitting amidst the fungus on a tree stump legs apart bunched hands swinging between his knees not his first rape nor needless to say his first killing i did not ask how the man known as prys gethin had remained alive and free this is wales boy then he choked the life out of the wife he shrugged well why not killing and rape are as natural to him as taking a piss would have been a soldier if there was a welsh army like the man he believes possesses him possesses its just a word john i only met him once see some years ago in an alehouse both of us well into our cups i recall that he invited me to join him in his work plant mat i suppose who knows where id be today if i hadnt at that moment been compelled to go outside and throw up my supper never went back never saw him again then how i asked do you know all this common knowledge where i come from boy some of it anyway no onell touch him see he knows too much and hes done too many favours this is not london middle wales is a big village full of mountains and rivers and lakes and waterfalls and miles of emptiness around which the legends echo vast whispers in the wind jesu twm is this a matter for poetry im welsh its in the blood his wife now did i tell you about his wife said to have fled within a month of their wedding to england i believe which did not improve his love of our neighbour word was that he liked to do her while covered in pig blood still wet she seems to have been a religious woman who would not have a child conceived in pig blood did she also put out his eye before she left put it out himself they say in a drunken rage tell me when youve heard enough of this sounds like horseshit to me who am i to say otherwise all right in truth little is known about the man i do not for example believe that gwilym davies is his name any more than is prys gethin the legend says he was born in tregaron where plant mat began all those years ago i can tell you boy that he was not he acquired an old farm in the hills near there which he claims as his ancestral home it is not im from tregaron and i know wheres he come from then dont know that by his accent id say north rather than south but welsh is his language and thieving is certainly his trade he inspires fear and respect over a wide area and not only through his looks and the killing and the rape that is not all legend he lives by thieving lives by farming now oh and slaughtering so loves to slaughter stock anybodys stock and not quickly after a successful cattle raid hell sacrifice one of the beasts on a hilltop under a beacon fire i know this ive seen the flames from afar sacrificed to god some god or the demon hes invested with the spirit of rhys gethin who knows he was rambling over all this as we drank full of the old testament thomas jones sat very still in the grey light his habitual levity long shed i waited for him to continue but he said nothing i said so the curse thinking not only of the two dead men but of dudley in the marketplace in presteigne cursing we might consider that to be a womans preserve thomas jones said also the sight and yet he has that too or so its claimed styling himself as a man who walks with his ancestors journeying to the wild and barren places to meet with owain and rhys the time i drank with him he told me what they looked like now how theyd not aged how in the other world all the grey had gone from owains forked beard and his powers were there to be called upon in the cause of wales hes mad increasingly id say so the bridge from which the farmer fell ach lets not get swept away it might just as easily have had an axe taken to it by gethins followers in the plant who then drowned the poor old boy and left him all entangled in the ruins of it how many followers does gethin have hard to be sure but two of them were in presteigne the day i found you at the inn the roberts brothers this is gerallt and gwyn that is ive known them only as woodsmen and hunters on his estate and both are men of violence shorttemper alehouse fights but not high in intellect just the two may have been more i didnt recognise i thought at first there might be some plan to free prys from the gaol or the court so i followed them keeping a safe distance behind they took this road all the way to brynglas hill where they stopped i may have blinked what did they do there didnt go close enough to find out boy remembering too well the face of a man beaten in tregaron town by gerallt roberts most of his teeth gone and his jaw too close to an ear than a jaw was ever meant to be however i did see two other men on the hill one of whom bore a close resemblance to my old friend john dee when was this but i knew recalling two horsemen id noticed down by nantygroes when i was on first the hill with stephen price the same dee i saw again that night in presteigne thomas jones said well well why then was the queens conjurer in town was he there to give evidence to the court on aspects of the hidden relating to prys gethin and death by cursing no i said with caution he wasnt anyway it seemed useful to seek you out i even wondered if youd been followed to brynglas by the roberts brothers not to my knowledge so i left you a message which you with your renowned intelligence contrived to ignore consider my head hung in shame i said but the roberts brothers had no need to free gethin from the court none at all and you think they knew this thomas jones shrugged whats happening here i said how could the truth about prys gethin have failed to come out in court because it was an english court not good enough legge knew legge knew everything before the trial began youd told whoever you told youd told them all about prys gethin no such thing as a free pardon i dont understand why did you even come to the trial not such a long ride from my home thats no answer no he looked down at his enfolded fingers i suppose not does it make more sense that i came to court because i was most explicitly warned not to in truth he looked up at me you think i would not like to see an end to prys gethin look the woman ill tell you the young woman who was raped and then choked to death and her husband killed that was no myth they were neighbours of my aunt at llanddewi not far from tregaron everyone knew whod done it but it would never be proved so i thinking it cowardly to finger prys from behind i offered to give evidence to the court regarding his reputation but you and was told boy that it would not be necessary told my presence would not be useful told to keep my head down in the west and forget the foregoing conversation had ever taken place so why after that would i not come to the trial movement overhead a bat flittering tree to tree followed by another thomas jones leaned back hands clasped behind his head does all this then suggest anything to you john the wood all around us let off a smell of voracious decay i sat down upon a stump with a jagged edge that hurt my arse i didnt care pain sharpens the senses monstrous constellations like the grotesque creatures on scorys map were finding form in the firmament of my head and it felt as if the cold moon itself were lodged in my breast xlv cold geometry it felt like they were here with us now skulking and scurrying amid the rotting trees cecil in shadow longnosed and mastiffeyed with his intelligence gatherer walsingham running hither and thither ratlike getting things done getting things done and of course none of it would ever lead back nothing ever did hell i didnt even know if this was cecil felt my fists clenching and unclenching my body all aquiver asking thomas jones when hed been approached by the man he would not name who might have been of cecils welsh kin ten days ago a fortnight he said a messenger came to me with instruction to ride to a certain place and what was required i told you as much intelligence as i could provide on the man calling himself prys gethin and speedily yes it would need to be else how could all this have been arranged in the time easily when you thought about it dudley had never explained fully but i guessed that not wishing to attract attention by assembling his own travelling party he would have instructed his steward thomas blount to cast around for a discreet but secure company journeying to the welsh border and thomas blount being a lawyer well known in the inns of court they would have found him how fortunate that this should coincide with the most unusual circumstance of a london judge being sent to try a welsh felon for a most uncertain offence my thoughts curled in upon themselves like eels in a bucket and i fought to untangle them the idea of the border judiciary in fear of a band of brigands that seemed unlikely to me from the start if the word came down from london thomas jones said theyd be forced to swallow their pride still hard it is to believe london would go to all that trouble all that expense all that connivance the question of robert dudley and the queen this was the most crucial matter in england nay in all europe a decision had therefore been taken to dispose of a man at whatever cost i recalled the urgency in cecil that day id been brought to him the day it must have begun to look as if amys suspicious death had not been enough to finish dudley as a suitor the day cecil and blanche parry had conspired to ensure that she failed to deliver the message to me from the queen seeking a suitable date for a royal wedding i have no doubts about your ability in this regard which is why i dont want you and your fucking charts within a mile of the queen at this time watching me how long had they been watching me i recalled a flitting glimpse of the blackclad walsingham mothlike in the strand as i was leaving cecils house watching dudley too well of course watching dudley the most hated man in all england and all his household in particular his principal retainers blount and forest i said how would they get to the prisoner in new radnor castle its hardly the fleet john and if it had been the fleet theyd have got to him easily enough even quicker at marshalsea though it might cost a groat or two more for the guards new radnor castle inside curtain walls would be a fine place for comings and goings certainly better than presteigne with its gaol in the middle of the town where all could see so men came to prys gethins dungeon at new radnor with a proposition hed be suspicious of course at first thomas jones said if the men who came to him were english and if they were not if he was addressed in welsh duw youre right who thinks of all this im sure we both saw the dimensions of it now the plan laid out with all its euclidian precision the alarming thought came to me that there would have been no one better to put the proposal to prys gethin than thomas jones twm siôn cati himself no such thing as a free pardon but no his pardon had come from the queen and this plan was the most savage thrust into elizabeths heart he wouldnt do it and they wouldnt demand it of him for fear that hed go along with it and then with typical cunning damage it at the eleventh hour or was that what he was doing now dear christ i was out of my head dizzy with imaginings just say it john thomas jones said wearily i nodded closing my eyes a bargain is cut against all reason prys gethin walks free while robert dudley master roberts never comes back across the border i felt myself sinking inexorably into the most treacherous political marsh in the world full of rapids and sucking pools dark water hanging weed fortunate that you were out of town when they took him thomas jones said otherwise theydve had you as well and we wouldnt be sitting here working it all out and you im guessing would have been long dead your value being beg mercy john negligible by comparison i could not argue with this they took him how i said where no sooner was the question out than i knew my name is mistress branwen laetitia swift ask anyone in this town maybe a sleeping draught in a cup of wine hed not refuse perhaps poison i stiffened i should also have told you thomas jones said that while discreetly following the roberts brothers around town before their departure for brynglas i was led to a warehouse on the outskirts gwyn let himself in and then came out quite quickly i think he was just making sure it was still there would still be there when it was needed what a cart wooden frame and a cover as much of it as i could see how would they know what was required of them i imagine a message was conveyed to them from prys by mouth id doubt either of them can read likely whoever went to gethin at new radnor would then have conveyed instructions to the brothers gethin would have revealed their names to him if his life depended on it hed certainly take the chance with their lives i dont know how it was done likely the man would go alone unarmed as a sign of trust i dont know all we can be sure of is that none of them will know who authorised the bargain how high it goes and the beauty of it when you think about it is that they know that prys as a devout welshman will never not even under the most imaginative of tortures reveal a deal struck with the english perfection i stood up so they have dudley alive or i think we must assume they have him thomas jones said apart from the scratting of rats or badgers in the wood there was silence so here it was for the sake of england or someones idea of what was best for her it had been agreed to spare a killer a many times murderer who relished the slick of blood upon his skin and believed himself justified driven by the ghosts of glyndwr and rhys gethin this man released to rob and kill and rape again at will though gethin might end up quietly dead i said knowing what he knows if they ever find him and i doubt they would plump welsh thomas jones was leaned back looking at me his eyes slitted there we are ive told you all i know what happens next is for you to say how sure are you that theyve taken dudley to brynglas its no more than an astute guess john though what i might add is that before he disappears forever it strikes me as likely that prys will want to come to brynglas i do think he believes that rhys gethin is within him is part of him and this is rhyss place the citadel of his highest triumph so a final pilgrimage a meeting with rhys or whatever demon hes invested with the spirit of rhys you said that what did you mean by it ah well i think we may have read some of the same books but you more than hush thomas jones was on his feet the sound of a distant horse moving at speed was no longer so distant xlvi portal hed been afraid to sleep lest they came for him the local men who sought gethin roger vaughan also a local man the only local man within the judges company therefore the local man who had let it happen the young pettifogger raised beyond his abilities in return for selling his county town down its mean river the cry of traitor resounding from an open window as he returned to his inn after taking my mare to the ostler a big sharp stone glancing from a wall by his head i was watching by my window see he said for those fools to come back from the hills trying to stay awake which is how i saw the arrival of dr jones at the bull and then the two of you leaving along the knighton road and i felt less secure he truly thought hed feel safer with us a conjurer and a pardoned felon than left alone in presteigne were all gone from there now the boy said every one of us who journeyed with the judge a sheepish shrug as he stood there holding his horses bridle i explained our situation telling thomas jones he could say what he wanted in front of vaughan didnt know how wise this was but it was too late for secrecy i suppose i was glad to have roger vaughan with us a lawyer with a lawyers sharp mind but also a local man alert to the snares of the hidden there might be a hundred armed men in presteigne by morning i said if forest gets to ludlow unharmed but it would be foolish for us to wait for them i know my way around brynglas vaughan said we dont know dudley was taken there i told him or if he was where exactly he might have been taken but if these brothers have him theyre likely to want proof that gethin has been freed before they fulfil their side of the bargain it was my only hope for dudley but i saw thomas jones shaking his head its gethin wholl want the proof of his freedom the knowledge than no one is on his trail and also from what i know of him hell want to well an englishman of dudleys status hell want to finish it himself in some he tightened his lips half turned away ritual fashion i said he has a legend to support thomas jones said and thats another reason why hed want it to be done here looking between the trees to the moongrazed hills i experienced that momentary sensation of being separate from the physical the uncomfortable feeling of following yourself just one step behind which always comes when theres no time to contemplate its significance and then it was fading and thomas jones was untying his horse from the tree he may not even be there yet especially if hes on foot you have weaponry boys vaughan produced a stubby dagger i had nothing only your magic eh john thomas jones smiled more than a touch ruefully whitton church lay by the side of the road amid ancient yew trees about half a mile short of pilleth it was two or three hundred years old and not in good repair but it gave us some concealment as we looked out towards brynglas upon whose slopes the moonlight gave the illusion of a first fall of quiet snow been here in my dreams so often thomas jones said every welshmen is inclined to venerate owain glyndwr was this a time for following such dreams i wondered again how far i might trust him what if he played a double game with his veneration of glyndwr this is what the night does to you if we go directly up the hill well be seen for miles vaughan said better to follow the river where it winds behind the trees he led us out past nantygroes where one small light shone in a downstairs room or was it the moons reflection and then we left the road to follow the river lugg the river of light living up to its name this night still as a cold white twisting road behind us a multitude of sheep lay closepacked in a corner of the pasture like frogspawn on a pond they come down before sunset i said they dont like the hill at night we kept as far as possible behind the trees the ground was rough and sloping we went carefully passing under the towering motte of the longruined castle overgrown now the river forming a natural moat the moon was high and white and the clouds were rolled back and the side of brynglas shone now like a polished breastplate looking bigger than id ever seen it i thought of anna ceddol sleeping in the house that was half inside the hill if ever there could be sleep with the mad boy in the house pushing back the thought i called softly to thomas jones so how was it in your dreams brynglas like jerusalem a shrine it makes me tremble his voice low and sibilant as the wind through dead foliage there is a shrine up there i said as we stopped to the virgin mary and um i suppose what came before her i know thomas jones gazed up between tall trees at the silvered hillside the heathen well where nymphs would bathe a portal to the otherworld the land of the dead of the ancestors so they say they also say owain went there on the night before the battle did you know that thered been this huge and savage storm the sky ripped apart with lightning weather again indeed his war began with a fiery star crossing the heavens followed by thunder and so it went on and in the silence after this fierce storm in the summer of owain and rhys gethin ascended the hill to the holy well it was june the twentyfirst midsummer the old festival and the next day they set fire to the church i said they stood and watched the church burn glyndwr had fired several churches on the way here supposedly because they paid tithes into england but i said nothing about this the new rector of pilleth hed say glyndwr and gethin had sold their immortal souls to the devil that night and a goodish deal it was boy imagine the terror when word of the victory reached the english court wondering if by years end theyd all be learning welsh but shortlived like all deals with the devil whatever he invoked here deserted him when he entered england he died unfulfilled as presumably did rhys gethin if he died thomas jones reined in his horse dont make dust of this boy owains death was never recorded nor his burial place ever found he simply disappeared oh im not saying he lives but something of him does and if its anywhere its here he turned slowly in the saddle to face me his round pale face shining like a smaller moon look at me boy fallen welshman recipient of an english pardon see what it does to me this place oh they all come here at least once not just the handful of mad old ragamuffins in plant mat but all those who yet dream of an exalted wales they come here to seek renewal and they keep coming back ofttimes for reasons theyll never quite understand the men i drink with in tregaron the poets and the dreamers they come quietly and quietly they leave at dusk or before dawn sometimes journeying all the way on foot i thought of the rector i have seen them anointing themselves here at night in the heathen way so this is the place for them isnt it the shrine the most likely anyway where might they take him what hiding places are there how far is it from the village not within sight of the village at night i said and no one comes out of there after dark the church itself the shrines behind it and the well a long hole in the ground with a pine wood behind and below it the bryn half sunk into the hill itself like a cave i said nothing of this but it would be the first place id go to warn the ceddols i kept my voice steady there are wide views from the church i said especially on a night like this youd see anyone coming especially three of us on horseback if we ride directly up the hill were meat is there another way there is another way i said with good tree cover fit for horses if we dismount and lead them im sure we could leave them in the stables at nantygroes but stephen price is a cautious man and the explanations would take time well continue thomas jones said see what there is to be seen if anything wait i said how much do you believe is there magic theres magic everywhere on a night like this boy but i had little faith that there was anything of the hidden here so many legends were woven with hindsight to light mere coincidence with glamour strange weather moving stars earthtremors you feel a softening of the ground vaughan had dismounted and was tying his horse to a young oak we should be able to get through this way and up the hill from behind but not if were in bog damn i should have thought when i came down the hill through the oak wood id only gone as far as the burial tump now i only wanted a swift and discreet way to the church and dudley if dudley was there and also to the bryn ill go through on foot for a short way vaughan said see how firm it is for the horses i watched him vanish into a thickening of undergrowth wishing there were more of us then looked up at the hill and the moon you could make out the grey tower of pilleth church halfway up a marker for the shrine of the village you could see nothing ive never asked thomas jones said but why were you here when i followed the roberts boys i presumed just to visit your old family home but its dying i said not wanting to mention the peculiar talents of siôn ceddol and the lure of his sister the village is dying id almost think you cared its the old home of my father my tad tad thats what you called him in the welsh way for years i hadnt even realised it was welsh i said nothing ah youre one of us more than you know john dee whys the village dying weight of too much killing the dead outnumber the living and the dead are rising it oppresses them there were always priests of the old kind to help them cope but now theyre told its their own fault for not praising god enough my he said you do care i hardly know anyone here my tad told them hed come back when he was rich but he never was not for long and he never did come back tell me do have any idea how practised gethin believes himself to be in the ways of magic i doubt hes read the books john but hes said to have the sight and the desire and what some might call the courage and others the madness of thomas jones breaking off because of a sharp cry from down by the river he began to turn his horse hes in the marsh twisting in the saddle i saw the waters glitter swordbright through a line of trees we should all have gone i slid to the ground and tied the mare to the slender trunk of the oak aware again of that feeling of separation from the physical a shudder going through me like you sometimes get in sleep as if i were snatched out of my body and then flung back the mare flinched as if shed felt it too hes here thomas jones said uncertainly i spun round thinking for a fearful moment that he meant prys gethin then saw roger vaughan fading up greyly from the riverbank the shape of him imprinted on the night but blurred in my sight as if the ink had run i moved towards him he was limping not looking at either of us only at the ground as if he might sink into it im all right dr dee im not hurt his voice was cracked like old parchment he was not all right he was far from all right xlvii orifice vaughans horse quite a big grey stallion was straining at his tether panting and blowing and i saw that the others were become restive too their eyes all aflare i said to vaughan what happened down there i dont know he clearly was shaken that is im not sure i think i think there might be something dead down there the smell might just be a sheep but i it dont feel right in any way he went to soothe the stallion putting his hands on it id swear in search of warmth and life but the horse sheered away from him i looked down towards the river ill go i said find out leave it john thomas jones said were better moving to higher ground where we can see anyone coming if dudleys only been missing since this morning its not likely that his body will yet stink that rather depends doesnt it i knew not what it depended on but must needs be sure and i was weary of unexplained fears and shadowplay natures marked cards and loaded dice before i could think better of it i was scrabbling down the way vaughan had come over short turf which suggested the sheep had been here in profusion in daylight hours the sheep which fled at sunset divers trees sprang up around me from halfgrown saplings to old oaks with bloated cankered boles and branches like fingers with the gnarling sickness the river was no longer to be seen too close or the bank had been raised up against winter floods you might conclude that on this hard moonflayed night i was not fully in my mind and maybe i wasnt id experienced this in glastonbury and other places where christianity and old magic were interwoven the air unsteady and full of sparks and sometimes you thought you could hear it like the hum of bees or indeed smell it in a sudden rank richness of earth youre one of us more than you know john dee i wondered now if my tads evocation of wales the men bent like thorn trees their skin scoured had not simply been intended to keep me away from here plant some deep revulsion inside me maybe some dark memory had lived inside him and the last thing he wanted was for his son to become one of us but now i was here whether by destiny or conspiracy an educated man grown weary of the pinches and taunts the mists and flickerings i wove between the trees looking for the river recalling my own drawing of the valley a place given form by ancient ritual but the river was hidden now by the earth of a sudden rising before me all humped like a deathbed how our nightminds ever find the most sinister of likeness it was only raised earth an upturned bowl made bigger by enclosing shadows than it had looked by day and the trees growing out of it turned into a conference of witches one of them longdead naked boughs clawing for the moon but it wasnt the tree that stank in the windless night it seemed as if the smell was all over the tump a raw essence of decay of corrupted flesh sharp and hideously sweet stephen price and pedr morgan had secretly buried a new corpse here which by now would indeed be in a ripe condition but buried under the moons lamp i rounded the tump to where theyd dug and was driven back as if struck by a reek so insidiously putrid that i felt as if my own body were rotting in its blast was sent reeling away a hand cupped over my nose my feet slithering and christ a blow a battlefield blow a bright ripping pain in the back of my head had me tumbling flung around and thrown down my stricken head jouncing from the bole of the tree behind me legs slithering into a bed of twiggery and stony soil i lay for long moments benumbed the night in spasm around me i must simply have backed hard into a tree with a low and knobbled branch which had scored my skull and put me down but it had felt like an act of violence reaching up a hand i hissed in pain on finding a flap of peeled flesh warm blood flooding through my fingers my hair already thick with it embedded in tree roots i stared through the pain into a blackness as if into the cave where the children of mat met entrance so narrow that only one man at a time might pass through and the devil the hole gaped at me like an open mouth and its breath was foul no escape from the stench of bloating flesh from not a cave but it was an orifice in the tumps flank where none had been when i was here before when i opened my mouth to call out for thomas jones and vaughan something at once rushed in foul as returning vomit how can i tell you this how can i describe the horror of closing my mouth on a mess of putrid flesh trying to retch but finding no breath for it beginning to choke the panic throwing me on my back amidst bonehard roots knowing full well that although my throat and gut were tight with revulsion there was nothing in my mouth nothing anywhere no air the moon gone darkness absolute know that i like darkness nights when i can lie on my back and planets and stars are laid out for me in strings and clusters like an intricate garden whose patterns i know with an intimacy as if id cultivated them myself this was a solid darkness like stilled smoke should i have formed a prayer holding it inside me or inscribed a protective pentagram on the air we dont think even those of us whove pored for years over the cabala and ascended if only in our minds the angelic stairways in cold life magic has a tendency to shrink back into the books in the struggle against hungry death we fall back on the physical with the running blood pooling on my face i pushed against the roots dug my boots into soft earth coming up very slowly my back against the tree but my body felt too heavy and i was aware of something pulling me back fighting it cold sweat welling from my skin to join the blood but it was too much for me and i slid back into the gleefully crackling leaves and felt a presence a nearness an active resentment fast hardening into hatred as i realised i must needs go into the hole xlviii not in a goodly way a log the size of a side of mutton was in slumber in the ingle at nantygroes i bent over the meagre glow from its underside needing bodily heat more than ever i could remember but stephen price was a farmer and wouldnt even think to awaken his fire before morning not that i sleep much these nights he said three or four hours then ill awake and get dressed have a bite to eat and then mabbe doze till dawn if i can and tonight with this gethin let loose you know about this the whole country knows of it by now i looked around the moon was a wavering lamp in the poor blued glass of a deephewn window i could hear clarys the housekeeper clattering somewhere in the brightness of pain my thoughts were voiced fast as arrows wheres your wife why do i never see your wife price shuffled uncomfortably on his stool gone im very sorry to hear that to monaughty farm to stay with my brothers family id thought hed meant dead a quiet woman anna ceddol had said sits before the kitchen fire goes out to listen to the priest on a sunday and then goes home and worries well i was glad she wasnt dead but why had she gone to stay at another farm not even two miles away stephen price was asking me if i wanted to lie down i shook my head but slowly the pain scraping ceaselessly at my head like a winddriven bough against a window id bathed it in the holy well and again with wellwater in the yard at nantygroes the good housekeeper clarys had applied a nettle balm but it had begun to bleed again ill recover i said looked like you were rehearsing alone for some christmas play thomas jones had said shaken pretending the other actors were there all around frit the hell out of me boy i did not mean for this to happen price said i didnt think it would happen to you he hadnt even asked why i accompanied by two others had come this night to brynglas seeming only grateful that i was attempting in my way to uncover what was wrong here and if he hadnt thought that anything would happen to me he seemed not unhappy that something had didnt think such things could happen to me either i said dully and had once been foolish enough to think that if they ever did id feel favoured maybe one day id be far enough removed from it to consider the science but not now when i felt as if my very soul had been snatched out and left to go cold could not smother another spasm of shivering and at last stephen price pulled down an iron poker from the wall and raised the log until a flame came tonguing through i was not as forthright with you he said stiffly as i mightve been never told you nothing wrong but couldve told you more there was a clopping of hooves from the yard outside the horses still were edgy frit and sweating id asked if we might leave all three at nantygroes for a while to calm down while we considered our situation and so vaughan and thomas jones had followed prices sons to the stables leaving us alone price and me wed moved on widely skirting the tump and the marshy ground leading the horses at last through the oak wood and up to pilleth church jones and i had waited in the trees while vaughan crept up alone to the church where it took him not long to establish that the building and surrounds were deserted he said later that hed stifled a cry when on peering around the wall of the tower hed encountered the stone virgin on her plinth her face so tainted that she seemed to sneer into his eyes i think he meant to pray to her and could not but at least the cold virgin was alone so we came down from the hill the more direct way veering from the path only once so that i might be sure that the door and shutters of the bryn were closed tight against invasion at first despondent over our failure to find dudley i was briefly lit by a small hope that wed been wildly wrong and that he was back in presteigne in some other whores bed but that light soon went out thing was i was affeared shed die your wife i looked blearily at price my hair and face stiff with dried blood couldnt sleep would not eat would not go out not even in daylight gone thin as a rib sent her down to monaughty farm to be cared for by my brothers wife mabbe she wont be back its all different down there see not much moren a mile but it lies easy a monastery farm a safer air she never liked this house or this valley thats what it come down to couldnt wait to move to monaughty where thered be more company more company and less company he looked down at the fire shaking his head wanted me to spend more money on the building work finish the extension at monaughty so we could go it led to much quarrelling at first i was glad to get away to london truth be told you know what women are like think youre tight with money dont understand what you gotter spend keeping your ground in good heart and he looked up stricken his face all creased truth of it is i never want to go to monaughty two brothers one farm divers sons it dont work stephen price of pilleth thats me was gonner make meredith an offer for this house its all your land down here most of it but no house joan was all oh thank god its only rented we can be out of yere wed signed for the place for two years i thought to mend things somehow thought mabbe ole walter the priest could change it for us when we first come if my wife or anybody seen anything wed send for walter and sometimes marged the wise woman mother marged and walter the priest they had an understanding what did they think was the problem here never listened much to ole marged it was all mumbles and spells father walter hed say that if you had the sight living yere youd ever need the saviours protection what did he mean shrine to the holy mother place of pilgrimage you come you pay your respects and then you leave with faith renewed no one should live too close to such places walter said cept mabbe monks and hermits trained to thrive on spiritual agony the ole priest you never knowed when he was serious but he knowed what he was about and then he died and then ole marged both gone one after the other and then all you had i said quietly was a boy who brought death out of the earth but could not talk and a new priest all for the bible had hopes for daunce at first that hed bring some sense with the new religion plain talking but in the end price stabbed the poker into the heart of the fire putting it all down to the devil that was the last thing we needed so you came to me you were sent to us thats how i seen it he leaned away from the fire the boy with you out there was that young vaughan of hergest and the man with him is my my cousin thomas jones from the west of wales he and vaughan had said theyd stay outside watch the night watch the hill for movement anything my wifes been like this all her life price said some has it most of us ent i thought it didnt bother her much any more but it was different here she liked to walk in the evening when the air was soft not any more no never any more his accent was thicker this night but his voice was higher querulous what did she see the dead he prodded at the fire but not in a goodly way you mean from the battlefield confused looking for a home fragments of them shed be walking through them like they were part of the wind blowing down the hill scattered like leaves that was how she described it after a while she wouldnt go up the hill at all except to church in a group of us where did she walk then by the river he looked uncomfortable quieter down there see until i leaned forward driven by sudden and powerful insight until you buried a mans body in the old grave mound i sat back into shadow felt i was close to the very heart of it if it was just the fears of villagers hed pass it off as the superstitions of the uneducated but his own wife domestic troubles matrimonial strife his desire to remain here in his own place tempered by that fear that his wife if they stayed might even die of it i said did she know what youd buried in the mound christ no of course not it was even possible that his wifes fear of brynglas had been another good reason to dispose of the remains before she could find out about it the thought of what that might do to her why did you bury him there why because it was the only place i could think of where the mad boy wouldnt find him or if he did nobody would dig there because they all knowed it was an ole grave nobody disturbs a known grave no i nodded can you tell me what happened down by the river with your wife price sat staring at the window and the smeared moon gone to walk around dusk pleasant warm evening come back not an hour later worst ive ever seen her close to swooning in distress face white as clouds took until next day fore she could even tell me what was it she saw saw smelled felt i nodded id thought the smell would cling to my apparel but when i left there it was gone the smell had been part of the place part of what was there and for the first time id been thankful that i did not see like mistress price no moren a white mist at first her husband said drifting across the marsh taking shape when it got close too close to run from what shape did it take a man he swallowed shifting on his stool clothed only only in his rage you mean naked violence price poked angrily at the log she felt the violence in him a dirty violence she felt what he wanted to do to her felt it inside he threw down the poker turned away from the fire inside you know what im saying dr dee you know what it felt like you heard of anything like that before no though maybe read of it i wasnt sure horrified i sought to reassure price telling him that no one was mad that the old priest had been right about the peculiar air of a place of pilgrimage which might have its origins long before the shrine of the virgin that it seemed to me the tump had itself been placed in geometric accordance with the hill the river the shrines heathen precursor and perhaps other monuments now vanished even the sun and moon and the stars to give this place a certain mystic resonance maybe empowering the spirit of whoever lay within the tump and anyone who disturbed it might themselves be disturbed all of this unloaded unrefined from my hurting head years of study might make it no clearer and i knew that but for my own experience at the tump this night id be inclined to say that mistress price had created the whole story in her head to persuade her husband to turn his back on brynglas hill we buried a naked man in the tump price said a man whose spirit did not rest who walked and more and what did you do she hadnt been out of her bed for three days after id spent the day with you on the hill came back home and clarys said joan hadnt been able to keep food down death was coming for her got the ole cart out and we carried her on it me and clarys took her down to monaughty and later when all were abed i went to the tump on your own with a lantern and the bier from the church i sought to frame a question it would not come it was my fault price said my wife had been near death my fault to put right like you say it was the wrong place he wiped his brow with a sleeve not the pleasantest task he stank to deepest hell he was green and going to fluids pieces were coming away from him but i done it what id reared back dug him out and took him away buried him the other side of the hill behind the pines laid the turf on top and packed it tight and said what prayers i could think of over him no one saw you not as i know of doubt if i cared by then had to be done why was it wrong against the laws of god i think not only the laws of man aye mabbe but what choice did i have tell me that i leaned forward looking into prices round firelit face so theres nothing in there now nothing in the tump only what was there before whatever that may be and the hole i said the hole remains no hole i filled it in who would not i gripped the wooden seat of my stool my aching head all aswirl id gone most of a day and a night without sleep had little to eat and taken a blow to the head but i knew that id gone into the hole and nothing there but a foul miasma and a swirling hatred and john boy thomas jones standing in the doorway hands behind his back how long hed been there i knew not but i knew the tilted smile on his face was no portent of good fortune beg mercy if i interrupt you john but i thought you might want to know that at this moment there is a man walking quite openly along the road towards us from the direction of presteigne evidently making for the hill i stood up someone you know well hes yet some distance away so we cannot be entirely sure but vaughan and i are in general agreement that it might well be the man who likes to call himself prys gethin i stood unsteadily a hand on the ingle beam john you look worse thomas jones said you should stay here vaughan and i will follow him ill come i said i must needs come for i was hearing his voice from earlier killing and rape as natural to him as taking a piss o liked to do her while covered in pig blood still wet the demon hes invested with the spirit of rhys gethin i stood pushing my hands back through my bloodstiffened hair regardless of the pain and then turned to price and asked him what id thought as a bookman and a philosopher never to ask any man master price i said have you weaponry here xlix skin of the valley at first sight looking down you might almost have thought him drunk trying to stay upright hands extended either side of his body upturned as if weighing the air it was the first time id seen him we watched from a small orchard growing on a shelf of higher ground behind nantygroes standing inside a lattice of shadows and speaking in low voices stephen price had offered to come with us bringing both his sons maybe rousing some of the local men but thomas jones had pointed out that too many of us on brynglas would only draw attention besides id no wish for too many people to know about robert dudley if it is gethin vaughan said how did he avoid half the men of presteigne theyll have given up long ago i said though that doesnt tell us how they failed to see him on the road unless vaughan said he was given help nobody saw him leave the court he may have been smuggled away later than we think it being important that he reaches his destination i said it was all aglow again the night alive and me half dead we have a choice thomas jones said we could simply wait here until he goes past and then follow him in the assumption that hell lead us to wherever your friend is held if he still lives wed have the moonlight on our side so we could leave a reasonable distance between him and ourselves i pointed to a line of pines on the eastern side of brynglas hill which hid the village and would offer us some cover more copses and dingles up there than youd imagine roger vaughan said plenty of places he can disappear if he does see us especially if he knows the hill i think we can take it he knows the hill all too well thomas jones said having been here many times following in the steps of rhys gethin calling rhyss spirit into him rhys in the time of triumph i said nothing none of my mentors agrippa trithemius would deem it possible for a man to summon anothers ghost into himself except in his imagination which would have more effect on himself than upon others and should not be too much feared we could see him more clearly now a sprightly puppetfigure under the moon and sometimes it looked as if he was almost dancing and then his pace was slowed and he was walking down the middle of the road as if in a procession as if he was not alone i felt vaughans shudder something unearthly about this hes happy thats all thomas jones said hes walked free from the highest court ever held in presteigne and hes on his way to do a killing something even more than that i marked how his hands seem to gatherin the bright night he feels himself entranced the arms of the figure on the road were opening and hands reaching out as if he might clasp the hill to his bosom we might simply go down to him thomas jones said present ourselves three against one and we have this the blade of the butchers chopping knife was near two feet long stephen price had handed it to me as we left and id unloaded it upon thomas jones at the earliest opportunity he held it point down behind an apple tree so that its blade should not reflect the moonlight a scholar he said a lawyer and a man who since his pardon has become rather too fond of his meat against a man of considerable strength whos driven to kill yes i suppose we could do that demand he tells us where they have your friend and when he refuses lop off one of his hands he ran a tentative thumb along the blade sharp enough certainly will it be you john to do the first hand well follow him i said nearly halfway up brynglas not far below the church prys gethin stopped and sat down on a small tump in the grass to gain the cover of the last stand of pine before the church wall wed had to creep one by one to higher ground and so looked down on gethin now both thomas jones and vaughan had been able to verify to their satisfaction that this was gethin and there was confirmation for me too when he turned his head and the moon lit the grim cavity where an eye once had lodged i looked at thomas jones in frustration he shrugged there was nothing we could do but wait after several minutes gethin had not moved sitting quite still as though in meditation or was he waiting for someone i leaned against one of the pines fatigue weighting my legs the only warmth came from the new blood on my brow the deep gash in my head having opened again tributaries channelled either side of my nose vaughan raised a hand making motion towards the church i looked at thomas jones and he nodded we might as well take this opportunity to leave the pines and reach the cover of the church wall for if gethin rose now and moved ahead of us hed have an open view of the whole valley and might well mark us we moved as before one by one i waited another minute before running in a crouch half blinded by the bloodflow to join the other two behind the low trees and bushes which enclosed the church on three sides below us to the left the village lay lightless and silent we approached the church itself with greater caution this time but a window of plain glass showed that there was still no one inside only a sheet of moonlight over the altar the raised churchyard gave us a plateau from which we could watch prys gethin still as a monument and far enough away for us to commune in whispers as we crouched among outlying tombs behind a loose wall of bushes you might almost imagine that he knew he was watched roger vaughan said i doubt that thomas jones prodded the earth with the butchers blade it seems more likely that hes waiting for someone we could be here until sunrise let me think on it he sat down on a low tomb the blade across his knees go and bathe your head in the well john if he moves well come for you ill go with you vaughan said its on the dark side of the church and the steps to the well are worn an owls call across the valley was returned as i followed vaughan around the body of the church the area of the well was darkened not only by the tower but the line of tall pines on the other side vaughan stopped stood with his back against the church wall i could not see his face only hear the desolation in his voice the truth is i must needs pray to the holy mother vaughan ive no confidence in surviving this night i stopped under the grey diamond panes of the steep end window and sighed because of what you saw down by the tump and felt and smelled a man mabbe came and went in a blinking listen i said sometimes we throw pictures from our thoughts into the night air and in some places the air is more receptive if the ancient greeks and the egyptians before them were so far ahead of where we are even now in matters of the hidden then we mustnt be too quick to dismiss the ancient britons with their standing stones and their rough earthen monuments more than just graves it seemed a rare madness delivering a lecture on antiquities to a gathering of one in a moonlit churchyard but it was clear to me now that the skin of this valley and the fabric betwixt the spheres must be rendered muslinthin it would have vaughan held his back against the church wall if id died from the fear of it i felt it wouldve relished that do you see no i did not see but i nodded look i said pray to the lady if you dip your sleeve in the holy well and wipe the grime from her brow she might even respond if his glance at me was in search of irony hed find no sign of it this night roger i said dont dwell on it and it wont reach you he nodded and picked his way to where the sad smirched virgin stood atop her ridge of rubblestones watching over the stonelined vault in the earth which held the holy well a well older than christianity where the heads of dead enemies would have been sunk in veneration of some forgotten druidic deity later perhaps invoked by owain glyndwr and rhys gethin and then prys gethin too on one of his dark pilgrimages to pilleth betwixt cattle raids no one more likely to have murdered and mutilated the man twice buried by stephen price in grotesque and wouldbe magical reenactment of the events of what i could not yet imagine was how the unknown mans unquiet spirit had been invested with the base instincts of his killer my split head could hold no more all logic and learning was collapsed into the midden of superstition as we returned to the tomb watching prys gethin so still on the hillside below us small as a toad from here as venus gleamed first signal of the coming dawn in my old life which surely had ended this night ghosts were neither good nor bad and all they could give me was the knowledge of their existence fear had no role to play for id not been able to understand fear of the unknown which to me was a wondrous thing which id approached eagerly with my arms spread wide i looked at thomas jones the butchers knife betwixt his knees his hands on its stringwound wooden hilt he leaned back stretched sighing he doesnt know boy doesnt know where they are hes waiting for them to find him thats why he made no attempt to conceal his arrival when they know hes free theyll know its not a trick and their side of the bargain can be met without fear of reprisal meaning dudley yet lives who can say we dont know where they might have him we dont know how many of them are holding him if we wait for them to find him and take him to the place yes we can follow them but how do we stop them putting an end to it pryss moment of blooddrenched triumph what do we do about this john can only wait vaughan said returning from his prayers what other choice do we have the other choice is to make sure they never find prys go down there now three against one and this thomas jones thumbed the butchers blade roger vaughan drew back in alarm with a rattling of bushes im a man of the law sos legge master jones its one thing for a man to be legally hanged heroes wed be in presteigne jesu only a hiss from vaughan but it was too loud and i thought i saw gethins head move though he was too distant for me to be sure thomas jones held out a dagger to me i took it i saw roger vaughans eyes close momentarily roger you know this place go around the church into the pines wait for a while to be sure youre not seen then quietly follow the path back to nantygroes indeed thomas jones said catching on fetch price and however many sons he has over the age of six what about you just do it eh vaughan hesitated for a moment and then turned and was gone thomas jones took a long breath parted the bushes separating us from the pale hillside peered through for a moment then let the bushes swing back and picked up his butchers knife from the tomb this is it then boy dont forget your magic white and amber strands in the east suggested that the moons dominion would end before long and i was glad of this the moon might be your friend on a night ride but it meddles too much with your mind and senses wed moved about fifty paces to the other end of the churchyard before easing ourselves through the bushes so that he would not at first see us walking slowly towards him for a swifter pace might have implied an attack thomas jones plucked off his green hat bore da prys good morning a thin white line on the horizon but the morning must be more than an hour away l courtly dance a silence formed allowing me to observe gethin for the first time he was perhaps a little over medium height with long tangled greying hair and a face like from a misericord its lines chiselled deep in varnished oak my gaze was drawn inevitably to the open cavity where the left eye had been a knot hole in the wood twm siôn cati he said well well his wide lips fell easily into a loose smile and then he spoke in welsh so rapid that i could understand not a word of it thomas jones nodded indeed he said however in the presence of an englishman i ever think it polite for those who can to use his language indeed im told that owain glyndwr himself when he was at the english court was ofttimes mistaken for an englishman while elizabeth of england who claims descent from arthur prys gethin speaking rapidly as though his mastery of the neighbouring tongue had been impugned speaks not a word yn gymreig his voice was unexpectedly high and surprisingly melodious like to a bladderpipe not entirely true i said foolishly in truth i was far from sure that for all her linguistic skills the queen had more than a few words of welsh but id always instinctively take her side is it not prys gethin glanced across at me and who are you to say sirrah thomas jones threw a swift warning look in my direction but i caught it too late john dee oh prys gethins one eye lit up and for a moment i had the disturbing sensation that i was also viewed by some organ of perception behind the empty socket of the other a secret sight which might penetrate my thoughts her conjurer i shrugged so the queen of england saw fit to dispatch her sorcerer to wales along with the father of her bastard child she doesnt have a i shook my head and my lips tightened with the pain no matter no matter indeed for i knew that in one sentence hed confirmed what until that moment had been only an elaborate theory where is he i said he glanced briefly at me then looked away where are you holding lord dudley no reply we know why you were freed i said we know about the agreement gethin spoke in welsh to thomas jones who at once translated john he invites us to kill him gethin smiled thomas jones raised the butchers knife gethin did not flinch the whole texture of the night was altered i watched the start of a dangerously delicate courtly dance in the remains of the moonlight prys gethin tossing a question in welsh at thomas jones who gave no answer gethin then addressing him at length still in welsh thomas jones listening without a word hands on hips then turning to me his voice mild prys wonders john why im working with the enemy and he is not realising too late my possible mistake if gethin believed his task had been assigned by cecil then he might see it as some peculiarly welsh alliance between the two of them how much he knew of cecils reasons for not wanting the queen wed to dudley an englishman i could not say nor whether from a welsh standpoint a spaniard or a frenchman would be preferable as a consort more welsh from gethin thomas jones listening then slowly shaking his head no boy myself ive never considered that accepting an english queens pardon was any kind of treachery but equally im under no illusion about the continuing welshness of the tudor line silence for a while only the call of a distant owl at nights end then gethin brought his attention to me do you know where you are standing dr dee i believe so i took an instinctive step back down the hillside for prys gethin even after walking from presteigne gave off such animation such an energy perhaps the energy of freedom after a long captivity or perhaps something more there was little doubt he knew where he was standing did he believe the spirit of the man whose name hed borrowed had come into him while he sat waiting on the hill a spirit now burning inside him not possible an occupying spirit could not be of human origin only demonic christ i felt my own energy seeping away into the ground i was near exhaustion and despite the extreme danger here felt i might fall to sleep on my feet like a horse we were in gethins hands and he knew it time passed the voice piping on as if delivering a sermon the welsh rising and dipping like a liturgy and then thomas jones replying this time also in welsh still now looking beyond me down the hill his eyes black i felt like a watcher from another smaller world thomas jones was nodding now a faint smile upon his plumpen features da iawn he said very good both men smiling all three of them jesu the third man was unknown to me he was a large man his hair was short and crinkled his beard grey his arms bare and muscular silver sweat shone from his face and a dagger from a fist thomas jones nodded to him john this is master gerallt roberts oh god he must have moved silently out of the pines lower down the hill from where we stood and simply walked up silently over the sheepcropped turf we were equal in number now but you only had to look at gerallt roberts to know that in truth we were outnumbered a long silence and then prys gethin spoke again in welsh john thomas jones looking down the slope at me prys tells me we are upon the very spot at which the welsh archers hired by the english were caused to turn and loose their arrows into the english army thus redeeming their heritage and how can he know that nobody replied having retreated a little way down the hill i had my back to those first pale lights of predawn looking up at two men who were still in night a place of redemption indeed thomas jones approached me looking sorrowful its been conveyed to me that this may be my last chance to regain my honour honour after my cowardly acceptance of mercy from a woman who will never be queen of wales i looked for a smile but his face was empty well never be part of that of england owain with his english education and his smooth english speech made that all too explicit my father achieved it i said traitors dont count john thomas jones sighed prys says that redemption requires of me one simple perfect act i heard his kindly voice as if from a great distance your decapitation it said i said nothing it was a play i was not part of it the only reality was the ache in my head and even that was dulled now how can we let you live knowing what you know we i saw that hed plucked the dagger from my belt i stared into his eyes but they would not meet mine look at me boy fallen welshman recipient of an english pardon see what it does to me this place thomas jones brought up the butchers knife ran a thumb along the blade it was a play it could not be happening i must endeavour not to make him laugh i turned to gethin the sheriffs men will be here soon you do know that the sheriff he smiled patiently the sheriff at whose behest i was comfortably accommodated for a few hours until all the hotheads waiting to kill me had dispersed in whose covered cart i was safely conveyed beyond the boundaries of presteigne that sheriff how many murders do you want to be tried for this time this is murder gethin spread his hands oh i think not dr dee not in my country i saw that only he and thomas jones were standing on the higher ground the big man roberts was gone and then i heard his slow breathing from behind me even smelling it foul the reek of betrayal or did that come from the ground where a history of it glittered in the very dew wheres lord dudley i said you might as well tell me you owe me that much i owe nothing to you or any man of your mongrel race no one will ever know where lord dudley died and all that will remain of his body will be his cock the cock which impregnated the english queen for gods sake the queen to be dried and powdered and sold to make fertility potions for old men in england of course the queen i said has not given birth to dudleys child and neither did his wife after ten years of marriage he seemed not to hear me nodded to thomas jones who looked uncomfortable weighing the long knife in two hands one clasped over the other because of the shortness of the wooden handle wouldnt be the first time would it i said to gethin im thinking of the man you killed and chopped off his privy parts and cut off his face he talks drivel gethin said position him something spoken in welsh thomas jones nodding then gesturing toward an area of turf a yard or so out from his boots i am required to invite you john to kneel and bow your head i looked at the selected turf and backed away from it into the arms of gerallt roberts who pulled me close sharply and i felt what could only be his head butting the back of mine bursting open my wound and i must have screamed as i sank in agony to my knees what a night for this prys gethin said did you see the star earlier i witnessed it as i walked here crossed the whole of the sky like the one which fired the heavens just before the start of owains war youd know of that as an astrologer through the pain came outrage in a comet widely seen across europe had been viewed as a portent of the endtime but hailed by glyndwr as inscribing across the night sky the trajectory of his campaign id charted the frequency of comets and if thered been one this night i was no astronomer this man was mad and i could not believe that someone at the highest level of english government would bargain with him maybe it was the french or the spaniards or some unbalanced independent contender like the preening earl of arundel when you are ready prys gethin said it will be easier for all of us if you pull your hair to one side to enable a clean cut dont think to further demean your race by attempting to run or to struggle the end of it would be the same only bloodier for just a moment as i came stubbornly to my feet yet refusing to believe by some trick of the paling moon his empty socket seem to glow as if this imaginary comet burned inside his skull in such a man it could only portend horror and tragedy as it would li ragged white i stood swaying hands on my gut where the wigmore shewstone swelled out of my jerkin like a cyst thomas jones bent and laid down the butchers knife let me talk to him he said to gethin with some small privacy he was after all to have become my cousin gethin picked up the long knife make it swift he stood back and signalled to the big man to do the same thomas jones came forward not a weapon betwixt us i wondered if as a known sorcerer a curse from me might have any effect in such moments youll consider anything kneel john thomas jones said if you please piss off theres no way out of this thomas jones said and yet you know there is you know of these matters if you go quietly that will not happen you know that if you go quietly and with humility your soul will slip away from this place in peace and grace whereas if you resist and must needs be ignominiously cut down your embittered ghost will join all the other unquiet spirits which crowd brynglas like crows i would have had an answer for that and a good and informed one but then thomas jones was stepping away holding out a hand to gethin for the butchers knife hefting it from hand to hand testing its balance the big man roberts was come close behind me again the smell of his breath was worse at this moment than the stench of rotting flesh from the hole in the tump by the river i couldnt speak i stood swaying new blood stiff on my cheeks i was aware of gethin walking over heard his rich bladderpipe voice in welsh and then it broke off translate for him he said with no expression in his voice thomas jones did as bid john the prince of wales is with us now he who could never leave while the english yoke lies heavily upon us more welsh but all i heard was the voice of thomas jones from earlier not saying he lives but something of him does and if its anywhere its here and now having watched prys gethin sitting upon the hill as if in silent summons i was afraid i cleared my throat he was in his way i said a man of honour i believe my family might even have supported his cause and yet i looked into the powdery night twixt thomas jones and prys gethin he looks not happy and who would be knowing that his only representative on the hill of his finest day was a oneeyed twisted scut who a grunt from behind and an agony as if my skull were cleaved open but this time i stayed on my feet who cares not a toss for the future of wales but only to satisfy his need for do it prys gethin said when i knelt every muscle and sinew in my legs was straining against it the body fighting to live the mind in furious bitter conflict with itself over what to believe who to trust the need to hold on to the last small hope that a man youd liked whod ofttimes made you laugh was not after all to be your murderer his voice at my ear im trying to help you boy to give you the quick and merciful passing thats mete for a man of your standing shifting his gaze when i looked up at him i knelt in the wet turf and they stood in silence around me with my head bowed all i could see was their boots one pair worn by roberts were all smirched with mud and pine needles but not enough to obscure the fine leather and good stitching and oh god robbie when my head jerked the wound under my hair sprang apart yet again and blood begin to run down into my eyes when the head was severed it would stop i let the breath go from my chest to my abdomen beginning to pray and in my head against a cloth of deep blue the sigil of st michael appeared for a moment michael who brings courage michael who is also the angel of death weighing the soul conveying it to where it must go out of the corner of one eye i saw the knife leave the ground then i saw on the grey grass the shadow of a raised blade extended from bowed arms breath froze in my throat silence roared in my ears i saw the shadow of the blade at an oblique angle not the slender finehoned blade that beheaded anne boleyn in one stroke but a rude butchers knife made for mutton i fell into prayer as the shadowblade twitched once and then fell with the echo of a cry across the night then came a brutal blow my body tipping sideways my head fallen heavily into the grass all shadow moments of emptiness then wet splatter hot blood on my cheeks in my mouth in my eyes through it i saw the blade falling again and again and again more blood flying up up up john the hand of god reaching down for me i didnt move lay on my side looking up through the blood into the face of thomas jones his panicked eyes under a blur of madness and tears as he kicked me over on to my back get up john get the fuck up i could feel my hands fingers flexing and then moving with an exploratory slowness to my neck which somehow seemed yet to be held twixt my collar bones sitting up now in a pond of blood looking down on the body of the big man roberts heaving and squirming in the grass his face a dark red carnival mask and then flinching away from the sight of the thick blade coming down on him and i heard thomas jones sob and over the sickening splinter of bone i heard the vixen shriek it came down the hillside with all the force of an arrow that would pierce my heart and in a blinking i was struggling to my feet fresh blood was slicked under my boots and i stumbled and fell dragged myself up again scraping the salty blood from my eyes as i clambered up into the dregs of the night and there was prys gethin creeping through the muddy dawn quite some distance ahead of me close to the church something up there having trapped his attention a pale fluttering gethin still now standing dagger in hand feet apart waiting for the figure in the ragged white nightshirt to come down from the hill like a summoned ghost oh no oh dear god no i ran crookedly up the steepening side of brynglas stumbling twice and clawing at the grass knowing these two black and white would come together long before i could reach them i began to cry out urgently and was answered the way one owl answers another the nightshirt billowed the long bone was raised the vixen shriek resounded down the valley i saw what might have been the first pale rays of the rising sun in prys gethins blade as it was drawn quickly back and then pushed with a practised ease under the boys jaw saw gethin wipe the blade in the grass and stride away not once looking back at any of us lii the wasting i knew he was gone before i reached him the old white nightshirt lay around him like the flaccid feathers of a dead bird slowly turning red under the bloody light of early dawn his throat was laid open as were his mad unseeing eyes to the awakening day sick to my soul i came to my knees beside him he was quite still his spirit had flit as lightly as a moths i looked up in dread through the dimness for sign of his sister but there was none only her voice in my memory were country people if he wanders out in the night here as ofttimes he does i know hell come to no harm i threw my fist with savagery at the turf grief and pity turned into a useless rage as thomas jones arrived at my shoulder i looked up at him and at brynglas a melancholic grey without even the mystery of mist as though the last small hope of spiritual relief for this damned hill had lodged for a while in siôn ceddol and now was snuffed out thomas jones was painfully panting floridfaced still holding the butchers knife reddened to the handle whos this boy from the village armed my voice choked on the senseless wasteful cruelty of it armed with a i picked up the agebrowned thigh bone from where it lay close to siôn ceddols halfcurled left hand id not noticed he was left handed a sinistral though doubtless the rector would have another unfailing sign of the demonic to gethin hed have looked unearthly in the half light like an angel hell kill anyone in his path now thomas jones said you know that then he was bent over coughing wretchedly his hands bloodied to the wrists the cuffs of his doublet blackened he came up pointing towards the thickness of pines to the left of the church went through there the woods not the churchyard this brought me to my feet dizzied for a moment too long without sleep and bleeding from the head the sky was the colour of ale no sun yet i looked down at siôn ceddol and his favourite bone his open throat i swallowed bile ill go after him took the butchers knife its handle all clammy with blood and worse we l l go thomas jones had me by the shoulders listen remember this dont think to appeal to his reason its gone in the ruins of his mind all is justified what did he say to you in welsh he said that only one of us need die i weighed the odds and they werent good ive seen roberts take three men down in a street brawl i did all i could think to do which was to go with him until the moment came and what if the moment had not come what if gethins attention had not been snared by the vixen shriek and the fluttering figure in white who unknowingly may have given his life for mine i turned back towards the upper part of the hill the high pines still black on the skyline whats up there thomas jones said im not sure i dont know maybe the rectors house along with the wasting of an innocent life maybe the most innocent the thin brown light of dawn had brought a mournful uncertainty the pines closed around us like the pillars of a rude temple wandering from tree to tree apparel stiffened with dried and drying blood saying nothing we must have looked like warsick soldiers escaping the fray moving with caution now as most of the trees were well grown enough to hide a man id no wish for us to die foolishly at gethins hands if he died at ours id feel no regret but how likely was that we were softskinned men who lived in books even thomas jones nowadays and one of us vainly courted the angelic the man we sought had skin like a lizards was wellpractised in the art of killing driven by devils the wood was deeper than it had appeared from the slope below the church it crested brynglas and continued down the northern flank could be that these pines had grown upon the land where rhys gethins fiery army had waited for edmund mortimers trained soldiers yeomen and peasants and the welsh archers who knew or yet did not what theyd do when the moment came maybe this was also where the women waited the women who travelled with gethins heroes and were said to have come scurrying down after the battle with their little knives standing in that clearing under a whitening sky i threw down the butchers knife in horrified realisation of the recent carnage it had performed in the saving of the unworthy life of a conjurer who might never know what hed conjured a seer who saw nothing beyond the physical the wigmore shewstone was a useless weight in the front pouch of my jerkin had it not been for my futile pursuit of advancement and the engines of creation we would not have come here and siôn ceddol would yet live let not this place be tainted by your presence said rector daunce perhaps after all with prescience i kicked the knife away and the blade came to rest at the bottom of one of the pines around which a john rope was tied i felt a drumming in my chest this was not the old and rotting hemp you might expect to find at the heart of a wood but new rope strong rope bending to it i saw that other shorter lengths lay nearby tossed among the needles and cones on top not embedded someone was roped to this tree and then cut loose and not long ago thomas jones said was this it dudleys prison i picked up a strand of rope its ragged end was brown with blood and almost at once across the clearing i saw the reason he lay twixt two young pines on the edge of the clearing where it was beginning to thicken into something approaching forestry he was most conspicuously dead face down in a bolster of browning needles a pond of blood beneath and around him and barefooted i shut my eyes in anguish close to weeping with despair i followed thomas jones across the clearing to the corpse he took a breath of pine wood and bent among the days first flies stabbed in more than one place but not freshly the pond of blood beneath him was congealed like a blackberry preserve or efficiently looks to me like the mortal injuries inflicted in a fight pine needles glued together by black blood a trail thomas jones stood up then bent and turned the body over stood looking down hands on hips john if you thought this was i turned slowly in the oily light the dead mans eyes were open an ooze of blood linked nose and mouth a young man maybe not yet twentyfive id never seen him before the breath went out of me gwyn roberts thomas jones said you think dudley the ropes cut gwyns stabbed to death in what looks like a fight i dont and his boots taken i said you may not have noticed but the older roberts was wearing riding boots of the finest quality dudleys in one of which he keeps a blade in his boot used to anyway hed shown it to me two or three years ago on an older pair the thin sheath stitched into a seam of leather to fit beside the calf the dagger it concealed had been no more than five inches long including the bone handle new boots but he wouldnt have abandoned an old precaution robert dudley was as superstitious as anyone i knew maybe he guessed theyd take his boots for their value and to render him more helpless maybe he retrieved the knife from the boot after theyd searched him i know not so its likely he lives thomas jones said or lived i said if gethin passed this way i walked back into the clearing wiping my mouth on a sleeve not daring to think there was cause for hope finally snatching up the bloodied knife from which it seemed that destiny that twisted joker had decreed there could be no parting flies sticking to it now coming out of the pine wood some minutes later we found ourselves closer to the church of st mary than id expected an ominous quiet was hung upon the air dawn birdsound was distant and thin thomas jones went to the holy well to wash but i sank to my knees in the grass sucking dew into my dry mouth this was the second dawn id seen since sleeping and i knew not when id ever felt as weary wet faced i walked around the front of the little grey church to the now familiar view over the cauldron of hills down the battlefield of brynglas becoming aware of movement villagers gathering a dozen or more including several women on the hill under the dirtybruised skin of the sky i saw old goodwife thomas and gareth puw the blacksmith and others i recognised but could not name but there was no sign of vaughan or price and his sons only some distance away something still as a sculpted tableau in the grass which no one approached siôn ceddols head lolled in his sisters lap her own head bowed her dense brown hair down around her face and his she did not seem to see any of them kneeling in an island of grief to which none could cross stabbing the knife into the ground i stood between the small trees on the edge of the churchyard from where wed watched prys gethin summoning his demons maybe it was through fatigue or because i did blame myself for the boys killing that i didnt go down there was nothing i could say to her not in front of the villagers the boy was slain and i could not bring him back who is she john thomas jones had come round from the well hed stripped away his ruined doublet stood in his shirt the sleeves rolled up blood streaks not fully washed from his arms anna let siôns head slip from her lap and laying it tenderly in the turf slowly arose her overdress was darkened at the thighs her lips parted in a soundless distress his mother sister he was there was something missing in his mind but something else there that we dont have a bar of sunlight split the fleshy cloud lighting the hillside i turned my head away blinded for the moment and then thomas jones was pulling me back twixt the trees speaking quietly do nothing a hundred paces below us prys gethin had emerged like a sprite from the pines i reached for the butchers knife but we were too far away and already it was too late liii untethered black now against the rosening sun whose rays for a moment seemed to sprout from his shoulders like small wings of dark fire dark angel rising his movements had been so swift and easy that he was already half a dozen paces down the hill taking anna ceddol with him the blade which had penetrated her brothers throat now at her own stay where you are john thomas jones murmured voice very low heavy with warning gethin had twisted her head to his chest was pulling her backwards one of the women cried out i saw gareth puw the blacksmith taking steps towards him and then reeling back at what gethin had done annas overdress was parted at the top a single red petal blooming above her shift i drew savage breath as the blade was lifted rededged freshlysharpened gethin said the piping voice was light and clear risen into a kind of rapture i made out his fingers and thumb tight around anna ceddols jaw as if he were squeezing juice from an orange as if his whole body was revelling in the sensation of it bright bells pealing in his head who wishes he sang to see the ease with which it severs a breast do not move thomas jones hissed if he sees either of us coming hell do it anyone gethins voice risen higher and now he faced the pines from which men were emerging roger vaughan stephen price no further gethin said or her lifeblood flows harm her stephen price said hoarsely and youll be torn apart by all of us not before shes dead and more of you with her even from this distance i saw gethins smile open up a split in the wood the silence around him was waxen prices round face was pale and sagging helpless a whole community held at bay by one man who believed himself more than a man who looked like more than a man i sensed a demon moving inside a puppet of skin untethered thomas jones said from all human constraint anna ceddol sagged in gethins grip my breath was rapid my thoughts feverish it would be unwise to kill her now hed know that but i didnt doubt that hed deform her and take pleasure in it i wondered if i could cross from the church to the pines go further down the hill from price and vaughan maybe come out behind him thomas jones said whatever youre thinking i know i know hed moved too far away from the pines wherever i was coming from hed see me running out and his knife hand would twitch and then gethin spoke so quietly that i caught only half of it who i want the sun had gone in gethin waited until out of the pines not too far from the churchyard where we stood came the ruins of a man his long face discoloured lips cut and swollen one eye enpurpled and abulge with blood one arm bound up in a sling illmade of rope a man so beaten he could no longer stand aright it took me a moment even me so let her go the voice was a rasp against dry stone prys gethin said wheres your blade a stillness for maybe three heartbeats then something dropped to the turf further out gethin said robert dudley looked down for a moment and then stepped over the body of siôn ceddol you with anna ceddols head crooked in an elbow gethin pointed with the tip of his blade at roger vaughan come out even from here i marked the terror in vaughans face as he left the shelter of the pine wood glancing behind him at prices face impassive take the rope from his arm gethin said do it or she yes vaughan put up his hands found the knot in the sling no resistance from dudley and no scream when his arm was freed only a tightening of the mouth that might have cracked teeth the way the arm fell from the rope made clear that it was broken prys gethin pointed his blade at the rope where it lay on the ground pick it up bind his hands behind his back price said but his arms do it the blade moved against annas throat bind it tight dudleys face creasing pale as cloud as he bit down on his agony whilst the binding was done now take his boots gethin said dudley sniffed kicked off one of gwyn robertss boots it came easily from his foot he said something that i took to be derogatory about welsh leather and i felt a foolish admiration for him this absurd hauteur in the face of imminent death id kept looking down the hill and across the valley for a sign of the hundred armed men promised by john forest nothing betrayal at every level i felt the wigmore shewstone pressing through the worn fabric of my jerkin into my abdomen reminding me how all this had started in the noble cause of expanding the queens vision would she ever know how it had ended vaughan knelt and pulled off the second boot you can go back now gethin said with the tip of his knife he beckoned dudley forward some women were turned away looking at the ground averting their eyes from an expected execution thomas jones looked at me baffled he cant kill dudley whilst holding the woman if he lets the woman go some of these men may try and take him and succeed but gethin didnt let the woman go he pointed down the hill towards the river sent dudley limping barefoot ahead of him i hear anyone following us gethin said and you know what will happen his fucking minds gone thomas jones said he cant do this he cannot do it on his own the progress was slow and awkward gethin holding anna ceddol tight and the knife tighter dudley shuffling and stumbling a few feet in front head thrown back in obvious agony then either he believes himself not alone i said or he isnt as they crossed the hill and entered a small copse of birch and rowan i saw that the petal on annas breast was become a rose in full bloom i seized the butchers knife tell them where ive gone i said where for gods sake you know where liv i ran down the oak woods primitive cloister early light flickered amongst the dry leaves and acorns under what felt like someone elses racing feet running against sombre reason and the cold denial of the puritans running against a sorry sense of my own failings running hardest of all against the images crowding into the minds poor glass the blade at the womans throat the blooming of the bloodflower at the start of a second day without sleep or much food i was become a creature of little more than air while the world was a faerie blur the dark oaks swelling and then shrinking before me like illusions in the distorting mirror i keep in my library at mortlake emerging from the wood on to the sheepcropped turf i ran in a fever calling upon an archangels energy throwing his sigil into the air pure white against the small pale sun and the stillvisible moon waxing close to full i ran panting like a hound and bathed with sweat and prayer until i stopped before the alien green of the old tump in the rivers bend knowing id be here a good while before gethin and his captives by daylight it was clear the hole in the side had been redug in haste the displaced soil lay in two heaps either side of it the cut turves lain against the bottom of the tump there was still a stench of putrefaction but nowhere near as strong as it had been last night whod dug it out again the roberts boys i could see no other explanation it would be done here the corpse tidily tucked into the earth then across the river theyd all go and away into the real wales i prayed that thomas jones was assembling those who would understand ready to move fast i prayed that dudley had some reserve of ingenuity i prayed to god and christ and the holy virgin and the archangel michael that anna ceddol would not lose her life turning my back on the hole i saw the bough which had ploughed the furrow in my head upthrust from the twisted bole of a thorn tree grown from the foot of the tump picked up a forked twig its bark stripped away by my head before the twig was snapped from the tree in my helpless writhing only good can fight evil and god knows there was little enough of it in me against all my rage i sought to gather in all the good id met or heard around brynglas hill the souls of father walter and marged the wisewoman and the unknown anchoress said to have lived where the church now stood by the shrine of the virgin who i visualised unsmirched and shining blessing the pure spring below conjuring a peace over brynglas a blue glow upon its slopes on which the sigil in my mind was etched the twig twisted in my hands lit by a shaft of amber sunlight my arms afire before the light was in an instant extinguished from above i dropped the twig who are you i said he came awkwardly down from the tump as if his limbs were afflicted by the gnarling sickness symptoms not apparent the last time id seen him he wore a peasants apparel sacking around his waist where the apron had been he looked tired his greywhite hair in disarray was like to the tonsure he must once have worn he was i realised much older than id thought maybe seventy maybe more too old for a satyr ah dr dee he said wearily i feel youre determined to do me harm the local accent was all gone i recalled that hed been educated at oxford his background may indeed have been wealthy and privileged if as bishop bonner thought hed actually bought his position of supremacy at wigmore abbey i followed him around to the sweeterscented side of the tump where the air was merely autumnally damp in truth i hadnt expected him id thought it might be daunce youre all aglow my boy he said look like a priest whos just celebrated the mass merely tired i said abbot it was true that i felt light and separate from my body yet my mind freed from its weight had a piercing focus and when john smart raised his hands i felt it was in defence rather than benediction call me martin he said abbots are of the past i looked around warily youre alone i thought we should talk somewhere only the faeries can overhear us help me i said where are they safe i believe except for gethin who is dead i stared at him the former abbot whod stolen church gold sold the buildings around him ran whores its too late for lies john smart said i can show you his body if you like though id guess youve seen enough of them for one morning and its not pretty he put out his own eye with his dagger the last good eye with some rage so that the blade would seem to have proceeded into his brain a swifter end than perhaps he deserved and too easy where was this in a dingle about half a mile from the hill not ten minutes ago why would he the presteigne boys out all night in the hills and angry for some reason he thought they were on his side let them take the woman so mistress ceddol safe i believe you believe she ran away she was not hurt not more than she had been anyway master roberts the socalled master roberts is taken by cart back to presteigne where ill find a better bedchamber for his recovery a wry smile with glass in its windows as befits his status i was watching his hands both exposed both empty no sign of weaponry im not lying to you dee why would gethin think that abbot that the angry boys from presteigne were on his side call me martin odd is it not the way mens minds work in extremis jesu smart you werent even born here and you cant give a straight answer to a straight question met scory last night he said for the first time still in town after giving evidence to the court this was before you arrived all full of wild accusations smart chuckled poor old bradshaw he was far more surprised than i was i sighed what did you discuss with scory talked about the problems of survival in the church in a time of constant change scorys less adventurous than me in my younger days but he likes to as you might say put some modest items discreetly in store for his future comfort but thats an aside it seemed the bishop of hereford knew more about abbot smart and his circumstances than hed confided to me what a bag of adders the church of england already was become good man scory make no mistake john smart said but as he may have indicated to you working the welsh borderlands does require a certain adaptability hes become quite exercised over the conduct of this man daunce who it might be said has too much god in him more energy in smart now his cheeks pinkened i said once again why did gethin think the presteigne boys were on his side the sun had broken through again smart clapped his hands what a fine morning this is become he peered at me are you sure you havent performed some kind of invocation dr dee all manner of stories are told about you most of them exaggerated i know the feeling i think you knew mistress ceddol did i but how well did you know prys gethin i knew not where this question came from maybe id thought back to what bonner had said about simony the ordination of fifty paying candidates a small coterie of thoroughly reprehensible followers or maybe it was given to me by the archangel michael was he at the abbey of wigmore i said was he given holy orders smart said gethin trusted the presteigne boys because id told him he could and because i was with them my thanks i said now to go back to my previous question smarts face had visibly darkened his eyes grown still he looked down at what i yet held the butchers knife laden with dried blood i let go of it and it fell to my feet bounced and slid in the slick grass towards the foot of the tump thank you smart said this is very much not the place to keep a weapon too close or an obsessive killer gods tears smart you cant just tell me what you want me to know and expect me to take my nose out of your stinking midden and walk away smart sighed at last there were times in the years before and during the reform when an abbot of the welsh borderlands was in need of personal protection i was i suppose threatened more than most in divers ways you ordained him as your guard he shrugged knowing what he was all right it was not my holiest act look dee if youve seen the report made to cromwell that was not fully accurate but some of it had foundation i knew it was coming i knew cromwell was committed to taking virtually all of us down the abbeys by whatever means and i knew thered be no great difficulty doing it to me id already journeyed to london cwtching up to the wily bastard offering my services in what way matter of survival dee im not proud of it not my behaviour then nor my behaviour now although old jeremy martin is a different man and a good innkeeper generous with his ale and cider and ever offering a nights sleep to those in need he smiled and then it died an innkeeper hears everything an innkeeper with a host of old acquaintances and friends in london is able to form an impression of whats taking shape under his nose and use it when it came to my notice that certain men were entrusting the man now known as prys gethin with a task of considerable delicacy lets say i thought it was illadvised and might rebound on whom i remember what he did in my defence twenty years ago when he was little more than a boy in those days his excuse would have been that he was doing it for the church now hes been all for wales smart sat down on the edge of the tump as though the burden of his past were become too much to support once made the mistake of going whoring with him learning that we had very different needs later a particular canon who sought to gather evidence of my misconduct had an accident after a while even i was in dismay over the depth of the boys depravity quite relieved when our ways diverged we sat in silence for a while i knew that everything hed told me might later be denied i wanted him to hang smart said i did not want him back in my life and when after he was freed the sheriff brought him to me as hed apparently requested what did you do what do you think i did i greeted him cordially as an old friend with great celebration fed him well and gave him drink told him how much i was in his debt for all hed done for me twenty years ago said id help him any way i could of course you did and in time he told me where he wanted to go and i took him partway there hidden in my cart saying id return for him in the morning with trusted friends men he could rely on the presteigne boys regular customers of mine in the lower parlour roisterers streetfighters as i said jeremy martin is ever generous with ale and cider and a bed for the night and they were the first hunting party to return to presteigne this was after you and your welsh friend had left much competition that night over whod find prys gethin so i told them id received information as to his whereabouts and could perhaps lead them there giving them more drink before we rode off you know where he was going you knew his plans smart smiled and tapped his nose best outcome dee we dont need another trial not for a while and you dont need to know any more about my role in gethins demise just as in the matter of master roberts i have no need at all to know who he is i walked with smart to the nantygroes bridge where the presteigne boys waited with the horses and his cart the day was brighter now though the sky was white when we were in first sight of the company i brought the shewstone from my bloodied jerkin quite alarmed at how full of heat it was having spent the whole night next to my lower abdomen yes i know which is the home of the second mind where lie the deepest feelings the unspoken perceptions there must needs be a close bond twixt the crystal and the scryer my friend jack simm the apothecary had said i wondered if at this moment in its swirling depths the sigil of st michael would be aglow when i gave the stone back to john smart he accepted it without a word and i was glad the circumstance was not right it was not the time although in some odd way it had served a purpose i said you scry abbot martin he said call me martin no i dont scry that was another of his tasks i gethin he saw in the stone he saw what would come at my house in the abbey wed spend whole hours before the stone thomas jones had said gethin was reputed to have the sight but gods tears this was his stone no its mine but he was the scryer a scryer need not be a spiritual man or so i thought i also thought to ask if he had acquaintance with a certain brother elias but guessed thered be no straight answer he stowed the stone away in his saddlebag should you ever have need of a scryer dee id advise you to have a care over whom you choose i did not look at the presteigne boys i nodded and turned away and walked back towards the river of light i lay flat on its bank hanging down reaching to splash bright water on my face when i went back to the tump the hole the wound in its side had collapsed in upon itself and the stench had gone leaving only the sharp bitter essence of autumn lv for tonight all wide awake now and in need of someone with whom to talk it all through i walked up through the cloistered oaks to the church and sat on the step below our lady of pilleth her demure chipped face shone through a dappled haze and a rediscovered beatific smile which led me to suppose that roger vaughan had been back there was no sign of matthew daunce with whom id nothing to discuss i let my head fall into my hands it no longer bled or ached so badly but whatever part of it enclosed my creative thoughts felt beaten thin as an old drumskin id bathed my head and eyes again this time with water from the holy well unable to shake off the vibrant feeling that id been used had been for a short time part of some engine of change or was it illusion i saw how circumstance had completed most of the preparations required for an invocation fasting selfdenial and the many hours without sleep that would separate me from this world leaving me open to the higher spheres and yet there are things i still cant comprehend i told the virgin i know not what was here before you how far it all goes back how brynglas became a place of healing before it was a place of killing where lies the power was there some energy in the very earth which was released in places such as this for the healing of the body and the expansion of human thought perhaps it had begun not here at all but with the river and the tump that was raised within its curve with whoever had been buried there at a time when there were no english and the word welsh meaning obscurely foreigner or stranger had not been invented had that been pilleths golden time and when was it turned bad when was the tump become a cauldron of spiritual pestilence from the second sphere and the hill was its natural vigour fouled by that single act of treachery by the welsh bowmen or was this ruinous reversal of allegiance as the church burned itself effected by something here already become malign all i knew was that the roiling air of betrayal seemed to have become an engine in itself a pestilence possessed of a dark intelligence which was become manifest in extremes of thought extremes of behaviour only held in balance by a mingling of spiritual disciplines as divers as the pulleys that made my mortlake owls flap their wings and make hoot i thought of the fevered swooping of the women with their knives wondering if it was even true or just corrosive gossip of the kind that had the queen pregnant with dudleys child how could it ever be proved when privy parts have no bones i looked up into the lowered eyelids of the stone mother are we able to reverse it i asked her is it in our power to restore life and health to this valley a shadow was fallen across the virgin and me and i turned and looked up into open eyes the colour a sky is meant to be in summer i was looking for you anna ceddol said her wet hair hung black as a ravens wings she pushed it back behind her ears must have washed it to be rid of the blood in the river or one of siôns wells too quiet see she said too quiet at the bryn they told me to try and sleep so i took a potion but i could not sleep for the quiet i rose to my feet i understood she faced me wethaired dryeyed they say you saw it done i nodded it was very quick gone like a moth a butterfly i saw what might be about to happen and ran hes in the church she said quickly on the bier does daunce daunce has been summoned to presteigne anna ceddol said where the bishop lodges i know not where siôn will lie ill talk to the bishop i said if its necessary knowing i must needs talk to him anyway about many things they say hes killed anna said the welshman they say he killed himself were you not there when he let me go i ran away i saw no more of him its as well i said he killed without a thought he was driven by a demonic madness the man who you and the shepherd found all cut about the man stephen price buried to prevent panic he can only have been killed by gethin anna ceddol looked down at the stain on her dress then up at the statue of the virgin no she said mercy no more lies youve been good to me i wont no i said i may have brought a terrible sorrow to you and everyone here stephen price saw me as a saviour but i think in truth that im just part of the curse i wont lie to you she said as if i hadnt spoken i know how that man died and i know how he was cut about i stared at her because i cut him her voice was soft as moss i took his apparel and then i set about his face with a spade my body jerked back against the statues stone robe what are you saying so that no one would ever know who he was she said rapidly that he was my father and siôns father listen i said you dont have to tell me any of this itll go no further but you still dont have to tell me no one will ever know any of it from me she looked up at the statue the holy mother will know tomos ceddol the man who anna had told me had courted her mother but was deemed by her mothers parents as not of their level who when annas mother died had begun to drink to excess who had been driven to violence by the ravings of their youngest child barely weaned when his mother had died not true anna said she was not his mother when she died i was already with child i was twelve years old oh dear god she was unwell for nearly a year my mother after a while he began to touch me hed get drunk on strong ale he was a big man resisting him would only lead did lead to injury she was hardly the first this had happened to hardly the first whod gone on to give birth to her own fathers child i believed that most women stayed made the best of it at least until the child was old enough to leave home but this child would never be old enough to leave and anna would blame her father for the boys idiocy her father and herself when i found out i was with child i tried to make away with him went to a wise woman in the next village who charged me all i had for a potion that made me sick for days but the babe continued to grow it wasnt until he was nearly two years that i knew he must be damaged in the head and knew why you dont know that i said but she seemed not to hear shed never let her father touch her again shed been sleeping with a kitchen knife since first learning there was a child on the way the night shed found him kicking siôn to quieten him that was true enough and happened just as shed told me what she hadnt told me was that when they left home taking all his money tomos ceddol had gone in search of them this was why theyd moved from village to village down the border he found you i said he found you here id become careless it was over twelve years since wed left id thought hed surely given up found a woman somewhere i thought we were safe in the bryn the first real home wed had his approach had been slow and careful at first hed watched for whole nights from the oak wood one of the thomas boys had seen him twice thought him a thief though nobody was ever robbed not then i imagined tomos ceddol catching sight of his daughter even more beautiful than hed remembered all the money hed spent trying to find her she was his daughter and the father of his child who should have been disposed of long ago gods tears the night he broke in he was drunk having found a barrel of cider left over from the harvest festival they heard later hed been driven out of his own village after two rapes although the women would not name him anna ceddol stopped as though that were the end of the story how did he die i said at last in dread of the answer not that you have to nor will i i awoke and he was in my bed naked and some men some have thinner skulls than others siôn had done this struck his father with the thigh bone it took me about three hours get him out to the hill anna said i had to do it myself he didnt find that man shed said of siôn he wouldnt even come out that day he was afraid and clung to the fire i smashed his face with the spade and then took the spade to him down there bore it on the spade into the wood i suppose the pigs ate it pedr morgan found him next day and his wife came to me to ask what we should do i thought of stephen price whod buried tomos ceddol not knowing who he was buried him twice in the tump why because it was the only place i could think of where the mad boy wouldnt find him but no one lay easy in the tump she felt what he wanted to do to her felt it inside i would talk to scory this was a matter for a priest of the old kind someone practised in the cure of souls come home with me anna ceddol said please come home with me for tonight part five here the vulgar eye will see nothing but obscurity and will despair considerably john dee monas hieroglyphica lvi from an angel he refused wine accepting small beer there was a ring of blood around the pupil of his left eye no longer wearing mourning though his apparel was of earth colours hed ridden alone to mortlake and i wondered if this meant he no longer feared for his life or if he no longer cared i wondered if hed been shown the letter from thomas blount i wondered if hed tell me if he had i wondered too much there was an unseasonably close air for that time of year when late afternoon and evening are become one and the traffic of wherries on the river is thinned dudley leaned back on the bench in my workroom the long board betwixt us his shoulders against the wall so you gave it back ofttimes you dont choose the stone jack simm had said reporting the words of elias the scryer the stone chooses you i didnt remind dudley of this my feeling was that if that stone had chosen me it was not for anything good but it hadnt anyway it had been given either as a bribe for my silence or i didnt know enough about the properties of crystal though i could almost feel its weight again pressed against the bottom of my gut the lower mind had my clumsy if heartfelt invocation of the archangel in some way altered its vibration altered me for altered i was smarts scryer was gethin i said and that taints it who can say what was invoked through gethins madness who knows what lived in him youd really want to risk loosing something uncertain into the queens all right a gloved hand was raised a frown flickering across dudleys damaged face i understand im already accused of carrying some satanic spore so ill bow to your superior knowledge of the hidden i sighed for the first time in years im beginning to wonder if i truly you do his bloodied eyes hardened never forget that or youll be begging on the fucking streets i said nothing could only wonder if such a simple life as that might not be preferable too many things which my poor mind was unable to arrange into the roughest of geometric patterns i was humbled id lost all faith in the power of my library i lowered my hands and stared into them watching them tremble i suppose another crystal stone will come when im deemed ready if ever gethin dudley said fixed me with his eye and said id be dead within the week and instead he is i said carefully did you see it done saw his body saw it loaded on to a handcart not what id asked a silence the air was like sand i suppose dudley said that i owe you my life not me thomas jones perhaps tell me i dont have to thank him i doubt hell be holding his breath in anticipation how are you now better as good as his word for once john smart had indeed provided for dudleys recovery a good bedchamber with window glass but not at the bull how you could stay with the doxy after what she branwen laetitia swift dudley said almost fondly did she give you a potion did she aid in your abduction all this yet worried me how could smart in his role as her fishmonger and former associate of gethins not have been part of it the most likely explanation it seemed to me now was that smart had not realised for a while how high the plot went maybe not realised that the target was lord robert dudley panicked when he found out lets say i thought it was illadvised and might rebound on him and his comfortable retirement who knows dudley said i was taken in the street hit from behind thrown into an alley dragged out as if drunk and then beaten tied down in a cart he drained his cup dont want to talk about it it demeans me did it i was inclined to think that now he was out of it he found it perversely flattering the lengths to which theyd gone and that coming through it had strengthened his cause hed remained with mistress swift until he was fit enough to mount a horse his broken arm still bound three days dudley healed quickly and ever thought the best of women and they of him she had new boots made for me he said man mustve been working day and night with a sheath in the side wed not discussed this for all his soldierly training i suspected this might have been the first time hed actually fought for his life youd taken out the blade after they searched you but before they stole the boots as obviously they would boots of such quality secreted the blade into my sleeve it took a couple of painful hours but eventually i had the ropes stripped to a thread when the older man left us alone it was the obvious time the boy had been taunting me in his halting english how theyd be cutting off my cock and what theyd do with it so they knew who you were evidently it delighted them lost count of the beatings his jaw tightening at the memory when the moment came the boy made the first move when his brother hadnt returned by first light he was on his feet blade out i think hed have cut my throat if i hadnt snapped the threads and not at my best i have to say but with surprise on my side he shrugged you seen cecil since your return he hasnt summoned me nor had his muscle come to snatch me into a barge cecils silence had said all i needed to hear however i said a royal barge did arrive this morning jesu dudley sat up hard with a clacking of the benchfeet on the flags bess my mother also had wondered as much and had been driven into a panic i shook my head blanche my cousin the queens senior gentlewoman and closest confidante a social visit much circumspect bordertalk with never a mention of either astrology or wedding dates dudley leaned forward across the board you told her everything dudley expelled a long long breath hells bells john who better i said she wont tell the queen unless it becomes necessary but she might have words with cecil you clever bastard he sat back smiling again what about legge did he know why he was sent to presteigne only to an extent id guess hed simply know his duty was to see that gethin was acquitted hes not a fool had he asked too many questions well would he even have arrived back in london how would he not with several dozen armed men it would take but one man i said to smother him in his chamber during some overnight gods bollocks john i always took you for an innocent me too i said ruefully what will you do now soon wishing i hadnt asked in some awful way fortified convinced that god had brought him through for only one purpose what hed do was to continue as before in pursuit of his lifes goal a spear of late sunlight lit the glass eyes of my finest owl sitting stately on his window sill the one that flapped his wings and said woowoo as we walked down to the thames dudleys limp was barely perceptible he stood tall again oh dear god well of course i wont give up he said i said nothing the last barge of the day was returning empty to the mortlake brewery as we went down the steps to the rivers edge gather im to be honoured quite soon how earldom and if that doesnt make me more of a candidate for besss hand or it might be a compensation i said bollocks you could waste your life john he turned to face me his face half in shadow it is my life its me or no one shes told you that had it from an angel dudley said when hed gone i sat on the top step and watched an olive mist floating over the water he hadnt mentioned the letter from thomas blount even before this id begun to wonder whether john forest had even shown it to him perhaps forest had been to blount and cautioned against revealing intelligence suggesting amy dudley had been unfaithful to her husband and on the most intimate terms with her murderer that would most certainly demean him if it became public knowledge and what would it achieve if dudley knew murder by some spanish assassin could never be proven now there was little doubt that the inquest jury would return a verdict of death by accident forest had perhaps reminded blount that messengers were apt to be blamed he himself had been embarrassed on his return from ludlow with twentyfive armed men to find that dudley was back in presteigne and had commanded him without explanation to return to london my own greatest regret was that id not insisted on seeing gethins body i did not trust john smart who only wanted to protect his business and the reputation of jeremy martin while i had no doubt that gethin was dead i realised that he was only dead in the sense that his hero owain glyndwr was dead no one knew where his body lay and perhaps no one ever would which would make a legend of him stories told to children that he would one day return this black sprite if the spiritual defences of brynglas were ever lowered and how could they be lower than they were now while dudley had lain at the home of branwen laetitia swift roger vaughan and i had met with bishop john scory in the privacy of the church in presteigne scory with many threats and much bad feeling was in the process of prising matthew daunce out of pilleth and would choose his successor with care the statue would be scrubbed and the church lightened with more windows daunce he said would doubtless go to london where he had friends at the heart if you could ever call it that of the new puritanism i suspected his clerical career would rise it was the way things were going pilleth however would require spiritual ministry of a more traditional kind an old magic john scory asked my advice as he had about the mysterious map of the world id told him that brynglas and its environs were no less mysterious to me now a lesson to be learned i said id write in some detail to scory when id given it more thought its part of me now that place and i think i may have to return ere long after siôn ceddol was buried not far from the church id sought to persuade anna to return with me to london but had known it was unlikely by christmas id learn in a letter from stephen price that she was betrothed to a schoolmaster in hereford within three weeks of my return home thomas jones came to mortlake with my cousin joanne and we discussed these matters in some depth i was intrigued to learn that five parish churches in the area of pilleth and the radnor forest were dedicated to the archangel michael which made me wonder if id not been drawn that strange and tragic morn into some archaic circus of power long buried who can say yet while the wigmore shewstone remained there i did take something away which i was able to demonstrate to thomas jones and hoped one day to show to the queen in the gardens at richmond the first instinct of it had been beside the tump when the twig which had scored my head had twitched in my hand in my mothers garden at mortlake i found forked twigs of birch and hazel with which to my great joy i was able to discover a new well betwixt our orchard and the church on another occasion when goodwife faldo lost not a ring thank god but a copper brooch i was able to find it for her in the hedge by the road leading to the brewery by walking with the twig held out before me and awaiting its response feeling my wrists seized by an unknown force learning by trial that i should simply let it happen for when i tried to study how it happened it would not it was about setting aside all intellect several times id swear that when my wrists moved i would look up and think id caught a bright bobbing movement over a hedge or a wall like the progress of a red hat but of course this was in my mind for i do not see the end notes and credits a year after it was opened the inquest into the death of amy dudley did indeed end as john dee expected with a verdict of accidental death it made no difference dudley would never marry elizabeth most of the theories about amys death are explored in depth in death and the virgin by chris skidmore and elizabeth and leicester by sarah gristwood a letter dated august a fortnight before her death from amy to her dressmaker places an order for the alteration of a velvet gown in these increasingly secular times its easy to underestimate the influence of religion superstition and magic in tudor england and wales often advances in science only added credibility to the concept of magic for anyone still sceptical the classic religion and the decline of magic by keith thomas and the archconjurer of england by glyn parry will explain everything in scholarly detail once again i also relied on the queens conjurer by benjamin woolley john dee by richard deacon john dee the world of an elizabethan magus by peter j french and the occult philosophy in the elizabethan age by frances yates some informed speculation about the dee dwelling at mortlake can be found in john dee of mortlake by nicholas dakin published by the barnes and mortlake history society damon albarns music for his opera dr dee shows a sympathetic understanding of mortlakes finest and is well worth a listen dees abilities as a dowser are fairly well chronicled john aubrey records how hed find missing items for his mortlake neighbour goodwife faldo the faldo family of mortlake were longtime neighbours of john dee and his mother it may have been the daughterinlaw of the goodwife faldo mentioned in this manuscript who as an old woman gave an account of the tall goodlooking and generous dr dee to aubrey dees scrying sessions in later life with the medium edward kelley are well chronicled he apparently told people his crystal had come from the angels but where his scrying activities began is less certain the queens interest is well known as is her visit to dees house to examine his scrying equipment for herself its likely she was accompanied on this visit by robert dudley the beryl in the british museum may have been dees or may not dowsing is the only fringepsychic gift he appeared to have possessed thanks to ced jackson john moss graham gardner and helen lamb of the british society of dowsers for background and caitlin sagan for the bm pictures the story of how presteigne became the assize town of radnorshire is well documented the mid wales organisedcrime syndicate plant mat based in a cave in the devils bridge area of ceredigion accepted responsibility for the murder of a judge at rhayader and some of its members were subsequently hunted down the prices did finish their new home still known as monaughty and still the most impressive elizabethan house in radnorshire standing alone in a curve of the road from knighton to penybont john dee is recorded as visiting wigmore in when he found discarded manuscripts which he considered to be of some value in the remains of the chapel at wigmore castle already falling into ruin today the castle is far more visible than the abbey the abbots house is now the home of john and carol challis who were kind enough to show us around and put me on to abbot smart more of whose alleged misdeeds were uncovered by john grove of the mortimer history society roger vaughan went on to become mp for radnorshire and in the s bought kinnersley castle just over the english border which he restored extensively putting in large windows to flood its rooms with light a ceiling decorated with esoteric symbols in its moulding is said to have been designed by john dee as dee was not known as an interior decorator it can only be assumed that if he was the designer it was meant to serve some protective purpose but thats another story five years later in local merchant john beddoes after whom presteigne high school is named left an area of land the rent from which is still used to pay for the ringing of the nightly curfew but that was another book twm siôn cati thomas jones of tregaron is still a wellknown folk hero in southwest wales often celebrated as the welsh robin hood he was pardoned by elizabeth not long after she came to the throne and he did indeed become john dees cousin by marriage it was tracy thursfield student of the hidden who first told me about the shewstone which was last heard of at brampton bryan castle home of the harleys who were also connected with wigmore abbey and gave regular advice throughout mairead reidy ace researcher found more details and provided a rich assortment of relevant literature keith parker author of a history of presteigne provided the background on dees family nicholas meredith and stephen price and hilary marchant suggested the sites of judicial premises thanks once again to the present owners of the two houses at nantygroes also duncan baldwin and lucille for legal advice apart from those involving royalty and high government figures theres little evidence of the way elizabethan trials were conducted especially at assize level it seems unlikely that there were barristers for the prosecution and defence as we know them today which suggests that most of the questioning of witnesses was done by the judge himself the rights of the accused to offer up a defence were not automatic and might depend on the generosity of the judge thanks to sir richard heygate coauthor with philip carrgomm of every home should have one the book of english magic for links to portals and john dee ed wilson for london geography and yet more legal assistance bev craven masterly graphic artist and connoisseur of the curious alun lenny for the background on plant mat twm and dees welsh roots my wife carol for the usual massive and perceptive edit and sara okeeffe at corvus for a final overview and a lot of patience pilleth church on brynglas is well worth a visit the holy well remains if not the statue of the virgin and as someone said its so light and welcoming up there these days that it looks as if work has been carried out there the name of rhys gethin who achieved owain glyndwrs greatest victory at pilleth is still remembered in wales most recently as the professed author of communications from the small terrorist unit meibion glyndwr who ran an arson campaign against englishowned holiday cottages in north wales in the s the most intriguing account of glyndwrs campaign and its aftermath is alex gibbons the mystery of jack of kent and the fate of owain glyndwr my apologies to nicholas meredith who may have been an entirely honest and decent businessman and property dealer the mappa mundi can be seen at hereford cathedral legends of guardians of ancient sites are well known on the welsh border and some stories of guardian manifestations are rather too recent to qualify as old legends an archaeologist once told me hed been refused permission to excavate a bronze age mound on a farm in powys because the farmer had himself once sunk a spade into it and seen something so dreadful hed not gone near it since with any kind of implement according to legend the restless spirit of amy robsart at cumnor place was removed from cumnor by ten priests with candles poor amy that seems wrong somehow
