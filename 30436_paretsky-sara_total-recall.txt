sara paretsky total recall the tenth book in the vi warshawski series for sara krupnik and hannah paretsky whose names i bear may the one who establishes peace in the high places grant us all peace thanks thanks to wolfson college oxford where i was a visiting scholar in which enabled me to pursue archival research thanks to dr jeremy black of wolfson for making my time there possible the archives of letters and audiotapes in the imperial war museum london are an important source about the kindertransport england s generous acceptance of ten thousand jewish children from central europe in the years immediately before the second world war as is true of librarians everywhere those at the imperial war museum were extremely helpfuleven allowing me into the archives on a day they were closed when i confused an appointment date the royal free hospital london gave me access to their archives allowed me to send lotty herschel to school there and were in general most helpful dr dulcie reed dr lettice bowen dr peter scheuer and dr judith levy all of whom trained in medicine in great britain around the same time as lotty herschel were generous in giving me time and information about that period in their lives in the case of all archival material as well as the reminiscences of these four doctors i have avoided turning peoples reallife experiences into fictionwith the exception of lotty and her roommates making lingerie out of parachute silk dr bowen and her friends did thisan amazing feat as anyone who has ever tried to construct lingerie from scratch will appreciate professor colin divall of the institute of railway studies york was helpful with information about train routes and timetables in the s because of the constraints of a novel focusing on chicago contemporary crime and v i warshawski i was not able to make as deep a use of any of my english research as i would have wished perhaps it will find a home in a different story on another day in chicago kimball wright advised me on the guns used in the book forensic pathologist dr robert kirschner was helpful in making accurate the deaths and near deaths of various unfortunate characters the events described in chapters and do happen sandy weiss was helpful as always on forensic engineering arcana jolynn parker did invaluable research on a number of topics including finding street maps of jewish neighborhoods of vienna in the s more important her astuteness as a reader helped me pick my way through some thorny problems as i developed the story line jonathan paretsky helped with german yiddishand star gazing special thanks to kate jones for her insightful discussion of this novel both at its end and at its beginnings as always the first cdog was there with advice encouragementand renewable kneecaps this is a work of fiction no resemblance is intended between any character in this novel and any real person living or dead whether in public office in corporate boardrooms on the streets or in any other walk of life similarly all the institutions involved including ajax insurance edelweiss re gargette et cie are phantasms of the authors fevered brain and are not intended to resemble any actual existing body the issues of slave reparations and holocaust asset recovery are very real the positions taken on them by characters in the novel do not necessarily reflect the authors own nor should they be taken to reflect the positions taken by people in public life who are debating them note anna freuds an experiment in group upbringing is in volume iv of her collected works the adult lives of the children she describes are explored in sarah moskovitzs love despite hate lotty herschels story work ethic the cold that winter ate into our bones you cant imagine living where you turn a dial and as much heat as you want glows from the radiator but everything in england then was fueled by coal and there were terrible shortages the second winter after the war like everyone i had little piles of sixpenny bits for the electric fire in my room but even if id been able to afford to run it all night it didnt provide much warmth one of the women in my lodgings got a length of parachute silk from her brother whod been in the raf we all made camisoles and knickers out of it we all knew how to knit back then i unraveled old sweaters to make scarves and vestsnew wool cost a fortune we saw newsreels of american ships and planes bringing the germans whatever they needed while we swathed ourselves in blankets and sweaters and ate grey bread with butter substitutes we joked bitterly that wed done the wrong thing bringing the americans in to win the wartheyd treat us better if wed lost the same woman whod gotten the parachute silk said of course i had started my medical training so i couldnt spend much time wrapped up in bed anyway i was glad to have the hospital to go toalthough the wards werent warm either patients and sisters would huddle around the big stove in the center of the ward drinking tea and telling storieswe students used to envy their camaraderie the sisters expected us medical students to behave professionallyfrankly they enjoyed ordering us about wed do rounds with two pairs of stockings on hoping the consultants wouldnt notice we wore gloves as we trailed after them from bed to bed listening to symptoms that came from deprivation as much as anything working sixteen or eighteen hours a day without proper food took a toll on all of us many of my fellow students succumbed to tuberculosis and were granted leavethe only reason the hospital would let you interrupt your training and come back as a matter of fact even though some took more than a year to recover the new antibiotics were starting to come in but they cost the earth and werent yet widely available when my turn came and i went to the registrar explaining that a family friend had a cottage in somerset where i could recuperate she nodded bleakly we were already down five in my class but she signed the forms for me and told me to write monthly she stressed that she would hope to see me in under a year in fact i was gone eight months id wanted to return sooner but claireclaire tallmadge who was a senior houseman by then with a consultancy all but certainpersuaded me i wasnt strong enough although i was aching to get back when i returned to the royal free it feltoh so good the hospital routine my studies they were like a balm healing me the registrar actually called me into her office to warn me to slow down they didnt want me to suffer a relapse she didnt understand that work was my only salvation i suppose it had already become my second skin its a narcotic the oblivion overwork can bring you arbeit macht freithat was an obscene parody the nazis thought up but it is possible arbeit macht betäubtwhat oh sorry i forgot you dont speak german they had type slogans over the entrance to all their camps and that was what they put over auschwitz work will make you free that slogan was a bestial parody but work can numb you if you stop working even for a moment everything inside you starts evaporating soon you are so shapeless you cant move at all at least that was my fear when i first heard about my family i became utterly without any grounding at all i was supposed to be preparing for my higherschool certificatethe diploma we took in those days when we finished high schoolthe results determined your university entrancebut the exams lost the meaning theyd had for me all during the war every time i sat down to read i felt as though my insides were being sucked away by a giant vacuum cleaner in a perverse way cousin minna came to my rescue ever since i arrived on her doorstep she had been unsparing in her criticisms of my mother the news of my mothers death brought not even a respectful silence but a greater barrage i can see now through the prism of experience that guilt drove her as much as anything she had hated my mother been jealous of her for so many years she couldnt admit now that shed been unfeeling even cruel she was probably griefstricken as well because her own mother had also perished all that family that used to spend summers talking and swimming at kleinsee well never mind that its old news now i would come home from walking the streets walking until i was too exhausted to feel anything to minna you think youre suffering that youre the only person who was ever orphaned left alone in a strange country and werent you supposed to give victor his tea he says he waited for over an hour for you and finally had to make it himself because youre too much a ladydie gnädige frauminna only ever spoke german at homeshe had never really mastered english which made her furious with shameand she curtsied to meto get your hands dirty doing work housework or a real job youre just like lingerl i wonder how a princess like her lived as long as she did in such a setting with no one to pamper her did she tilt her head and bat her eyes so that the guards or other inmates gave up their bread to her madame butterfly is dead its time you learned what real work is a fury rose up in me greater than any i remember since i smacked her in the mouth and screamed if people took care of my mother its because she repaid them with love and if they dont care for you its because youre utterly loathsome she stared at me for a moment her mouth slack with shock she recovered quickly though and hit me back so hard she split my lip with her big ring and then hissed the only reason i let a mongrel like you accept that scholarship to high school was on the understanding that you would repay my generosity by taking care of victor which i might point out you have failed utterly to do instead of giving him tea youve been flaunting yourself at the pubs and dance halls just like your mother max or carl or one of those other immigrant boys is likely to give you the same present that martin as he liked to call himself gave madame butterfly tomorrow morning im off to that precious headmistress that miss skeffing youre so fond of to tell her you cant continue your education its time you started pulling your weight around here blood pouring down my face i ran pellmell across london to the youth hostel where my friends livedyou know max and carl and the rest of them when they turned sixteen the year before they hadnt been able to stay in their foster homes i begged them to find me a bed for the night in the morning when i knew minna would be with her great love the glove factory i sneaked back for my books and my clothesit was only two changes of underwear and a second dress victor was dozing in the living room but he didnt wake up enough to try to stop me miss skeffing found a family in north london who gave me a room in exchange for doing their cooking and i began to study as if my mothers life could be redeemed by my work as soon as i finished the supper dishes i would solve chemistry and math problems sometimes sleeping only four hours until it was time to make the familys morning tea and after that i never stopped working really that was where the story ended sitting on a hillside on a dull october day overlooking a desolate landscape listening to lotty until she could talk no more its harder for me to figure out where it began looking back now now that im calm now that i can think its still hard to say oh it was because of this or because of that it was a time when i had a million other things on my mind morrell was getting ready to leave for afghanistan i was worrying most about that but of course i was trying to run my business and juggle the nonprofit work i do and pay my bills i suppose my own involvement began with isaiah sommers or maybe the birnbaum foundation conferencethey happened on the same day i babysitters club they wouldnt even start the funeral service the church was full ladies were crying my uncle was a deacon and he was a righteous man hed been a member of that church for fortyseven years when he passed my aunt was in a state of total collapse as you can imagine and for them to have the nerve to say the policy had already been cashed in when thats what i want to know ms warashki when was it ever cashed in with my uncle paying his five dollars a week for fifteen years like he did and my aunt never hearing word one of him borrowing against the policy or converting it isaiah sommers was a short square man who spoke in slow cadences as if he were himself a deacon it was an effort to keep from drowsing off during the pauses in his delivery we were in the living room of his south side bungalow at a few minutes after six on a day that had stretched on far too long already id been in my office at starting a round of the routine searches that make up the bulk of my business when lotty herschel called with an sos you know maxs son brought calia and agnes with him from london dont you agnes suddenly has a chance to show her slides at a huron street gallery but she needs a minder for calia im not a babysitter lotty id said impatiently calia was max loewenthals fiveyearold granddaughter lotty swept imperiously past that protest max called me when they couldnt find anyoneits his housekeepers day off hes going to that conference at the hotel pleiades although ive told him many times that all hes doing is exposingbut thats neither here nor there at any rate hes on a panel at tenotherwise hed stay home himself i tried mrs coltrain at my clinic but everyones tied up michael is rehearsing all afternoon with the symphony and this could be an important chance for agnes vici realize its an imposition but it would be only for a few hours why not carl tisov i asked isnt he staying at maxs too carl as a babysitter once he picks up his clarinet the roof of the house can blow off without his noticing i saw it happen once during the v raids can you tell me yes or no im in the middle of surgical rounds and i have a full schedule at the clinic lotty is the chief perinatologist at beth israel i tried a few of my own connections including my parttime assistant who has three foster children but no one could help out i finally agreed with a surly lack of grace i have a client meeting at six on the far south side so someone had better be able to step in before five when i drove up to maxs evanston home to collect calia agnes loewenthal was breathlessly grateful i cant even find my slides calia was playing with them and stuck them in michaels cello which got him terribly cross and now the wretched beast cant imagine where hes flung them michael appeared in a tshirt with his cello bow in one hand darling im sorry but they have to be in the drawing roomthats where i was practicing vic i cant thank you enoughcan we take you and morrell to dinner after our sunday afternoon concert we cant do that michael agnes snapped thats maxs dinner party for carl and you michael played cello with the cellini chamber ensemble the london group started back in the forties by max and lottys friend carl tisov the cellini was in chicago to kick off their biannual international tour michael was also scheduled to play some concerts with the chicago symphony agnes gave calia a quick hug victoria thank you a million times please though no television she only gets an hour a week and i dont think american shows are suitable for her she darted back into the drawing room where we could hear her furiously tossing cushions from the couch calia grimaced and clutched my hand it was max who actually got calia into her jacket and saw that her dog her doll and her favoritest story were in her day pack so much chaos he grunted youd think they were trying to launch the space shuttle wouldnt you lotty tells me you have an evening appointment on the south side perhaps you could meet me in the pleiades lobby at fourthirty i should be able to finish up by then so i can collect this whirling dervish from you if you have a crisis my secretary will be able to reach me victoria we are grateful he walked outside with us kissing calia lightly on the head and me on the hand i hope your panel isnt too painful an outing i said he smiled lottys fears shes allergic to the past i dont like wallowing in it but i think it can be healthy for people to understand it i strapped calia into the backseat of the mustang the birnbaum foundation which often underwrites communications issues had decided to hold a conference on christians and jews a new millennium a new dialogue they came up with the program after southern baptists announced plans to send a hundred thousand missionaries to chicago this past summer to convert the jews the baptist drive fizzled out only about a thousand stalwart evangelizers showed up it cost the baptists something in cancelation fees at the hotels too but by then the planning for the birnbaum conference was well under way max was taking part in the bankaccount panel which infuriated lotty he was going to describe his postwar experiences in trying to track down his relatives and their assets lotty said he was going to expose his misery for the world at large to stare at she said it only reinforced a stereotype of jews as victims besides she would add dwelling on missing assets only gave people fuel for the second popular stereotype that all jews cared about was money to which max invariably replied who cares about money here really the jews or the swiss who refuse to return it to the people who earned it and deposited it and the fight went on from there it had been an exhausting summer being around them in the seat behind me calia was chattering happily the private eye as babysitter it wasnt the first image you got from pulp fiction i dont think race williams or philip marlowe ever did babysitting but by the end of the morning i decided that was because they were too weak to take on a fiveyearold i started at the zoo thinking trudging around for an hour would make calia eager to rest while i did some work in my office but that proved to be an optimism born of ignorance she colored for ten minutes needed to go to the bathroom wanted to call grandpapa thought we should play tag in the hall that runs the length of the warehouse where i lease space was terrifically hungry despite the sandwiches wed eaten at the zoo and finally jammed one of my picklocks into the back of the photocopier at that point i gave up and took her to my apartment where the dogs and my downstairs neighbor gave me a merciful respite mr contreras a retired machinist was delighted to let her ride horseback on him in the garden the dogs joined in i left them to it while i went up to the third floor to make some calls i sat at the kitchen table with the back door open so i could keep an ear cocked for when mr contrerass patience waned but i did manage to get an hour of work in after that calia consented to sit in my living room with peppy and mitch while i read her favoritest story the faithful dog and the princess i have a dog too aunt vicory she announced pulling a blue stuffed one from her day pack his name is ninshubur like in the book see it says ninshubur means faithful friend in the language of the princesss people vicory was the closest calia could get to victoria when we met almost three years ago wed both been stuck with it ever since calia couldnt read yet but she knew the story by heart chanting for far rather would i die than lose my liberty when the princess flung herself into a waterfall to escape an evil enchantress then ninshubur the faithful hound leapt from rock to rock heedless of any danger he jumped into the river and carried the princess to safety calia pushed her blue plush dog deep into the book then threw him on the floor to demonstrate his leap into the waterfall peppy wellbred golden retriever that she was sat on the alert waiting for a command to fetch but her son immediately bounded after the toy calia screamed running after mitch both dogs began to bark by the time i rescued ninshubur all of us were on the brink of tears i hate mitch he is a bad dog i am most annoyed at his behavior calia announced i was thankful to see that it was threethirty despite agness prohibition i plunked calia in front of the television while i went down the hall to shower and change even in the era of casual dress new clients respond better to professionalism i put on a sage rayon suit with a rose silk sweater when i got back to the living room calia was lying with her head on mitchs back blue ninshubur between his paws she bitterly resisted restoring mitch and peppy to mr contreras mitch will miss me he will cry she wailed so tired herself that nothing made sense to her tell you what baby well get mitch to give ninshubur one of his dog tags that way ninshubur will remember mitch when he cant see him i went into my storage closet where i found one of the small collars wed used when mitch had been a puppy calia stopped crying long enough to help buckle it in place around ninshubur i attached a set of peppys old tags which looked absurdly big on the small blue neck but brought calia enormous satisfaction i stuffed her day pack and ninshubur into my own briefcase and scooped her up to carry her to my car im not a baby i dont get carried she sobbed clinging to me in the car she fell asleep almost at once my plan had been to leave my car with the pleiades hotel valet for fifteen minutes while i took calia in to find max but when i pulled off lake shore drive at wacker i saw this wasnt going to be possible a major crowd was blocking the entrance to the pleiades driveway i craned my head trying to see a demonstration apparently with pickets and bullhorns television crews added to the chaos cops were furiously whistling cars away but the traffic was so snarled i had to sit for some minutes in mounting frustration wondering where i would find max and what to do with calia heavily asleep behind me i pulled my cell phone out of my briefcase but the battery was dead and i couldnt find the incar charger of course not id left it in morrells car when he and i went to the country for a day last week i pounded the steering wheel in useless frustration as i sat fuming i watched the picketers who belonged to conflicting causes one group all white was carrying signs demanding passage of the illinois holocaust asset recovery act no deals with thieves they were chanting and banks insurers where is our money the man with the bullhorn was joseph posner hed been on the news so many times lately i could have picked him out in a bigger crowd than this he was dressed in the long coat and bowler hat of the ultraorthodox the son of a holocaust survivor he had become ostentatiously religious in a way that made lotty grind her teeth he could be seen picketing everything from xrated movies with the support of christian fundamentalists to jewishowned stores like neiman marcus that were open on saturday his followers who seemed to be a cross between a yeshiva and the jewish defense league accompanied him everywhere they called themselves the maccabees and seemed to think their protests should be modeled on the original maccabees military prowess like a growing number of fanatics in america they were proud of their arrest records posners most recent cause was an effort to get illinois to pass the illinois holocaust asset recovery act the ihara suggested by legislation in florida and california would bar insurance companies from doing business in the state unless they proved that they werent sitting on any life or property claims from holocaust victims it also had clauses dealing with banks and with firms that benefited from use of forced labor during the second world war posner had been able to generate enough publicity that the bill was being debated in committee the second group outside the pleiades mostly black was carrying signs with a large red slash through pass the ihara no deals with slave owners and economic justice for all their signs proclaimed the guy leading this group was also easy to recognize alderman louis bull durham durham had been looking for a long time for a cause that would turn him into a highprofile opponent to the mayor but opposition to the ihara didnt strike me as a citywide issue if posner had his maccabees durham had his own militant followers hed set up empower youth energy teams first in his own ward and then around town as a way of getting young men off the streets and into jobtraining programs but some of the eye teams as they were called had a shadier side there were whispers on the street of extortion and beatings for store owners who didnt contribute to the aldermans political campaigns and durham himself always had his own group of eyeteam bodyguards who surrounded him in their signature navy blazers whenever he appeared in public if the maccabees and the eye team were going head to head i was glad i was a private detective trying to make my way through traffic not one of the policemen hoping to keep them apart the traffic finally inched me past the hotel entrance i turned east onto randolph street where it perches over grant park all the meters there were taken but i figured the cops were too busy at the pleiades to spare time for ticketing i locked my briefcase in the trunk and pulled calia from the backseat she woke briefly then slumped against my shoulder she wasnt going to manage the walk to the hotel i gritted my teeth making the best load i could of her fortypound deadweight i staggered down the stairs leading to the lower level of columbus drive where the hotels service entrance lay it was already almost five i hoped id find max without too much trouble as id hoped no one was blocking the lower entrance i walked past the attendants with calia and rode the elevator up to the lobby level the crowd here was as thick as the mob outside if quieter hotel guests and birnbaum conference participants were wedged around the doors anxiously wondering what was going on and what to do about it i was despairing of finding max in this mob when i spotted a face i knew al judson the pleiades security chief was near the revolving doors talking on a twoway radio i elbowed my way to him whats up al judson was a small black man unobtrusive in crowds an excop whod learned how to keep an eye on volatile groups from patrolling grant park with my dad forty years ago when he saw me he gave a smile of genuine pleasure vic which side of the door are you here for i laughed but with some embarrassment my dad and i had argued about my joining antiwar protesters in grant park when he was assigned to riot control duty id been a teenager with a dying mother and emotions so tangled i hadnt known what i wanted so id run wild with the yippies for a night i need to find this small persons grandfather should i take to the streets instead then youd have to choose between durham and posner i know about posners crusade on the lifeinsurance payments but whats durham s judson hunched a shoulder he wants the state to make it illegal for a company to do business here if they profited from slavery in the us unless they pay restitution to the descendants of slaves that is so he says dont pass the ihara unless you add that clause to it i gave a little whistle of respect the chicago city council had passed a resolution demanding reparations for descendants of slaves resolutions are a nice gesturenods to constituencies without costing businesses anything the mayor might be in an awkward spot if he fought durham publicly over turning the resolution into a law with teeth in it it was an interesting political problem but not as immediate a one for me as calia who was making my arms feel as though they were on fire one of judsons subordinates was hovering ready to snatch his attention i quickly explained my need to find max judson spoke into his lapel radio within a few minutes a young woman from hotel security appeared with max who took calia from me she stirred and began to cry he and i had time for a few flustered words about his panel the melee outside calias day before i left him the unenviable task of soothing calia and getting her to his car as i sat in the thicket of traffic waiting to move back past the protest site toward lake shore drive i nodded off several times by the time i reached isaiah sommerss house in avalon park i was thick with sleepiness i was almost twenty minutes late though he swallowed his annoyance as best he could but it wouldnt do for me to fall asleep in front of him ii cash on the coffin when did your aunt give the policy to the funeral home i shifted on the couch the heavy plastic covering the upholstery crinkling as i moved on the wednesday my uncle passed on the tuesday they came for the body in the morning but before they would collect it they wanted proof that she could pay for the funeral which was scheduled for the saturday my mother had gone over to be with my aunt and she found the policy in uncle aarons papers just like we knew it would be he was methodical in everything he did great and small and he was methodical in his documents as well sommers massaged his neck with his square hands he was a lathe operator for the docherty engineering works his neck and shoulder muscles were bunched from leaning over a machine every day then like i said when my aunt got to the church on saturday they told her they werent starting the funeral until she came up with the money so after they took your uncles body on wednesday the funeral parlor must have called the policy number in to the company who told them that the policy had already been cashed what a horrible experience for all of you did the funeral director know who the money had been paid to thats just my point sommers pounded his fist on his knee they said it was to my aunt and that they wouldnt do the funeralwell i told you all that so how did you manage to get your uncle buried or did you i had an uneasy vision of aaron sommers lying in cold storage until the family shelled out three thousand dollars i came up with the money isaiah sommers looked reflexively toward the hall his wife who had let me in had made clear her disapproval of his exerting himself for his uncles widow and believe me it wasnt so easy if youre worried about your fee dont be i can take care of that and if you can find out who took the money maybe we can get it back wed even give you a finders fee the policy was worth ten thousand dollars i dont need a finders fee but i will need to see the policy he lifted a presentation copy of roots from the coffee table the policy was folded carefully underneath do you have a photocopy of it i asked no ill mail you one tomorrow you know that my fee is a hundred dollars an hour with a minimum of five hours work right i charge for all nonoverhead expenses as well when he nodded that he understood i pulled two copies of my standard contract from my case his wife who had obviously been lurking outside the door came in to read it with him while they slowly went through each clause i looked at the lifeinsurance policy it had been sold to aaron sommers by the midway agency and it dated back as isaiah said some thirty years it was drawn on the ajax life insurance company that was a help i had once dated the guy who now headed claims operations at ajax i hadnt seen him for a number of years but i thought he would probably talk to me this clause here margaret sommers said it says you dont refund money if we dont get the results were looking for is that right yes but you can halt the investigation at any point also i will report to you after my initial inquiries and if it doesnt seem as though theyre going anywhere ill tell you that frankly but thats why i ask for a fivehundreddollar earnest payment up front if i start to look and dont find anything people are tempted not to pay hmmph she said it doesnt seem right to me you taking money and not delivering im successful most of the time i tried not to let fatigue make me crankyshe wasnt the first person to raise this point but it wouldnt be fair to say i always am able to find out what someone wants to know after my first inquiry i can estimate the amount of time it will take to complete the investigation sometimes people see that as more than theyre willing to invest you may decide that too and youd still keep isaiahs five hundred dollars yes hes hiring my professional expertise i get paid for providing that just as a doctor does even when she cant cure you its taken years in the business to become hardheartedor maybe headedabout asking for money without embarrassment i told them if they wanted to talk it over some more they could call me when theyd made a decision but that i wouldnt take the uncles policy or make any phone calls until theyd signed a contract isaiah sommers said he didnt need more time that his cousins neighbor camilla rawlings had vouched for me and that was good enough for him margaret sommers folded her arms across her chest and announced that as long as isaiah understood he was paying for it he was free to do as he pleased she wasnt keeping books for that mean old jew rubloff to throw her money away on isaiahs useless family isaiah gave her a hard look but he signed both contracts and pulled a roll from his trousers he counted out five hundred dollars in twenties watching me closely while i wrote out a receipt i signed the contracts in turn giving one back to isaiah putting the other with the policy in my case i jotted down his aunts address and phone number took the details for the funeral parlor and got up to leave isaiah sommers escorted me to the door but before he could close it i heard margaret sommers say i just hope you dont come to me when youve found yourself throwing good money after bad i turned down the walk on his angry response id had my fill of bitterness lately what with lottys arguing with max and now the sommerses taking each other on their snarling seemed endemic to the relationship it would be difficult to be around them often i wondered if they had friends and what the friends did when faced with this sniping if max and lottys quarrel hardened into the same kind of misery i would find it intolerable ms sommerss gratuitous remark about the mean old jew she worked for also hit me hard i dont like meanspirited remarks of any kind but this one jarred me especially after listening to max and lotty go ten rounds on whether he should speak at todays conference what would margaret sommers say if she heard max detail his life when the nazis came to powerforced to leave school seeing his father compelled to kneel naked in the street was lotty right was his speaking a demeaning exposure that would do no good would it teach the margaret sommerses of the world to curb their careless prejudices id grown up a few blocks south of here among people who would have used worse epithets than margaret sommerss if shed moved next door if she sat on a stage rehearsing the racial slurs that she probably grew up hearing i doubted that my old neighbors would change their thinking much i stood on the curb trying to stretch out the knife points in my trapezius before starting the long drive north the curtains in the sommerses front window twitched i got into my car the september nights were drawing in only the faintest wisp of light still stained the horizon as i turned north onto route why did people stay together to be unhappy my own parents hadnt shown me a harlequin picture of true love but at least my mother struggled to create domestic harmony she had married my father out of gratitude and out of fear an immigrant alone on the streets of the city not knowing english hed been a beat cop when he rescued her in a milwaukee avenue bar where shed thought she could use her grand opera training to get a job as a singer hed fallen in love and never to the best of my knowledge fallen out of it she was affectionate toward him but it seemed to me her true passion was reserved for me of course i wasnt quite sixteen when she died what does one know of ones parents at that age and what about my clients uncle isaiah sommers was certain that if his uncle had cashed in his lifeinsurance policy he would have told his aunt but people have many needs for money some of them so embarrassing that they cant bring themselves to tell their families my melancholy reflections had carried me unnoticing past the landmarks of my childhood to where route became the gleaming eightlane drive skirting the lake shore the last color had faded from the sky turning the lake to a spill of black ink at least i had a lover to turn to even if only for a few more days morrell whom ive been seeing for the past year was leaving on tuesday for afghanistan a journalist who often covers humanrights issues hes been longing to see the taliban up close and personal since they consolidated their power several years back the thought of unwinding in the comfort of his arms made me accelerate through the long dark stretch of south lake shore drive up past the bright lights of the loop to evanston iii what is in a name morrell greeted me at the door with a kiss and a glass of wine howd it go mary poppins mary poppins i echoed blankly then remembered calia oh that it was great people think daycare workers are underpaid but thats because they dont know how much fun the job is i followed him into the apartment and tried not to groan out loud when i saw his editor on the couch not that i dislike don strzepek but id badly wanted an evening where my conversation could be limited to an occasional snore don i said as he got up to shake hands morrell didnt tell me to expect this pleasure i thought you were in spain i was he patted his shirt for cigarettes remembered he was in a nosmoking zone and ran his fingers through his hair instead i got back to new york two days ago and learned that the boy reporter was leaving for the front so i wangled a deal with maverick magazine to do a story on this birnbaum conference and came out of course now i have to work for the pleasure of bidding morrell adieu which i wont let you forget amigo morrell and don had met in guatemala when they were both covering the dirty little war there a number of years back don had gone on to an editorial job at envision press in new york but he still undertook some reporting assignments maverick magazine a kind of edgier version of harpers published most of his work did you get here in time for the maccabeeseyeteam standoff i asked i was just telling morrell i picked up literature from both posner and durham he waved at a pile of pamphlets on the coffee table ill try to talk to both of them but of course thats breaking news what i need is background morrell says you might be able to supply me with some when i looked a question he added id like a chance to meet max loewenthal since hes on the national committee dealing with missing assets for holocaust survivors his kindertransport story alone would make a good sidebar and morrell tells me that you know two of his friends who also came to england as children in the thirties i frowned thinking of lottys furies with max over exposing the past maybe i can introduce you to max but i dont know whether dr herschel would want to talk to you and carl tisov maxs other friend hes here from london on a concert tour so whether hed have the time let alone the interest i broke off with a shrug and picked up the pamphlets don had brought back from the demonstrations these included a flyer from louis durham printed expensively in three colors on glossy stock the document proclaimed opposition to the proposed illinois holocaust asset recovery act unless it also covered descendants of african slaves in america why should illinois ban german companies who profited from the backs of jewish and gypsy workers but accept american companies who grew rich on the backs of african slaves i thought it was a good point but i found some of the rhetoric disturbing its not surprising illinois is considering the ihara jews have always known how to organize around the issue of money and this is no exception margaret sommerss casual comment about the mean old jew rubloff echoed uncomfortably in my head i put the flyer back on the table and rifled through posners screed which was irritating in its own way the day of the jew as victim is over we will not sit idly by while german and swiss firms pay their shareholders with our parents blood ugh good luck in talking to these two specimens i flipped through the rest of the literature and was surprised to see the company history ajax insurance had recently printed one hundred fifty years of life and still going strong by amy blount phd you want to borrow it don grinned thanks i have my own copythey held a gala a couple of weeks ago to celebrate my most important client sits on their board so i got chapter and verse close up i even met the author shed been a thin severelooking young woman dreadlocks tied back from her face with grosgrain ribbons sipping mineral water on the fringes of a blacktie crowd i tapped her booklet howd you get this bull durham going after ajax or is posner don patted his cigarette pocket again both as far as i can tell now that edelweiss re owns ajax posner wants a printout of all their policies from on and durham is quite as insistent that ajax open their books so he can see whom they insured from to naturally ajax is fighting like crazy to keep the ihara with or without durham s amendment from getting passed here or anywhere although the florida and california legislation that inspired the illinois act doesnt seem to have hurt insurers any i guess theyve figured they can stall until the last beneficiary dies morrell im going to kill in a minute if i dont get some nicotine you cuddle vic ill give my great hacking smokers cough to warn you im coming back in poor guy morrell followed me as i went into the bedroom to change mmph i dont remember that bra it was a rose and silver number i rather liked myself morrell nuzzled my shoulder and fiddled with the hooks after a few minutes i pulled away that smokers cough is going to hack in our ears in a minute when did you find out he was coming to town he called from the airport this morning i tried to let you know but your mobile phone wasnt on morrell took my skirt and sweater and hung them in the closet his extreme tidiness is a big reason i cant imagine our ever living together he perched on the edge of the tub when i went into the bathroom to take off my makeup as much as anything i think don wanted an excuse to get away from new york you know since envisions parent company was bought by that big french firm gargette he hasnt been having much fun in publishing so many of his authors are being axed that hes afraid his job will be cut he wants to scope out the issues surrounding the birnbaum conferencesee if theres enough in them for a book of his own we went back into the bedroom where i pulled on jeans and a sweatshirt what about you i leaned against him closing my eyes and letting the wall of fatigue id been battling crash over me is there any risk of your contract for the taliban book being canceled no such luck babe morrell ruffled my hair dont sound so hopeful i blushed i didnt mean to be so obvious but kabul an american passport is as big a liability there as a womans exposed arms morrell held me more tightly youre more likely to get into trouble here in chicago than i am in afghanistan ive never been in love before with a woman who was beaten up and left to die on the kennedy but you could visit me every day while i was recuperating i objected i promise you victoria iphigenia that if i am left to die in the khyber pass i will get humane medicine to fly you over so you can see me every day humane medicine was a humanrights group morrell had traveled with in the past they were based in rome and were hoping to set up an inoculation program for afghan children before the himalayan winter set in in earnest morrell was going to roam around talking to anyone he could observe the statesanctioned boys schools see if he could find any of the underground girls schools and generally try to get some understanding of the taliban hed even been taking a course on the koran in a mosque on devon avenue im going to fall asleep if i dont start moving i murmured into his chest lets get some dinner for don weve got that fettuccine i bought on the weekend put some tomatoes and olives and garlic in it thatll do the job we went back into the living room where don was flipping through a copy of the kansas city reviewmorrell had a critique of some recent books on guatemala in it good job morrellits a tough question what to do about old juntas in new clothes isnt it tough question to know what to do about our own governments involvement with some of these groups too i drifted for a bit while they talked about south american politics when don announced a need for another cigarette morrell followed me to the kitchen to pull supper together we ate at the island countertop in the kitchen perched on barstools while don talked with a certain gloomy humor about the changes in publishing while i was in barcelona my corporate masters announced to the journal that writers are just content providers then they sent out a protocol on how to type manuscripts demoting the content providers to clerktypists a few minutes before ten he pushed his chair away from the counter there should be some coverage of the birnbaum conference on the ten oclock news id like to watch although the cameras probably concentrated on the action out front he helped morrell scrape the plates into the garbage then went to the back porch for another cigarette while morrell loaded the dishwasher wiped down the counters and wrapped leftovers in airtight containers i went into the living room to turn on channel global entertainments chicago station the evening anchor dennis logan was just finishing his summary of the upcoming news events turned stormy at times at the conference on jews in america being held today at the hotel pleiades but the real surprise came at the end of the afternoon from someone who wasnt even on the program beth blacksin will have the whole story later in our broadcast i curled up in the corner of morrells couch i started to nod off but when the phone rang i woke up to see two young women onscreen raving about a drug for yeast infections morrell whod come into the room behind me muted the set and answered the phone for you sweet max he stretched the receiver out to me victoria im sorry to phone so late maxs tone was apologetic we have a crisis here that im hoping you can solve ninshuburthat blue stuffed dog calia takes everywheredo you have it by any chance i could hear calia howling in the background michael shouting something agness voice raised to yell something else i rubbed my eyes trying to remember far enough back in the day to calias dog i had stuffed calias day pack into my case then forgotten about it in the harassment of getting her to max i put the phone down and looked around i finally asked morrell if he knew where my briefcase was yes v i he said in a voice of longsuffering you dropped it on the couch when you came in i put it in my study i set the receiver on the couch and went down the hall to his study my briefcase was the only thing on his desk except for his copy of the koran with a long green string marking his place ninshubur was buried in the bottom with some raisins calias day pack and the tale of the princess and her faithful hound i picked up the study extension and apologized to max promising to run right over with the animal no no dont disturb yourself its only a few blocks and ill be glad to get out of this upheaval when i returned to the living room don said the suspense was mounting we were on the second commercial break with the promise of fireworks to come max rang the bell just as dennis logan began speaking again when i let max into the little entryway i saw he had carl tisov with him i handed the toy dog to max but he and carl lingered long enough that morrell came over to invite them in for a drink something strong like absinthe carl said i had always wished for a large family but after this evenings waterworks i think i didnt miss so much how can one small diaphragm generate more sound than an entire brass section its the jet lag max said it always hits small ones hard don called out to us to hush theyre finally getting to the conference max and carl moved into the living room and stood behind the couch don turned up the volume as beth blacksins pixieish face filled the screen when the southern baptists announced their plan to send a hundred thousand missionaries to chicago this past summer as part of their plan to convert jews to christianity a lot of people were troubled but the birnbaum foundation took action working with the illinois holocaust commission the chicago roman catholic archdiocese and dialogue an interfaith group here in chicago the foundation decided to hold a conference on issues that affect not just illinois s substantial jewish population but the jewish community in america as a whole hence todays conference christians and jews a new millennium a new dialogue at times it seemed as though dialogue was the last thing on anyones mind the screen shifted to footage of the demonstrations out front blacksin gave both posner and durham equal sound bites then shifted back to the hotel ballroom sessions inside the building also grew heated the liveliest one covered the topic which sparked the demonstrations outside the proposed illinois holocaust asset recovery act a panel of banking and insurance executives arguing that the act would be so costly that all consumers would suffer drew a lot of criticism and a lot of anguish here the screen showed furious people yelling into the mikes set up in the aisles for questions one man shouted the insult that margaret sommers and alderman durham had both made earlier that the reparations debate proved that all jews ever thought about was money another man yelled back that he didnt understand why jews were considered greedy for wanting bank deposits their families had made why arent the banks called greedy they held on to the money for sixty years and now they want to hang on to it forever a woman stomped up to a mike to say that since the swiss reinsurer edelweiss had bought ajax she assumed edelweiss had their own reasons to oppose the legislation channel let us watch the melee for about twenty seconds before blacksins voice cut in again the most startling event of the day didnt take place in the insurance session but during one on forcible conversion when a small man with a shy manner made the most extraordinary revelation we watched as a man in a suit that seemed a size too big for him spoke into one of the aisle mikes he was closer to sixty than fifty with greying curls that had thinned considerably at his temples i want to say that it is only recently i even knew i was jewish a voice from the stage asked him to identify himself oh my name is paulpaul radbuka i was brought here after the war when i was four years old by a man who called himself my father max sucked in his breath while carl exclaimed what who is this don and morrell both turned to stare you know him i asked max clamped my wrist to hush me while the little figure in front of us continued to speak he took everything away from me most especially my memories only recently have i come to know that i spent the war in terezin the socalled model concentration camp that the germans named theresienstadt i thought i was a german a lutheran like this man ulrich who called himself my father only after he died when i went through his papers did i find out the truth and i say it is wrong it is criminally wrong to take away from people the identity which is rightfully theirs the station let a few seconds silence develop then dennis logan the anchor appeared in a split screen with beth blacksin its a most extraordinary story beth you caught up with mr radbuka after the session didnt you well be showing your exclusive interview with paul radbuka at the end of our regular newscast coming up for fans who thought the cubs couldnt sink lower a surprising comefromahead loss today at wrigley iv memory plant do you know him don asked max muting the sound as yet another round of ads came up max shook his head i know the name but not this man its justits a most unusual name he turned to morrell if i can impose on youid like to stay for the interview like max carl was a short man not quite as tall as i am but where max smiled goodnaturedly on the world around himoften amused by the human predicamentcarl held himself on alerta bantam rooster ready to take on all comers right now he seemed edgier than usual i looked at him but decided not to quiz him in front of don and morrell morrell brought max herbal tea and poured brandy for carl finally the station finished its lengthy dissection of the weather and turned to beth blacksin she was talking to paul radbuka in a small meeting room at the pleiades another woman with wings of black hair framing her oval face was with them beth blacksin introduced herself and paul radbuka then let the camera focus on the other woman also here this evening is rhea wiell the therapist who has treated mr radbuka and helped him recover his hidden memories ms wiell has agreed to talk to me later tonight in a special edition of exploring chicago blacksin turned to the small man mr radbuka how did you come to discover your true identity you said in the meeting that it was in going through your fathers papers what did you find there the man who called himself my father radbuka corrected her it was a set of documents in code at first i paid no attention to them somehow after he died i lost my own will to live i dont understand why because i didnt like him he was always very brutal to me but i became so depressed that i lost my job i even stopped getting out of bed on many days and then i met rhea wiell he turned to the darkhaired woman with a look of adoration it sounds melodramatic but i believe i owe my life to her and she helped me make sense of the documents to use them to find my missing identity rhea wiell is the therapist you found beth prodded him yes she specializes in recovering memories of events that people like me block because the trauma around them is so intense he continued to look at wiell who nodded reassuringly at him blacksin stepped him through some of his highlights the tormenting nightmares that he had been ashamed to speak of for fifty years and his dawning realization that the man who called himself his father might really be someone completely unrelated to him we had come to america as dpsdisplaced personsafter the second world war i was only four and when i was growing up this man said we were from germany he gasped for air between sentences like an asthmatic fighting to breathe but what ive finally learned from my work with rhea is that his story was only half true he was from germany but i was aa camp child camp survivor i was from some other place some country under nazi control this man attached himself to me in the confused aftermath of the war to get a visa to america he looked at his hands as if he were terribly ashamed of this and do you feel up to telling us about those dreamsthose nightmaresthat led you to rhea wiell beth prompted him wiell stroked radbukas hand in a reassuring fashion he looked up again and spoke to the camera with an almost childish lack of selfconsciousness the nightmares were things that haunted me things i couldnt speak out loud and could experience only in sleep terrible things beatings children falling dead in the snow bloodstains like flowers around them now thanks to rhea i can remember being four years old we were moving this strange angry man and i we were first on a ship and then on a train i was crying my miriam where is my miriam i want my miriam but the man who kept saying he was vati my father would hit me and finally i learned to keep all those cries to myself and who was miriam mr radbuka blacksin leaned toward him her eyes wide with empathy miriam was my little playmate we had been together sincesince i was twelve months old radbuka began to cry when she arrived at the camp with you isnt that right beth said we spent two years in terezin together there were six of us the six musketeers i think of us now but my miriam she was my speciali want to know she is still alive someplace still healthy and maybe she remembers her paul as well he cupped his face in his hands his shoulders shook rhea wiells face loomed suddenly between him and the camera lets finish here beth thats all paul can handle today as the camera pulled back from them dennis logan the station anchor spoke over the scene this sad sad story continues to haunt not only paul radbuka but thousands of other holocaust survivors if any of you think you know pauls miriam call the number on our screen or go to our web site wwwglobeallcom well make sure paul radbuka gets your message how disgusting carl burst out when morrell muted the set again how can anyone expose himself like that you sound like lotty max murmured i suppose his hurt is so great that he isnt aware that hes exposing himself people like to talk about themselves don put in thats what makes a journalists job easy does his name mean something to you mr loewenthal max looked at him quizzically wondering how don knew his name morrell stepped in to perform introductions don explained that he had come out to cover the conference and recognized max from todays program did you recognize the guyradbuka wasnt it the name or the person he added youre a journalist who would like me to talk about myself to you max said sharply i have no idea who he is he was like a child carl said utterly unselfconscious about what he was saying even though he was recounting the most appalling events the phone rang again it was michael loewenthal saying that if his father had calias dog to please come home with it max gave a guilty start victoria may i call you in the morning of course i went into the back to get a card from my case so that max would have my cellphone number then i walked out to the car with him and carl did you two recognize the guy under the street lamp i saw max look at carl the name i thought i recognized the namebut it doesnt seem possible ill call you in the morning when i went back inside don was in purdah again with a cigarette i joined morrell in the kitchen where he was washing carls brandy glass did they tell all away from the prying ears of journalism i shook my head im beat but im curious too about the therapist are you guys going to stay up for the special segment with her don is panting for it he thinks she may be his careersaving book youd better believe it don called through the screen door although the guy would be hard to work withhis emotions seem awfully volatile we all returned to the living room just as the exploring chicago logo came up on the screen the shows regular announcer said they had a special program for us tonight and turned the stage over to beth blacksin thank you dennis in this special edition of exploring chicago we have the opportunity to follow up on the exciting revelations we heard earlier today exclusively on global television when a man who came here as a boy from wartorn europe told us how therapist rhea wiell helped him recover memories he had buried alive for fifty years she ran a few segments from radbukas speech to the convention followed by excerpts from her own interview with him were going to follow up on todays extraordinary story by talking to the therapist who worked with paul radbuka rhea wiell has been having remarkable successand started remarkable controversy i might addwith her work in helping people get access to forgotten memories memories theyve usually forgotten because the pain of remembering them is too great we dont bury happy memories so deep do we rhea the therapist had changed into a soft green outfit that suggested an indian mystic she nodded with a slight smile we dont usually suppress memories of icecream sodas or romps on the beach with our friends the memories we push away are the ones that threaten us in our core as individuals also with us is professor arnold praeger the director of the planted memory foundation the professor was given due face time to say that we lived in an era that celebrated victims which meant people needed to prove they had suffered more terribly than anyone else such people seek out therapists who can validate their victimization a small number of therapists have helped a large number of wouldbe victims remember the most shocking events they begin recalling satanic rituals sacrificing pets that never even existed and so on many families have been terribly damaged by these planted memories rhea wiell laughed softly i hope you are not going to suggest that any of my patients have recovered memories of satanic sacrifices arnold youve certainly encouraged some of them to demonize their parents rhea theyve ruined their parents lives by accusing them of the most heinous brutalityaccusations which cant be proved true in a court of law because the only witnesses to them are your patients imaginations you mean the only witness besides the parent who thought he was safe from ever being found out wiell said keeping her voice gentle as a contrast to praegers sharp speech praeger cut her off in the case of this man whose tape we just watched the father is dead and cant even be summoned to speak on his own behalf were told about documents in code but i wonder what key you used to break the code and whether someone like me would get the same result if i looked at the documents wiell shook her head smiling gently my patients privacy is sacrosanct arnold you know that these are paul radbukas documents whether anyone else can see them is his decision alone blacksin stepped in here to draw the conversation back to what recovered memories actually were wiell talked a little about posttraumatic stress disorder explaining that there are a number of symptoms that people share after trauma whether its from battleas soldiers or civiliansor experiencing other fragmenting events like sexual assault children whove been sexually abused adults whove been tortured soldiers whove endured battle all share some common problems depression inability to sleep inability to trust people around them or form close connections but people can be depressed and have sleep disorders without having been abused praeger snapped when someone comes into my office complaining of those symptoms i am very careful about forming an opinion of the root cause i dont immediately suggest hes been tortured by hutu terrorists people are at their most dependent and vulnerable with psychotherapists it is all too easy to suggest things to them which they come ardently to believe we like to think that our memories are objective and accurate but unfortunately its very easy to create memories of events that never took place he went on to summarize research on planted or created memories that showed how people were persuaded they had taken part in marches or demonstrations when there was objective evidence that theyd never been in the city where the demonstration was held a little before eleven blacksin cut the argument short until we truly understand the workings of the human mind this debate will continue between people of goodwill why dont each of you take thirty seconds to summarize your positions before we say good night ms wiell rhea wiell looked at the camera with a wide serious gaze we often like to dismiss other peoples horrible memories not because were not compassionate and not because we dont want to be victims but because were afraid to look inside ourselves were afraid to find out what lies hiddenwhat weve done to other people or what has happened to us it takes a lot of courage to take a journey to the past i would never start someone on that journey who wasnt strong enough to make it to the end i certainly never let them travel that dangerous road alone after that professor praegers rebuttal sounded cruel and unfeeling if the rest of the viewing audience was like me they wanted wiell back wanted her to say they were strong enough to travel to the past and good or interesting enough that she would guide them on the way when the camera faded to commercials morrell switched off the set don rubbed his hands this woman has book six figures written all over her ill be a hero in paris and new york if i get her before bertelsmann or rupert murdoch does if shes legitimate what do you two think remember the shaman we met in escuintla morrell said to don he had the same expression in his eyes as if he saw into the most secret thoughts of your mind yes don shuddered what a horrible trip we spent eighteen hours underneath a pigsty outwaiting the army that was when i decided id be happier working fulltime at envision press and letting people like you hog the glory morrell so to speak you think shes a charlatan morrell spread his hands i dont know anything about her but she certainly believes in herself doesnt she a yawn split my face im too tired to have an opinion but it should be easy enough to check her credentials in the morning i pushed myself upright on leaden legs morrell said hed join me in a minute before don gets too carried away with this new book i want to go over a few things about my own in that case morrell were doing it outside im not dueling with you over contracts without nicotine i dont know how late the two of them sat up i was asleep almost before the door out to the porch closed behind them v sniffing for a scent w hen i got back from my run the next morning don was where id left him the night before on the back porch with a cigarette he was even wearing the same jeans and rumpled green shirt you look horribly healthy it makes me want to smoke more in selfdefense he sucked in a final mouthful of smoke then ground the butt tidily on a broken piece of pottery morrell had given him morrell said youd operate the coffee thingy for me i suppose you know hes gone into town to see someone or other at the state department i knew morrell had gotten up when i did at sixthirty as his departure date loomed hed stopped sleeping wellseveral times in the night id woken to find him staring rigidly at the ceiling in the morning i slid out of bed as quietly as possible going to the guest bathroom in the hall to wash then using his study to leave a message for ralph devereux head of claims at ajax insurance asking for a meeting at his earliest convenience by the time i finished that morrell was up while i did my stretches and drank a glass of juice he answered his mail when i left for my run he was deep in an online chat with humane medicine in rome my return route took me past maxs lakefront home his buick was still in the driveway as were two other cars presumably carls and michaels rentals there didnt seem to be any signs of life musicians go to bed late and get up late max who usually is at work by eight must be following his sons and carls rhythms i stared at the house as if the windows would lead me to the secret thoughts of the men inside what had the man on television last night meant to max and carl they had at least recognized the name i was pretty sure of that had one of their london friends been part of the radbuka family but max had made it clear last night that he wasnt ready to talk about that i shouldnt try to trespass i shook out my legs and finished my run morrell had a semicommercial espresso machine back in his apartment i made cappuccinos for don and myself before showering while i dressed i checked my own messages ralph had called from ajax and would be delighted to squeeze me in at a quarter of twelve i put on the rose silk sweater and sage skirt id worn yesterday it gets complicated spending part of my life at morrellsthe clothes i want are always in my own apartment when im with him or in his place when im home don had moved to the kitchen eating island with the heraldstar when i came in if they took you for a ride on a russian mountain in paris where would you be russian mountain i mixed yogurt and granola with orange slices is this helping you get ready to ask searching comments of posner and durham he grinned im sharpening my wits if you were going to do some fast checking on the therapist who was on television last night where would you start i leaned against the counter while i ate id search the accreditation databases for therapists to see if she was licensed and what her training was id go to proquestshe and the guy from the memory foundation have been mixing it upthere might be some articles about her don scribbled a note on the corner of the crosswordpuzzle clues how long would it take you to do it for me and how much would you charge depends on how deep you wanted to go the basics i could do pretty fast but i charge a hundred dollars an hour with a fivehour initial minimum how generous is gargettes expenses policy he tossed the pencil aside they have four hundred cost accountants in their head office at rheims just to make sure editors like me dont eat more than a big mac on the road so theyre not too likely to spring for a private investigator still this could be a really big book if she is who she says she isif the guy is who he says he is could you do some checking for me on spec i was about to agree when i thought of isaiah sommers carefully counting out his twenties i shook my head unhappily i cant make exceptions for friends it makes it hard for me to charge strangers he pulled out a cigarette and tapped it on the paper okay can you do some checking and trust me for the money i grimaced yeah i guess ill bring a contract back with me tonight he returned to the porch i finished my breakfast and ran water over the bowlmorrell would have a fit if he came home to find casehardened yogurt on itthen followed don out the back door my car was parked in the alley behind the building don was reading the news but looked up to say goodbye on my way down the back stairs the word came to me from nowhere roller coaster if its the same in french as italian a russian mountain is a roller coaster youve already earned your fee he picked up his pencil and turned back to the crossword page before going to my office i swung by global entertainments studios on huron street when the company moved into town a year ago they bought a skyscraper in the hot corridor just northwest of the river their midwest regional offices where they control everything from a hundred seventy newspapers to a big chunk of the broadband dsl business are on the upper levels with their studios on the ground floor global executives are not my biggest fans in chicago but ive worked with beth blacksin since before the company took over channel she was on the premises editing a segment for the evening news she ran out to the lobby in the sloppy jeans she cant wear onair greeting me like a longlost friendor anyway a valuable source i was riveted by your interview yesterday with that guy radbuka i said howd you find him warshawski her expressive face came alive with excitement dont tell me hes been murdered im getting to a live mike calm down my little newshound as far as i know hes still on the planet what can you tell me about him youve found out who the mysterious miriam is then i took her by the shoulders blacksin calm downif youre able im purely on a fishing expedition right now do you have an address youd be willing to give out for him or for the therapist she took me with her past the security station to a warren of cubicles where the news staff had desks she went through a stack of papers next to her computer and found the standard waiver sheet people sign when they give interviews radbuka had listed a suite number at an address on north michigan which i copied down his signature was large and untidy kind of the way hed looked in his toobig suit rhea wiell by contrast wrote in a square almost printlike hand i copied out the spelling of her name and then noticed that radbukas address was the same as hers her office at water tower could you get me a copy of the tape your interview and the discussion between the therapist and the guy from the antihypnosis place that was good work pulling them together at the last minute she grinned my agents happymy contracts coming up in six weeks praeger has a real bee in his bonnet about wiell theyve been adversaries on a bunch of cases not just in chicago but all around the country he thinks shes the devil incarnate and she thinks hes the next thing to a child molester himself theyve both had media trainingthey looked civilized on camera but you should have heard them when the camera wasnt rolling what did you think of radbuka i asked up close and personal did you believe his story do you have proof hes a fraud is that what this is really about i groaned i dont know anything about him zippo niente nada i cant say it in any more languages what was your take on him her eyes opened wide oh vic i believed him completely it was one of the most harrowing interviews ive ever doneand i talked to people after lockerbie can you imagine growing up the way he did and then finding the man who claimed to be your father was like your worst enemy what was his fatherfoster fathers name she scrolled through the text on her screen ulrich whenever paul referred to him he always used the mans german name instead of daddy or father or something do you know what he found in ulrichs papers that made him realize his lost identity in the interview he said they were in code she shook her head still looking at the screen he talked about working it through with rhea and getting the correct interpretation he said they proved to him that ulrich had really been a nazi collaborator he talked a lot about how brutal ulrich had been to him beating him for acting like a sissy locking him in a closet when he was away at work sending him to bed without food there wasnt a woman on the scene or was she a participant in the abuse i asked paul says ulrich told him that his motheror mrs ulrich anywayhad died in the bombing of vienna as the war was ending i dont think mr ulrich ever married here or even had women to the house ulrich and paul seemed to have been a real pair of loners papa went to work came home beat paul paul was supposed to be a doctor but he couldnt handle pressure so he ended up as an xray technician which earned more ridicule he never moved out of his fathers house isnt that creepy staying with him even when he was big enough to earn his own living that was all she could or at least all she would tell me she promised to messenger over a tape of the various segments with radbuka as well as the meeting between the therapists to my office later in the day i still had time before my appointment at ajax to do some work in my office it was only a few miles north and west of globalbut a lightyear away in ambience no glass towers for me three years ago a sculptor friend had invited me to share a sevenyear lease with her for a converted warehouse on leavitt since the building was a fifteenminute drive from the financial district where most of my business lies and the rent was half what you pay in those gleaming highrises id signed on eagerly when we moved in the area was still a grimy nomansland between the latino neighborhood farther west and a slick yuppie area nearer the lake at that time bodegas and palm readers vied with music stores for the few retail spaces in what had been an industrial zone parking abounded even though the yuppies are starting to move in building espresso bars and boutiques we still have plenty of collapsing buildings and drunks i was against further gentrificationi didnt want to see my rent skyrocket when the current lease expired tessas truck was already in our little lot when i pulled in shed received a major commission last month and was putting in long hours to build a model of both the piece and the plaza it would occupy when i passed her studio door she was perched at her outsize drafting table sketching shes testy if interrupted so i went down the hall to my own office without speaking i made a couple of copies of isaiah sommerss uncles policy and locked the original in my office safe where i keep all client documents during an active investigation its really a strongroom with fireproof walls and a good sturdy door midway insurances address was listed on the policy they had sold the policy to aaron sommers all those years back if i couldnt get satisfaction from the company id have to go back to the agentand hope he remembered what hed done thirty years ago i checked the phone book the agency was still on fiftythird street down in hyde park i had two queries to complete for breadandbutter clients while i sat on hold with the board of health i logged on to lexis and proquest and submitted a search on rhea wiell as well as paul radbuka my board of health connection came on the phone and for once answered all my questions without a lot of hedging when id wrapped up my report i checked back with lexis there was nothing on the radbuka name i checked my disks of phone numbers and addresses for the us more uptodate than web search enginesand found nothing when i looked up his fathers name ulrich i got fortyseven matches in the chicago area maybe paul hadnt changed his name legally when he became radbuka rhea wiell on the other hand gave me a lot of hits she had apparently appeared as an expert witness in a number of trials but tracking them down so i could get transcripts would be a tedious business however i did find she was a clinical social worker fully accredited by the state of illinois at least she had started from an authentic position i logged off and swept my papers together into my case so i could be on time for my meeting with the head of the ajax claims department vi staking a claim i originally met ralph devereux early in my life as an investigator it hasnt been so many years but at the time i was the first woman in chicago maybe even the country with a pi license it was a struggle to get clients or witnesses to treat me seriously when ralph took a bullet in his shoulder because he couldnt believe his boss was a crook our relationship fractured as abruptly as his scapula i hadnt seen him since i admit i felt a little nervous anticipation as i rode the l down to ajax s headquarters on adams street when i got off the elevator at the sixtythird floor i even stopped in the ladies room to make sure my hair was combed and my lipstick tidily confined to my mouth the executivefloor attendant escorted me down a mile of parquet to ralphs corner his secretary pronounced my name perfectly and buzzed the inner sanctum ralph emerged smiling both arms held out in greeting i took his hands in my own smiling back trying to hide a twinge of sadness when id met him ralph had been a slimhipped ardent young man with a shock of black hair falling in his eyes and an engaging grin his hair was still thick although liberally tinged with grey but he had jowls now and while he wasnt exactly fat those slim hips had disappeared into the same past as our brief affair i exchanged conventional greetings congratulating him on his promotion to head of the claims department it looks as though you recovered full use of your arm i added just about it still bothers me when the weathers damp i got so depressed after that injurywaiting for it to heal feeling like a moron for letting it happen at allthat i took to cheeseburgers the big shakeups here the last few years havent helped any either you look great though you still running five miles every morning maybe i should hire you to coach me i laughed youre already in your first meeting before i get out of bed youd have to take a lowerpressure job the shakeups you mentionedthose from edelweiss acquiring ajax that came at the end really we took a lot of hits in the market at the same time that hurricane andrew overwhelmed us while we were dealing with that and laying off a fifth of our workforce worldwide edelweiss snapped up a chunk of our depressed stock they were a hostile suitorim sure you followed that in the financial pagesbut they certainly havent been a hostile master they seem quite eager to learn how we do things here rather than wanting to interfere in fact the managing director from zurich whos looking after ajax wanted to sit in on my meeting with you his hand in the small of my back he ushered me into his office where a man with tortoiseshell glasses dressed in a pale wool suit and a bold tie stood when i entered he was around forty with a round merry face that seemed to match the tie more than the suit vic warshawski bertrand rossy from edelweiss re in zurich you two should get along wellvic speaks italian oh really rossy shook hands with the name warshawski i would have assumed polish my mother was from pitiglianovicino orvieto i said i can only stumble through a few stock phrases of polish rossy and i sat in chrome tube chairs next to a glasstopped table ralph himself who had always had an incongruousseeming taste for modernism leaned against the edge of the aluminum tabletop he used as a desk i asked rossy the usual things about where he had acquired his perfect english he had gone to school in england and how he liked chicago very much his wife who was italian had found the summer weather oppressive and had taken their two children to her familys estate in the hills above bologna she just returned this week with paolo and marguerita for the start of the school year here and already im better dressed than i was all summer isnt that right devereux i could barely persuade her to let me out the front door in this tie this morning he laughed loudly showing dimples at the corners of his mouth now i make a campaign to persuade her to try the chicago opera her family have been in the same box at la scala since it opened in and she cant believe a raw young city like this can really produce opera i told him i went to a production once a year in tribute to my mother who had taken me every fall but of course i couldnt compare it to a european opera company nor do i have a family box its the upper gallery for me what we call the nosebleed section he laughed again nosebleed section my colloquial american is going to improve for talking to you we shall all go together one evening if you can condescend to climb down from the nosebleed section but i see devereux looking at his watchoh very discreetly dont be embarrassed devereux a beautiful woman is an inducement to waste precious business minutes but miss warshawski must have come here for some other purpose than to discuss opera i pulled out the photocopy of the aaron sommers policy and explained the events around his aborted funeral i thought if i came straight to you with the situation you could get me an answer fast when ralph took the photocopy out to his secretary i asked rossy if hed attended yesterdays birnbaum conference friends of mine were involved im wondering if edelweiss is concerned about the proposed holocaust asset recovery act rossy put his fingertips together our position is in line with the industry that however legitimate the grief and the grievancesof both the jewish and the africanamerican communitiesthe expense of a policy search shall be most costly for all policyholders for our own company we dont worry about the exposure edelweiss was only a small regional insurer during the war so the likelihood of involvement with large numbers of jewish claimants is small of course now im learning that we do have this fifteenyear history of slavery still taking place in america while ajax was in its early days and i am just now suggesting to ralph that we get ms blount the woman who wrote our little history to look in the archives so we know who our customers were in those very old days assuming she has not already decided to send our archives to this alderman durham but how expensive it is to go back to the past how very costly indeed your history oh that booklet on one hundred fifty years of life i have a copywhich i confess ive yet to read does it cover ajax s preemancipation years do you really think ms blount would hand your documents to an outsider is this the true reason for your visit here ralph says you are a detective are you doing something very subtle very humphrey bogart pretending to care about the sommers claim and trying to trick me with questions about the holocaust and slavery claims i did think this little policy was small small potatoes for you to bring to the director of claims he smiled widely inviting me to treat this as a joke if i wanted to im sure in switzerland as well as here people call on those they know i said ralph and i worked together a number of years ago before he became so exalted so im taking advantage of our relationship in the hopes of a fast answer for my client exalteds the word for me ralph came back in and vic has such a depressing habit of being right about financial crime that its easier to go along with her from the start than fight her what crime surrounds this claim thenwhat are you correct about today rossy asked so far nothing but i havent had time to consult a psychic yet psychic he repeated doubtfully indovina i grinned they abound in the area where i have my office ah psychic rossy exclaimed i have been pronouncing it wrong all these years i must remember to tell my wife about this she is keenly interested in unusual events in my business day psychics and nosebleeds she will enjoy them so much i was saved from trying to respond by ralphs secretary who ushered in a young woman clutching a thick file she was wearing khaki jeans and a sweater that had shrunk from too many washings this is connie ingram mr devereux the secretary said she has the information you wanted ralph didnt introduce rossy or me to ms ingram she blinked at us unhappily but showed her packet to ralph this here is all the documents on l im sorry about being in my jeans and all but my supervisor is away so they told me to bring the file up myself i printed the financials from off the microfiche so they arent as clear as they could be but i did the best i could bertrand rossy joined me when i got up to look over her shoulder at the papers connie ingram flipped through the pages until she came to the payment documents ralph pulled them out of the file and studied them he looked at them for a long moment then turned to me sternly it seems that your clients family was trying to collect twice on the same policy vic we frown on that here i took the pages from him the policy had been paid up in in someone had submitted a death certificate a photocopy of the canceled check was attached it had been paid to gertrude sommers care of the midway insurance agency and duly endorsed by them for a moment i was too dumbfounded to speak the grieving widow must be quite a con artist to convince the nephew into shelling out for his uncles funeral when shed collected on the policy a decade ago but how on earth had she gotten a death certificate back then my first coherent thought was meanspirited i was glad id insisted on earnest money up front i doubted isaiah sommers would have paid to learn this bit of news this isnt your idea of a joke is it vic ralph demanded he was angry because he thought he looked foolishly incompetent in front of his new master i wasnt going to ride him scouts honor ralph the story i told you is the identical one i got from my client have you ever seen something like this before a fraudulent death certificate it happens he flicked a glance at rossy usually its someone faking his own death to get away from creditors and then the circumstances of the policythe sizethe timing between when it was sold and when it was cashedmake us investigate before we pay for something like thishe snapped the canceled check with his middle fingerwe wouldnt investigate such a small face valueand one where wed collected all the premium years before so the possibility exists the possibility that people are submitting claims that arent rightfully theirs rossy took the whole file from ralph and started going through it one page at a time but the company would only pay once ralph said as you can see we had all the information available when the funeral home submitted the policy so we didnt pay the claim twice i dont suppose anyone from the agency would have bothered to check whether the purchaserhe looked at the tab on the filewhether sommers was really dead when his wife filed the claim connie ingram asked doubtfully if she should talk to her supervisor about calling the agency or the funeral home ralph turned to me are you going to talk to them anyway vic will you let connie know what you find out the truth i mean not some version that you want ajax to learn if miss warshawski is in the habit of hiding her findings from the company ralph perhaps we shouldnt trust her with these delicate questions rossy gave me a little bow im sure you would ask your questions so skillfully that our agent might be startled into telling youwhat he ought to keep between himself and the company ralph started to say that he was only trying to bait me then sighed and told connie by all means to ask any questions she needed to reclose the file ralph what if someone else filed the claim someone pretending to be gertrude sommers i said would the company make her whole ralph rubbed the deepening crease between his eyes dont ask me to make moral decisions without the facts what if it was her husbandor her kid hes listed as a secondary beneficiary after her or her minister im not going to commit the company to anything until i know the truth he was talking to me but looking at rossy who was looking at his watch not at all discreetly ralph muttered something about their next appointment this made me more uneasy even than the fraud over the claim i dont like my lovers even longformer lovers to feel the need to be obsequious as i left the office i asked ralph for a photocopy of the canceled check and the death certificate rossy answered for him these are company documents devereux but if you dont let me show them to my client then he has no way of knowing whether im lying to him i said you remember the case this last spring where various lifeinsurance companies admitted to charging black customers as much as four times the amount they did whites i assure you that will leap into my clients mind and then instead of me coming around asking for documents in a nice way you might have a federal lawsuit with a subpoena attached rossy stared at me suddenly frosty if the threat of a lawsuit seems to your mind to be asking in a nice way then i have to ask myself questions about your business practices with the dimples in abeyance he showed he could be a formidable corporate presence i smiled and took his hand turning it to look at the palm he was startled into standing motionless signor rossy i wasnt threatening you with a lawsuit i was an indovina reading your fortune foreseeing an inevitable future the frost melted abruptly what other things do you divine i put his hand down my powers are limited but you seem to have a long lifeline now with your permission may i copy the canceled check and the death certificate forgive my swiss habits of being unwilling to part with official documents by all means make copies of these two papers but the file as a whole i think ill keep with me just in case your charm makes you more persuasive with this young lady than her normal loyalties would allow you to be he gestured at connie ingram who blushed sir im really sorry sir but can you fill out a slip for me i cant let a claim file stay out of our area without a notice of the number and of who has it ah so you have respect for documents as well excellent you write down what you need and i will sign it will that fulfill the requirements her color spreading to her collarbone connie ingram went out to ralphs secretary to type up what she needed i followed with the documents i was allowed to have ralphs secretary copied them for me ralph walked partway down the hall with me stay in touch vic okay i would be grateful to hear from you if you learn anything about this business youll be the second to know i promised you going to be equally forthcoming naturally he grinned briefly showing a trace of the old ralph and if i remember right im likely to be much more forthcoming than you i laughed but i still felt sad as i waited for the elevator when the doors finally opened with a subdued ding a young woman in a prim tweed suit stepped off clutching a tan briefcase to her side the dreadlocks tidily pulled away from her face made me blink in recognition ms blountim v i warshawskiwe met at the ajax gala a month ago she nodded and briefly touched my fingertips i need to be in a meeting ah yes with bertrand rossy i thought of putting her on her guard against rossys accusation that she was siphoning off company documents for bull durham but she whisked herself down the hall toward ralphs office before i could make up my mind the elevator that brought her had left before another arrived connie ingram joined me her paperwork apparently finished mr rossy seems very protective of his documents i commented we cant afford to misplace any paper around here she said primly people can sue us if we dont have our records in tiptop shape are you worried about a suit from the sommers family mr devereux said the agent was responsible for the claim so its not our problem here at the company but of course he and mr rossy she stopped redfaced as if remembering rossys comment about my persuasive charms the elevator arrived and she scurried into it it was twelveforty heart of the lunch hour the elevator stopped every two or three floors to take in people before making its express descent from forty to the ground i wondered what indiscretion she had bitten back but there wasnt any way i could pump her vii cold call something there is that doesnt love a fence i muttered as i boarded the northbound l lots of people on the train were muttering to themselves i fit right in when someone is guarding documents is it because his corporate culture is obsessive as rossy said or because theres something in them he doesnt want me to see because hes in the pay of the united nations the man next to me said theyre bringing in tanks those united nations heliecopters landing in deetroit i seen them on tv youre right i said to his beery face its definitely a un plot so you think i should go down to midway insurance talk to the agent see if my charms are persuasive enough to wangle a look at the sales file your charms plenty persuasive enough for me he leered that was esteemenhancing when i got off the train at western i picked up my car and immediately headed south again down in hyde park i found a meter with forty minutes on it on one of the side streets near the bank where midway insurance had their offices the bank building itself was the neighborhoods venerable dowager its ten stories towering over hyde park s main shopping street the facade had recently been cleaned up but once i got off the elevator onto the sixth floor the dim lights and dingy walls betrayed a management indifference to tenant comfort midway insurance was wedged between a dentist and a gynecologist the black letters on the door telling me they insured life home and auto had been there a long time part of the h in home had peeled away so that it looked as though midway insured nome the door was locked but when i rang the bell someone buzzed me in the office beyond was even drearier than the hall the flickering fluorescent light was so dim that i didnt notice a peeling corner of linoleum until id tripped on it i grabbed at a filing cabinet to keep from falling sorryi keep meaning to fix that i hadnt noticed the man until he spokehe was sitting at a desk that took up most of the room but the light was bad enough i hadnt seen him when i opened the door i hope you buy premises insurance because youre inviting a nasty suit if you dont glue that down i snapped coming all the way into the room he turned on a desk lamp revealing a face with freckles so thick that they formed an orange carpet across his face at my words the carpet turned a deeper red i dont get much walkin business he explained most of the time were in the field i looked around but there wasnt a desk for a second person i moved a phone book from the only other chair and sat down you have partners subordinates i inherited the business from my dad he died three years ago but i keep forgetting that i think the business is going to die too i never have been much good with cold calls and now the internet is killing independent agents mentioning the internet reminded him that his computer was on he flicked a key to start the screensaver but before the fish began cascading i saw hed been playing some kind of solitaire the computer was the only newish item in the room his desk was a heavy yellow wooden one the kind popular fifty years ago with two rows of drawers framing a kneehole for the users legs black stains from decades of grime coffee ink and who knows what scarred the yellow in the places i could see itmost of the surface was covered in a depressing mass of paper my own office looked monastic by comparison four large filing cabinets took up most of the remaining space a curling poster of the chinese national tabletennis team provided the only decoration a large pot hung from a chain above the window but the plant within had withered down to a few drying leaves he sat up and tried to put a semblance of energy into his tone what can i do for you im v i warshawski i handed him one of my cards and you are fepple howard fepple he looked at my card oh the detective they told me youd be calling i looked at my watch it had been just over an hour since i left ajax someone in the company had moved fast who told you that bertrand rossy i dont know the name it was one of the girls in claims women i corrected irritably whatever anyway she told me youd be asking about one of our old policies which i cant tell you anything about because i was in high school when it was sold so you looked it up what did it tell you about who cashed it in he leaned back in his chair the man at ease i cant see why thats any of your business i grinned evilly all ideas about charm and persuasion totally forgotten the sommers family whom i represent have an interest in this matter that could be satisfied by a federal lawsuit involving subpoenas for the files and suing the agency for fraud maybe your father sold the policy to aaron sommers back in but you own the agency now it wouldnt be the internet that would finish you off his fleshy lips pursed together in a pout for your information it wasnt my father who sold the policy but rick hoffman who worked for him here so where can i find mr hoffman he smirked wherever you look for the dead but i dont imagine old rick ended up in heaven he was a mean sob how he did as well as he did he shrugged eloquently you mean unlike you he wasnt afraid of the cold call he was a friday man you know going into the poor neighborhoods on friday afternoons collecting after people got paid a lot of our business is life insurance like that small face value enough to get someone buried right and leave a little for the family its all someone like this sommers could probably afford ten thousand although that was big by our standards usually theyre only three or four thousand so hoffman collected from aaron sommers had he paid up the policy fepple tapped a file on top of the mess of papers oh yes yes it took him fifteen years but it was paid in full the beneficiaries were his wife gertrude and his son marcus so who cashed it in and if they did how come the family still had the policy looking at me resentfully fepple started through the file page by page he stopped at one point staring at a document his lips moving soundlessly a little smile flickered at the corners of his mouth an unpleasant secretive smile but after a moment he continued the search finally he pulled out the same documents id already seen at the company a copy of the death certificate and a copy of the countersigned check what else was in the file i asked nothing he said quickly there was nothing unusual about it at all rick did a zillion of these little weekend sales theres no surprise to them i didnt believe him but i didnt have a way to call his bluff not much of a way to make a living three and fourthousanddollar sales rick did real well for himself he knew how to work the angles ill tell you that much and what youre not telling me im not telling you my private business youve barged in here without an appointment fishing around for dirt but you dont have any grounds to ask questions and dont go waving federal lawsuits at me if there was any funny business about this it was the companys responsibility not mine did hoffman have any family a son i dont know what happened to himhe was a whole lot older than me and he and old rick didnt hit it off too great i had to go to the funeral with my old man and we were the only damned people in the church the son was long gone by then so who inherited hoffmans share of the business fepple shook his head he wasnt a partner he worked for my old man strictly commission buthe did well so why dont you pick up his client list and carry on for him the nasty little smile reappeared i might just do that very thing i didnt realize until the company called me what a little gold mine ricks way of doing business represented i wanted to see that file badly but short of grabbing it from the desk and running off down the stairs into the arms of the guard in the lobby i couldnt think of any way to look at it at least not at the moment as i left i tripped again on the corner of the linoleum if fepple didnt fix it soon id be suing him myself since i was already south i went on another two miles to sixtyseventh street where the delaney funeral parlor stood it was in an imposing white building easily the grandest on the block with four hearses parked in the lot behind it i left my mustang next to them and went in to see what i could learn old mr delaney talked to me himself about how sorry they were to have had to inflict such grief on a sweet decent woman like sister sommers but that he couldnt afford to bury people for charity if you did it once every freeloader on the south side would be coming around with some story or other about their insurance falling through as to how hed learned that sommerss policy had already been cashed in they had a simple procedure with the lifeinsurance companies they had called given the policy number and been told that the policy had already been paid i asked who hed spoken to i dont give anything away free young lady mr delaney said austerely if you want to pursue your own inquiries at the company i urge you to do so but dont expect me to give you for nothing information i spent my hardearned money finding out all i will tell you is that it isnt the first time this has happened that a bereaved family has discovered that their loved one had disposed of his resources without privileging them with the information it isnt a regular occurrence but families are often sadly surprised at the behavior of their loved ones human nature can be all too human a lesson im sure gertrude sommers and her nephew learned at aaron sommerss funeral i said getting up to leave he bowed his head mournfully as if unaware of the bite behind my words he hadnt gotten to be one of the richest men in south shore by apologizing for his rigorous business methods viii tales of hoffman the score so far today seemed to be warshawski zero visitors three i hadnt gotten any satisfaction from ajax or the midway agency or the funeral director while i was south i might as well complete my sweep of frustrating meetings by visiting the widow she lived a few blocks from the dan ryan expressway in a rickety twelveflat with a burntout building on one side and a lot with bits of masonry and rustedout cars on the other a couple of guys were leaning over the engine of an elderly chevy when i pulled up the only other person on the street was a fiercelooking woman muttering as she sucked from a brown paper bag the sommerses doorbell didnt seem to work but the street door hung loosely on its hinges so i went on into the building the stairwell smelled of urine and stale grease dogs barked from behind several doors as i passed briefly overwhelming the thin hopeless wail of a baby i was so depressed by the time i reached gertrude sommerss door that i was hard put to knock instead of beating a craven retreat a few minutes passed finally i heard a slow step and a deep voice calling to know who it was i told her my name that i was the detective her nephew had hired she scraped back the three dead bolts holding the door and stood in the entrance for a moment looking me over somberly before letting me in gertrude sommers was a tall woman even in old age she was a good two inches taller than my fiveeight and even in grief she held herself erect she was wearing a dark dress that rustled when she walked a black lace handkerchief tucked in the cuff of her left sleeve underscored her mourning looking at her made me feel grubby in my workworn skirt and sweater i followed her into the apartments main room standing until she pointed regally at the sofa the bright floral upholstery was shielded in heavy plastic which crackled loudly when i sat down the buildings squalor ended on her doorstep every surface that wasnt encased in plastic shone with polish from the dining table against the far wall to the clock with its fake chimes over the television the walls were hung with pictures many of the same smiling child and a formal shot of my client and his wife on their wedding day to my surprise alderman durham was on the wallonce in a solo shot and again with his arms around two young teens in his blue empower youth energy sweatshirts one of the boys was leaning on metal crutches but both were beaming proudly im sorry for your loss ms sommers and sorry for the terrible mixup over your husbands life insurance she folded her lips tightly she wasnt going to help i plowed ahead as best i could laying the photocopies of the fraudulent death certificate and canceled insurance check in front of her im bewildered by this situation im wondering if you have any suggestions about how it could have occurred she refused to look at the documents how much did they pay you to come here and accuse me no one paid me to do that and no one could pay me to do that ms sommers easy words easy words for you to say young woman true enough i paused trying to feel my way into her point of view my mother died when i was fifteen if some stranger had cashed in her burial policy and then accused my dad of doing it well i can imagine what he would have done and he was an easygoing guy but if i cant ask you any questions about this how am i ever going to find out who cashed this policy all those years ago she clamped her lips together thinking it over then said have you talked to the insurance man that mr hoffman who came around every friday afternoon before mr sommers could spend his pay on drink or whatever he imagined a poor black man would do instead of putting food on his familys table mr hoffman is dead the agency is in the hands of the previous owners son who doesnt seem to know too much about the business did mr hoffman treat your husband with disrespect she sniffed we werent people to him we were ticks in that book he carried around with him driving up in that big mercedes like he did we knew just where our hardsaved nickels went and no way to question whether he was honest or not you think now he cheated you how else do you explain this she slapped the papers on the table still without looking at them you think i am deaf dumb and blind i know what goes on in this country with black folk and insurance i read how that company in the south got caught charging black folk more than their policies were worth did that happen to you no but we paid we paid and we paid and we paid all to have it go up in smoke if you didnt file the claim in and you dont think your husband did who would have i asked she shook her head but her gaze inadvertently went to the wall of photographs i drew a breath this isnt easy to ask but your son was listed on the policy her look scorched me my son my son died it was because of him we went after a bigger policy thinking to leave him a little something besides our funerals mr sommerss and mine muscular dystrophy our boy had and in case youre thinking oh well they cashed the policy to pay his medical bills let me tell you miss mr sommers worked two shifts for four years paying those bills i had to quit my job to take care of my son when he got too sick to move anymore after he passed i worked two shifts too to get rid of the bills at the nursing home where i was an aide if youre going to pry into all my private details you can have that one without charging my nephew a nickel for it the grand crossing elder care home but you can go snooping through my life maybe i have a secret drinking viceyoull go ask them at the church where i became a christian and where my husband was a deacon for fortyfive years maybe mr sommers gambled and used all my housekeeping money thats the way you plan on ruining my reputation isnt it i looked at her steadily so you wont let me ask you any questions about the policy and you cant think of anyone who might have cashed it in you dont have other nephews or nieces besides mr isaiah sommers who might have again her gaze turned to the wall on an impulse i asked her who the other boy was in the picture of alderman durham with her son thats my nephew colby and no youre not getting a shot along with the cops to pin something on him nor yet on the aldermans empower youth energy organization alderman durham has been a good friend to my family and to this neighborhood and his group gives boys something to do with their time and energy it didnt seem like the right time or place to ask about the rumors that eye members hustled campaign contributions with a judicious use of muscle i turned back to the papers in front of us and asked about rick hoffman what was he like can you imagine him stealing the policy from you oh what do i know about him except like i said his leather book that he ticked off our names in he could have been adolf hitler for all i know did he sell insurance to a lot of people in this building i persisted and why do you want to know that id like to find out if other people who bought from him had the same experience you did at that she finally looked at me instead of through me in this building no at where aaronmr sommersworked yes my husband was at south branch scrap metal mr hoffman knew people want to be buried decent so he came around to places like that on the south side must have had ten or twenty businesses hed hit on friday afternoon sometimes hed collect at the shop yard sometimes hed come here it all depended on his schedule and aaron mr sommers he paid his five dollars a week for fifteen years until he was paid up would you have any way of knowing the names of some of the other people who bought from hoffman she studied me again trying to assess whether this was a soft sell and deciding finally to take a chance that i was being genuine i could give you four names the men my husband worked with they all bought from hoffman because he made it easy coming around like he did does this mean you understand im telling the truth about this she swept a hand toward my documents still without looking at them i grimaced i have to consider all the possibilities ms sommers she eyed me bitterly i know my nephew meant it for the best hiring you but if hed known how little respect youd have im not disrespecting you ms sommers you told your nephew youd talk to me you know the kinds of questions this must raise theres a death certificate with your husbands name on it with your name on it as the presenter dated almost ten years ago with a check made out to you through the midway insurance agency someone cashed it if im going to find out who i have to start somewhere it would help me believe you if i could find other people this same thing happened to her face pinched up with anger but after sitting in silence while the clock ticked off thirty seconds she pulled a lined notepad from under the telephone wetting her index finger she turned the pages of a weatherbeaten address book and finally wrote down a series of names still without speaking she handed the list to me the interview was over i picked my way back along the unlit hall and down the stairs the baby was still wailing outside the men were still huddled over the chevy when i unlocked the mustang the men shouted over a jovial offer to trade i grinned and waved oh the kindness of strangers it was only when people talked to me they got so hostile there was a lesson in there for me but not one i particularly wished to pursue it was almost three i hadnt eaten since my yogurt at eight this morning maybe the situation would seem less depressing if i had some food i passed a strip mall on my way to the expressway and bought a slice of cheese pizza the crust was gooey the surface glistened with oil but i ate every bite with gusto when i got out of my car at the office i realized id dripped oil down the front of my rose silk sweater warshawski zero visitors five at this point at least i didnt have any business meetings this afternoon my parttime assistant mary louise neely was at her desk she handed me a packet with the video of the radbuka interviews which beth blacksin had messengered over i stuffed it in my briefcase and brought mary louise up to date with the sommers case so she could check on the other men who had bought insurance from rick hoffman then told her about dons interest in paul radbuka i couldnt find anyone named radbuka in the system i finished so either vicif he changed his name he had to do so in front of a judge there will be a court order mary louise looked at me as though i were the village idiot i gaped at her like a dying pike and meekly went to turn on my computer it was small comfort that if radbuka or ulrich or whatever his name was had taken any legal action it wasnt in the system yet i should have thought of that myself mary louise not wanting to go stomping far and wide through the city didnt believe radbuka wasnt somewhere in the system she did her own search and then said she would stop at the courts in the morning to doublecheck the paper record although maybe the therapist will tell you where to find him whats her name when i told her her eyes opened wide rhea wiell the rhea wiell you know her i spun around in my chair to face her not personally mary louises skin turned the same orangy pink as her hair but because you know because of my own story i followed her career i sat in on some of the trials where she testified mary louise had run away from an abusive home when she was a teenager after a tumultuous ride through sex and drugs shed pulled herself together and become a police officer in fact the three children she was fostering had been rescued from an abusive home so it wasnt surprising she paid special attention to a therapist who worked with molested children wiell used to be with the state department of children and family services she was one of the staff therapists she worked with kids but she also was an expert witness in court cases that hinged on abuse remember the maclean trial as mary louise described it the details began coming back to me the guy was a law professor whod started life as a du page county criminal prosecutor when his name was put forward for a federal judgeship his daughter by then a grown woman came forward to denounce him as having raped her when she was a child she was insistent enough that she forced the state to bring charges various rightwing family foundations had ridden to macleans rescue claiming the daughter was the mouthpiece of a liberal smear campaign since the father was a conservative republican in the end the jury in the criminal sexualassault trial found for the father but his name was dropped from consideration for the judgeship and wiell testified i asked mary louise more than that she was the daughters therapist it was working with rhea wiell that made the woman recover the memories of abuse when shed blocked them for twenty years the defense brought in arnold praeger from the planted memory foundation he tried all kinds of cheap shots to make her look bad but he couldnt shake her mary louise glowed with admiration so praeger and wiell go back a ways together i dont know about that but they definitely have been adversaries in court for quite a few years i put in a search to proquest before i left this morning if their fights have been in the news i should have the stories i brought up my proquest search mary louise came to read over my shoulder the case she had mentioned had generated a lot of ink at the time i skimmed a couple of pieces in the heraldstar which praised wiells unflappable testimony mary louise bristled with anger over an oped piece arnold praeger had run in the wall street journal criticizing both wiell and the law which would allow the testimony of young children who had clearly been coached in what they remembered wiell wasnt even a reputable therapist praeger concluded if she was why had the state of illinois dropped her from its payroll dropped her i said to mary louise sending the piece to the printer with several of the others do you know about that no i assumed she decided private practice was a better place to be sooner or later just about everyone gets burned out working for dcfs mary louises pale eyes were troubled i thought she was a really good really genuine therapist i cant believe the state would fire her or at least not for any good reason maybe out of spite she was the best they had but theres always a lot of jealousy in offices like that when i saw her in court i used to imagine she was my mother in fact i was incredibly jealous of a woman i met who saw her professionally she laughed in embarrassment ive got to go time for me to pick up the kids before class ill do those sommers queries first thing tomorrow you filling in your time sheets yes maam i saluted her smartly its not a joke vic she said sternly its the only way i know i know mary louise doesnt like to be teased which can be boringbut probably also is why shes such a good office manager when mary louise had left promising to stop by the courts to check for radbukas changeofname filing i called a lawyer i knew in the state department of children and family services wed met at a seminar on women and law in the public sector and kept in touch in a desultory way she referred me to a supervisor in the dcfs office who would speak if it was far off the record the supervisor wanted to call me back from a pay phone in case her desk line was being monitored i had to wait until five when the woman stopped at a public phone in the basement of the illinois center on her way home before shed tell me anything my informant made me swear i wasnt calling on behalf of the planted memory foundation not everyone at dcfs believes in hypnotherapy but nobody here wants to see our clients hurt by one of those planted memory lawsuits when i assured her by running through a list of possible references until i hit on a name she knew and trusted she was amazingly frank rhea was the most empathic therapist we ever used she got incredible results from kids who would hardly even give their names to other therapists i still miss her when we have certain kinds of trauma cases the trouble was she began to see herself as the priestess of dcfs you couldnt question her results or her judgment i dont remember exactly when she started her private practice maybe six years ago doing it parttime but it was three years ago when we decided to sever her contract with the state the press release said it was her decision that she wanted to concentrate on her practice but the feeling here was that she wouldnt take direction she was always right weor the state attorney general or anyone who disagreed with herwere wrong and you cant have a staff person someone you rely on with kids and in court who always wants to be joan of arc did you think she might misrepresent a situation for her own glory i asked oh no nothing like that she wasnt out for gloryshe was on a mission im telling you some of the younger women started calling her mother teresa and not always out of admiration actually that was part of the problem she split the office straight in half between rhea worshipers and rhea doubters and then she wouldnt let you question how she came to a conclusion like in that one case where the guy she was accusing of molestation was a former prosecutor whod been nominated for a federal judgeship rhea wouldnt let us see her case notes before she testified if the case had backfired we could have been facing a ton of damages i thumbed through my stack of printouts wasnt the daughter who brought the charges part of wiells private practice yes but rhea was still on the state payroll so the guy could have claimed she was using state office space or facilities for photocopying or whatnotanything like that would have brought us into a lawsuit we couldnt afford that kind of exposure we had to let her go now you tell me since ive been so frank with you whats rhea done that means a pi is interested in her id known id have to cough up something tit for tat its how you keep information coming to you one of her clients was in the news this week i dont know if you saw the guy with the recovered memories from the holocaust someone wants to write a book about him and about how rhea works ive been asked to do some background checking one thing rhea knows better than any other therapist who ever worked for this office and thats how to attract attention my informant hung up smartly ix princess of austria so she is a legitimate therapist controversial but legitimate i said to the glowing tip of dons cigarette if you did a book with her you wouldnt be signing on with a fraud actually theyre excited enough in new york that i went ahead and scheduled an appointment with the lady tomorrow at eleven if youre free want to sit in on it maybe shell allow you to bring back a report to dr herschel that will help you allay her concerns under the circumstances i cant imagine that happening but i would like to meet rhea wiell we were sitting on morrells back porch it was close to ten but morrell was still downtown at a meeting with some state department officialsi had an uneasy feeling they were trying to persuade him to do some spying while he was in kabul i was wrapped in one of morrells old sweaters drawing some small comfort from itwhich made me feel like mitch and peppythe dogs like to have my old socks to play with when im out of town lotty had brought my day to such a ragged end that i needed what comfort i could find id been running since i kissed morrell goodbye this morning even though i still had a dozen urgent tasks i was too tired to keep going before dictating my case notes before calling isaiah sommers before going home to run the dogs before heading back to morrells place with a contract for don strzepek to cover my queries about rhea wiell i needed to rest just half an hour on the portable bed in my back room id thought half an hour would make me fit enough to cram another days work into the evening it was almost ninety minutes later that my client roused me what made you go down to my aunt with all those accusations he demanded when the phone dragged me awake couldnt you respect her widowhood what accusations my mouth and eyes felt as though theyd been stuffed with cotton going to her home and saying she stole money from the insurance company if i hadnt been bleary from my nap i might have answered more coolly but maybe not i will make every allowance for your aunts grief but that is not what i said and before you call to accuse me of such abominable behavior why dont you ask me what i said all right im asking you his voice was leaden with suppressed anger i showed your aunt the canceled check the company issued when a death claim was submitted nine years ago i asked her what she knew about it that is not an accusation a check for her had been made out in care of the midway insurance agency i couldnt pretend her name wasnt on the check i couldnt pretend ajax hadnt issued it based on a bona fide death certificate i had to ask her about it you should have talked to me first im the person who paid you i cannot consult with clients about every step i take in an investigation id never get anything done you took my money you spent it on accusing my aunt your contract says i can terminate our arrangement at any time i am terminating it now fine i snapped terminate away someone committed fraud with your uncles policy if you want them to get away with it so be it of course i dont want that but ill look into the matter on my own in a way that will respect my aunt i should have known a white detective would act just like the police i should have listened to my wife he hung up it wasnt the first time an angry client had fired me but ive never learned to take it with equanimity i could have done things differently i should have called him called him before i went to see his aunt gotten him on my side or at least called him before i went to sleep i could have kept my tempermy besetting sin i tried to remember exactly what id said to his aunt damn it i should do as mary louise said dictate my notes as soon as i finished a meeting better late than never i could start with my phone conversation with the client exclient i dialed up the wordprocessing service i use and dictated a summary of the call adding a letter to sommers confirming that hed canceled my services id enclose his uncles policy with the letter when id finished with isaiah sommers i dictated notes from my other conversations of the day working backward from my informant at family services to my meeting with ralph at ajax lotty called on the other line when i was halfway through reconstructing my encounter with the insurance agent howard fepple max told me about the program he saw with you at morrells last night she said without preamble it sounded very disturbing it was he didnt know whether to believe the mans story or not did morrell make a tape of the interview not that i know of i got a copy of the tape today which i can i want to see it will you bring it to my apartment this evening please it came out as a command not a request lotty this isnt your operating room i dont have time to stop at your place tonight but in the morning i this is a very simple favor victoria which has nothing to do with my operating room you dont need to leave the tape with me but i want to see it you can stand over me while i watch it lotty i dont have the time i will get copies made tomorrow and let you have one of your very own but this one is for a client who hired me to investigate the situation a client she was outraged did max hire you without either of you talking to me my forehead felt as though it were squeezed inside a vise if he did thats between him and me not you and me what difference does it make to you what difference that he violated a trust thats what matters when he told me about this person at the conference this man calling himself radbuka i said we shouldnt act hastily and that i would give him my opinion after i had seen the interview i took a deep breath and tried to bring my brain into focus so the radbuka name means something to you and to max and to carl from our days in london max thought we should hire you to find out about this man i wanted to wait i thought max respected my opinion she was almost spitting mad but her explanation made me say gently take it easy lotty max didnt hire me this is a separate matter i told her about don strzepeks interest in doing a book about rhea wiell showcasing paul radbukas recovered memory im sure he wouldnt object to sharing the tape with you but i really dont have time to do it tonight i still need to finish some work here go to my own place to look after the dogs and then im going up to evanston do you want me to tell morrell that youll be coming up to view the tape at his place i want the dead past to bury the dead she burst out why are you letting this don go digging around in it im not letting him and im not stopping him all im doing is checking to see whether rhea wiell is a genuine therapist then youre letting not stopping she sounded close to tears i picked my words carefully i can only begin to imagine how painful it must be to you to be reminded of the war years but not everyone feels that way yes to many people it is a game something to romanticize or kitschify or use for titillation and a book about a ghoul feasting on the remains of the dead only helps make that happen if paul radbuka is not a ghoul but has a genuine past in the concentration camp he mentioned then he has a right to claim his heritage what does the person in your group whos connected to the radbukas say about this did you talk to him or her that person no longer exists she said harshly this is between max and carl and me and now you and now this journalist don whoever he is and the therapist and every jackal in new york and hollywood who will pick over the bones and salivate with pleasure at another shocking tale publishers and movie studios make fortunes from titillating the comfortable wellfed middle class of europe and america with tales of torture i had never heard lotty speak in such a bitter way it hurt as if my fingers were being run through a grater i didnt know what to say except to repeat my offer to bring her a copy of the tape the next day she hung up on me i sat at my desk a long time blinking back tears of my own my arms ached i lacked the will to move or act in any meaningful way but in the end i picked up the phone and continued dictating my notes to the wordprocessing center when i had finished that i got up slowly like an invalid and printed out a copy of my contract for don strzepek maybe if i talked to dr herschel myself don said now as we sat on morrells porch shes imagining me as a tv reporter sticking a mike in front of her face after her familys been destroyed shes right in a way about how we comfortable americans and europeans like to titillate ourselves with tales of torture i shall have to keep that thought in mind as a corrective when im working on this book all the same maybe i can persuade her that i also have some capacity for empathy maybe max will probably let me bring you to his dinner party on sunday at least you could meet lotty in an informal way i didnt really see it though usually when lotty got on her high horse max would snort and say she was in her princess of austria mode that would spark another flare from her but shed back away from her more extreme demands tonights outburst had been rawer than thatnot the disdain of a hapsburg princess but a ragged fury born of grief lotty herschels story four gold coins my mother was seven months pregnant and weak from hunger so my father took hugo and me to the train it was early in the morning still dark in fact we jews were trying not to attract any more attention than necessary although we had permits to leave all our documents the tickets we could still be stopped at any second i wasnt yet ten and hugo only five but we knew the danger so well we didnt need papas command to be silent in the streets saying goodbye to my mother and oma had frightened me my mother used to spend weeks away from us with papa but i had never left oma before by then of course everyone was living together in a little flat in the leopoldsgassei cant remember how many aunts and cousins now besides my grandparentsbut at least twenty in london lying in the cold room at the top of the house on the narrow iron bed minna considered appropriate for a child i wouldnt think about the cramped space on the leopoldsgasse i concentrated on remembering oma and opas beautiful flat where i had my own white lacy bed the curtains at the window dotted with rosebuds my school where my friend klara and i were always one and two in the class how hurt i wasi couldnt understand why she stopped playing with me and then why i had to leave the school altogether i had whined at first over sharing a room with six other cousins in a place with peeling paint but papa took me for a walk early one morning so he could talk to me alone about our changed circumstances he was never cruel not like uncle arthur mamas brother who actually beat aunt freia besides hitting his own children we walked along the canal as the sun was rising and papa explained how hard things were for everyone for oma and opa forced out of the family flat after all these years and for mama with all her pretty jewels stolen by the nazis and worrying about how her children would be fed and clothed let alone educated lottchen you are the big girl in the family now your cheerful spirit is mamas most precious gift show her you are the brave one the cheerful one and now that shes sick with the new baby coming show her you can help her by not complaining and by taking care of hugo what shocks me now is knowing that my fathers parents were also in that flat and how little i remember of them in fact im pretty sure that it was their flat they were foreign you see from belarus they were part of the vast throng of eastern european jews who had flocked into vienna around the time of the first world war oma and opa looked down on them it confuses me that realization because i loved my mothers parents so much they doted on me too i was their precious lingerls beloved child but i think oma and opa despised papas parents for speaking only yiddish not german and for their odd clothes and religious practices it was a terrible humiliation for oma and opa when they were forced to leave the renngasse to live in that immigrant jewish quarter people used to call it the matzoinsel the matzo island a term of contempt even oma and opa when they didnt think papa was around would talk about his family on the insel oma would laugh her ladylike laugh at the fact that papas mother wore a wig and i felt guilty because i was the one who had revealed this primitive practice to oma she liked to interrogate me about the customs on the insel after i had been there and then she would remind me that i was a herschel i was to stand up straight and make something of my life and not to use the yiddish i picked up on the insel that was vulgar and herschels were never vulgar papa would take me to visit his parents once a month or so i was supposed to call them zeyde and bobe grandpa and grandma in yiddish as opa and oma are in german when i think about them now i grow hot with shame for withholding from them the affection and respect they desired papa was their only son i was the oldest grandchild but even to call them zeyde and bobe as they requested seemed disgusting to me and bobes blond wig over her closecropped black hair that seemed disgusting as well i hated that i looked like papas side of the family my mother was so lovely very fair with beautiful curls and a mischievous smile and as you can see i am dark and not at all beautiful mischlinge cousin minna called me halfbreed although never in front of my grandparents to opa and oma i was always beautiful because i was their darling lingerls daughter it wasnt until i came to live with minna in england that i ever felt ugly what torments me is that i cant recall my fathers sisters or their children at all i shared a bed with five or maybe six cousins and i cant remember them only that i hated not being in my own lovely white bedroom by myself i remember kissing oma and weeping but i didnt even say goodbye to bobe you think i should remember i was only a child no even a child has the capacity for human and humane behavior each child was allowed one small suitcase for the train oma wanted us to take leather valises from her own luggagethose had not been of interest to the nazis when they stole her silver and her jewels but opa was more practical and understood hugo and i mustnt attract attention by looking as though we came from a rich home he found us cheap cardboard cases which anyway were easier for young children to carry by the day the train left hugo and i had packed and repacked our few possessions many times trying to decide what we couldnt bear to live without the night before we left opa took the dress i was going to wear on the train out to oma everyone was asleep except me i was lying rigid with nervousness in the bed i shared with the other cousins when opa came in i watched him through slits in my closed eyes when he tiptoed out with the dress i slid out of bed and followed him to my grandmothers side oma put a finger on her lips when she saw me and silently picked apart the waistband she took four gold coins from the hem of her own skirt and stitched them into the waist underneath the buttons these are your security opa said tell no one not hugo not papa not anyone you wont know when you will need them he and oma didnt want to cause friction in the family by letting them know they had a small emergency hoard if the aunts and uncles knew lingerls children were getting four precious gold coinswell when people are frightened and living too close together anything can happen the next thing i knew papa was shaking me awake giving me a cup of the weak tea we all drank for breakfast some adult had found enough canned milk for each child to get a tablespoon in it most mornings if i had realized i wouldnt see any of them againbut it was hard enough to leave to go to a strange country where we knew only cousin minna and only that she was a bitter woman who made all the children uncomfortable when she came to kleinsee for her threeweek holiday in the summersif id known it was the last goodbye i wouldnt have been able to bearthe leaving or the next several years when the train left it was a cold april day rain pouring in sheets across the leopoldsgasse as we walkednot to the central station but a small suburban one that wouldnt attract attention papa wore a long red scarf which he put on so hugo and i could spot him easily from the train he was a café violinist or had been anyway and when he saw us leaning out a window he whipped out his violin and tried to play one of the gypsy tunes he had taught us to dance to even hugo could tell misery was making his hand quaver and he howled at papa to stop making such a noise i will see you very soon papa assured us lottchen you will find someone who needs a willing worker i can do anything remember thatwait tables haul wood or coal play in a hotel orchestra as the train pulled away i held the back of hugos jacket and the two of us leaned out the window with all the other children waving until papas red scarf had turned to an invisible speck in our own eyes we had the usual fears all kindertransport children report as we traveled through austria and germany of the guards who tried to frighten us of the searches through our luggage standing very still while they looked for any valuables we were allowed a single tenmark piece each i thought my heart would be visible through my dress it was beating so hard but they didnt feel my clothes and the gold coins traveled with me safely and then we passed out of germany into holland and for the first time since the anschluss we were suddenly surrounded by warm and welcoming adults who showered us with bread and meat and chocolates i dont remember much of the crossing we had a calm sea i think but i was so nervous that my stomach was twisted in knots even without any serious waves when we landed we looked around anxiously for minna in the crowd of adults who had come to meet the boat but all the children were claimed and we were left standing on the dock finally a woman from the refugee committee showed up minna had left instructions for us to be sent on to london by train but she had delayed getting word to the refugee committee until that morning we spent the night in the camp at harwich with the other children who had no sponsors and went on to london in the morning when we got to the station to liverpool street it was massive we clung to each other while engines belched and loudspeakers bellowed incomprehensible syllables and people brushed past us on important missions i clutched hugos hand tightly cousin minna had sent a workman to fetch us giving him a photograph against which he anxiously studied our faces he spoke english which we didnt understand at all or yiddish which we didnt understand well but he was pleasant bustling us into a cab pointing out the houses of parliament and big ben giving us each a bit of queer pastefilled sandwich in case we were hungry after our long trip it was only when we got to that narrow old house in the north of london that we found out minna would take me and not hugo the man from the factory settled us in a forbidding front room where we sat without moving so fearful we were of making a noise or being a nuisance after some very long time minna swept in from work full of anger and announced that hugo was to go on that the foreman from the glove factory would be coming for him in an hour one child and one child only i told her highness madame butterfly that when she wrote begging for my charity she may choose to roll around in the hay with a gypsy but that doesnt mean the rest of us have to look after her children i tried to protest but she said she could throw me out on the street better be grateful to me you little mongrels i spent all day persuading the foreman to take hugo instead of sending him to the child welfare authorities the foreman mr nussbaum his name was actually turned out to be a good foster father to hugo he even set him up in business many years later but you can only guess how the two of us felt that day when he arrived to take hugo away with him the last sight either of us had then of any familiar face of our childhood like the nazi guards minna searched my clothes for valuables she refused to believe the penury to which the family was reduced fortunately my oma had been clever enough to evade both nazis and minna those gold coins helped pay my fees in medical school but that was a long way ahead in a future i didnt imagine as i sobbed for my parents and my brother x in the mind readers lair when i finally woke the next morning my head was heavy with the detritus of dreams and difficult sleep i once read that a year or eighteen months after losing them you dream of your dead as they were in their prime i suppose i must sometimes dream of my mother as she was in my childhood vivid and intense but last night she was dying eyes heavy with morphine face unrecognizable as disease had leached flesh from bone lotty and my mother are such intertwined strands in my mind that it was almost inevitable that her distress would overlay my sleep morrell looked at me questioningly when i sat up he had come in after i went to bed but i was tossing not sleeping his impending departure made him feverishly nervous we made love with a kind of frantic unsatisfying energy but fell asleep without talking in the morning light he traced my cheekbones with his finger and asked if it was his leaving that had disturbed my sleep i gave a twisted smile my own stuff this time i gave him a brief synopsis of the previous day why dont we go to michigan for the weekend he said we both need a breather you cant do anything on a saturday anyway and we can give each other better comfort away from all these people i love don like a brother but having him here right now is a bit much well come back in time for michael and carls concert on sunday my muscles unknotted at the thought and it sent me into the day with better energy than my tormented night warranted after stopping at home to take the dogs for a swim i drove into the west loop to the unblinking eye the camera and video place i use when only the best will do i explained what i wanted to maurice redken the technician i usually work with we ran my copy of the channel video through one of their machines watching radbukas naked face as he went through the torments of his life when he said my miriam where is my miriam i want my miriam the camera was right in his face i froze the image there and asked maurice to make prints of that and a couple of other closeups for me i was hoping rhea wiell would introduce me to radbuka but if she didnt the stills would help mary louise and me track him down maurice promised to have both the stills and three copies of the tape ready for me by the days end it wasnt quite tenthirty when we finished there wasnt time for me to go to my office before dons appointment with rhea wiell but i could walk the two miles from the eye to water tower if i didnt dawdlei hate paying gold coast parking fees water tower place is a shopping mecca on north michigan a favorite dropoff place for tour buses from small midwestern towns as well as an oasis for local teens threading my way through girls whose pierced navels showed below their cropped tshirts and women pushing expensive baby buggies overflowing with packages i found don leaning against the back entrance he was so engrossed in his book he didnt look up when i stopped next to him i squinted to read the spine hypnotic induction and suggestion an introductory manual does this tell you how ms wiell does it i asked he blinked and closed the book it tells me that blocked memories really can be accessed through hypnosis or at least the authors claim so fortunately i only have to see if wiell has a sellable book in her not sort out whether her therapy is legitimate im going to introduce you as an investigator who may help collect background data if wiell and the publisher come to terms you can say anything you like he looked at his watch and fished a cigarette from his breast pocket although hed changed clothes into a pressed opennecked shirt and a tweed jacket he still looked halfasleep i took the book on hypnotic induction while don lit his cigarette broadly speaking hypnosis seemed to be used in two main ways suggestive hypnosis helped people break bad habits and insight or exploratory hypnosis helped them understand themselves better recovering memories was only one small part of using hypnosis in therapy don pinched off the glowing end of his cigarette and put the stub back in his pocket time to go ms warshawski i followed him into the building this book could help you end that expensive habit for good he stuck out his tongue at me i wouldnt know what to do with my hands if i quit we went behind a newsstand on the ground floor in a dark alcove which held the elevators to the office floor it wasnt exactly secret just out of the way enough to keep the shopping hordes from straying there by mistake i studied the tenant board plastic surgeons endodontists beauty salons even a synagogue what an odd combination i called over to the jane addams school as you suggested don said abruptly when we were alone on an elevator first i couldnt find anyone who knew wiellshe did her degree fifteen years ago but when i started talking about the hypnotherapy the department secretary remembered wiell was married then used her husbands name we got off the elevator and found ourselves at a point where four long corridors came together what did they think of her at uic i asked he looked at his appointment book i think we go right here theres some jealousya suggestion she was a charlatan but when i pushed it seemed to stem from the fact that social work had made her richdoesnt happen to too many people i gather we stopped in front of a blond door with wiells name and professional initials painted on it i felt a tingle from the idea that this woman might read my mind she might know me better than i knew myself was that where hypnotic suggestibility got its start the urgent desire to be understood so intimately don pushed the door open we were in a tiny vestibule with two shut doors and a third one that was open this led to a waiting room where a sign invited us to sit down and relax it added that all cell phones and pagers should be turned off don and i obediently pulled out our phones he switched his off but mine had run down again without my noticing the waiting room was decorated with such attention to comfort that it even held a carafe of hot water and a selection of herbal teas new age music tinkled softly padded chairs faced a fourfoothigh fish tank built into the far wall the fish seemed to rise and fall in time to the music what do you think this setup costs don was trying the other two doors one turned out to be a bathroom the other was locked i dont knowinstalling it took a bundle but looking after it wouldnt take too much except for the rent of course the nicotine in your system is keeping you awake these fish are putting me to sleep he grinned youre going to sleep vic when you wake up it isnt like that although people are always nervous at first and imagine the television version the locked door had opened and rhea wiell appeared behind us youre from the publishing company arent you she seemed smaller in person than she had on television but her face held the same serenity id noticed on screen she was dressed as she had been on camera in soft clothes that flowed like an indian mystics don shook her hand unembarrassed and introduced both of us if you and i decide to work together vic may help with some of the background checking wiell stood back to let us pass in front of her into her office it too was designed to put us at ease with a reclining chair a couch and her own office chair all covered in soft green her diplomas hung behind her desk the msw from the jane addams school of social work a certificate from the american institute of clinical hypnosis and her illinois license as a psychiatric social worker i perched on the edge of the recliner while don took the couch wiell sat in her office chair her hands loosely crossed in her lap she looked like jean simmons in elmer gantry when we saw you on channel thirteen the other night i immediately realized you had a very powerful story to tell you and paul radbuka don said you must have thought about putting it into a book before i called hadnt you wiell smiled faintly of course ive wanted to if you saw the whole program then youre aware that my work ismisunderstoodin a number of circles a book validating the recovery of blocked trauma would be enormously useful and paul radbukas story would be unusual enoughpowerful enoughto force people to pay serious attention to the issue don leaned forward chin on his clasped hands im new to the subjectmy first exposure came two nights ago ive been cramming hard reading a manual on hypnotic suggestion looking at articles about you but im definitely not up to speed she nodded hypnosis is only one part of a total therapeutic approach and its controversial because it isnt understood very well the field of memory what we remember how we remember and maybe most interestingly why we remembernone of that is really known right now the research seems exciting to me but im not a scientist and i dont pretend to have the time to follow experimental work in depth would your book focus exclusively on paul radbuka i asked since doni hope you dont mind my using your first namedon called yesterday ive been thinking it over i believe i should use some other case histories as well to show that my work with paul isntwell the kind of flybynight treatment that planted memory therapists like to claim what do you see as the books central point don patted his jacket pocket reflexively then pulled out a pen in lieu of his halfsmoked cigarette to show that our memories are reliable to show the difference between planted memories and genuine ones i began going through my patient files last night after i finished work and found several people whose histories would make this point quite strongly three had complete amnesia about their childhoods when they started therapy one had partial memories and two had what they thought were continuous memories although therapy unlocked new insights for them in some ways its most exciting to uncover memories for someone who has amnesia but the harder work is verifying filling in gaps for people who have some recall don interrupted to ask if there was some way to verify memories that were uncovered in treatment i expected wiell to become defensive but she responded quite calmly thats why i earmarked these particular cases for each of them there is at least one other person a witness to their childhood who can corroborate what came up in here for some its a brother or sister in one case its a social worker for two there are primaryschool teachers wed have to get written permission don was making notes for the patients and for their verifiers witnesses she nodded again of course their real identities would be carefully concealed not just to protect themselves but to protect family members and colleagues who could be harmed by such narratives but yes well get written permission are these other patients also holocaust survivors i ventured helping paul was an incredible privilege a smile lit her face with a kind of ecstatic joy so intense so personal that i instinctively shrank back on the recliner away from her most of my clients are dealing with terrible traumas to be sure but within the context of this culture to get paul to that point to the point of being a little boy speaking broken german with his helpless playmates in a concentration camp was the most powerful experience of my life i dont even know how we can do it justice in print she looked at her hands adding in a choked voice i think hes recently recovered a fragment of memory of witnessing his mothers death ill do my best for you don muttered he too had shifted away from her you said youd be concealing peoples real identities i said so is paul radbuka not his real name the ecstasy left wiells face replaced again by her patina of professional calm hes the one person who doesnt seem to have any living family left to be upset by his revelations besides hes so intensely proud of his newly recovered identity that it would be impossible to persuade him to use a cover name so youve discussed it with him don asked eagerly hes willing to take part i havent had time to talk about it with any of my patients she smiled faintly you only broached the idea yesterday after all but i know how intensely paul feels its why he insisted on speaking up at the birnbaum conference earlier this week i think too hed do anything he could to support my work because its changed his life so dramatically how did he come to remember the name radbuka i said if he was raised by this foster father from the age of four and wrenched from his birth family in infancyhave i got that chronology right wiell shook her head at me i hope your role isnt to try to set traps for me ms warshawski if it is ill have to look for a different publisher than envision press paul found some papers in his fathers deskhis foster father i should sayand they pointed the way to his birth name for him i wasnt trying to set a trap ms wiell but it would certainly strengthen the book if we could get some outside corroboration of his radbuka identity and its remotely possible that i am in a position to provide that to be candid i have friends who came to england from central europe with the kindertransport in the last months before the war began apparently one of their group of special friends in london was named radbuka if it turns out your client is a relation it might mean a great deal both to him and to my friends who lost so many family members again the rapturous smile swept across her face ah if you can introduce him to his relatives that would be an indescribable gift to paul who are these people do they live in england how do you know them i know two of them who live here in chicago the third is a musician whos visiting from london for a few days if i could talk to your client not until ive consulted with him she cut me off and i would have to have yourfriendsnames before i could do so i hate to have to be so suspicious but i have had too many traps set for me by the planted memory foundation my eyes narrowed as i tried to hear behind her words was this paranoia born of too much skirmishing with arnold praeger or a legitimate prudence before i could decide don said you dont think max would mind your giving his name do you vic max wiell cried max loewenthal how do you know him don asked again before i could respond he spoke at the session on the efforts of survivors to track down the fates of their families and whether they had any assets tied up in swiss or german banks paul and i sat in on that we hoped we could learn some new ideas for ways of looking for his family if max is your friend im sure paul would be glad to talk to himhe seemed an extraordinary man gentle empathic yet assured authoritative thats a good description of his personality i said but he also has a strong sense of privacy he would be most annoyed if paul radbuka approached him without my having a chance to speak to mr radbuka first you can rest assured that i understand the value of privacy my relations with my clients would not be possible if i didnt protect them wiell gave me the same sweet steely smile shed directed at arnold praeger on tv the other night so can we arrange a meeting with your client where i can talk to him before introducing him to my friends i tried to keep irritation out of my voice but i knew i couldnt match her in sanctity before i do anything i will have to talk to paul surely you understand that any other course would violate my relationship with him she wrote maxs name in her datebook next to paul radbukas appointment her square printlike hand was easy to read upside down of course i understand that i said with what patience i could muster but i cant let paul radbuka come to mr loewenthal out of the blue in the belief that theyre related in fact i dont think mr loewenthal is himself a part of the radbuka family if i could ask paul a few questions first it might spare everyone some anxiety she shook her head with finality she would not turn paul over to someone like me an unskilled outsider whether its mr loewenthal or his musician friend who is part of the family i assure you i would approach them with the utmost empathy and the first step is to talk to paul to get his permission for me to go to them how long will your musician be in chicago at this point i didnt want to tell her anything about anyone i knew but don said i think he said that hes leaving for the west coast on monday while i fumed to myself don got wiell to give a précis on how hypnosis worked and how she used itsparingly and only after her patients felt able to trust herbefore he brought up the kind of controversy the book was likely to generate he grinned engagingly from our standpoint controversy is highly desirable because it gives a book access to the kind of press coverage you cant buy but from yoursyou may not want that kind of spotlight on you and your practice she smiled back at him like you i would welcome the publicityalthough for a different reason i want as many people as possible to start understanding how we block memories how we recover them and how we can become liberated in the process the planted memory foundation has done a great deal of damage to people suffering from trauma i havent had the resources to make the truth clear to a wider audience this book would help me greatly a silvery bell like a japanese temple bell chimed on her desk well have to stop nowi have another patient coming and i need time to prepare for my session i handed her my card reminding her that i wanted an early meeting with paul radbuka she shook my hand in a cool dry clasp giving my hand a slight pressure intended to reassure me of her goodwill to don she added that she could help him stop smoking if he wanted most of my hypnotic work is in the arena of selfexploration but i do work with habit management sometimes don laughed i hope well be working closely together for the next year or so if i decide im ready to quit well put the manuscript aside while i lie back on your couch here xi ramping up as we walked past the liposuckers to the elevator don congratulated himself on how well things had gone im a believer its going to be a great project those eyes of hers could convince me to do just about anything they apparently did i said dryly i wish you hadnt brought maxs name into the discussion chrissake vic it was a pure fluke that she guessed it was max loewenthal he stood back as the elevator doors opened to let out an elderly couple this is going to be a careersaving book for me i bet i can get my agent to go to high six figures not to mention the film rightsdont you see dustin hoffman as the brokendown radbuka remembering his past lottys bitter remark on ghouls profiting on the remains of the dead came back to me full force you said you wanted to prove to lotty herschel that youre not the mikeintheface kind of journalist shes not going to be very persuaded if youre prancing around in glee about turning her friends misery into commercial movies vic get a grip don said cant you let me have my moment of triumph of course i wont violate dr herschels most sacred feelings i started out feeling a bit doubtful of rhea but by the end of the hour she had me totally on her sidesorry if the excitements gone to my head she rubbed me the wrong way a bit i said thats because she wouldnt toss you her patients home phone number which she absolutely should not give anyone you know that i know that i had to agree i guess what bugs me is her wanting to mastermind the situation shell meet max and lotty and carl shell decide what theyre about but shes resisting the idea that i might meet her client dont you think its odd that he gave her office as his home addressas if his identity was wrapped up in her youre overreacting vic because you like to be the one in control yourself you read some of the articles you printed out for me on the attacks against her by planted memory right shes sensible to be cautious he paused while the elevator landed and we negotiated our way past the group waiting to get on i scanned them hoping i might see paul radbuka wondering about the destination of the people boarding were they getting fat sucked out root canals which one was rhea wiells next patient don continued with the thought uppermost in his own mind do you think its lotty max or carl who really is related to radbuka they sound pretty prickly for people who are only looking out for their friends interests i stopped behind the newsstand to stare at him i dont think any of them is related to radbuka thats why im so annoyed that ms wiell has maxs name now i know i know i added as he started to interrupt you didnt really give it to her but shes so focused on her prize exhibits wellbeing that shes not thinking outside that landscape now to anyone elses needs but why should she he asked i mean i understand that you want her to be as empathic to max or dr herschel as she is to paul radbuka but how could she be that concerned about a group of strangers besides shes got such an exciting event going on with what shes done with this guy that its not surprising really but why are your friends so very defensive if it isnt their own family theyre worrying about good grief donyoure almost as experienced as morrell in writing about warscarred refugees im sure you can imagine how it must have felt to be in london with a group of children who all shared the same traumasfirst of leaving their families behind to go to a strange country with a strange language then the even bigger trauma of the horrific way in which their families died i think youd feel a sense of bonding that went beyond friendshipeveryones experiences would seem as though they had happened to you personally i suppose youre right of course you are i only want to get in with rhea on the story of the decade he grinned again disarming me and pulled the halfsmoked cigarette out of his pocket again until i decide to let rhea cure me i need to get this inside me can you come over to the ritz with me share a glass of champagne and let me feel just a minute moment of euphoria about my project i still wasnt in a very celebratory mood let me check with my answering service while you go over to the hotel then a quick one i guess i went back to the corner to use the pay phones since my cell phone was dead why couldnt i let don have his moment of triumph as he had put it was he right that i was only resentful because rhea wiell wouldnt give me radbukas phone number but that sense of an ecstatic vision when she was talking about her triumph with paul radbuka had made me uncomfortable it was the ecstasy of a votary though not the triumphant smirk of a charlatan so why should i let it raise my hackles i fed change into the phone and dialed my answering service vic where have you been christie weddington a day operator whod been with the service for longer than me jolted me back to my own affairs whats up beth blacksin has phoned three times wanting a comment murray ryerson has called twice besides messages from a whole bunch of other reporters she read off a string of names and numbers mary louise she called and said she was switching the office line over to us because she felt like she was under siege but about what i dont know vic i just take the messages murray said something about alderman durham though andhere it is she read the message in a flat uninflected voice call me and tell me whats going on with bull durham since when have you started robbing the widow and orphan of their mite i was completely bewildered i guess just forward all those to my office computer are there any business messages things that dont come from reporters i could hear her clicking through her screen i dont thinkoh here is something from a mr devereux at ajax she read me ralphs number i tried murray first hes an investigative reporter with the heraldstar who does occasional special reports for channel this was the first time hed called me in some monthswed had quite a falling out over a case that had involved the stars owners in the end wed made a kind of fragile peace but weve been avoiding involvement with each others cases warshawski what in hell did you do to yank bull durhams chain so hard hi murray yes im depressed about the cubs and worried because morrell is leaving for kabul in a few days but otherwise things go on same as always how about you he paused briefly then snarled at me not to be a smartmouthed pain in the ass why dont you start from the beginning i suggested ive been in meetings all morning and have no idea what our aldercreatures have been saying or doing bull durham is leading a charge of pickets outside the ajax company headquarters ohon the slavereparations issue right ajax is his first target his handouts name you as an agent of the company involved in the continuing suppression of black policyholders by depriving them of their settlements i see a recorded message interrupted us telling me to deposit twentyfive cents if i wanted to continue the call gotta go murray im out of change i hung up on his squawk that that was hardly an answerwhat had i done that must be why ralph devereux was calling to find out what id done to provoke a fullscale picket what a mess when my clientexclienttold me he was going to take steps these must have been the ones he had in mind i gritted my teeth and put another thirtyfive cents into the phone i got ralphs secretary but by the time she put me through to him id been on hold so long i really had run out of quarters ralph im at a pay phone with no more money so lets be brief i just heard about durham did you feed the sommers file to him he asked voice heavy with suspicion so that he could denounce me as an ajax stooge and have every reporter in the city hounding me thank you no my clients aunt reacted with indignation to my asking her about the previous death certificate and the check my client fired me im guessing he went to durham but i dont know that definitely when i find out ill call you anything else rossy on your butt over this the whole sixtythird floor although rossy is saying it shows he was right not to trust you hes just flailing in fury looking for a target these are the snows of summer they wont stick on ajax although they may freeze me some im going to see sommers to find out what he told durham what about your historian amy blount the young woman who wrote up the book on ajax yesterday rossy was saying he didnt trust her not to give ajax data to durham did he ask her that she denied showing our private papers to anyone but how else could durham have found out who we insured back in the s we mention birnbaum in our history bragging that they go back with us to but not the detail durham has about insuring plow shipments they made to slaveholders now the birnbaum lawyers are threatening us with breach of fiduciary responsibility although whether it extends back that far do you have blounts phone number i could try asking her the metallic voice announced that i needed another twentyfive cents ralph quickly told me blount had gotten her phd in economic history at the university of chicago last june i could reach her through the department call me when you he started to add but the phone company cut us off i dashed through the lobby to the cab rank but the sight of a pair of smokers huddled along the wall made me remember don sitting in the ritz bar i hesitated then remembered my phone charger was still in morrells cari wouldnt be able to call don from the road to explain why id stood him up i found him under a fern tree in the smoking section of the bar with two glasses of champagne in front of him when he saw me he put out his cigarette i bent over to kiss his cheek doni wish you every success with this book and with your career i picked up a glass to toast him but i cant stay to drink theres a crisis involving the players you originally came here to interview when i told him about durham s pickets outside ajax and that i wanted to go see what they were up to he relit his cigarette did anyone ever tell you you have too much energy vic itll age morrell before his time trying to keep up with you i am going to sit here with my champagne having a happy conversation about rhea wiells book with my literary agent i will then drink your glass as well if you learn anything as you bounce around chicago like a pinball in the hands of a demented wizard i will listen breathlessly to your every word for which i will charge you a hundred dollars an hour i swallowed a large gulp of champagne then handed him the glass i curbed my impulse to dart across the lobby to the elevators the image of myself as a pinball careening around the city was embarrassingalthough it kept recurring to me as the afternoon progressed xii pinball wizard i bounced first to the ajax building on adams durham only had a small band of pickets outin the middle of a workday most people dont have time to demonstrate durham himself led the charge surrounded by his cadre of empower youth energy members their eyes watching the passersby with the sullenness of men prepared to fight on a moments notice behind them came a small group of ministers and community leaders from the south and west sides followed by the usual handful of earnest college students they chanted justice now no highrises on the bones of slaves and no reparations for slaveowners i walked in step with one of the students who welcomed me as a convert to the fold i didnt realize ajax had benefited so much from slavery i said its not just that but did you hear what happened yesterday they sicced a detective on this poor old woman who had just lost her husband they cashed his lifeinsurance check and then like pretended she had done it and sent this detective down to accuse her right in the middle of the funeral what i shouted really sucks doesnt it hereyou can read the details he thrust a broadsheet at me my name jumped out at me ajax have you no mercy warshawskihave you no shame birnbaumhave you no compassion where is the widows mite gertrude sommers a godfearing woman a churchgoing woman a taxpaying woman lost her son then she lost her husband must she lose her dignity as well ajax insurance cashed her husbands lifeinsurance policy ten years ago when he died last week they sent their tame detective v i warshawski to accuse sister sommers of stealing it in the middle of the funeral in front of her friends and loved ones they shamed her warshawski we all have to make a living but must you do it on the bodies of the poor ajax make good the wrong pay the widow her mite repair the damage you have done to the grandchildren of slaves birnbaum give back the money you made with ajax on the backs of slaves no holocaust restitution until you make the africanamerican community whole i could feel the blood drumming in my head no wonder ralph was angrybut why should he take it out on me it wasnt his name that was being slandered i almost jumped out of the line to tackle alderman durham but in the nick of time i imagined the scene on televisionthe eye team wrestling with me as i screamed invective the alderman shaking his head more in sorrow than anger and declaiming something sanctimonious to the camera i watched fuming as the circle of marchers brought durham parallel to me he was a big broadshouldered man in a blackandtan houndstooth jacket which looked as though it had been made to measure so carefully did the checks line up along the smoothfitting seams his face gleamed with excitement behind his muttonchop whiskers since i couldnt punch him i folded the broadsheet into my purse and ran down adams toward my car a cab would have been faster but my rage needed a physical outlet by the time i reached canal street the soles of my feet throbbed from running in pumps on city pavement i was lucky i hadnt sprained an ankle i stood outside my car gulping in air my throat dry as my pulse returned to normal i wondered where bull durham had gotten the money for custom tailoring was someone paying him to harass ajax and the birnbaumsnot to mention me of course all aldercreatures have plenty of chances to stick their fingers in the till in perfectly legal waysi was so furious with him i wanted to assume the worst i needed a phone and i needed water as i looked for a convenience store where i could buy a bottle i passed a wireless shop i bought another incar charger my life would be easier this afternoon if i was plugged in before i got onto the expressway to track down my clientexclienti called mary louise on my private office line she was understandably upset at my leaving her holding the bag i explained how that had happened then read her bull durhams broadsheet good grief hes got a nerve what do you want to do about it start with a statement something like this in his zeal to make political hay out of gertrude sommerss loss alderman durham overlooked a few things including the facts when gertrude sommerss husband died last week the delaney funeral parlor humiliated her by halting the funeral just as she took her seat in the chapel they did so because her husbands lifeinsurance policy had been cashed some years ago the family briefly employed investigator v i warshawski to get at the facts of what happened contrary to alderman durhams claims ajax insurance did not hire warshawski warshawski was not at aaron sommerss funeral and did not see or meet the unfortunate widow until the following week it is inconceivable that warshawski would ever interrupt a funeral in the fashion the alderman is claiming if alderman durham was utterly mistaken about the facts of warshawskis involvement in the case are his other statements open to the same questions mary louise read it back to me we tweaked it a few times then she agreed to phone or email it to the reporters who had been calling if beth blacksin or murray wanted to talk to me in person she should tell them to come to my office around sixthirtyalthough if they were like the rest of the chicago media they would probably be camped outside the doors of members of the birnbaum family hoping to accost them a cop tapped my parking meter and made an ugly comment i put the car in gear and started down madison toward the expressway do you know what the birnbaum part of durham s handout is about mary louise asked apparently ajax insured the birnbaums back in the s part of the vast birnbaum holdings came from something in the south ajax execs are steaming over how durham got that information as i oozed onto the expressway i was glad id bought the water traffic seems to run freely these days only between ten at night and six the next morning at twothirty the trucks heading south on the ryan formed a solid wall i put mary louise on hold while i slid my mustang in between an eighteenwheel ups truck and a long flatbed with what looked like a reactor coil strapped to it before hanging up i asked her to dig up amy blounts home phone number and address phone them to me here in my car but dont call her yourself i dont know yet if i want to talk to her the flatbed behind me gave a loud hoot that made me jump i had let three car lengths open up in front of me i scooted forward mary louise said before you go i tracked down those men aaron sommers worked with at south branch scrap metal the ones who bought life insurance from rick hoffman along with mr sommers the durham attack on me personally had driven the earlier business from my mind id forgotten to tell mary louise the client had fired me so shed gone ahead with the investigation and had found three of the four men still alive claiming to be doing an independent quality check for the company shed persuaded the policyholders to call the midway agency the men said their policies were still intact shed doublechecked with the carrier the third man had died eight years ago his funeral had been duly paid for by ajax so whatever fraud had been committed it wasnt some wholesale looting by midway or hoffman of those particular burial policies not that it really mattered at this point but i thanked her for the extra effortshed done a lot in a short morningand turned my attention to the traffic when i reached the stevenson cutoff my motion slowed to something more like a turtle on valium than a pinballconstruction now in its third year cut off half the lanes the stevenson expressway is the key to the industrial zone along the citys southwest corridor truck traffic along it is always heavy with the construction and the afternoon rush building we all bumped along at about ten miles an hour at kedzie i was glad to leave the expressway for the maze of plants and scrap yards alongside it even though the day was clear down here among the factories the air turned bluegrey from smoke i passed yards full of rusting cars yards making outboard motors a rebar mill and a mountain of yellowish salt ominous portent of the winter ahead the roads were deeply rutted i drove cautiously my car slung too low to the ground for the axle to survive a major hole trucks jumped past me with a happy disregard of any traffic signs even with a good detail map i blundered a few times it was a quarter past three fifteen minutes after isaiah sommerss shift ended before i jolted into the yard of the docherty engineering works a roughly graveled area it was as scarred by heavy trucks as the surrounding streets a fourteenwheeler was snorting at a loading dock when i got out of the mustang it was my lucky afternoonit looked as though the seventothree shift was just leaving the shop i leaned against my car watching men straggle through a side door isaiah sommers appeared about halfway through the exodus he was talking to a couple of other men laughing in an easy way that took me by surprise when id met him hed been hunched and surly i waited until hed clapped his coworkers on the shoulder and gone on to his own truck before straightening up to follow him mr sommers the smile vanished leaving his face in the guarded lines id seen the other night oh its you what do you want i pulled the broadsheet from my purse and handed it to him i see the steps you took on your own led you straight to alderman durham there are a few factual errors but its having quite a galvanizing effect on the city you should be pleased he read the sheet with the same slow concentration hed given my contract well you know as well as i that i wasnt present at your uncles funeral did you tell mr durham that i was maybe he put the two pieces of the story together wrong but yes i did talk to him told him about you accusing my aunt he stuck his jaw out pugnaciously im not here to play hesaid shesaid with you but to find out why you went out of your way to pillory me in this public way instead of trying to work things out in private my auntshe doesnt have money or connections or a way to get even when someone like you comes along to accuse her unjustly several men passed us looking us over curiously one of them called a greeting to sommers he flipped up a palm but kept his angry gaze on me your aunt feels bereft she needs someone to blame so shes blaming me almost ten years ago someone using your aunts name cashed a check for the policy with a death certificate claiming your uncle was dead to back up the claim either your aunt did it or someone else but her name was on the check i had to ask her youve fired me so i wont be asking any more questions but dont you wonder how it got there the company did it the company did it and hired you to frame me like it says here he pointed at the broadsheet but his voice lacked conviction its a possibility i conceded its a possibility the company did it well never know of course why not i smiled i have no reason to look into it you could hire someone else to do so but it would cost you a fortune of course its much easier to toss accusations around than it is to look for facts its the american way these days isnt it find a scapegoat instead of a fact his face was bunched in confusion i took the broadsheet from him and turned back to my car the phone which id left attached to the charger was ringingmary louise with amy blounts details i scribbled them down and started the car wait isaiah sommers yelled he shook off someone whod stopped to talk to him and ran over to my car i put it in park and looked up at him my brows raised my expression bland he fumbled for words then blurted out what do you think about you said its a possibility that the company cashed in the policy is that what you think i turned off the engine to be honest no i wont say its impossible i uncovered claims fraud at that company once before but it was under a different management team which had to resign when the news got out the thing is it would mean collusion between someone in the company and the agent since the agency deposited the check but the claims manager made no demur about bringing the file up where i could see it its true rossy had put me through a song and dance to keep me from examining the complete filebut edelweiss had only been involved with ajax for four months so i didnt see how he could possibly be part of an ajax lifeinsurance fraud the agent is a more likely candidate although none of the other policies hoffman sold at your uncles workplace was fraudulently cashed the check was paid through midway its also possible your uncle did it for reasons you might never know or you might find very painful to know or some other family member and before you blow your stack and get on to bull durham from the nearest phone i dont seriously think it was your aunt not after talking to her but your family or the agency would be the two places i would look if i was looking he slammed the roof of my car in frustration he was strong enough that the car bounced slightly look here ms warashki i dont know who to believe or who to listen to my wifeshe thought i should go talk to alderman durham camilla rawlings the lady who gave me your name to begin with she already chewed me out for firing you she thinks i should make my peace with you but what can i believe mr durham he said he had proof the insurance company profited from slavery and this is one more coverup and no offense but you being white how can you understand i got out of the car so he wouldnt have to bend over and i wouldnt get a crick in my neck looking up mr sommers i cant ever completely but i do try to listen empathicallyand impartiallyto whatever i hear the situation with your aunt i realize its complicated by america s history if i want to ask her how her name got to be on that check then you and your wife and your aunt see me as a white woman someone in league with the company to defraud you but if i start screaming in chorus with youcompany coverup fraudwhen i have no facts then im useless as a detective my only lodestar is sticking to the truthas far as i can know it its a costly decisioni lose clients like you i lost a wonderful man in camillas brother im not always right but i have to stick to the truth or be buffeted like a leaf by every wind that blows it took me a long time to get over my breakup with conrad rawlings i love morrell hes a great guybut conrad and i were attuned in a way that you only find once in a very blue moon sommerss face contorted with strain would you consider going back to work for me id consider it id be a little wary though he nodded in a kind of rueful understanding then blurted out im sorry about durham getting the facts mixed up i do have cousins one anyway that could have gone and done it but you see its painful too painful to expose my family like that and if it was my cousin colby then hell ill never see the money again id be out the price of the funeral and the price of your fee besides making my family ashamed in public its a serious problem i cant advise you on it he shut his eyes tightly for a moment is theredo you still owe me any more time from my five hundred dollars hed had an hour and a half coming to him before mary louise checked with the men at south branch scrap metal any more work would be with the meter running again about an hour i said gruffly cursing myself could youis there anything you could find out about the agent in just an hour you going to call mr durham and tell him he made a mistake i have a press interview scheduled at sixthirty i dont want to mention your name if im working for you he took a breath ill call him if youll ask a few questions of the insurance agency xiii secret agent family spokesman andy birnbaum greatgrandson of the patriarch who parlayed a scrapmetal pushcart into one of america s great fortunes said the family is bewildered by durham s accusations the birnbaum foundation has supported innercity education arts and economic development for four decades birnbaum added that relations of the africanamerican community with both the birnbaum corporation and its foundation have been mutually supportive and he is sure that if alderman durham sits down to talk the alderman will realize there has been a misunderstanding i got that sound bite on the radio as i was riding back into the city the inbound traffic was heavy but moving fast so i didnt pay close attention until my own name jumped out at me investigator v i warshawski said in a written statement that durham s accusations that she had interrupted aaron sommerss funeral with demands for money are a complete fabrication joseph posner who is lobbying hard for illinois to pass the holocaust asset recovery act said that durham s charges against ajax were a red herring to keep the legislature from considering the act he said durham s antisemitic comments were a disgrace to the memory of the dead but that as the sabbath started in a few hours he would not violate its peace by appearing in public to confront the alderman thank heavens we were at least spared joseph posner joining the fray just now i couldnt absorb any more news i turned to music one of the classical stations was soothing the commuters savage breast with something very modern and spiky the other was running a highvoltage ad for internet access i turned off the radio altogether and followed the lake south back to hyde park given howard fepples lackadaisical attitude toward his business there was only an outside chance that id find him still in his office at fourthirty on friday still when youre a pinball you bounce off all the levers in the hopes of landing in the money and this time i had a bit of luckor whatever youd call the chance to talk to fepple again he was not only in but hed installed fresh lightbulbs so that the torn linoleum the grime and his eager expression when i opened the door all showed up clearly mr fepple i said heartily glad to see you havent given up on the business yet he turned away from me his eager look replaced by a scowl it obviously wasnt the hope of seeing me that had led him to put on a suit and tie you know an amazing thought occurred to me when i was driving back from seeing isaiah sommers this afternoon bull durham knew about me he knew about the birnbaums he knew about ajax but even though he went on for days about the injustice to the sommers family he didnt seem to know about you you dont have an appointment he muttered still not looking at me you can leave now walkin business i chirped brightly you need to cultivate it so lets talk about that policy you sold aaron sommers i told you it wasnt me it was rick hoffman same difference your agency your legal liability for any wrongdoing my client isnt interested in dragging this out in court for years although he could sue you for a bundle under erisayou had a fiduciary responsibility to his uncle which you violated hed be happy if youd cut him a check for the ten thousand that the policy was worth hes not your he blurted then stopped my my howard who has been talking to you was it mr sommers himself no that cant be right or youd know hed brought me back in to finish the investigation so it must have been alderman durham if thats the case you are going to have so much publicity youll be turning business away i have an interview with channel thirteen in a little bit and they will be salivating when they hear that your agency has been tipping off bull durham about your own customers affairs youre all wet he said curling his lip i couldnt talk to durham hes made it clear he doesnt have any use for whites now im really curious i settled myself in the rickety chair in front of his desk im dying to see who youre all dolled up for i have a date i do have a social life that has nothing to do with insurance i want you to leave so i can close up my office in a little bit as soon as you answer some questions i want to see the file on aaron sommers his carpet of freckles turned a deeper orange you have a helluva nerve those are private papers none of your damned business they are my clients business one way or another either by you cooperating now or by my getting a court order youre going to show me the file so lets do it now go get your court order if you can my father trusted me with his business i am not going to let him down it was a strange and rather sad attempt at bravado okay ill get a court order one other thing rick hoffmans notebook that little black book he carried around with him ticking off his clients payments i want to see it join the crowd he snapped everyone in chicago wants to see his notebook but i dont have it he took it home with him every night like it was the secret of the atom bomb and when he died it was at his home if i knew where his son was maybe id know where the damned notebook was but that creep is probably in an insane asylum someplace hes not in chicago at any rate his phone rang he jumped on it so fast it might have been a hundreddollar bill on the sidewalk theres someone with me right now he blurted into the mouthpiece right the woman detective he listened for a minute said okay okay jotted what looked like numbers on a scrap of paper and hung up he turned off his desk lamp and made a big show of locking his filing cabinets when he came around to open the door i had no choice but to get up as well we rode the elevator down to the lobby where he surprised me by going up to the guard see this lady collins shes been coming around my office making threats can you make sure she doesnt get into the building again tonight the guard looked me up and down before saying sure thing mr fepple without much enthusiasm fepple went outside with me when i congratulated him on a successful tactic he smirked before striding off down the street i watched him go into the pizza restaurant on the corner they had a phone in the entryway which he stopped to use i joined a couple of drunks outside a convenience store across the street they were arguing about a man named clive and what clives sister had said about one of them but they broke off to try to cadge the price of a bottle from me i moved away from them still watching fepple after about five minutes he came out looked around cautiously saw me and darted toward a shopping center on the north side of the street i started after him but one of the drunks grabbed me telling me not to be such a stuckup bitch i stuck a knee in his stomach and jerked my arm free while he shouted obscenities i ran north but i was still in my pumps this time the left heel gave and i tumbled to the concrete by the time i got myself collected fepple had disappeared i cursed myself fepple and the drunks with equal ferocity by a miracle damage was limited to the shreds in my panty hose and a bloody scrape on my left leg and thigh in the fading daylight i couldnt tell if id ruined my skirt a silky black number that i was rather fond of i limped back to my car where i used part of my bottle of water to clean the blood from my leg the skirt had some dirt ground into it fraying the fabric surface i picked at the gravel bits disconsolately maybe when it was cleaned the torn threads wouldnt show leaning back in the front seat with my eyes shut i wondered whether it was worthwhile trying to get back into the hyde park bank building even if i could charm my way past the guard in my current disarray if i took anything fepple would know it had been me that project could wait until monday i still had over an hour before i was due to meet beth blacksini should just go home and clean up properly for my interview on the other hand amy blount phd the young woman whod written ajax s history lived only three blocks from the bank i called the number mary louise had dug up for me ms blount was home in her polite aloof way she acknowledged that wed met when i explained that i wanted to ask some questions about ajax she turned from aloof to frosty mr rossys secretary has already asked me those questions i find them offensive i wont answer them from you any more than from him sorry ms blount i wasnt very clear ajax didnt send me to you i dont know what questions rossy wants to ask you but theyre probably different from mine mine come from a client whos trying to find out what happened to a lifeinsurance policy i dont think you know the answer but id like to talk to you because because of what because i was so frustrated at being stiffed by fepple defamed by durham that i was clutching at any straw because i cannot figure out whats going on and id like to talk to someone who understands ajax im in the neighborhood i could stop by now for ten minutes if you can spare the time after a pause she said coldly she would hear what i had to say but couldnt promise shed answer any questions she lived in a shabby courtyard building on cornell the kind of haphazardly maintained property that students can afford even so as i knew from the plaint of an old friend whose son was starting medical school down here blount probably paid six or seven hundred a month for the broken glass on the sidewalk her badly hung lobby door and the hole in the stairwell wall blount stood in the open door to her studio apartment watching while i climbed the third flight of stairs here at home her dreadlocks hung loosely about her face instead of the prim tweed suit shed worn to ajax she had on jeans and a big shirt she ushered me in politely but without cordiality waving a hand at a hardwood chair while seating herself in the swivel desk chair at her work station except for a futon with a bright kente cover and a print of a woman squatting behind a basket the room was furnished with monastic severity it was lined on all sides by white pasteboard bookshelves even the tiny eating alcove had shelves fitted around a clock ralph devereux told me you had a degree in economic history is that how you came to be involved with writing the ajax history she nodded without speaking what did you do your dissertation on is this relevant to your clients story ms warshawski i raised my brows polite conversation ms blount but thats right you said you wouldnt answer any questions you said you had already heard from bertrand rossy so you know that alderman durham has had ajax under his secretary she corrected me mr rossy is too important to call me himself her voice was so toneless that i couldnt be sure whether her intent was ironic still he made the questions take place so you know durham s picketing the ajax building claiming that ajax and the birnbaums owe restitution to the africanamerican community for the money they both made from slavery i suppose rossy accused you of supplying durham the information out of the ajax archives she nodded fractionally her eyes wary the other piece of durham s protest concerns me personally have you encountered the midway insurance agency over in the bank building howard fepple is the rather ineffectual present owner but thirty years ago one of his fathers agents sold a policy to a man named sommers i outlined the sommers family problem now durham has hold of the story based on your work at ajax im wondering if you have any ideas on who might give the alderman such detailed inside information about both the company history and this current claim sommers complained to the alderman but the durham protest had one detail that i dont think sommers would have known the fact that ajax insured the birnbaum corporation in the years before the civil war im assuming that information is accurate or rossy wouldnt have called you had his secretary call you when i paused blount said it is sort of that is the original birnbaum the one who started the family fortune was insured by ajax in the s what do you mean sort of i asked in mordecai birnbaum lost a load of steel plows he was sending to mississippi when the steamship blew up on the illinois river ajax paid for it i suppose thats what alderman durham is referring to she spoke in a rapid monotone i hoped when she lectured to students she had more animation or theyd all be asleep steel plows i repeated my attention diverted they existed before the civil war she smiled primly john deere invented the steel plow in in he set up his first major plant and retail store here in illinois so the birnbaums were already an economic power in i dont think so i think it was the civil war that made the family fortune but the ajax archives didnt include a lot of specificsi was guessing from the list of assets being insured the birnbaum plows were only a small part of the ships cargo in your opinion who could have told durham about birnbaums plow shipment is this a subtle way to get me to confess she could have asked the question in a humorous veinbut she didnt i made an effort not to lose my own temper in return im open to all possibilities but i have to consider the available facts you had access to the archives perhaps you shared the data with durham but if you didnt perhaps you have some ideas on who did so you did come here to accuse me she set her jaw in an uncompromising line i sank my face into my hands suddenly tired of the matter i came here hoping to get better information than i have but let it be i have an interview with channel thirteen to discuss the whole sorry business i need to go home to change she tightened her lips do you plan to accuse me on air i actually didnt come here to accuse you of anything at all but youre so suspicious of me and my motives that i cant imagine youd believe any assurances i gave you i came here hoping that a trained observer like you would have seen something that would give me a new way to think about whats going on she looked at me uncertainly if i told you i didnt give durham the files would you believe me i spread my hands try me she took a breath then spoke rapidly looking at the books over her computer i happen not to support mr durhams ideas i am fully cognizant of the racial injustices that still exist in this country i have researched and written about black economic and commercial history so i am more familiar with the history of these injustices than most they run deep and they run wide i took the job of writing that ajax history for instance because im having a hard time getting academic history or economics programs to pay attention to me outside of africanamerican studies which are too often marginalized for me to find interesting i need to earn something while im jobhunting also the ajax archives will make an interesting monograph but i dont believe in focusing on africanamericans as victims it makes us seem pitiable to white america and as long as we are pitiable we will not be respected she flushed as if embarrassed to reveal her beliefs to a stranger i thought of lottys angry vehemence with max on the subject of jews as victims i nodded slowly and told blount that i could believe her besides she added her color still deepened it would seem immoral to me to make the ajax files available to an outsider when they had trusted me with their private documents since you didnt feed inside ajax information to the alderman can you think who might have she shook her head its such a big company and the files arent exactly secret at least they werent when i was doing my research they keep all of the old material in their company library in boxes hundreds of boxes as a matter of fact recent material they guarded carefully but the first hundred yearsit was more a question of having the patience to wade through it than any particular difficulty gaining access to it although you do have to ask the librarian to see itstill anyone who wanted to study those papers could probably get around that difficulty so it might be an employee someone with a grudge or someone who could be bribed or perhaps a zealous member of alderman durhams organization any or all of those could be reasonable possibilities but i have no names to put forward still thirtyseven hundred people of color hold lowlevel clerical or manuallaboring positions in the company they are underpaid underrepresented in supervisory positions and often are treated to overt racial slurs any of them could become angry enough to undertake an act of passive sabotage i stood up wondering if someone in the sommers extended family was among the lowlevel clerks at ajax i thanked amy blount for being willing to talk to me and left her one of my cards in case anything else occurred to her as she walked me to the door i stopped to admire the picture of the squatting woman her head was bent over the basket in front of her you didnt see her face its by lois mailou jones ms blount said she also refused to be a victim xiv running the tape late that night i lay in the dark next to morrell fretting uselessly endlessly about the day my mind bouncedlike a pinballfrom rhea wiell to alderman durham my fury with him rising each time i thought of that flyer he was handing out in the ajax plaza when i tried to put that to rest id go back to amy blount to howard fepple and finally to my gnawing worries about lotty when id gone to my office from amy blounts place id found the copies of the paul radbuka video the unblinking eye had made for me along with the stills of radbuka my long afternoon dealing with sommers and fepple had pushed radbuka out of my mind at first i only stared at the packet trying to remember what id wanted from the eye when i saw the stills of radbukas face i recalled my promise to lotty to get her a copy of the video today numb with fatigue i was thinking i might hang on to it until i saw her on sunday at maxs when she phoned victoria im trying to be civilized but have you not had my messages this afternoon i explained that i hadnt had a chance to check with my answering service in about fifteen minutes im talking to a reporter about the charges that bull durhams been flinging at me so i was trying to organize my response into sincere succinct nuggets bull durham the man whos been protesting the holocaust asset recovery act dont tell me hes involved now with paul radbuka i blinked no hes involved in a case ive been working on insurance fraud involving a south side family and that takes precedence over responding to messages from me lotty i was outraged alderman durham handed out flyers today defaming me he marched around a public space bellowing insults about me through a bullhorn it doesnt seem extraordinary that i had to respond to that i walked into my office five minutes ago i havent even seen my messages yes i see she said ibut i need some support too i want to see this mans video victoria i want to know that youre trying to help me that you wont abanthat you wont forget our her voice was panicky she was flailing about for words in a way that made my insides twist lotty please how could i forget our friendship or ever abandon you as soon as i finish with this interview ill be right over say in an hour when we hung up i checked my messages shed phoned three times beth blacksin had phoned once to say shed love to talk to me but could i come to the global building since she was jammed up with editing all the interviews and demonstrations of the day shed seen murray ryersonhed join us at the studio i thought wistfully of my cot in the back room but gathered up my things and drove back downtown beth spent twenty minutes taping me while she and murray peppered me with questions i was being careful not to implicate my client but i freely tossed them howard fepples nameit was time someone besides me started pushing on him beth was gleeful enough to get this exclusive new source that she happily shared what she had with me but neither she nor murray had any idea who had given durham the information on the birnbaums i got thirty seconds with the alderman who says its common knowledge murray said i talked to the birnbaum legal counsel who said its overblown ancient history i couldnt get to the woman who wrote their history amy blountsomeone at ajax suggested it was her i talked to her i said smugly id bet hard against her it has to be another ajax insider or maybe someone in the birnbaum company with a grudge you talk to bertrand rossy i gather hes fulminatingthe swiss probably arent used to street demonstrations if durham hadnt libeled me id be chortling over it you know that piece we did on wednesday on paul radbuka beth said changing the subject to something she cared about personally weve had about a hundred and thirty emails from people who say they know his little friend miriam my assistants tracking them down most of them are unstable gloryseekers but it will be such a coup if one of them turns out to be the real deal just think if we reunite them onair i hope youre not building that up onair i said sharply it may turn out to be just that air what beth stared at me you think he made up his friend no vic youre wrong about that murray whose sixeight frame had been curled against a filing cabinet suddenly stood up straight and began pelting me with questions what inside dope did i have on paul radbuka what did i know about his playmate miriam what did i know about rhea wiell nothing on all of the above i said i havent talked to the guy but i met rhea wiell this morning shes not a fraud vic beth said sharply i know shes not shes not a fraud and shes not a con artist but she believes in herself so intensely thati dont know i cant explain it i finished helplessly struggling to articulate why her look of ecstasy when she discussed paul radbuka had unnerved me so much i agreeit doesnt seem possible that someone as experienced as wiell could be conned butwell i guess i wont have an opinion until i meet radbuka i finished lamely when you do youll really believe in him beth promised she left a minute later to edit my remarks for the ten oclock news murray tried to talk me into a drink you know warshawski we work together so well itd be a shame not to get back in the habit oh murray you sweettalker you i can see how badly you need your own private angle on this stuff i cant stay tonightits vital that i get to lotty herschels place in the next half hour he followed me down the hall to the security station while i handed in my pass whats the real story for you here warshawski radbuka and wiell or durham and the sommers family i frowned up at him they both are thats the problem i cant quite focus on either of them durham is about the slickest politico in town these days next to the mayor be careful how you tangle with him say hey to the doc for me okay he squeezed my shoulder affectionately and turned back up the hall ive known lotty herschel since i was an undergraduate at the university of chicago i was a bluecollar girl on an upscale campus feeling rawly out of place when i met hershe was providing medical advice to an abortion underground where i volunteered she took me under her wing giving me the kind of social skills id lost when i lost my mother keeping me from losing my way in those days of drugs and violent protest taking time from a densepacked schedule to cheer my successes and condole over failures shed even gone to some college basketball games to see me playtrue friendship since sports of all kind bore her but it was my athletic scholarship that made my education possible so she supported my doing my best at it if she was collapsing now if something terrible was wrong with heri couldnt even finish the thought it was so frightening to me shed recently moved to a highrise on the lakefront to one of the beautiful old buildings where you can watch the sun rise with nothing between you and water but lake shore drive and a strip of park she used to live in a twoflat a short walk from her storefront clinic but her one concession to aging was to give up on being a landlady in a neighborhood full of drugdealing housebreakers max and i had both been relieved to see her in a building with an indoor garage when i left my car with her doorman it was only eight oclock the day seemed to have been spinning on so long i was sure we must have come round the other side of dark to begin a new one lotty was waiting in the hall for me when i got off the elevator making a valiant effort at composure even though i held the envelope of stills and video out to her she didnt snatch it from me but invited me in to her living room offering me a drink when i said i only wanted water she still ignored the envelope trying to make a joke that i must be ill if i wanted water instead of whisky i smiled but the deep circles under her dark eyes disturbed me i didnt comment on her appearance just asking as she turned to go to the kitchen if she would bring me a piece of fruit or cheese she seemed to really look at me for the first time you havent eaten i can see from the lines on your face that youre exhausted stay in here ill fix you something this was more like her usual brisk manner i was slightly reassured slumping against her couch and dozing until she returned with a tray cold chicken carrot sticks a small salad and slices of the thick bread a ukrainian nurse at the hospital bakes for her i tried not to spring on the food as if i were one of my own dogs while i ate lotty watched me as if keeping her eyes from the envelope by an act of will she kept up a flow of random chatterhad i decided to go away with morrell for the weekend would we make it back for sunday afternoons concert max was expecting forty or fifty people at his house for dinner afterward but heand especially caliawould miss me if i didnt come i finally interrupted the flow lotty are you afraid to look at the pictures because of what you will see or because of what you may not see she gave the ghost of a smile acute of you my dear a little of both i think butif you will run the tape for me maybe i am ready to see it max warned me that the man was not prepossessing we went to the back bedroom she uses for television and loaded the tape into the vcr i glanced at lotty but the fear in her face was so acute that i couldnt bear to watch her as paul radbuka recounted his nightmares and his heartbreaking cries for his childhood friend i kept my eyes glued to him when wed seen everything including the exploring chicago segment with rhea wiell and arnold praeger lotty asked in a thread of a voice to return to radbukas interview i ran it through for her twice more but when she wanted a third rerun i refused her face was grey with strain youre torturing yourself with this lotty why ithe whole thing is hard even though i was sitting on the floor next to her armchair i could barely make out her words something is familiar to me in what hes saying only i cant think becausei cant think i hate this i hate seeing things that make my mind stop working do you believe his story i made a helpless gesture i cant fathom it but its so remote from how i want to see life that my mind is rejecting it i met the therapist yesterdayno it was today it just seems like a long time ago shes a legitimate clinician i think but well fanatical a zealot for her work in general and most particularly for this guy i told her i wanted to interview radbuka to see if he could be related to these people you and max know but shes protecting him hes not in the phone book either as paul radbuka or paul ulrich so im sending mary louise out to all the ulrichs in chicago maybe hes still living in his fathers house or maybe a neighbor will recognize his picturewe dont know his fathers first name how old would you say he is she asked unexpectedly you mean could he be the right age for the experiences hes claiming youd be a better judge of that than i but again it would be easier to answer if we saw him in person i took the stills out of the envelope holding the three different shots so that the light shone full on them lotty looked at them a long time but finally shook her head helplessly why did i imagine something definite would jump out at me its what max said to me resemblance is so often a trick of the expression after all and these are only photographs photographs of a picture really i would have to see the man and even thenafter all id be trying to match an adult face against a childs memory of someone who was much younger than this man is now i took her hand in both of mine lotty what is it youre afraid of this is so painful for you its breaking my heart is itcould he be part of your family do you think hes related to your mother if you knew anything of those matters you would know better than to ask such a question she said with a flash of her more imperious manner but you do know the radbuka family dont you she laid the pictures on the coffee table as if she were dealing cards and then proceeded to rearrange them but she wasnt really looking at them i knew some members of the family many years ago the circumstanceswhen i last saw them it was extremely painful the way we parted i mean or anyway the whole situation if this man isi dont see how he could be what he says but if he is then i owe it to the family to try to befriend him do you want me to do some digging assuming i can get hold of any information to dig with her vivid dark face was contorted with strain oh victoria i dont know what i want i want the past never to have happened or since it did and i cant change it i want it to stay where it is past dead gone this man i dont want to know him but i see i will have to talk to him do i want you to investigate him no i dont want you near him but find him for me find him so i can talk to him and you youwhat you can do is try to see what piece of paper convinced him his name was really paul radbuka late that night her unhappy contradictory words kept tumbling through my mind sometime after two i finally fell asleep but in my dreams bull durham chased me until i found myself locked up with paul radbuka at terezin with lotty on the far side of the barbed wire watching me with hurt tormented eyes keep him there among the dead she cried lotty herschels story english lessons school still had three weeks to go when hugo and i reached london but minna didnt think it worthwhile to register me since my lack of english would keep me from understanding any lessons she set me to doing chores in the house and then in the neighborhood she would write a shopping list in her slow english script spelling the words under her breathincorrectly as i saw when i learned to read and write in the new language she would give me a pound and send me to the corner shop to buy a chop for dinner a few potatoes a loaf of bread when she got home from work she would count the change twice to make sure i hadnt robbed her still each week she gave me sixpence in pocket money hugo whom i saw on sundays was already chattering in english i felt humiliated the big sister not able to speak because minna kept me barricaded behind a wall of german she hoped day to day that i would be sent back to vienna why waste your time on english when you may leave in the morning the first time she said it my heart skipped a beat mutti und oma haben sie dir geschrieben they wrote you i can go home i havent heard from madame butterfly minna spat in her own good time she will remember you mutti had forgotten me it hit my childs heart like a fist a year later when i could read english i despised the childrens books we were given in school with their saccharine mothers and children my mother would never forget me she loves me even though she is far away and i pray every night to see her again as i know she is praying for me and watching over me thats what the girls in good wives or english orphans would have said to cousin minna boldly defiant in their trembling littlegirl voices but they didnt understand anything about life those little girls your own mother lies in bed too worn to get up to kiss you goodbye when you get on a train leave your city your home your mutti and oma behind men in uniforms stop you look in your suitcase put big ugly hands on your underwear your favorite doll they can take these things if they want and your mother is lying in bed not stopping them of course i knew the truth knew that only hugo and i could get visas and travel permits that grownups werent allowed to go to england unless someone in england gave them a job i knew the truth that the nazis hated us because we were jews so they took away opas apartment with my bedroom some strange woman was living there now with her blond child in my whitecanopied bedi had gone early one morning on foot to look at the building with its little sign juden verboten i knew these things knew that my mama was hungry as we all were but to a child your parents are so powerful i still half believed my parents my opa would rise up and make everything go back the way it used to be when minna said my mother would remember me in her own good time she only voiced my deepest fear i had been sent away because mutti didnt want me until september when the war started and no one could leave austria anymore minna would say that at regular intervals even today im sure she did this because she so resented my mother lingerl the little butterfly with her soft gold curls her beautiful smile her charming manners the only way minna could hurt lingerl was to hurt me perhaps the fact that my mother never knew made minna twist the knife harder she was so furious that she couldnt stab lingerl directly that she kept on at me maybe thats why she was so hateful when we got the news about their fate the one thing i knew for sure my first summer in london the summer of was what my papa told me that he would come if i could find him a job armed with a germanenglish dictionary which i found in minnas sitting room i spent that summer walking up and down the streets near minnas house in kentish town my cheeks stained with embarrassment i would ring doorbells and struggle to say mine vater he need job he do all job garden he make garden house he clean house coal he bring coal make house warm eventually i ended up at the house behind minnas i had been watching it from my attic window because it was so different from minnas hers was a narrow frame structure whose neighbors almost touched on the east and west sides the garden was a cold oblong as narrow as the house and only holding a few scraggly raspberry bushes to this day i wont eat raspberries anyway the house behind was made of stone with a large garden roses an apple tree a little patch of vegetables and claire i knew her name because her mother and her older sister would call to her she sat on a swingbench under their pergola her fair hair pulled away from her ears to hang down her back while she pored over her books claire her mother would call teatime darling youll strain your eyes reading in the sun of course i didnt understand what she was saying at first although i could make out claires name but the words were repeated every summer so my memory blurs all those summers in my memory i understand mrs tallmadge perfectly from the start claire was studying because next year she would take her higherschool certificate she wanted to read medicineagain i only learned this later the sister vanessa was five years older than claire vanessa had some refined little job i dont remember what now she was getting ready to be married that summer that i understood clearlyall little girls understand brides and weddings from peeping over railings at them i would watch vanessa come into the garden she wanted claire to try on a dress or a hat or admire a swatch of fabric and finally when she could get her sisters attention no other way she would snatch claires book then the two would chase each other around the garden until they ended up in a laughing heap back under the pergola i wanted to be part of their life so desperately that at night i would lie in bed making up stories about them claire would be in some trouble from which i would rescue her claire would somehow know the details of my life with cousin minna and would boldly confront minna accuse her of all her crimes and rescue me i dont know why it was claire who became my heroine not the mother or the bridemaybe because claire was closer to my age so i could imagine being her i only know that i would watch the sisters laughing together and burst into tears i put off their house until last because i didnt want claire to pity me i pictured my papa as a servant in her house then she would never sit laughing with me on the swing but in the letters that still passed between england and vienna that summer papa kept reminding me that he needed me to get him a job all these years later i am still bitter that minna couldnt find a place for him at the glove factory its true it wasnt her factory but she was the bookkeeper she could talk to herr schatz every time i brought it up she screamed that she wasnt going to have people pointing a finger at her during the war the glove factory was working treble shifts to supply the army finally one hot august morning when i had seen claire go into the garden with her books i rang their doorbell i thought if mrs tallmadge answered i could manage to speak to her if claire was in the garden i was safe from having to face my idol of course it was a maid who came to the doori should have expected that since all of the bigger houses in our neighborhood had maids and even the small ugly ones like minnas had at least a charwoman to do the heavy cleaning the maid said something too fast for me to understand i only knew her tone was angry quickly as she started to shut the door in my face i blurted out in broken english that claire wanted me claire ask she say you come the maid shut the door on me but this time she told me to wait a word i had learned in my weeks of doorbell ringing by and by claire came back with the maid oh susan its the funny little girl from over the way ill talk to heryou go on when susan disappeared sniffing claire bent over and said ive seen you watching me over the wall you queer little monkey what do you want i stammered out my story father needed job he could do anything but mother looks after the garden and susan cleans the house play violin sister i pantomimed vanessa as a bride making claire burst into gales of laughter he play very pretty sister like mrs tallmadge appeared behind her daughter demanding to know who i was and what i wanted she and claire had a conversation that went on for some time which i couldnt follow at all except to recognize hitlers name and the jews of course i could see that claire was trying to persuade mrs tallmadge but that the mother was obduratethere was no money when my english became fluent when i got to know the family i learned that mr tallmadge had died leaving some moneyenough to maintain the house and keep mrs tallmadge and her daughters in respectable comfortbut not enough for extravagance sponsoring my father would have been extravagant at one point claire turned to ask me about my mother i said yes she would come too but claire wanted to know what kind of work my mother could perform i stared blankly unable to imagine such a thing not just because she had been sick with her pregnancy but no one expected my mother to work you wanted her around to make you gay because she danced and talked and sang more beautifully than anyone but even if my english had allowed me to express those ideas i knew they would be a mistake sewing i finally remembered very good sewing mother make makes maybe ted claire suggested you can try her mother snorted going back into the house ted was edward marmaduke he was going to be vanessas husband i had seen him in the garden too a pale englishman with very blond hair who turned an unhealthy pinkyred under the summer sun he would serve in africa and italy but come home in one piece in his face scorched to a deep brick that never really faded that summer of he didnt want a poor immigrant couple to encumber the start of his married life with vanessa i heard that argument crouched on the other side of the wall between minnas yard and claires knowing it was about me and my family but only understanding his loud no and from vanessas tone that she was trying to please both claire and her fiancé claire told me not to give up hope but little monkey you need to learn english you have to go to school in a few weeks in vienna i said i go home i go on the school there claire shook her head there may be war in europe you might not go home for a long time no we need to get you speaking english so my life changed overnight of course i still lived with minna still ran her errands endured her bitterness but my heroine actually did take me to the pergola every afternoon she made me speak english with her when school started she took me to the local grammar school introduced me to the headmistress and helped me at odd intervals to learn my lessons i repaid her with lavish adoration she was the most beautiful girl in london she became my standard of english manners claire says one doesnt do that i would say coldly to minna claire says one always does this i imitated her accent and her ways of doing things from how she draped herself in the garden swing to how she wore her hats when i learned claire was going to read medicine if she got a place at the royal free that became my ambition too xv gate crasher morrells and my brief vacation in michigan helped drive fridays worries to the back of my mindthanks chiefly to morrells good sense since i was driving the outbound route i started to detour to hyde park thinking i could make a quick trip in and out of fepples office to look for the sommers family file morrell vetoed this sharply reminding me that wed agreed to fortyeight hours without business i didnt bring my laptop so that i wouldnt be tempted to email humane medicine you can stay away from an insurance agent who sounds like a disgusting specimen for that long too v i morrell took my picklocks out of my bag and stuck them in his jeans anyway i dont want to be a party to your extracurricular informationgathering techniques i had to laugh despite a momentary annoyance after all why would i want to spoil my last few days with morrell by bothering with a worm like fepple i decided not even to bother with the morning papers which id stuck in my bag without reading i didnt need to raise my blood pressure by seeing bull durhams attacks on me in print less easy to put aside were my worries about lotty but our ban on business didnt include concerns about friends i tried to describe her anguish to morrell he listened to me as i drove but couldnt offer much help in deciphering what lay behind her tormented speech she lost her family in the war didnt she except for her younger brother hugo who went to england with her he lives in montreal he runs a small chain of upscale womens boutiques in montreal and toronto her uncle stefan i guess he was one of her grandfathers brothers he came to chicago in the s and spent most of the war as a guest of the federal government in fort leavenworth forgery i added in response to morrells startled question a master engraver who fell in love with andrew jacksons face but overlooked a few details so he wasnt part of her childhood she was nine or ten when she last saw her mother then no wonder those wartime memories are too painful for her didnt you say he was deadthe person named radbuka or she lotty revealed no details at all but she did say it said that the person no longer exists i thought about it its a peculiar construction that person no longer exists it could mean several thingsthe person died the person changed identities or maybe the person betrayed her in some way so that someone she loved or who she thought loved her never really existed then the pain could come from the reminder of a second loss dont go sleuthing after her vic let her bring the story to you when shes strong enough to i fixed my eyes on the road and if she never tells me he leaned over to wipe a tear from my cheek its not your failure as a friend these are her demons not your failures i didnt speak much for the rest of the ride we were going about a hundred miles around the big u of lake michigans southern end i let the rhythm of car and road fill my mind morrell had booked a room at a rambling stone inn overlooking lake michigan after checking in we took a walk along the beach it was hard to believe that this was the same lake that chicago borderedthe long stretches of dunes empty of everything but birds and prairie grasses were a different world than the relentless noise and grime of the city three weeks after labor day we had the lakefront to ourselves feeling the wind from the lake in my hair making the crystalline sand along the shore sing by rubbing it with my bare heel gave me a cocoon of peace i felt the tension lines smooth out of my cheeks and forehead morrellit will be very hard for me to live without you these next few months i know this trip is exciting and that youre eager to go i dont grudge it to you but it will be hardespecially right nownot to have you here he pulled me to him it will be hard for me to be away from you too pepaiola you keep me stirred up sneezing with your vigorous remarks id told morrell once that my father used to call my mother and me thatone of the few italian words hed picked up from my mother pepper mill my two pepaiole hed say pretending to sneeze when we were haranguing him over something youre making my nose red okay okay well do it your way just to protect my nose when i was a little girl he could make me burst out laughing with his fake sneezes pepaiola huhsneeze at this i tossed a little sand at morrell and sprinted away from him down the beach he chased after me which he normally wouldnt dohe doesnt like to run and anyway im faster i slowed so he could catch me we spent the rest of the day avoiding all difficult topics including his imminent departure the air was chilly but the lake was still warm we swam naked in the dark then huddled in a blanket on the beach making love with andromeda overhead and orion the hunter my talisman rising in the east his belt so close it seemed we might pluck it from the sky sunday at noon we changed reluctantly into our dress clothes and drove back into the city for the cellinis final chicago concert when we stopped for gas near the entrance to the tollway the weekend felt officially over so i bought the sunday papers durham s protest led both the news and the oped sections in the heraldstar i was glad to see that my interview with blacksin and murray had made durham cool his jets about me mr durham has dropped one of his complaints that chicago private investigator v i warshawski confronted a bereaved woman in the middle of her husbands funeral my sources in the community were understandably devastated by the terrible inhumanity of an insurance company failing to keep its promise to pay to bury a loved one in their agitation they may have misspoken ms warshawskis role in the case may have misspoken cant he come right out and say he was wrong i snarled at morrell murray had added a few sentences saying that my investigation was raising troubling questions about the role of both the midway insurance agency and the ajax insurance company midway owner howard fepple had not returned phone calls an ajax spokesperson said the company had uncovered a fraudulent death claim submitted ten years ago they were trying to see how that could have occurred the oped page had an article by the president of the illinois insurance institute i read it aloud to morrell imagine that you go into berlin the capital of germany and find a large museum dedicated to the horrors of three centuries of african slavery in the united states then imagine that frankfurt munich cologne bonn all have smaller versions of american slavery museums thats what its like for america to put up holocaust museums while completely ignoring atrocities committed here against africans and native americans now suppose germany passed a law saying that any american company which benefited from slavery couldnt do business in europe thats what illinois wants to do with german companies the past is a tangled country no ones hands are clean but if we have to stop every ten minutes to wash them before we can sell cars or chemicals or even insurance commerce will grind to a halt and so on lotty isnt alone in wanting the past to stay good and buried pretty slick in a superficial kind of way morrell grimaced yes it makes him sound like a warmhearted liberal worrying about africanamericans and indians when all he really wants to do is keep anyone from inspecting lifeinsurance records to see how many policies were sold which illinois insurers dont want to pay out of course the sommers family also bought a policy they cant collect on although i dont think it was the company that defrauded them but the agent i wish i could see fepples file not today ms warshawski im not giving back your picklocks until i board that on tuesday i laughed and subsided into the sports section the cubs had gone so far into free fall that theyd have to send the space shuttle to haul them back to the national league the sox on the other hand were looking pretty the best record in the majors going into the final week of the season even though the pundits were saying theyd be eliminated in the first round of the playoffs it was still an amazing event in chicago sports we reached orchestra hall seconds before the ushers closed the doors michael loewenthal had left tickets for morrell and me we joined agnes and calia loewenthal in a box calia looking angelic in white smocking with gold roses embroidered on it her doll and dog festooned with ribbons in matching gold were propped up in the chair next to hers wherere lotty and max i whispered as the musicians took the stage max is getting ready for the party lotty came over to help him then got into a huge row with both him and carl she doesnt look well i dont know if shell even stay for the party shh mommy aunt vicory you cant talk when daddy is playing in public calia looked at us sternly she had been warned against this sin many times in her short life agnes and i obediently subsided but my worries about lotty rushed back to the front of my mind also if she was having a major fight with max i wasnt looking forward to the evening as the musicians took the stage they looked remote in their formal wear like strangers not friends for a moment i wished wed skipped the concert but once the music began with the controlled lyricism that marked carls style the knots inside me began to unwind in a schubert trio the richness of michael loewenthals playing and the intimacy he seemed to feelwith his cello with his fellow musiciansmade me ache with longing morrell took my fingers and squeezed them gently separation will not part us during intermission i asked agnes if she knew why lotty and max were fighting she shook her head michael says theyve been arguing off and on all summer over this conference on jews where max spoke on wednesday now they seem to be fighting about a man max met there or heard speak or something but i was trying to get calia to hold still while i braided the ribbons into her hair and didnt really pay attention after the concert agnes asked if we would drive calia up to evanston with us shes been so good sitting like a princess for three hours the sooner she can run around and let off steam the better id like to stay until michaels ready to leave calias angelic mood vanished as soon as we walked out of orchestra hall she ran shrieking down the street shedding ribbons and even ninshubur the blue stuffed dog before she actually careened into the street i caught up with her and scooped her up i am not a baby i do not get carried she yelled at me of course not no baby would be such a pain i was panting with the exertion of carrying her down the stairs to the garage morrell was laughing at both of us which made calia at once assume an icy dignity i am most annoyed at this behavior she said echoing her mother her little arms crossed in front of her speaking for both of us i murmured setting her back on her feet morrell handed her into the car and gravely offered ninshubur back to her calia wouldnt allow me to fasten her seat belt but decided morrell was her ally against me and stopped squirming when he leaned in to do the job on the ride to maxs she scolded me through the medium of lecturing her doll you are a very naughty girl picking up ninshubur and carrying him down the stairs when he was running ninshubur is not a baby he needs to run and let off steam she certainly took my mind off any other worries perhaps that would be a good reason to have a child you wouldnt have energy left to fret about anything else a handful of cars were in maxs drive when we got there including lottys darkgreen infiniti its battered fenders an eloquent testimony to her imperious approach to the streets she hadnt learned to drive until she arrived in chicago at the age of thirty when she apparently took lessons from a nascar crash dummy she must have patched up her disagreement with max if she was staying for the party a blacksuited young man opened the door for us calia ran down the hall shrieking for her grandfather when we moved more slowly after her we saw two other men in waiters costumes folding napkins in the dining room max had set up a series of small tables there and in the adjacent parlor so that people could eat dinner sitting down lotty her back to the door was counting forks into bundles and slapping them onto a sideboard judging from her rigid posture she was still angry we slipped by without saying anything not the best mood for a party i muttered we can pay our respects to carl and leave early morrell agreed we tracked max down in the kitchen where he was conferring with his housekeeper on how to manage the party calia ran to tug at his arm he hoisted her up to the countertop but didnt let her stop his discussion with mrs squires max has been an administrator for yearshe knows you never finish anything if you keep accepting interruptions whats going on with lotty i asked when he and mrs squires were done oh shes having a temper tantrum i wouldnt pay much attention to it he said lightly this isnt about the radbuka business is it i asked frowning opa opa calia shouted i was quiet the whole time but aunt vicory and mommy talked and then aunt vicory was very bad she hurted my tummy when she carried me down the stairs terrible puppchen max murmured stroking her hair adding to me lotty and i have agreed to keep our disagreements to one side for the evening so i am not going to violate the concordat by giving my views one of the waiters brought a young woman in jeans into the kitchen max introduced her as lindsey a local student who was going to entertain the small ones at the party when i told calia id go upstairs to help her put on play clothes she told me scornfully it was a formal party so she had to keep her party dress on but she consented to go with lindsey to the garden lotty swept into the kitchen acknowledging morrell and me with a regal nod and said she was going up to change despite her daunting manner it was a relief to see her imperious rather than anguished she reappeared in a crimson silk jacket and long skirt about the time the other guests began to arrive don strzepek walked over from morrells actually wearing an ironed shirtmax had readily agreed to include morrells old friend in the invitation the musicians showed up in a bunch three or four had children around calias age the cheerful lindsey scooped them all together and took them upstairs to watch videos and eat pizza carl had changed from his tails into a soft sweater and trousers his eyes were bright with pleasure in himself his music his friends the tempo of the party began to accelerate with the force of his personality even lotty was relaxing laughing in one corner with the cellini bass player i found myself discussing chicago architecture with michael loewenthals first cello instructor over wine and little squares of goatcheese polenta the cellinis manager suggested todays antiamerican sentiment in france resembled antiroman feelings in ancient gaul near the piano morrell was deep in the kind of political controversy he delights in we forgot our idea of leaving early around nine when the rest of the guests had gone into the back of the house for dinner the doorbell rang i had lingered in the sunroom listening to rosa ponselle sing lamero sarò costante it had been one of my mothers favorite arias and i wanted to hear the recording to the end the bell rang again as i crossed the empty hall to join the rest of the partythe waiters were apparently too busy serving dinner to respond to it i turned back to the heavy double doors when i saw the figure on the doorstep i sucked in my breath his curly hair was thinning at the temples but despite the grey and the lines around his mouth his face had a kind of childlike quality the pictures id been looking at showed him contorted with anguish but even with his cheeks creased in a shy eager smile paul radbuka was unmistakable xvi contact problems he looked around the hall with a kind of nervous eagerness as if he had arrived early for an audition are you mrs loewenthal perhaps or a daughter mr radbukaor is it mr ulrichwho invited you here i wondered wildly if that was what lotty and max had been fighting aboutmax had found the guys address and invited him to come while carl was still in town lotty with her intense fear of reawakening the past strenuously objected no no ulrich was never my name that was the man who called himself my father im paul radbuka are you one of my new relatives why are you here who invited you i repeated no one i came on my own when rhea told me that some of the people who knew my family or perhaps are my family were leaving chicago tomorrow when i talked to rhea wiell friday afternoon she said you didnt know there were any other radbukas and that shed see how you felt about meeting them oh ohyou were part of that meeting with rhea are you the publisher who wants to write my story im v i warshawski im an investigator who spoke to her about the possibility of meeting you i knew i sounded chilly but his unexpected arrival had me offbalance i knowthe detective who went to see her when she was talking to her publisher then youre the person who is friends with the survivors from my family no i said sharply trying to slow him down i have friends who may know someone from the radbuka family whether that person is related to you would depend on a lot of details that we cant really get into tonight why dont you he interrupted me his eager smile replaced by anger i want to meet anyone who could possibly be a relative not in some cautious way going back to you finding out who these other radbukas are checking to see whether they could really be related to me whether they want to meet me that might take months even yearsi cant wait for that kind of time to pass so you prayed and the lord directed you to mr loewenthals address i said spots of color burned in his cheeks youre being sarcastic but theres no need to be i learned at rheas that max loewenthal was the man who was interested in finding me that he had a musician friend who knew my family and that the musician was here only until tomorrow when she put it like that that max and his friend thought they might know someone of my family i knew the truth either max or his musician friend must be my missing relation they are hiding behind a cloak of pretending to have a friendi know thatits a common disguise especially for people who are frightened of having their identities known i saw i would have to take the initiative come to them overcome their fears of being found out so i studied the newspapers i saw the cellini was visiting from england with their last concert today i saw the name loewenthal as the cellist and knew he must be maxs relation rhea told you mr loewenthals name i demanded furious with her for breaching maxs privacy he gave a supercilious smile she made it clear she wanted me to learn it shed written maxs name next to mine in her appointment book which made me sure max and i were linked i remembered reading her square hand upside down myself i felt overwhelmed by his easy manipulation of facts to suit his wishes and demanded sharply how hed found maxs house since his home phone isnt listed oh it was simple he laughed with childish delight his anger forgotten i told them at the symphony i was michael loewenthals cousin and that i badly needed to see him while he was still in town and the cso gave you this address i was staggered stalking is such a serious problem for performers that no symphony management worth its salt gives out home addresses no no he laughed again if youre a detective this will amuse you maybe even be useful to you in your work i did try to get the address from the symphony management but they were very stuffy so today i went to the concert what a beautiful gift michael hashow wonderfully he plays on that cello i went backstage afterward to congratulate him but that wasnt so easy eitherthey make it hard to get in to see the performers he scowled in momentary resentment by the time i got backstage my cousin michael had left but i heard the other performers talking about the party that max was holding tonight so i called the hospital where max works and told them i was with the chamber players but i had lost maxs address so they found someone in the administrationit took a while because its sunday thats why im latebut they called me with the address how did you know where mr loewenthal works i was reeling so hard in the face of his narrative that i could only grasp at the corner points it was in the program the program for the birnbaum conference he beamed with pride wasnt that clever to say i was one of the musicians isnt that the kind of thing an investigator like you does to find people it made me furious that he was rightits exactly what i would have done despite how clever it was youre here under a false impression max loewenthal is not your cousin he smiled indulgently yes yes im sure youre protecting himrhea told me you were protecting him and that she respected you for it but consider this he wants to find out about me what other possible reason could there be than that he knows were related we were still standing in the doorway you yourself know theres a party going on mr loewenthal cant possibly give you proper attention tonight why dont you give me your address and phone numberhe will want to meet you when he can give you his total attention you should go home before you find yourself in the embarrassing predicament of trying to explain yourself to a room full of strangers youre not maxs daughter or his wife youre only a guest here as i am myself radbuka snapped i want to meet him while his son and his friend are still here which one is his friend there were three men of the right age playing in the concert out of the corner of my eye i saw a couple of people drifting back from the dining room toward the front of the house i took radbuka or ulrich or whoever he was by the elbow why dont we go out to a coffee shop where we can talk this over privately then we can figure out whether theres any chance you could be related toanyone in mr loewenthals milieu but this public forum isnt the best way to do it he wrenched himself away how do you spend your time looking for peoples missing jewelry or their lost dogs youre a property investigator but i am not a piece of property i am a man after all these yearsall these deaths and separationsto think i might have some family that survived the shoah i dont want to waste one more second before seeing them let alone one more week or years even while you file information about me his voice thickened with feeling i thoughtin your television interview last week you said youd only recently discovered your past but its been weighing on me all this time even though i didnt know it you dont know what it was like to grow up with a monster a sadist and never understand the reason for his hatred he had attached himself to someone he despised in order to get a visa to america if i had known what he really waswhat he had done in europe i would have had him deported now to have the chance to meet my true familyi will not let you put any barriers in my path tears started down his face even so if you leave your details with me i will see that mr loewenthal gets them he will arrange an appointment with you at an early date but thisconfronting him in a public gatheringwhat kind of welcome do you think he would give you i tried to hide my anxiety and dismay under a copy of rhea wiells saintly smile the same welcome i will give himthe heartfelt embrace of one survivor of the ashes to another there is no way you can understand that understand what max himself suddenly appeared with the cellini oboist on his arm victoria is this a guest whom i should know are you max radbuka pushed past me to max grasping his hand his face shining with pleasure oh that i had words to express how much this night means to me to be able to greet my true cousin max max max looked from radbuka to me with the same confusion i was feeling im sorry i dont knowohyouare you victoria is this your doing no it was all mine radbuka crowed in delight victoria had mentioned your name to rhea and i knew you must be my cousin either you or your friend why else would victoria be trying so hard to protect you radbuka adapted himself quickly to the environment he hadnt known my name when he arrived now i was victoria he also made the childlike assumption that the people in his special world like rhea must be familiar to anyone he spoke to but why discuss me with this therapist at all max said the crowd growing behind him included don strzepek who stepped forward im afraid that was my doing mr loewenthali mentioned your first name and rhea wiell immediately guessed it was you because youd been on the program at the birnbaum conference i made a helpless gesture ive tried to suggest to mrradbukathat he come away with me to talk over his situation quietly an excellent idea why dont you let ms warshawski get you some supper and go up to my study where i might be able to join you in an hour or so max was offbalance but trying to handle the situation gracefully paul laughed bobbing his head up and down i know i know rhea suggested you might be reluctant to be public with our relationship but truly you have nothing to feari am not planning on asking for money or anything of that naturethe man who called himself my father left me well off although since the money came from acts of monstrosity perhaps i should not be taking it but if he couldnt care for me emotionally at least he tried to compensate with money you came to my house under false pretenses i assure you mr radbuka i am not related to the radbuka family are you ashamed paul blurted but im not here to embarrass you only to finally find my family to see what i can learn about my past my life before terezin what little i know i will tell you another time when im at leisure to attend to you properly max took his elbow trying futilely to propel him to the door and what you know about yourself you can tell me give your phone number to ms warshawski and i will get in touch with you tomorrow i promise you radbukas face crumpled like a child about to cry he reiterated his speech about not being able to wait one more minute and tomorrow your musician friend will be gone what if hes the one who is my missing cousinhow will i ever find him again dont you see max began helplessly all this flailing around with no information is only harder on you harder on me please let ms warshawski take you upstairs and talk to you in a quiet way or leave your number with her and go home now but i came here by taxi i cant drive i dont have a way home radbuka cried out in a childlike bewilderment why wont you make me welcome as more people finished dinner they began filling the hall on their way to the front room an altercation at the foot of the stairs was a lightning rod for attention the crowd began to grow pressing against max i took pauls arm again you are welcomebut not arguing in the hall in the middle of a party rhea wouldnt want you to be so distressed would she lets sit down where we can be comfortable not until i meet maxs musician friend he said stubbornly not until he tells me to my face that he knows me remembers the mother whom i saw pushed alive into a pit of lime lotty had appeared at the door connecting the living room to the hall she pushed her way through the group to my side whats going on victoria this is the guy calling himself radbuka i muttered to her he got here through some unfortunate fast footwork on his part behind us we heard a woman echo lottys question to someone else in the crowd and we also heard the response im not sure i think this man may be claiming carl tisov is his father or something radbuka heard her as well carl tisov is that the name of the musician is he here now lottys eyes widened in dismay i whirled determined to deny the rumor before it got started but the crowd surged forward the buzz catching like fire on straw and spreading through the room carls appearance at the back of the hall caused a sudden silence what is this he asked gaily are you having a prayer vigil out here loewenthal is that carl pauls face lit up again is it you who is my cousin oh carl i am here your longlost relation perhaps we are even brothers oh will you people please move out of the way i need to get to him this is horrifying lotty muttered in my ear how did he get here how did he decide carl was related to him the crowd stood frozen with the embarrassment people get when confronted with an adult whose emotions are running wild as paul tried to push his way through the throng calia suddenly appeared at the top of the hall shrieking loudly the other small ones followed yelling just as loudly as she pelted down the stairs lindsey was running after them trying to reestablish ordersome game must have gotten out of hand calia stopped on the lower landing when she realized the size of her audience then she gave a loud whoop of laughter and pointed at paul look its the big bad wolf hes going to eat my grandpa hell catch us next all the children took up the chant pointing at paul and screeching its a wolf its a wolf its the big bad wolf when paul realized he was the object of their taunting he started to tremble i thought he might cry again agnes loewenthal elbowed her way through the packed hall she stomped up the short flight to the lower landing and scooped up her daughter youre over the top just now young lady you littlies were supposed to stay in the playroom with lindsey im most annoyed at this behavior its long past time for your bath and bedyouve had enough excitement for the day calia began to howl but agnes marched up to the upper landing with her the other children became quiet at once they tiptoed up the stairs in front of a redfaced lindsey the lesser drama with the children had unfrozen the crowd they let michael loewenthal divert them into the front room where coffee was set up i saw morrell who had appeared in the hall when my attention was on calia talking to max and don radbuka was covering his face in distress why is everyone treating me this way the wolf the big bad wolf that was my foster father ulrich thats german for wolf but it isnt my name who told the children to call me that no one i said crisply my sympathy worn completely thin the children were acting out the way children will no one here knows that ulrich is german for big bad wolf it isnt id forgotten lotty was standing behind me its one of those medieval totemic names wolflike ruler something like that she added something in german to paul paul started to answer her in german then stuck out his lower lip like calias when she was being stubborn i will not speak the language of my slavery are you german did you know the man who called himself my father lotty sighed im american but i speak german pauls mood shifted upward again he beamed at lotty but you are a friend of max and carls so i was right to come here if you know my family did you know sofie radbuka at that question carl turned to stare at him where the hell did you come up with that name lotty what do you know about this did you bring this man here to taunt max and me i lotty said ineed to sit down her face had gone completely white i was just in time to catch her as her knees buckled xvii digging up the past morrell helped me support lotty into the sunroom where we laid her on a wicker settee she hadnt fainted completely but was still pale and glad to lie down max his face pinched with worry covered lotty with an afghan always calm in a crisis he sent don to the housekeeper for a bottle of ammonia when id soaked a napkin with it and waved it under her nose lottys color improved she pushed herself to a sitting position urging max to return to his guests after assuring himself that she was really better he reluctantly went back to the party melodrama must be in the air this evening lotty said trying unsuccessfully for her usual manner ive never done that before in my life who brought that extraordinary man here surely that wasnt you victoria he brought himself i said he has an eellike ability to wiggle into spaces including the hospital where some moron in admin gave him maxs home address morrell coughed warningly jerking his head at the shadows on the far side of the room paul radbuka was standing there just beyond the edge of the circle of light cast by a floor lamp now he darted forward to stand over lotty are you feeling better now do you feel like talking i think you must know sofie radbuka who is she how can i find her she must be related to me in some way surely the person you are looking for was named miriam despite her shaking hands lotty pulled herself together to use her princess of austria manner my miriam yes i long to find her again but sofie radbuka that is a name which was dangled in front of me like a carrot making me believe one of my relations must still be alive somewhere only now the carrot has been withdrawn but im sure you know her why else did you faint when you heard the name a question whose answer i would have liked to hear myself but not in front of this guy lotty raised haughty eyebrows at him what i do is no conceivable business of yours it was my understanding from the uproar you caused in the hall that you came to see whether either mr loewenthal or mr tisov were related to you now that youve caused a great disturbance perhaps you would be good enough to give your address to ms warshawski and leave us in peace radbukas lower lip stuck out but before he could dig his heels in morrell intervened im going to take radbuka up to maxs study as v i tried to do an hour ago max and carl may join him there later if theyre able don had been sitting quietly in the background but he stood up now right come on big guy dr herschel needs to rest don put an arm around him with morrell at his other elbow they moved the unhappy radbuka to the door his neck hunched into his oversize jacket his face so expressive of bewildered misery that he looked like a circus clown when theyd gone i turned to lotty who was sofie radbuka she turned her frosty stare to me no one that i know of then why did hearing her name make you faint it didnt my foot caught on the edge of a rug and lotty if you dont want to tell me keep it to yourself but please dont make up stupid lies to me she bit her lip turning her head away from me theres been far too much emotion in this house today first max and carl furious with me and now the man himself shows up i dont need you angry with me as well i sat on the wicker table in front of her settee im not angry but i happened to be alone in the hall when this guy came to the door and after ten minutes with him my head was spinning like a hula hoop if you faint or start to faint then claim nothing was wrong it makes me even dizzier im not here to criticize but you were so upset on friday you got me seriously worried and your agony seems to have started with this guys appearance at the birnbaum conference she looked back at me her hauteur suddenly changed to consternation victoria im sorryi have been selfish not thinking of the effect of my behavior on you you do deserve some kind of explanation she sat frowning to herself as if trying to decide what kind of explanation i deserved i dont know if i can make clear the relationships of that time in my life how i came to be so close to max and even carl there was a group of nine of us refugee children who became good friends during the war we met over music a woman from salzburg a violist who was herself a refugee came around london and gathered us up she saw carls gift got him lessons got him into a good music program there were various others teresz who eventually married max me my father had been a violin player café music not the stuff of the soirées frau herbst organized but skillfulat least i think he was skillful but how can i know when i only heard him as a child anyway even though i had no gift myself i loved hearing the music at frau herbsts was radbuka the name of one of that group why does carl care so much is it someone he was in love with she smiled painfully you would have to ask him that radbuka was the name ofsomeone else maxhe had great organizational skills even as a young man when the war ended he went around london to the different societies that helped people find out about their families then hewent back to central europe looking that was ini think it was in but after all this time i cant be sure of the exact year that was when the radbuka name came upit wasnt anyone in the groups actual surname you see but that is why we could ask max to look because we were all so close not like a family like something else perhaps a combat team who fought together for years for almost all of us maxs reports came back with devastating completeness no survivors for the herschels the tisovs the loewenthalsmax found his father and two cousins and that was another terrible she cut herself off midsentence i was starting my medical training it consumed me to the exclusion of so much else carl always blamed me forwell lets just say something unpleasant came up around the person from the radbuka family carl always thought my absorption with medicine made me behave in a fashion which he regarded as cruel as if his own devotion to music had not been equally absolute this last sentence she muttered under her breath as an afterthought she fell silent she had never spoken to me of her losses in such a way such an emotional way i didnt understand what she was trying to sayor not to sayabout the friend from the radbuka family but when it became clear she wouldnt expand on it i couldnt press her do you knowi hesitated trying to think of the least painful way of asking the questiondo you know what max learned about the radbuka family her face twisted theyhe didnt find any trace of them although traces were hard to find and he didnt have much money we all gave him a bit but we didnt have money either so hearing this man call himself radbuka must have been quite a shock she shuddered and looked at me it was believe me its been a shock all week how i envy carl able to put the whole world to one side when he starts to play or maybe its that he puts the whole world inside him and blows it out that tube she repeated the question shed asked when she saw paul on video how old is he do you think he says he came here after the war around the age of four so he must have been born in or so he couldnt bedoes he think he was born in theresienstadt i threw up my hands all i know about him is from wednesday nights interview is theresienstadt the same as what he calls terezin terezin is its czech name its an old fortress outside prague she added with an unexpected gleam of humor thats austrian snobbery using the german namea holdover from when prague was part of the hapsburg empire and everyone spoke german this man tonight hes insisting hes czech not german by calling it terezin we sat again in silence lotty was withdrawn into her own thoughts but she seemed more relaxed less tortured than she had for the past few days i told her id go up to see what i could learn from radbuka lotty nodded if i feel stronger ill come up by and by right nowi think ill just lie here i made sure she was wellcovered in the afghan max had provided before turning out the light when i closed the french doors behind me i could see across the hall into the front room where a dozen or so people still lingered over brandy michael loewenthal was on the piano bench holding agnes on his lap everyone was happy i went on up the stairs maxs study was a large room overlooking the lake filled with ming vases and tang horses it was at the far end of the second floor from where the children were watching videos max had picked the room when his own two children were small because it was wellsecluded from the body of the house when i shut the door no outside sounds could disrupt the tension inside morrell and don smiled at me but paul ulrichradbuka looked away in disappointment when he saw it was me not max or carl i dont understand whats happening he said pathetically are people ashamed to be seen with me i need to talk to max and carl i need to find out how were related im sure carl or max will want to know he has a surviving family member i squeezed my eyes shut as if that would block out his hyperemotional state try to relax mruh mr loewenthal will be with you as soon as he can leave his guests perhaps mr tisov as well can i get you a glass of wine or a soft drink he looked longingly at the door but apparently realized he couldnt find carl unaided he subsided into an armchair and muttered that he supposed a glass of water would help settle his nerves don jumped up to fetch it i decided the only way to get any information out of him would be to act as though i believed in his identity he was so unstable leaping up the scale from misery to ecstasy by octaves weaving straws in the conversation into clothes that i wasnt sure anything he said would be reliable but if i challenged him he would only retreat into a defensive weeping do you have any clue about where you were born i asked i gather radbuka is a czech name the birth certificate that was sent with me to terezin said berlin which is one reason im so eager to meet my relatives maybe the radbukas were czechs hiding in berlin some jews fled west instead of east trying to get away from the einsatzgruppen maybe they were czechs who had emigrated there before the war ever started oh how i wish i knew something he knotted his hands in anguish i picked my next words with care it must have been quite a shock to you to find that birth certificate when youruhfoster father died telling you that you were paul radbuka from berlin instead ofwhere did ulrich tell you you were born vienna but no ive never seen my terezin birth certificate i only read about it elsewhere once i realized who i was how cruel of ulrich to write about it but not leave you with the document itself i exclaimed no no i had to track it down in an outside report it waswas just by chance i found out about it at all what an extraordinary amount of research youve done i packed my voice with so much admiration that morrell frowned at me in warning but paul brightened perceptibly id love to see the report that told you about your birth certificate at that he stiffened so i hastily changed the subject you dont remember any czech i suppose if you were separated from your mother atwhat was ittwelve months he relaxed again when i hear czech i recognize it but dont really understand it the first language i spoke is german because that was the language of the guards also many of the women who worked in the nursery at terezin spoke it i heard the door open behind me and held a hand out in a signal to be quiet don slid past me to put a glass of water next to paul out of the corner of my eye i saw max quietly follow don into the room paul caught up in the pleasure of my attending to his story went on without paying attention to them there were six of us small children who more or less banded together and really we formed a little brigade even at the age of three we looked after one another because the adults were so overworked and so underfed they couldnt care for individual children we clung to one another and hid together from the guards when the war ended we were sent to england at first we were scared when the adults started putting us on trains because in terezin we saw many children put on trains and everyone knew they went someplace to die but after we got over our terror we had a happy time in england we were in a big house in the country it had a name like that of an animal a dog which was scary at first because we were terrified of dogs from having seen them used so evilly in the camps and thats where you learned english i prompted we learned english bit by bit the way children do and really we forgot our german after a time maybe it was nine months or even a year they started finding homes for us people wanting to adopt us they decided we were mentally recovered enough that we could stand the pain of losing one another although how can you ever stand that pain the loss of my special playmate my miriam it haunts my dreams to this day his voice broke he used the napkin don had put under the water glass to blow his nose one day this man arrived he was large and coarsefaced and said he was my father and i should go with him he wouldnt even let me kiss my little miriam goodbye kissing was weibischa sissy thingand i must be a man now he shouted to me in german and was furious that i didnt speak german anymore over and over as i was growing up he would beat me telling me he was making a man out of me beating the schwule und weiblichkeit out of me he was crying freely in obvious distress i handed him the glass of water that must have been very horrible max said gravely when did your father die he didnt seem to notice maxs sudden appearance in the conversation you mean i presume the man who is not my father i dont know when my birth father died that is what i am hoping you can tell me or perhaps carl tisov he blew his nose again and stared at us defiantly the man who stole me from my campmates died seven years ago it was after that when i started having nightmares and became depressed and disoriented i lost my job i lost my bearings my nightmares became more and more explicit i tried various remedies butalways i was being drawn to these unspeakable images of the past images i have come to recognize as my experience of the shoah not until i started working with rhea did i understand them for what they were i think i saw my mother being raped and pushed alive into a pit of lime but of course it could have been some other woman i was so little i cant even recall my mothers face did your foster father tell you what became ofwell his wife morrell put in he said the woman he called my mother had died when the allies bombed vienna that we had lived in vienna and lost everything because of the jews he was always very bitter about the jews do you have any idea why he tracked you down in england or how he knew you were there i was struggling to make sense of his narrative he spread his hands in a gesture of bewilderment after the wareverything was so unsettled anything was possible i think he wanted to come to america and claiming he was a jew which he could do if he had a jewish child in hand that would put him at the head of the queue especially if he had a nazi past he wanted to conceal and you think he did max asked i know so i know so from his papers that he was a vile piece of drek a leader of the einsatzgruppen what a horrible thing to uncover don murmured to be a jew and find youve grown up with the worst of the murderers of your people no wonder he treated you the way he did paul looked at him eagerly oh you do understand im sure that his bestial behaviorthe way he would beat me deprive me of food when he was angry lock me in a closet for hours sometimes overnightall that came from his terrible antisemitism you are a jew mr loewenthal you understand how ugly someone like that can be max sidestepped the remark ms warshawski says that you found a document in yourfoster fatherspapers that gave you the clue to your real name im curious about that would you let me see it ulrichradbuka took his time to answer when you tell me which one of you is related to me then perhaps i will let you see the papers but since you will not help me i see no reason why i should show you my private documents neither mr tisov nor i is connected to the radbuka family max said please try to accept that it is a different friend of ours who knew a family with your name but i know as much as that person does about the radbuka familywhich im sorry to say isnt a great deal if you could let me see these documents it would help me decide if you are part of the same family when radbuka refused in a panicky voice i intervened to ask if he had any idea where his birth parents came from apparently taking the question as agreement to his radbuka identity paul recounted what he knew with a return of his childlike eagerness i know nothing whatsoever about my birth parents some of our six musketeers knew more although that can be painful too my little miriam for instance poor soul she knew her mother had gone mad and died in the mental hospital at terezin but nowmax you say you know the details of my family life who of the radbukas would be in berlin in no one max said with finality no brothers nor parents i can assure you of that this is a family which emigrated to vienna in the years before the first world war in they were sent to lodz in poland the ones who were still alive in were sent on to the camp where they all perished paul ulrichradbukas face lit up but perhaps i was born in lodz i thought you knew youd been born in berlin i blurted out there are so few reliable documents from those times he said perhaps they gave me the paper of a boy who died in the camp anything like that is possible talking to him was like walking in the marshes just when you thought you had a fact to stand on the ground gave way max looked at him gravely none of the radbukas in vienna had special standing they werent important socially or artistically as was typically true of people who were sent to theresiento terezin of course there were always exceptions but i doubt you will find them in this case so youre trying to tell me my family doesnt exist but i can see its just that youre hiding them from me i demand to see them in person i know they will claim me when they meet me one easy solution to the problem is a dna test i suggested max carl and their english friend could give blood we could agree on a lab in england or the us and send a sample of mrmr radbukas blood there as well that would resolve the question of whether hes related to any of you or to maxs english friend i am not uncertain paul exclaimed his face pink you may be youre a detective who makes a living by being suspicious but i will not submit to being treated like a laboratory specimen the way my people were in that medical laboratory at auschwitz the way my little miriams mother was treated looking at blood samples is what the nazis cared about heredity race all those things i wont take part in it that brings us back to where we started i said with a document that you alone know about and no way for suspicious detectives like me to verify your certainty by the way who is sofie radbuka paul turned sulky she was on the web someone in a missingpersons chat room said they wanted information about a sofie radbuka who lived in england in the forties so i wrote saying she must be my mother and the person never wrote back right now were all exhausted max said mr radbuka why dont you write down everything you know about your family i will get my friend to do the same you can give me your document and i will give you the other one then we can meet again to compare notes radbuka sat with his lower lip sticking out not even looking up to acknowledge the suggestion when morrell with a grimace at the clock said hed drive him home radbuka refused at first to get up max looked at him sternly you must leave now mr radbuka unless you wish to create a situation in which you would never be able to return here his clown face a tragic mask radbuka got to his feet with morrell and don again at his elbows like wardens in a highclass mental hospital he shambled sullenly to the door xviii old lovers downstairs the party was over the waitstaff was cleaning up the remains vacuuming food from the carpets and washing up the last of the dishes in the living room carl and michael were debating the tempo in a brahms nonet playing passages on the grand piano while agnes loewenthal watched from a couch with her legs curled under her she looked up when i glanced in the doorway hurriedly untangling her feet to run over to me before i could follow morrell and don outside vic who is that extraordinary man carl has been beside himself over this intrusion he went into the sunroom and shouted at lotty about it until michael stopped him what is going on i shook my head i honestly dont know this guy thinks he spent his childhood in the camps he says he only recently discovered his birth name was radbuka so he came here hoping max or carl was related to him because he thought that one of their friends in england had family of that name but that doesnt make sense agnes cried max came down the stairs behind us his gait heavy with extreme weariness so hes gone is he victoria no it doesnt make sense nothing tonight made much sense lotty fainting ive watched her take bullets out of people without flinching what did you think of this creature victoria do you believe his story its an extraordinary tale i was so tired myself that i was seeing sparks in front of my eyes i dont know what i think hes so volatile moving from tears to triumphal glee and back in thirty seconds and every time he gets a new piece of information he changes his story where was he born in lodz berlin vienna im staggered that rhea wiell would hypnotize someone that unstableid think it would demolish his fragile connection to reality butall these symptoms could be caused by exactly what he says happened to him an infancy spent in terezini dont know how youd recover from that in the living room michael and carl were playing the same passage on the piano over and over with variations in tempo and tone that were too subtle for me the repetition began grating on me the door to the sunroom opened and lotty came into the hall pale but composed sorry max she murmured sorry to leave you alone to deal with him but i couldnt face him nor could carl apparentlyhe came in to castigate me for refusing to join you upstairs now i gather carl has returned to the world of music leaving this one in our possession lotty max held up a hand if you and carl want to keep fighting take it someplace else neither of you had anything to contribute to what was going on upstairs but one thing i would like to know the doorbell interrupted himmorrell returning with don he must live close by i said you were hardly gone a minute morrell came over to me he asked to be dropped at a place where he could get a cab which frankly i was happy to do a little of the guy goes far with me so i left him in front of the orrington where theres a taxi stand did you get his address morrell shook his head i asked when we got into the car but he announced he would go home by cab i tried asking for it too don said because of course i want to interview him but hed decided we were an untrustworthy bunch ah nuts i said now im back to square one with finding him unless i can track the cab did he say anything upstairs lotty asked anything about how he came to think his name was radbuka i leaned against morrell swaying with fatigue just more mumbo jumbo about these mystery documents of his father foster father and how they proved ulrich was part of the einsatzgruppen whats that agnes asked her blue eyes troubled special forces that committed special atrocities in eastern europe during the war max said tersely lotty since youre feeling better i would like some information from you now who is sofie radbuka i think you might explain to me and to vic here why it had such an effect on you i told vic lotty said i told her the radbukas were one of the families that you inquired about for our group of friends in london id been about to suggest to morrell that we go home but i wanted to hear what lotty would say to max could we sit down i asked max im dead on my feet victoria of course max ushered us into the living room where carl and michael were still fiddling with their music michael looked over at us he told carl they could finish the discussion on the way to los angeles and came over to sit next to agnes i pictured michael with his cello stuck between his legs in an airplane seat bowing the same twelve measures over and over while carl played them on his clarinet at a different pace you havent eaten have you morrell said to me let me try to rustle you up a snackyoull feel better you didnt get dinner max exclaimed all this upheaval is erasing ordinary courtesy from my mind he sent one of the waiters to the kitchen for a tray of leftovers and drinks now lotty its your turn on the hot seat ive respected your privacy all these years and i will continue to do so but you need to explain to us why the name sofie radbuka rattled you so badly this evening i know i looked for radbukas for you in vienna after the war who were they it wasnt the name lotty said it was the whole aspect of that she broke off biting her lip like a schoolgirl when she saw max gravely shake his head itit was someone at the hospital lotty muttered looking at the carpet at the royal free who didnt want their name public so that was it carl said with a venom that startled all of us i knew it at the time i knew it and you denied it lotty flushed a wave of crimson almost as dark as her jacket you made such stupid accusations that i didnt think you deserved an answer about what agnes asked as bewildered as i was carl said you must have realized by now that lotty and i were lovers for some years in london i thought it would be forever but thats because i didnt know lotty had married medicine unlike you and music lotty snapped right i said leaning over to serve myself scalloped potatoes and salmon from the tray the waiter had brought you both had strong senses of vocation neither of you would budge then what happened then lotty developed tb or so she said carl bit off the words he turned back to lotty you never told me you were ill you never said goodbye i got your letterletter a notice in the times would have told me morewhen i returned from edinburgh there it was that cold cryptic note i ran across town that imbecile landlady in your lodgingsi can still see her face with the horrible mole on her nose and all the hairs sticking out of itshe told me she was smirking from her i learned you were in the country from her i learned youd instructed her to forward all your mail to claire tallmadge the ice queen not from you i loved you i thought you loved me but you couldnt even tell me goodbye he stopped panting then added bitterly to this day i do not understand why you let that tallmadge woman run you around the way she did he said to lotty she was soso supercilious you were her little jewish pet couldnt you ever see how she looked down on you and the rest of that family the vapid sister vanessa and her insufferable husband what was his name marmalade marmaduke lotty said as you know quite well carl besides you resented anyone i paid more attention to than you my god you two max said you should join calia up in the nursery could we get to the point besides lotty said flushing again at maxs criticism when i returned to the royal free claireclaire felt her friendship with me was inappropriate shei didnt even know she retired until i saw it in the royal free newsletter this spring what did the radbukas have to do with this don asked i went to see queen claire carl snarled she told me she was forwarding lottys mail to a receiving office in axmouth in care of someone named sofie radbuka but when i wrote my mail was returned to me with a note scribbled on the envelope that there was no one there by that name i even took a train out from london one monday and walked three miles through the countryside to this cottage there were lights on inside lotty but you wouldnt answer the door i stayed there all afternoon but you never came out six months went by and suddenly lotty was back in london with no word to me no response to my letters no explanation as if our life together had never taken place who was sofie radbuka lotty your lover did the two of you sit in there all afternoon laughing at me lotty was leaning back in an armchair her eyes shut the lines in her face sharply drawn so might she look dead the thought made me clutch at my stomach sofie radbuka no longer existed so i borrowed her name she said in the thread of a voice not opening her eyes it seems stupid now but we all did unaccountable things in those days the only mail i accepted was from the hospitaleverything else i sent back unread just as i did your letters i had a mortal condition i needed to be alone while i coped with it i loved you carl but no one could reach me in the alone place i was not you not max no one when irecoveredi had no capacity for talking to you itthe only thing i knew to do was draw a line youyou never seemed inconsolable to me max went to sit next to her taking her hand but carl got up to pace furiously about the room oh yes i had lovers he spat over his shoulder lovers aplenty that i wanted you to know about but it was many years before i fell in love again and by then i was out of practice i couldnt make it last three marriages in forty years and how many mistresses in between im a byword among women in orchestras dont blame me for that lotty said coldly sitting up you can choose how to act i dont bear responsibility for that yes you can choose to be remote as ever poor loewenthal he wants you to marry him and cant figure out why you wont he doesnt realize youre made of scalpels and ligatures not heart and muscle carl i can manage my own business max said half laughing half exasperated but returning to the present if i may if the radbukas are gone how exactly did this man tonight get the name in the first place yes lotty agreed thats why i was so startled to hear it do you have any sense of how to find that out victoria max asked i yawned ferociously i dont know i dont know how to get him to let me see these mystery documents the other end of the investigation would be his past i dont know what kind of immigration records might survive from or when he would have come into this country if he really was even an immigrant he is at least a speaker of german lotty said unexpectedly when he first arrived i wondered if any of his story was trueyou know on the tape he claimed to have come here as a small child speaking german so i asked him in german if he was brought up on the myth of the ulrichs as wolflike warriors he clearly understood me i tried to remember the sequence of remarks in the hall but i couldnt quite get everything straight thats when he said he wouldnt speak the language of his slavery isnt it another yawn engulfed me no more tonight carl michael the concert today was brilliant i hope the rest of the tour goes as wellthat this disturbance in the field doesnt affect your music are you going on with them i added to agnes she shook her head the tour goes on for four more weeks calia and i will stay with max another five days then return directly to england she should be in kindergarten right now but we wanted her to have this time with her opa by which time i will also know the story of ninshubur the faithful hound by heart max smiled although his eyes remained grave morrell took me by the hand we stumbled out to his car together while don trailed behind us getting in a few lungfuls of nicotine an evanston patrol car was inspecting morrells car stickers the town makes money by having capricious parking regulations morrell was outside his own parking zone but we got into the car before the man actually wrote a ticket i slumped against the front seat ive never been around so much emotion for so many hours exhausting morrell agreed i dont think this man paul is a fraud do you not in the sense that hes deliberately trying to con us i murmured my eyes shut he sincerely believes what hes saying but hes alarming he believes a new thing at the drop of a hat its a hell of a story one way or another don said i wonder if i should go to england to check up on the radbuka family that gets you kind of far from your book with rhea wiell i said and as morrell advised me yesterday is it really necessary to go sleuthing after lottys past only insofar as it seems to have invaded the present don answered i thought she was lying didnt you about it being someone at the royal free i mean i thought she was making it clear it was her business not ours i said sharply as morrell pulled into the alley behind his building that history between lotty and carl i shivered as i followed morrell down the hall to the bedroom lottys pain carls too but lotty feeling so alone she couldnt tell her lover she was dying i cant bear it tomorrows my last day here morrell complained i have to pack and i have to spend the day again with state department officials instead of with you my darling as i would prefer i could have done with less trauma tonight and more sleep i flung my clothes onto a chair but morrell hung his suit tidily in the closet he did at least leave his weekend bag to unpack in the morning youre a little like lotty vic morrell held me in the dark if something goes amiss with you dont creep away to a cottage under a fake name to lick your wounds alone they were a comfort those words with his departure so close with the turbulence of the last few hours still shaking me they spread around me in the dark those words calming me into sleep lotty herschels story ve day i took hugo to piccadilly circus for the ve day celebrations masses of people fireworks a speech by the king broadcast over loudspeakersthe crowd was euphoric i shared some of the feelingalthough for me complete euphoria was impossible it wasnt just because of the newsreels of belsen and other camps that had sickened the english that spring stories of death had been floating in from europe with the immigrant community for some time even minna had been furious over some of the mps callous response to the men who had escaped from auschwitz when it was first being built i would get impatient with hugo because he couldnt remember oma and opa or even mama very clearly he hardly remembered any german whereas i had to hang on to the language because thats what cousin minna spoke at home in she had married victor a horrid old man who she was sure was going to inherit the glove factory he had a stroke before the owner died and it went to someone else so there she was stuck with an elderly sick husband and no money but he was from hamburg so of course they spoke german to each other it took me longer than hugo to learn english longer to fit in at school longer to feel at home in england for hugo coming to england at five life began with the nussbaum family they treated him like a son in fact mr nussbaum wanted to adopt hugo but that upset me so much that the nussbaums dropped the idea i see things differently now see hugos turning to them trusting them as the natural state of a fiveyearold not an abandonment of my parentsand of me probably if id lived with someone who cherished me my reaction to the idea would have been differentalthough mr nussbaum was always very kind to me and tried to include me in his regular sunday outings with my brother but i was especially angry with hugo on ve day because he thought the end of the war meant he would have to return to austria he didnt want to leave the nussbaums or his friends at school and he was hoping i would explain to mama and papa that he would only come for the summers i realize now my anger was partly fueled by my own anxieties i longed for the loving family id lost longed to put cousin minna and her constant criticism behind me but i too had friends and a school that i didnt want to leave i was turning sixteen with two years to work toward my higherschool certificate i could see that it would be as hard to return to austria as it had been to come to england six years earlierharder since the ruin of war might make it impossible for me to finish school there miss skeffing the headmistress at the camden high school for girls was on the board at the royal free hospital she had encouraged me to do the science course that would prepare me for medicalschool entrance i didnt want to leave her or the chance to read medicine although i saw very little of claire these days since she was starting her junior houseman rotation i didnt want to leave her either after all it was claires example that made me stand up to cousin minna and insist on applying to the camden school minna was furiousshe wanted me to leave school at fourteen to help make money in the glove factory but i reminded her that since she wouldnt recommend my father for a job in she had a nerve expecting me to quit school to take one now she and victor also tried to put a stop to my going to meet friends for miss herbsts music evenings during the war years those evenings were a lifesaver even for someone like me with no musical ability there was always something to dowe staged operas held impromptu glees even during the blitz when you found your way around london by guess i would slam out of minnas house and move through the black streets to miss herbsts flat sometimes id go by bus that was an adventure because the buses had to obey the blackout so you wouldnt know one was coming until it was almost on top of you and then youd have to guess where to get off once on the way home i guessed wrong and landed miles away from minnas a street warden found me and let me spend the night in their shelter it was great fun drinking watery cocoa with the wardens while they talked over football scores but my little adventure left minna more sour than ever much as we were worried about our families none of usnot just me or hugo but no one in that group at miss herbstswanted to resume life in german we saw it as the language of humiliation germany or austria or czechoslovakia were the places where wed seen our beloved grandparents forced to scrub the paving stones on their hands and knees while crowds stood around jeering and throwing things at them we even changed the spelling of our names i turned lotte into lotty carl used a c instead of the k hed been born with on ve night after the kings speech i put hugo on the tube back to golders green where the nussbaums lived and met up with max and some of the others in covent garden to wait for carl whod gotten a job with the sadlers wells orchestra which was playing that night thousands of people were in covent garden the one place in london you could get a drink in the middle of the night someone was passing bottles of champagne through the crowd max and the rest of our group put our personal worries to one side and became riotous with the other revelers no more bombs no more blackouts no more minuscule bits of butter once a weekalthough of course that was ignorant optimism rationing went on for years carl eventually found us sitting on an overturned barrow in st martin s lane the owner who sold fruit was a little drunk he was carving apples carefully into slices and feeding them to me and another girl in our group who later became utterly suburban bred corgis and voted conservative at the time she was the most sophisticated of our set wearing lipstick dating american servicemen and getting nylons for her pains while i darned my cotton stockings feeling like a dowdy schoolgirl next to her carl bowed grandly to the barrow owner and took a slice of apple out of the mans hand i will feed miss herschel he said and held the piece of apple out to me i suddenly became aware of his fingers as if they were actually touching my body i put my hand around his wrist to guide the apple to my mouth xix case closed the dreams woke me in the grey light of predawn nightmares of lotty lost my mother dying faceless figures chasing me through tunnels while paul radbuka watched alternating between weeping and manic laughter i lay sweating my heart pounding next to me morrell slept his breath coming out in soft little snorts like a horse clearing its nose i moved into the shelter of his arms he clung to me in sleep for a few minutes then rolled over without waking by and by my heart rate returned to normal but despite yesterdays fatigues i couldnt get back to sleep all of last nights tormented confessions churned in my head like clothes pounding in a washing machine paul radbukas emotions were so slippery so intense that i couldnt figure out how to respond to him lotty and carls history was just as overwhelming it didnt surprise me to hear that max wanted to marry lotty although neither of them had ever mentioned it around me i seized on the small problem instead of the large wondering if lotty was so used to her solitary life that she preferred to be on her own morrell and i had talked about living together but even though wed both been married in our younger days we couldnt quite agree on giving up our privacy for lotty whod always lived on her own it would be an even harder move it was clear that lotty was hiding something about the radbuka family but i had no way of knowing what it wasnt her mothers familyshed been startled by that suggestion almost affronted perhaps some poor immigrant family whose fate had mattered terribly to her people have unexpected sources of shame and guilt but i couldnt imagine something that would shock me so much it would make me turn against her something she wouldnt even tell max what if sofie radbuka had been a patient whose care she had bungled during her medical training sofie radbuka had died or was in a vegetative coma lotty blamed herself and pretended to have tuberculosis so she could go to the country to recuperate shed taken radbukas name in some kind of guilt storm that had her overidentifying with the patient aside from the fact that it contradicted everything i knew about lotty it still wouldnt turn me from her the notion that shed pretended to have tb so she could go to the country and carry on an affair with a sofie radbukaor anyonewas ludicrous she could have had an affair in london without jeopardizing a training program that women in the forties entered only with great difficulty it unnerved me to see lotty teetering on the edge of collapse i tried to recite morrells good advice that i should not sleuth after her that if she didnt want to tell me her secrets it was her demons not my failure that made her keep them to herself i should stick to my business anyway to exploring the kind of financial shenanigan that isaiah sommers had hired me to untangle not that id done much about that situation either other than get him to stir up bull durham to denounce me in public it was only fiveforty i could do one little thing for isaiah sommers which morrell would holler about if he knew i sat up morrell sighed but didnt move pulling on the jeans and sweatshirt out of my overnight bag i tiptoed out of the room with my running shoes morrell had absconded with my cell phone and picklocks i went back to the room for his backpack which i took to his study with mei didnt want the clanking of keys to wake him i left a note on his laptop gone to the city for an early appointment see you tonight for supper love v morrells place was only six blocks from the davis l stop i walked across in company with other early commuters joggers people out with their dogs amazing how many people were on the streets and how many looked fresh and fit the sight of my own redstained eyes in the bathroom mirror had made me flinchthe madwoman of chaillot let loose upon the town the express trains for the morning rush were running in twenty minutes i was at my own stop belmont a few blocks from my apartment my car was out front but i needed to shower and change so that i looked less like the ghost of my own nightmares i crept in quietly hoping the dogs wouldnt recognize my step trouser suit crepesoled shoes peppy gave a sharp bark as i tiptoed back outside but i didnt slow down i stopped at a coffee bar on my way to lake shore drive for a large orange juice and an even larger cappuccino it was almost seven now the morning commute had begun in earnest but i still made it to hyde park before seventhirty i gave a perfunctory nod to the guard at the entrance to the hyde park bank building it wasnt the same man fepple had warned against me on friday this man gave me a cursory glance over his newspaper but didnt challenge me i was professionally dressed i knew where i was going to the sixth floor where i pulled on latex gloves to start work on fepples locks i was so tense listening for the elevator that it took me a moment to realize the locks were already open i slipped into the office snarling as i tripped once more on the torn corner of linoleum fepple was behind his desk in the pale light coming through the window i thought hed fallen asleep in his chair i hesitated at the door then decided to put a bold face on it wake him force him to hand over the sommers file i switched on the overhead light and saw that fepple would never speak to anyone again his mouth was missing the side of his head the carpet of freckled skin nothing left of them but a smear of bone and brain and blood i sat abruptly on the floor head between my knees even with my nose muffled i thought i could smell blood my gorge rose i willed my mind to other matters i couldnt add my vomit to the crime scene i dont know how long i sat like that until voices in the hall made me realize how precarious my position was in an office with a dead man with picklocks in my pocket and latex gloves on my hands i stood up so fast that my head swam again but i shook off the faintness and turned the dead bolt to lock myself in trying to make it a clinical exercise i edged around the desk to look at fepple a gun had fallen to the floor just below where his right arm dangled i squinted at it a twentytwo sig trailside so he had shot himself because whatever hed seen in the sommers file had unbalanced his mind his computer was still on in a suspend state suppressing my nausea i gingerly stretched an arm past his left side using a picklock to bring up the screen so that i wouldnt disturb any evidence a block of text came back to life when my father died this was a flourishing agency but i am a failure as an agent i have watched my sales and profits go in a downward spiral for five years i thought i could cheat my way out of debt but now that the detective is watching me im afraid i would be a failure even at that ive never married ive never known how to attract women i cant face myself any longer i dont know how to pay my bills if anyone cares perhaps my mother im sorry howard i printed it out and stuffed the paper in my pocket my hands inside their latex gloves were wet black spots swam around my eyes i was very aware of fepples shattered head next to me but i couldnt look at it i wanted to leave the obscene mess but i might not get another chance to find the sommers file the cabinets were open which surprised me when i was here last week fepple had made quite a point of unlocking them when he wanted to put the papers away then promptly locking them again the third drawer the one where hed stuck the sommers file was labeled rick hoffmans clients the files were jammed into the drawer some upside down none in any kind of order when i pulled out the first file barney williams i thought i was at the end of the alphabet but it was followed by larry jenks with an uneasy eye on the clock i emptied the drawer and replaced the folders one at a time the sommers file wasnt there i flipped through the folders looking for anything that related to sommers there wasnt anything in them but copies of policies and payment schedules about threequarters of them were closed cases where the policy was stamped paid with the date or lapsed for nonpayment with the date i looked in the other drawers but found nothing i took a half dozen of the paid policies i could get mary louise to check on whether theyd been paid to the beneficiary i listened uneasily to voices coming from the hall but i couldnt leave until id looked for the sommers papers in the mess on the desk the papers were flecked with bits of blood and brain i didnt want to disturb theman experienced tech could tell in a flash that someone had been searchingbut i wanted that file bracing myself keeping my eyes shielded willing myself to believe there was nothing in the chair i leaned over the desk pulling back the edges of the documents in front of fepple i worked my way outward from the middle in a circle when i found nothing i moved around to fepples side of the desk trying not to step in anything and looked in the desk drawers nothing but signs of his dismal life halfeaten bags of chips an unopened box of condoms covered in cracker crumbs diaries dating back to the s when his father was booking appointments books on how to improve your tabletennis game who would have thought he had enough sticktoitiveness to pursue a sport it was nine now the longer i stayed the more likely it was that someone would come in on me i went to the door standing to the left of the frame so i couldnt be seen through the glass listening for sounds from the hall a group of women was passing laughing about something wishing each other a good morning how was the weekend heavy workload this morning in dr zabars office how was melissas birthday party silence then the elevator bell and a pair of women with an infant when they had gone i slid the door open a crack the hall was empty as i went out i saw fepples briefcase in the corner behind me on an impulse i picked it up while i waited for the elevator i stuffed the latex gloves into the case along with the files i was borrowing i hoped i didnt have anything on me to link me to the crime scene but when i got off the elevator at the bottom i saw my shoe had left a nasty brownish smear on the car floor i somehow managed to walk out the door with my head up but as soon as i was out of the guards sight lines i skittered around the corner barely making it to the alley before throwing up my orange juice and coffee xx hunter in the middle back home i scrubbed my shoes obsessively but all the perfumes of dow chemical wouldnt wipe them clean i couldnt afford to throw them out but i didnt think i could bear to wear them again either i took off the suit inspecting every inch under a strong light there didnt seem to be anything of fepple on the fabric but i bundled it up for the dry cleaner anyway i had stopped at a pay phone on lake shore drive to call in the news of a dead body in the hyde park bank building by now the police machinery should be in motion i walked restlessly to the kitchen door and back i could call one of my old friends on the force for an inside report on the investigation but then id have to reveal that id found the body which would mean id spend the day answering questions i tried calling morrell hoping for comfort but hed already left for his meeting at the state department i wondered what fepple had done with my business card i hadnt seen it on his desk but i wasnt looking for anything that small the cops would come after me if they figured out i was the detective mentioned in fepples suicide note if it was a suicide note of course it was the gun had fallen from his hand to the floor underneath after he shot himself he felt like a failure and couldnt face himself any longer so he shot away the lower half of his face i stopped at the kitchen window to stare at the dogs which mr contreras had let into the garden i should take them for a run as if catching my gaze mitch looked up at me and grinned wolfishly that nasty little smile of fepples when hed read the sommers file when he said he was going to take over rick hoffmans client list that was the smile of someone who thought he could capitalize on another persons weakness not the smile of a man who hated himself so much he was going to commit suicide this morning hed been in the same suit and tie hed worn on friday who had he dressed up for a woman as he had implied someone he tried to romance but who told him horrible things about himself so horrible that he came back to the office and committed suicide or had he dressed for the person whod called him when he was talking to me the person who told him how to ditch me go to a pay phone await further instructions fepple cut through the little shopping center where his mystery caller picked him up fepple figured he could cash in on some secret hed seen in the sommers file he tried to blackmail his mystery caller who told fepple they needed to talk privately in his officewhere he shot fepple staging it to look like suicide very edgar wallace in either case the mystery caller had taken the sommers file i moved restlessly back to the living room more likely fepple had left the file on his bedside table along with old copies of tabletennis tips i wished i knew what the police were doing whether they were accepting the suicide whether they were testing for gunpowder residue on fepples hands finally for want of something better to do i went down to the yard to collect the dogs mr contreras had his back door open when i went up the half flight of stairs to tell him i was going to take the dogs with me for a run and then to my office i could hear the radio our top local story the body of insurance agent howard fepple was found in his hyde park office this morning following an anonymous tip to police the fortythreeyearold fepple apparently killed himself because the midway insurance agency started by his grandfather in was on the brink of bankruptcy his mother rhonda with whom he lived was stunned by the news howie didnt even own a gun how can the police go around saying he shot himself with a gun he didnt have hyde park is real dangerous i kept telling him to move the agency out here to palos where people actually want to buy insurance i think someone broke in and murdered him and dressed it up to look like he killed himself area four police say they will not rule out the possibility of murder but until the autopsy report is complete they are treating fepples death as a suicide this is mark santoros global news chicago aint that something cookie mr contreras looked up from the suntimes where he was circling racing results guy shooting himself just because he come on hard times no stamina these young fellas i muttered a weak agreementultimately i would tell him that id found fepple but that would be a long conversation which i didnt feel up to holding today i drove the dogs over to the lake where we ran up to montrose harbor and back sleep deprivation made my sinuses ache but the threemile run loosened my tight muscles i took the dogs with me down to the office where they raced around sniffing and barking as if they had never been inside the place before tessa yelled out at me from her studio to get them under control at once before she took a sculpting mallet to them when i had them corralled inside my own place i sat at my desk for a long while without actually moving when i was little my granny warshawski had a wooden toy shed get out for me when we went to visit a hunter was in the middle with a bear on one side and a wolf on the other when you pushed the button once the hunter swung around to point his rifle at the wolf while the bear jumped up to threaten him if you pushed it again he turned to the bear while the wolf jumped up sommers lotty lotty sommers it was as if i were the hunter in the middle who kept swerving between the two images i couldnt keep track of either ones problem long enough to focus on it before the other popped up again finally wearily i switched on my computer sofie radbuka paul had found her in a chat room on the web while i was searching rhea wiell called ms warshawski what did you do to paul last night he was waiting outside my office this morning when i got in weeping saying you had ridiculed him and kept him from his family maybe you could hypnotize him and get him to recover a memory of the truth i said if you imagine that is funny you have such a perverse sense of humor i would believe anything of you the vestal virgin had turned so icy her voice could have put out the sacred fire ms wiell didnt we agree on as much privacy for mr loewenthal as you demanded for paul radbuka but paul tracked max loewenthal down in his home did he think of that all by himself she was human enough to be embarrassed and answered more quietly i didnt give him max loewenthals name paul unfortunately saw it himself in my desk file when i said you might know one of his relatives he put two and two together hes very quick but that doesnt mean he should have been subjected to taunting she added trying to regain the upper hand paul barged in on a private party and unnerved everyone by making up three different versions of his life story in as many minutes i knew i shouldnt lose my temper but i couldnt keep myself from snapping hes dangerously unstable ive been wanting to ask why you found him a good candidate for hypnotherapy you didnt tell me you had special clinical skills when we met on friday wiell said in a honeyed voice even more irritating than her icy fury i didnt know you could evaluate whether someone was a good candidate for hypnosis do you think he was dangerously unstable because he threatened the peace of mind of people who are embarrassed to claim a relationship with him this morning paul told me that they all know who sofie radbuka was but that they refused to tell him and that you goaded them on to me this is heartless i took a deep breath trying to tamp down my annoyancei needed her help which would never be forthcoming if i kept her pissed off at me fifty years ago mr loewenthal looked for a radbuka family who had lived in vienna before the war he didnt know the family personally they were acquaintances of dr herschels mr loewenthal undertook to search for any trace of them when he went back to central europe in or to hunt for his own family mitch gave a short bark and ran to the door mary louise came in calling out to me about fepple i waved to her but kept my attention on the phone when paul said he was born in berlin mr loewenthal said that made it extremely unlikely that paul was related to the radbukas hed looked for all those years back so paul instantly offered two alternative possibilitiesthat hed been born in vienna or even in the lodz ghetto where the viennese radbukas had been sent in we allmr loewenthal me and a humanrights advocate named morrellthought that if we could see the documents paul found in his fathersfoster fatherspapers after his death we could work out whether there was any possibility of a relationship we also suggested dna testing paul rejected both suggestions with equal vehemence wiell paused then said paul says you tried to keep him out of the house then you brought in a group of children to taunt him by calling him names i tried not to screech into the mouthpiece four little ones came pelting downstairs caught sight of your patient and began yelling that he was the big bad wolf believe me every adult within a twentyfoot radius moved rapidly to break that up but it upset paulit would unnerve anyone to have a group of strange kids mock him but i gather it awoke unpleasant associations in pauls mind to his fatherfoster father ms wiell could you persuade paul to let me or mr loewenthal look at these documents he found in his fathers papers how else can we trace the connection paul is making between himself and mr loewenthal ill consider it she said majestically but after last nights debacle i dont trust you to consider the best interests of my patient i made the rudest face i could muster but kept my voice light i wouldnt deliberately do anything that might harm paul radbuka it would be a big help if mr loewenthal could see these documents since hes the person with the most knowledge of the history of his friends families when she hung up with a tepid response to think about it i let out a loud raspberry mary louise looked at me eagerly was that rhea wiell whats she like in person i blinked trying to remember back to friday warm intense very convinced of her own powers she was human enough to be excited by dons book proposal vic mary louises face turned pink she is an outstanding therapist dont go attacking her if shes a little aggressive in believing her own point of viewwell shes had to stand up to a lot of public abuse besides she added shrewdly youre that way yourself thats probably why you two rub each other the wrong way i curled my lip at least paul radbuka shares your view says she saved his life which makes me wonder what kind of shape he was in before she fixed him ive never been around anyone that frighteningly wobbly i gave her a thumbnail sketch of radbukas behavior at maxs last night but i didnt feel like adding lotty and carls part of the story mary louise frowned over my report but insisted rhea would have had a good reason for hypnotizing him if he was so depressed that he couldnt leave his apartment this at least is a step forward stalking max loewenthal and claiming to be his cousin is a step forward toward what a bed in a locked ward sorry i added hastily as mary louise huffily turned her back on me she clearly has his best interests close at heart we were all rather daunted by his showing up uninvited at maxs last night thats all all right she hunched a shoulder but turned back to me with a determined smile changing the subject to ask what i knew about fepples death i told her about finding the body after wasting time lecturing me on breaking into the office she agreed to call her old superior in the department to find out how the police were treating the case her criticism reminded me that id stuffed some of rick hoffmans other old files into fepples briefcase which id dumped into the trunk and forgotten mary louise said she supposed she could check up on the beneficiaries to see whether theyd been properly paid by the company as long as she didnt have to answer any questions about where shed gotten their names mary louise youre not cut out for this work i told her when id brought fepples canvas case in from my car youre used to the cops where people are so nervous over your power to arrest that they answer your questions without you needing any finesse id think you could find finesse without lying she grumbled taking the files from me oh gross v i did you have to spill your breakfast on them one of the folders had a smear of jelly on it which was now on my hands as well when i looked deeper into the bag i saw the remains of a jelly donut mushed up with the papers and other detritus it was gross i washed my hands put on latex gloves and emptied the case onto a piece of newspaper mitch and peppy were extremely interested especially in the donut so i lifted the newspaper onto a credenza mary louises interest was caught she put on her own pair of gloves to help me sort through the rubble it wasnt a very appetizingor informativehaul an athletic supporter so grey and misshapen it was hard to recognize jumbled in with company reports and pingpong balls the jelly donut another open box of crackers mouthwash you know its interesting that theres no diary either in here or on his desk i said when wed been through everything maybe he had so few appointments he didnt bother with a diary or maybe the guy he was seeing friday night took the diary so no one would see fepple had an appointment with him he took that when he grabbed the sommers file i wondered if wiping the jelly out of the interior of the case would destroy vital clues but i couldnt bring myself to dump the contents back into the mess mary louise pretended to be excited when i went to the bathroom for a sponge gosh vic if you can clean out a briefcase maybe you can learn to put papers into file jackets lets see first you get a bucket of water rightoh my whats this the jelly had glued a thin piece of paper to one side of the case i had almost pulped it running the sponge over the interior now i took the case over to a desk lamp so i could see what i was doing i turned the case inside out and carefully peeled the page off the side it was a ledger sheet with what looked like a list of names and numbers in a thin archaic scriptwhich had bloomed like little flowers in the places it was wet jelly mixed with water had made the top left part of the page unreadable but what we could make out looked like this this is why its such a mistake to be a housecleaning freak i said severely weve lost part of the document what is it mary louise leaned over the desk to see it that isnt howard fepples handwriting is it this script its so beautiful its like engravingi dont see him doing it anyway the paper looks old it had gilt edging around the lower right which had escaped damage the paper had turned brown with age the ink itself was fading from black to green i cant make out the names mary louise said they are names dont you think followed by a bunch of numbers what are the numbers they cant be datestheyre too weird but it cant be money either they could be dates if they were written european stylethats how my mother did itday first followed by month if thats the case this is a sequence of six weeks from june to august in an unknown year i wonder if we could read the names if we enlarged them lets lay this on the copier where the heat will dry it faster while mary louise took care of that i looked through every page of the company reports in fepples bag hoping to find another sheet from the ledger but this was the only one xxi stalker in the park mary louise started work on the files id pulled out of rick hoffmans drawer i turned back to my computer id forgotten the search id entered for sofie or sophie radbuka but the computer was patiently waiting with two hits an invitation from an online vendor to buy books about radbuka and a bulletin board for messages at a familysearch site fifteen months earlier someone using the label questing scorpio had posted a query i am looking for information about sofie radbuka who lived in the united kingdom in the s underneath it was paul radbukas answer entered about two months ago and filling pages of screen dear questing scorpio words can hardly express the excitement i felt when i discovered your message it was as if someone had turned on a light in a blackedout cellar telling me that i am here i exist i am not a fool or a madman but a person whose name and identity were kept from him for fifty years at the end of the second world war i was brought from england to america by a man claiming to be my father but in reality he was a committer of the most vile atrocities during the war he hid my jewish identity from me and from the world yet made use of it to smuggle himself past the american immigration authorities he went on to describe the recovery of his memory with rhea wiell going into great detail including dreams in which he was speaking yiddish fragments of memories of his mother singing a lullaby to him before he was old enough to walk details of his foster fathers abuse of him i have been wondering why my foster father tracked me down in england he concluded but it must be because of sofie radbuka he might have been her torturer in the concentration camps she is one of my relatives perhaps even my mother or a missing sister are you her child we might be brother and sister i am yearning for the family i have never known please i implore you write back to me to paulradbuka survivorcom tell me about sofie if she is my mother or my aunt or possibly even a sister i never knew existed i must know no followup was posted which wasnt too surprising his hysteria came through so clearly in the document that i would have shied away from him myself i did a search to see if questing scorpio had an email address but came up short i went back to the chat room and carefully constructed a message dear questing scorpio if you have information or questions about the radbuka family that you would be willing to discuss with a neutral party you could send them to the law offices of carter halsey and weinberg these were the offices of my own lawyer freeman carter i included both the street address and the url for their web site then sent an email to freeman letting him know what id done i looked at the screen for a bit as if it might magically reveal some other information but eventually i remembered that no one was paying me to find out anything about sofie radbuka and settled down to some of the online searches that make up the better part of my business these days the web has transformed investigative work making it for the most part both easier and duller at noon when mary louise left for class she said all six policies id brought with me from midway were in order for the four where the purchaser was dead the beneficiaries had duly received their benefits for the two still living no one had submitted a claim three of the policies had been on ajax paper two other companies had issued the other three so if the sommers claim had been fraudulently submitted by the agency it wasnt a regular occurrence exhaustion made it hard for me to thinkabout that or anything else when mary louise had left waves of fatigue swept over me i moved on leaden legs to the cot in my supply room where i fell into a feverish sleep it was almost three when the phone pulled me awake again i stumbled out to my desk and mumbled something unintelligible a woman asked for me then told me to hold for mr rossy mr rossy oh yes the head of edelweisss us operations i rubbed my forehead trying to make blood flow into my brain then since i was still on hold went to the little refrigerator in the hall which i share with tessa for a bottle of water rossy was calling my name sharply when i picked up the phone again buon giorno i said with a semblance of brightness come sta che cosa posso fare per lei he exclaimed over my italian ralph told me you were fluent you speak it beautifullyalmost without an accent actually thats why i called to speak italian to me i was incredulous my wifeshe gets homesick when i told her id met an italian speaker who shared her love of opera she wondered if youd do us the honor of coming to dinner she was especially fascinated as i was sure she would be by the idea of your office among the indovinepsuchics he added in english correcting himself immediately to sychics do i have this correct now perfect i said absently i looked at the isabel bishop painting on the wall by my desk but the angular face staring at a sewing machine told me nothing it would be a pleasure to meet mrs rossy i finally said is it possible that you could join us tomorrow evening i thought of morrell leaving for rome on a ten am flight and the hollow i would feel when i saw him off as it happens im free i copied the addressan apartment building near lottys on lake shore drive into my palm pilot we hung up on mutual protestations of goodwill but i frowned at the painted seamstress a long moment wondering what rossy really wanted the page id found in fepples briefcase was dry now i set the machine to enlarge the copy and came up with letters big enough to read the original i tucked into a plastic sleeve the script was still hard to make out but i could read hillel brodsky i or g herstein and th and aaron sommersalthough it looked like pommers i knew it had to be my clients uncle so this was a list of clients from the midway agencythat seemed like a reasonable assumption what did the crosses mean that they were dead that their families had been defrauded or both perhaps th sommers was still alive the dogs restless from five hours inside got up and wagged their tails at me you guys think we should get in motion youre right lets go i shut down my system carefully slid the original of the fragment into my own case and took fepples briefcase with me back to the car the clock was ticking and i had businesshours errands to run i gave the dogs a chance to relieve themselves but didnt take the time to run them before driving out the ohare corridor to cheviot labs a private forensics lab i often use i showed the fragment of paper to the engineer whos helped me in the past i know metal not paper but weve got someone on staff here who can do it he said im willing to pay for a priority job i said he grunted ill talk to her kathryn chang one of usll call you tomorrow i was just ahead of the afternoon rush so i kept the increasingly restless dogs in the car until we got to hyde park where i threw sticks into the lake for them for half an hour sorry guys bad timing to take you two today back in the car with you it was four when a lot of duty rosters change i drove over to the hyde park bank building sure enough the same man whod been here friday was on duty he looked at me without interest when i stopped in front of his station we kind of met on friday afternoon i said he looked at me more closely oh yeah fepple said youd been harassing him you harass him to death he seemed to be joking so i smiled not me it was on the news that hed been shot or shot himself thats right they say the business was going down the toilet which doesnt surprise me ive worked here nine years since the old man died i bet i could count the evenings the young one worked late must have been disappointed with the client he saw on friday he came back with someone after i left thats right but must not have amounted to anything after all i suppose thats why i didnt see him leave he stayed up there and killed himself the man who came in with himwhen did he leave not sure it was a man or a womanfepple came back along with a lamaze class i think he was talking to someone but i cant say i was paying close attention cops think im derelict because i dont photograph every person that passes through here but hell the building doesnt even have a signin policy if fepples visitor left at the same time as the pregnant couples i wouldnt have noticed them special i had to give up on it i handed him fepples canvas bag telling him id found it on the curb i think it might belong to fepple judging by the stuff inside since the cops are being a pain maybe you could just drop it in his officetheir problem to sort out if they ever come back here again i gave him my card just in case something occurred to him along with my most dazzling smile and headed for the western suburbs unlike my beloved old trans am the mustang didnt handle well at high speedswhich wasnt a problem this afternoon because we werent going anywhere very fast as the evening rush built i sat for long periods without moving at all the first leg of the trip was on the same expressway id taken when i went to see isaiah sommers on friday the air thickened along the industrial corridor turning the bright september sky to a dull yellowish grey i took out my phone and tried max wondering how lotty and he were faring after last nights upheavals agnes loewenthal answered the phone oh vicmax is still at the hospital were expecting him around six but that horrid man who came to the house last night was around today i inched forward behind a waste hauler he came to the house no it was worse in a way he was in the park across the street when i took calia out for a walk this afternoon he came over to try to talk to us saying he wanted calia to know he wasnt really a big bad wolf that he was her cousin what did you do i said he was quite mistaken and to leave us alone he tried to follow us arguing with me but when calia got upset and began to cry he started to shout at usimploring me to let him talk to calia by himself we ran back to the house maxi called max he called the evanston police who sent a squad car around they moved him off butvic its really frightening i dont want to be alone in the housemrs squires didnt come in today because of the party yesterday the car behind me honked impatiently i closed a sixfoot gap while i asked if she really had to stay in chicago until saturday if this horrid little man is going to be stalking us i might see if we can get on an earlier flight although the gallery i went to last week wants me to come in on thursday to meet with their backers id hate to lose that opportunity i rubbed my face with my free hand theres a service i use when i need help bodyguarding or staking out places do you want me to see if they have someone who can stay in the house until you go home her relief rushed across the airwaves to me ill have to talk to maxbut yes yes do that vic my shoulders sagged when she hung up if radbuka was turning into a stalker he could become a real problem i called the streeter brothers voice mail to explain what i needed theyre a funny bunch of guys the streeter brothers they do surveillance bodyguarding and furniture moving with tom and tim streeter running a changing group of nine including these days two wellmuscled women by the time i finished my message we had passed into the exurbs the road widened the sky brightened when i left the tollway it was suddenly a beautiful fall day again xxii grieving mother howard fepple had lived with his mother a few blocks west of harlem avenue these werent the suburbs of great wealth but of the working middle class where ranch houses and colonials sit on modest plots and neighborhood children play in each others yards when i pulled up in front of the fepple home only one car a latemodel navy oldsmobile sat in the drive neither news crews nor neighbors were paying their respects to rhonda fepple the dogs strained to follow me from the car when i locked them in they barked their disapproval a flagstone path whose stones were cracked and overgrown with weeds curved away from the driveway to a side entrance when i rang the bell i saw that the paint on the front door had peeled loose in a number of places after a long wait rhonda fepple came to the door her face with the same carpet of freckles as her sons held the blank stunned look most people wear after a harsh blow she was younger than id expected despite the grief that was collapsing her inside her clothes she had only a few lines around her redstained eyes and her sandy hair was still thick mrs fepple im sorry to bother you but im a detective from chicago with a few questions about your son she accepted my identity without even wanting a name let alone some identification did you find out who shot him no maam i understand you told the officers on the morning shift that mr fepple didnt own a gun i wanted him to if he was going to stay in that creepy old building but he just laughed and said there wasnt anything in the agency anyone would want to steal i always hated that bank those halls with all the little turnings off them anyone could lie in wait for you there the agency wasnt doing very well these days i understand was it more prosperous when your husband was alive youre not trying to say what they told me this morning are you that howie was so depressed he took his own life because he wasnt that kind of boy young man you forget they grow up she patted the corners of her eyes with a tissue it was comforting somehow to know that even a dreary specimen like howard fepple had someone who mourned his death maam i know this is a really hard time for you to try to talk about your son with the loss so fresh but i want to explore a third possibilitybesides suicide or a random breakin im wondering if there was anyone who might have specifically had a quarrel with your son had he talked to you about any conflicts with clients lately she stared at me blankly thinking new thoughts was hard in her griefdrained state she stuffed the tissue back into the pocket of the old yellow shirt she was wearing i suppose you better come in i followed her into the living room where she sat on the edge of a sofa whose cabbage roses had faded to a dull pink when i took a matching armchair at right angles to her dust bunnies bounced along the walls the new piece in the room a tan naugahyde recliner parked in front of the thirtyfourinch television had probably belonged to howard how long had your son been working at the agency mrs fepple she twisted her wedding ring howie wasnt much interested in insurance but mr fepple insisted he learn the business you can always make a living in insurance no matter how bad times are he always said thats how the agency survived the depression he was always telling howie that but howie wanted to do somethingwell more interesting more like what the boysmenhe went to school with were doing computers finance that kind of thing but he couldnt make a go of it so when mr fepple passed away and left the agency to him howie went ahead and tried to make it work but that neighborhood has gone steep downhill since when we used to live there of course we moved out here in but all mr fepples clients were on the south side he didnt see how he could move the agency and look after them so you lived in hyde park when you were growing up i asked to keep the conversation going south shore really just south of hyde park then when i got out of high school i went off to work as a secretary to mr fepple he was quite a bit older but well you know how these things go and when we found howie was on the way well we got married he had never married beforemr fepple i meanand i guess he was excited at the idea of a boy to carry onhis father started the agencyyou know how men are about things like that when the baby came i stayed at home to look after himback then we didnt have day care you know not like now mr fepple always said i spoiled him but he was fifty by then not much interested in children her voice trailed away so mr howard fepple only started work at the agency when his father died i prompted how did he learn the business oh well howie used to work there weekends and summers and he spent four years there after college he went out to governors state got a degree in business but like i said insurance wasnt really his cup of tea the mention of tea galvanized her into thinking we should have something to drink i followed her into the kitchen where she pulled a diet coke out of the refrigerator for herself and handed me a glass of tap water i sat at the kitchen table pushing aside a banana peel what about the agent who worked for your husband what was his name rick hoffman your son seemed to admire his work she made a face i never took to him he was such a fussy man everything had to be just so when i worked there he was always criticizing me because i didnt keep the file drawers the way he wanted them organized it was mr fepples agency i told him and mr fepple had a right to set up files the way he wanted them but mr hoffman insisted i get all his files arranged in this special way like it was some big deal he did these little sales burial policies that kind of thing but the way he acted youd think he was insuring the pope she waved her arm in a vague gesture making the dust bunnies bounce somehow he made a lot of money doing it money mr fepple sure never saw mr hoffman drove a big mercedes had a fancy apartment someplace on the north side when i saw him show up with that mercedes i told mr fepple he must be embezzling or part of the mob or something but mr fepple always went through the books very carefully no money was ever missing or anything when time went on mr hoffman got stranger and stranger by what mr fepple said he drove the girl who came there later onafter howie was born after i quit to look after himout of her mind he was always fussing around his papers she said taking them in and out of files i think he kind of went senile toward the end but mr fepple said he wasnt doing any harm let him come into the office and shuffle his papers around hoffman had a son right did his boy and yours hang out together oh goodness me nohis boy started college the year howie was born i dont know if i ever even met him it was just mr hoffman always talking about him how everything he did was for his boyof course i shouldnt poke fun i felt the same way about howie but somehow it griped me all the money he could come up with to spend on his son while mr fepple who owned the agency didnt have near as much mr hoffman sent his son off to some fancy eastern school to college someplace that sounded like harvard but wasnt but i never heard his boy amounted to anything much even with all that expensive education do you know what became of him the son i mean she shook her head i heard he was like a hospital clerk or something but after mr hoffman passed away we didnt hear anything about him it wasnt like we knew anyone who knew him in a social way i mean did your son talk about hoffman lately i asked did he mention problems with any of mr hoffmans old clients im wondering in particular if any of them might have threatened him or maybe made him so depressed about the business that he didnt see how he could make it work she shook her head sniffling again as she thought of her sons last days but thats why i dont think he killed himself he was oh sort of excited like he getsgotwhen he had a new idea in mind he said he finally understood how hoffman made so much money out of his list he figured he could get me a mercedes of my own if i wanted pretty soon he said now well i do clerical work up in western springs and i guess ill just keep on until i retire the bleakness of the prospect depressed me almost as much as it did her i asked abruptly when shed last seen her son tears leaked from the corners of her eyes friday morning when i was leaving for work he was getting up he said he had a dinner meeting with a client so hed be home late then when he didnt come home i got worried i called the office off and on on saturday but he does sometimesdid sometimesgo to these tabletennis tournaments out of town i thought maybe he forgot to tell me or maybe he had a datei did kind of wonder the way he dressed so carefully friday morning i trytriedto remember hes not still a child although its hard when hes living right here at home i tried to get a client name from her wondering if isaiah sommers had come around threatening him but much as she would have liked to blame howies death on some black person from the south side rhonda fepple couldnt remember his mentioning any names the officers who talked to you this morning they didnt bother to search your sons room did they no i didnt think they wouldthey were too fixed on their suicide theory could i take a look she still didnt ask me for identification but led me down the hall to her sons room she must have given him the master suite when her husband diedit was a large room with a kingsize bed and a small desk the room smelled of sour sweat and other things i didnt want to think about mrs fepple murmured something apologetic about laundry and tried to pick up some of the clothes from the floor she stood looking from a polkadotted shirt in her left hand to a pair of shorts in her right as if trying to figure out what they were then let them fall back to the floor after that she just stood watching me as if i were the television screen a soothing but meaningless piece of motion in the room rummaging through dresser and desk drawers i found cell phones from two earlier generations of models a collection of startling porn that fepple had apparently printed off the web a half dozen broken calculators and three tabletennis paddles but no documents of any kind i went through his closet and even looked between the mattress and box springs all i found was another collection of porn this time magazines that dated back several yearshe must have forgotten about them when he learned how to cruise the net the only insurance documents in the room were company pamphlets stacked on the desktop not the sommers file nor even a datebookwhich hadnt been in his briefcase or officenor any more pages like the one id found in his briefcase this morning i pulled one of the photocopies of the page from my own case and showed it to her do you know what this is it was in your sons office she looked at it with the same apathy shed given my search that i couldnt tell you she started to hand it back to me then said it might be mr hoffmans handwriting he kept these leather books with his name stamped on the cover in gold hed take them around with him to his customers and check off when they paid just like on here she tapped the check marks with her index finger one day i picked up his book when he was in the washroom and when he came back youd think i was a russian spy going after the atom bomb the way he carried on like i knew what any of it meant does this writing look like hoffmans writing she shrugged i havent seen it in years i just remember it was scrunched up like this kind of hard to read but real even like it was engraving i looked around discouraged what i hoped to find was some kind of diary your son didnt have one on his desk at the office nor in his briefcase do you know how he kept track of his appointments he had one of those handheld gadgets one of those electronic things yeah like that she added when i showed her my palm pilot if it wasnt on him then whoever killed him mustve stolen it which either meant an appointment with his killer ora random attack where the killer stole pawnable electronics the computer had been left therebut it would have been hard to smuggle past the guard i asked mrs fepple if the cops had returned her sons possessions to her but those were still part of crimescene evidence the technicians were keeping them until the autopsy gave them a definitive report of suicide was he renting monthbymonth or is there a lease hed gone to monthbymonth she agreed to lend me a spare office key that shed kept but the thought of having to get all those files packed up by the end of september and of having to work with the various companies to shift active policyholders to a new agency made her droop further into her yellow shirt i dont know what i thought youd be able to tell me but it doesnt seem like youre going to be able to find who killed him i gotta lie down somehow all this it has me worn out youd think all youd do is cry but its like all i can do is sleep xxiii fencing in the dark my long trek north to morrells took me through the disturbing vistas of the western suburbs no center no landmarks just endless sameness sometimes row on row of ranch houses sometimes of moreelaborate moreaffluent tracts but all punctuated with malls showing identical megastores the third time i passed bed bath beyond and barnes noble i thought i was driving in circles sometimes i feel like a motherless child a long way from home i sang as i sat in a stationary lane at one of the everlasting tollbooths on the rim road around the city i was motherless after all and forty miles from morrells home i flung my change into the box and scoffed at myself for melodramatic selfpity real grief lay in rhonda fepples story the childless mother its so out of the order of nature and it exposes you as so fundamentally powerless to have a child die before you you never really recover from it howie fepples mother didnt think her son had committed suicide no mother would want to believe that of her child but in fepples case it was because he was excitedhe finally understood how rick hoffman had made enough money out of his book to drive a mercedesand he was going to get one for rhonda i pulled out my phone to call nick vishnikov the chief deputy medical examiner but the traffic suddenly cleared the suvs around me quickly accelerated to eighty or ninety the call could wait until it didnt put my life in danger to make it the dogs panted gently over my shoulder reminding me that it had been some hours since their last run when i finally reached the dempster exit i pulled off at a forest preserve to let them out it was dark now the park officially closed with a piece of chain blocking me from going farther than a few yards off the main road while mitch and peppy excitedly set off after rabbits i stood at the chain with my cell phone calling first morrell to tell him we were only eight miles away then trying lotty again she had left the clinic her receptionist mrs coltrain told me how did she seem dr herschel is working too hard she needs to take some time off for herself mrs coltrain has known me for years but she wont gossip about lotty with anyone not even to agree with max when he mocks her imperial manner i tapped the phone thoughtfully if i was going to have a hearttoheart with lotty i should do it sitting down at home but this was morrells last night in chicago the dogs were crashing around somewhere near me i called to them to remind them that i was here and in charge of the pack when theyd run up sniffed my hands and torn off again i reached lotty at home she cut short my attempt to express concern at her collapse yesterday id rather not discuss it victoria im embarrassed that i created such a disturbance in the middle of maxs party and dont want to be reminded of it maybe oh physician you should consult a doctor yourself make sure youre okay that you didnt hurt yourself when you fainted her voice took on a sharper edge im perfectly fine thanks very much i stared into the dark underbrush as if seeing it would enable me to penetrate lottys mind i know you werent in the room with radbuka last night when he was going on about his past but did max tell you radbuka found a posting on a bulletin board from someone wanting information about sofie radbuka i went on the web today and found the site radbuka is convinced she must have been his mother or his sister at least he wrote a long message to that effect lotty who was she you found sofie radbuka on the web thats impossible i found someone who wanted information about her saying that she lived in england during the forties i repeated patiently max didnt think fit to tell me that she snapped thank you very much she hung up leaving me uncomfortably alone in the dark woods a sense of being both forlorn and ridiculous made me call the dogs back to me again i could hear them thrashing around but they wouldnt come i had kept them penned up all daythey werent going to reward me by being good dogs now before going to the car for a flashlight so i could track them i made one last callto nick vishnikov at the morgue after all the place never closes when i dialed the numberwhich i know by hearti got the one thin piece of luck the fates were allowing me today vishnikov who pretty much chooses his hours was still there vic hows morrell he in kabul yet tomorrow i said nicktheres a guy with a head wound who came in this morning the police are calling it suicide but you murdered him and you want to confess autopsies make him ferociously cheerful howard fepple i want to be a hundredfifty percent certain that he put that sig trailside to his head all by himself he hadnt done fepples case while he put me on hold to check the files i fiddled with the dogs leashes wishing i hadnt let them disappear into the darki couldnt hear them now i handed it off to one of my juniors since it seemed straightforward and he treated it as routine suicide but i see he didnt check the hands for gunpowderhe relied on the fact that the victim ate the gun we still have the bodyill review it before i leave do you have evidence of murder people do the darnedest things but i have a guy who told his mother he was on to something hot and i have a mystery visitor to his office id love it if the states attorney pulled fepples phone logs ill let you know if theres anything to change the verdict later vic i wondered whether my client had gone around with a gun to threaten fepple but isaiah sommers didnt strike me as the kind of person who would set up an elaborate trap if fepple had been murdered by the person who called him when i was in the office on friday that was someone who was planning to kill and planning a way to avoid being seen he had gone in and out of the building with big enough groups of people to avoid notice hed shown fepple how to get away from me it didnt sound like isaiah sommers momentarily forgetting the dogs i got the sommers number from directory assistance margaret sommers answered her voice heavy with hostility but after a moments pause in which she couldnt think of a reason not to she brought her husband to the phone i told him about fepples death i searched both the office and his home and couldnt find a trace of your uncles file i said the police are labeling this a suicide but i think someone killed him and im sort of thinking they killed him to get that file who would do that it could be that whoever perpetrated the fraud to begin with left some kind of record behind that they dont want anyone else to find it could be someone got pissed enough at the guy over something else to kill him when i paused he exploded you accusing me of going in there to murder him my wife was right alderman durham was right you never had the least mr sommers ive had a long day im out of finesse i dont think you killed the guy on the other hand youve clearly got a temper maybe your wife or the alderman pushed you to stop waiting for me to get results to go see fepple yourself maybe his smirking donothing attitude goaded you to act well it didnt he didnt i agreed to wait for you and i am waiting for you even though the alderman thinks im making a big mistake he does what does he recommend peppy and mitch bounded up to me i smelled them before i saw them darker shapes against the darkness of the clearing where i stoodthey had rolled in something rank my hand over the mouthpiece i ordered them to sit peppy obeyed but mitch tried to jump on me i pushed him away with my foot thats just it he doesnt have a plan i can follow he wants me to initiate a suit against ajax but like i asked him whos going to pay all those legal bills who has that kind of time my wifes brother he took on a big lawsuit it dragged through the courts for thirteen years i dont want to wait thirteen years to get my money back in the background i could hear margaret sommers demanding to know why he wanted to tell the whole world her private business mitch lunged at me again knocking me offbalance i sat down hard the phone still clutched to my ear i tried to push mitch away without shouting into the mouthpiece he barked in excitement thinking we were having a wonderful game together peppy tried to shove him out of the way by now i smelled just as bad as the two of them i clipped their leashes on and stood up am i ever going to get any satisfaction out of this situation sommers was demanding im sorry about the agent that was a terrible way to die but its no joke to come up with all that cash for a funeral ms warashki im going to talk to the company tomorrow to see if theyll offer a settlement i was going to pitch it to them as a way of building pr ammo against durham but i didnt think it would help relations with the client if i told him that if they offer you something on the dollar would that be acceptable ilet me think about it very wise mr sommers i said tired of standing around in the dark with my smelly dogs your wife should have a chance to tell you im trying to rob you call me tomorrow ohdo you own a gun yourself do ioh i see you want to know if im lying about killing that agent i rubbed a hand through my hair realizing a second too late how much it stank of rotten rabbit im trying to assure myself that you couldnt have killed him he paused i could hear him breathing heavily in my ear while he thought it over and then reluctantly revealed that he owned a ninemillimeter browning special thats reassuring mr sommers fepple was killed with a swiss model different gauge call me tomorrow about whether youll take a deal from the company good night as i yanked the dogs toward the car a forestpreserve deputy pulled into the clearing behind my mustang shining his searchlight on us he demanded over his bullhorn that i come over when we got to the car he seemed disappointed to find that we were a lawabiding trio with both dogs hitched up the deputies love to ticket people for disobeying the leash laws mitch incurably friendly lunged toward the man who backed away in disgust from the stench he seemed to be looking for some grounds for a ticket but finally said only that the park was closed and he was going to watch to see that we moved on you are an evil animal i said to mitch when we were back on dempster the deputy ostentatiously tailing us you not only stink yourself but youve gotten that gross smell all over me its not like i have clothes to burn you know mitch stuck his head over the backseat grinning happily i opened all the windows but it was still a tough ride i had intended to stop at maxs to find out how they were doing and to see what max could tell me about lottys history with the radbuka family right now all i really wanted was to fling the dogs into a tub and dive in after them but to be prudent i swung past maxs house before going to morrells leaving mitch in the car i took peppy and a flashlight and walked through the park across the street from maxs we surprised several bundles of students tied up in love knots who backed away from us in disgust but radbuka at least didnt seem to be hovering nearby at morrells i chained the dogs to the backporch railing don was out there with a cigarette inside i could hear morrell tinkering with a schumann piano concerto too loudly to hear my arrival warshawskiwhatve you been doing don demanded armwrestling skunks don this is great you dont get enough exercise you can help me wash these wonderful animals i went in through the kitchen taking a garbage bag to wrap my clothes in when i stripped i put on an old tshirt and cutoffs to bathe the dogs my suggestion that he help wash them had made don scuttle i laughed as i scrubbed mitch and peppy then went into the shower myself by the time the three of us were clean morrell was waiting in the kitchen for me with a glass of wine predeparture nerves had turned morrell edgy i told him about fepple and the depressing life he seemed to have led and how the dogs had rolled in something so rotten that theyd scared off a sheriffs deputy he expressed shock and amusement in the right places but his mind wasnt with me i kept the news of radbukas stalking the loewenthals and lottys disturbing behavior to myselfmorrell didnt need worries about me to take with him into the talibans world don was going to stay on at morrells while he worked on his project with rhea wiell but morrell said it wasnt cowardice over dog bathing that had driven him away but morrells own orders hed sent don to a hotel so we could have this last evening alone together i made up little bruschette with pears and gorgonzola then put together a frittata taking elaborate care even caramelizing onions for it id laid by a special bottle of barolo a meal of love a meal of despair remember me remember that my meals make you happy and return to me as i should have expected morrell was completely prepared with everything packed into a couple of lightweight bags hed stopped his paper forwarded his mail to me left me money to pay his bills he was nervous and excited although we went to bed soon after eating he talked until close to two in the morning about himself his parentswhom he almost never mentionedhis childhood in cuba where they had come as emigrants from hungary his plans for his upcoming trip as we lay next to each other in the dark he clung to me feverishly victoria iphigenia i love you for your fierceness and your passionate attachment to truth if anything should happen to menot that i expect it toyou have my lawyers name nothing will happen to you morrell my cheeks were wet we fell asleep like that clutched in each others arms when the alarm woke us a few hours later i quickly took the dogs around the block while morrell made coffee he had talked himself out in the night we were silent on the drive to the airport in the backseat the dogs sensing our mood whined nervously morrell and i share an aversion to long farewells i dropped him at the terminal and quickly drove off not even staying to see him go inside if i didnt see him leaveperhaps he wouldnt be gone xxiv walrus duty at eightthirty in the morning traffic into the city was at a standstill after last night i couldnt face another horrible commute don wasnt coming back to morrells until later this afternooni could rest there for a bit avoiding the expressways altogether i entered the alternative morning rush hourkids going to school people arriving for jobs at the little shops and delis that dot the area they accentuated my sense of instability morrell gone a hole in the middle of my life why didnt i live in one of those tidy whitesided houses with children heading off for school while i went to some orderly job as i sat at the light at golf road i phoned in for my messages nick vishnikov wanted me to call him tim streeter had said he would be happy to provide some security for calia and agnes until they left on saturday in my personal turmoil over morrells departure id forgotten radbukas odd behavior i stopped dawdling along with my maudlin thoughts and drove over to maxs as fast as i could by this time of day hes usually already in meetings but when i reached his house his lesabre was still in the driveway his face was heavy with worry when he answered the door victoria come in has morrell left before shutting the door he peered anxiously across the street but only a lone jogger was visible a silhouette moving along the lakeshore i just dropped him at the airport did agnes tell you i can arrange a little security for you that would be a help if i had known what a chamber of horrors id open by participating in that birnbaum conference putting calia at risk at risk i interrupted has radbuka been back did he make an overt threat against her no nothing that concrete but his obsession with being related to mei cant understand it this hovering around here i interrupted to ask again if radbuka had been back i dont think so but of course this house is so exposed with a public park across the street you think im blowing my worries out of proportion maybe so maybe so but im not young and calia is precious still if you can arrange for someone reliable to be hereand of course i will pay the fee max took me back to the kitchen to use the phone agnes was sitting there drinking coffee anxiously watching calia who was alternating spoonfuls of cornflakes with pleas to go to the zoo no darling were going to stay inside and paint pictures today agnes repeated i took a cup of coffee to the phone with me tom streeter promised to have his brother tim at maxs within the hour with tim on the case you can be pretty secure going anywhere you want i told agnes is he the big bad wolf calia demanded no hes a big good teddy bear i said youll see you and your mama will both find him irresistible max sat next to calia trying not to let his anxiety shine through as obviously as agness when i asked him what he could tell me about the radbuka family hed known in london he got up again taking me away from the eating alcove he kept turning to look at calia while he spoke i didnt know them lotty has always claimed they were an acquaintance merely and i have acquiesced in that calia climbed down from the table announcing she was through with breakfast she was tired of the house she was going outside now when your grandpapa and i are through talking well go across to the park with the dogs i said you hold tight for ten more minutes i mouthed television at agnes who made a sour face but took calia upstairs to the universal babysitter you think the radbukas were relations or close friends of lottys i said to max its what i said sunday night lotty always made it clear that one didnt discuss the radbukas with her i assume thats why she gave me the information about them in writing to preclude any discussion i dont know who they were he moved calias dishes to the sink and sat back down at the table yesterday i went through such files as i have from that trip i made to central europe after the war i was looking for so many people that nothing stands out very clearly in my mind lotty had given me her grandparents address on the renngassethat was where she lived before the anschlussa very tony address which had been taken over in by people who wouldnt talk to me i concentrated most of my energy in vienna on my own family and then i wanted to get to budapest to look for tereszs people we werent married then of course we were still very young his voice faded into memory after a minute he shook his head with a sad little smile and continued anyway the notes i have about the radbukaswell let me get them while he went up to his study i helped myself to fruit and rolls from his refrigerator he came back in a couple of minutes with a thick binder he thumbed through it opening it to a sheet of cheap grey paper encased in plastic even though the ink was fading to brown lottys distinctive scriptspiky and boldwas unmistakable dear max i admire your courage in taking this trip vienna for me represents a world i cant bear to return to even if the royal free would grant me a leave of absence so thank you for going since i am as desperate for a conclusive answer as everyone else i told you about my grandparents if by a miracle they have survived and have been able to return to their home it is renngasse thirdfloor front i want to ask you also to look for any record of another family from vienna named radbuka this is for someone at the royal free who sadly cannot recollect many details for instance the mans first name was shlomo but the person doesnt know his wifes name or even if they would have been registered with some kind of germanized names they had a son called moishe born around one daughter named rachel two other daughters whose names the person isnt sure ofone might be evaand a number of grandchildren of our generation also the address isnt certain it was on the leopoldsgasse near the untere augarten strasse end you turn right from ua onto lgasse then its the second turning on your right into the interior courtyard and on the third floor at the back i realize thats a hopeless way to describe what may now be a pile of rubble but its the best i can do but please i ask you to treat it as seriously as your search for our own families please make every effort to see what trace you can find of them i am on duty tonight and tomorrow night both so i wont be able to see you in person before you leave the remainder of the letter gave the names of some of lottys aunts and uncles and concluded with im enclosing a gold prewar fivekrone piece to help pay for your journey i blinked gold coins sound romantic exotic and wealthy i thought lotty was a poor student barely able to make her tuition and rooming payments she was she had a handful of gold coins that her grandfather had helped her smuggle out of vienna giving one of them to me meant wearing her coat and socks to bed in lieu of heat that winter maybe that contributed to her getting so sick the next year abashed i returned to the main question so you dont have any idea who in london asked lotty for help he shook his head it could have been anyone or it could have been lotty herself searching for relatives i wondered if it might be one of her cousins names she and hugo were sent to england the herschels had been quite well off before the anschluss they still had some resources but lotty once or twice mentioned very poor cousins who stayed behind but i also thought it might be someone who was in england illegally someone lotty felt honorbound to protect i didnt have anything to go on mind you but one imagines something and that was the picture i painted to myself or maybe it was tereszs idea i cant remember now of course radbuka might have been a patient or colleague from the royal free for whom lotty felt similarly protective i suppose i could get in touch with the royal free see if they have lists that date back to i said doubtfully what did you find in vienna did you go toto i looked at lottys note and stumbled through the pronunciation of the german street names max flipped through the binder to the back where he pulled a cheap notebook from its own plastic cover i looked at my notes but they dont tell me much bauernmarkt where my own family lived had been badly hit in the bombing i know i did walk all through that area through what they used to call the matzoinsel where the eastern european jews gathered when they immigrated during the early years of the century im sure i tried to find the place on the leopoldsgasse but the site of so much desolation was too depressing my notes i kept for news from the different agencies i visited he opened the notebook carefully so as not to tear the fragile paper shlomo and judit radbuka deported to lodz february with edithi think thats the name lotty thought might be evarachel julie and mara and a list of seven children two to ten years old then i had a job tracking down what happened in the lodz ghetto poland was a very difficult country thenit wasnt yet under communist control but while some people were quite helpful there were also ferocious pogroms against the remnants of the jewish community it was the same story of desolation and deprivation that existed all over europe poland lost a fifth of its population to the war i nearly turned tail a half dozen times but finally i did get hold of some of the records of the ghetto authority the radbukas all were deported to a death camp in june of none of them survived of my own family well i found a cousin in one of the dp camps i tried to persuade him to come to england with me but he was determined to return to vienna where he did live out the rest of his life at the time no one knew what would happen with the russians and austria but in the end it worked out fine for my cousin but he was always very reclusive after the war i had looked up to him so as a child he was eight years older than me it was hard to see him so fearful so withdrawn i stood silent sickened by the images he was conjuring before bursting out then why did lotty use the name sofie radbuka ithat episodethe picture of carl going to the country looking for her cottage lotty staying behind the doors and using the name of a dead personits very unnerving and it doesnt sound like lotty max rubbed his eyes everyone has unaccountable moments in their lives it may be that lotty thought she was responsible for the loss or death of this sofie radbuka whether it was a cousin or a patient when lotty thought she might be dying herselfwell we were all living difficult lives then working hard coping with the loss of our families the deprivation in england after the war was still acute toowe had our own bomb sites to clean up there were coal shortages bitter weather no one had any money food and clothes were still rationed lotty might have snapped under the strain overidentified with this radbuka woman i do remember when lotty came back from that illness it was in winter maybe february she had lost a lot of weight but she brought a dozen eggs and a half pound of butter back from the country with her and invited teresz and me and the rest of our lot over for tea she scrambled all the eggs up with the butter and we had a wonderful feast and at one point she announced she would never again let her life be held hostage she was so fierce we all rather backed away carl refused to come of course it was years before he would speak to her again i told him about the bulletin board id found with questing scorpios entry so there definitely was someone in england by that name in the forties but my feeling is that paul radbukas response was so intense that scorpio didnt write back i posted a message saying scorpio could get in touch with freeman carter if there was something confidential to discuss max shrugged helplessly i dont know i dont know what any of it means i just wish lotty would either tell me what shes tormenting herself withor stop carrying on in such a dramatic fashion have you spoken to her since sunday night i tried talking to her last night but she bit my head off max grunted this is one of those weeks where i wonder what keeps our friendship together shes an important surgeon shes sorry she was momentarily under the weather at my delightful party but shes fine now thanks very much and she needs to make rounds the doorbell rang tim streeter had arrived he was a tall rangy guy with a handlebar moustache and an engaging smile max called to agnes who quickly relaxed under tims calm air of confidence while calia after a momentary suspicion promptly announced he was a lawrus because of his giant moustache and offered to throw him dead fish tim made her squeal with laughter by blowing spluttery air through his moustache points max much relieved took off for the hospital tim toured the premises looking for vulnerable spots then crossed the street to the park with calia so she could play with the dogs calia brought ninshubur with her proudly showing mitch and peppy that her dog had tags just like theirs ninshubur is mitchs mummy she announced after seeing the skillful way tim kept between calia and any passersby seeming to make it part of a game instead of alarming the child agnes returned to the house to set up her paints when the dogs had run the edge off their energy i told tim i needed to move on theres not an imminent threat as i understand it he drawled a hyperemotional guy flailing aroundnot threatening directly but making everyone uncomfortable i agreed then i think i can do it on my own ill set up a camp bed in that sunroom its the one place with vulnerable windows youve got the photos of the stalker right in the confusion of getting morrell to ohare id left my briefcase at his place i had a set of photos in it which i said id drop off in an hour or two on my way into the city calia pouted when i called the dogs to me but tim blew through his moustache and gave a walruslike bark she turned her back on us and demanded that he bark again if he wanted another fish lotty herschels story quarantine i reached the cottage on a day so hot that not even the bees could bear it a man whod ridden the bus with me from seaton junction carried my suitcase up the road for me when he finally left me after asking for the eighth or ninth time if i was sure i could manage i sat exhausted on the doorstone letting the sun burn through my jumper id darned it so many times that it was more mending thread than cotton at this point it had been hot in london too but a horrible city heat where the yellow skies pushed down on you so hard your head began to buzz as if it were filled with cotton wool at night i sweated so much that sheet and nightgown both were wet when i got up in the morning i knew i needed to eat but between the heat and the lethargy my physical condition induced it was hard to force food down when claire examined me she told me brusquely that i was starving myself to death any infection on the wards could kill you in a week the condition youre in right now you need to eat you need to rest eat and rest when i lay in bed at night feverish nightmares consumed me i kept seeing my mother too weak from hunger and pregnancy to walk down the stairs with us when hugo and i left vienna the baby died of malnutrition at two months nadia theyd called her meaning hope they would not be hopeless i knew the baby died because my father wrote to tell me a red cross letter with the prescribed twentyfive words that reached me in march the last letter from him i had hated the baby when my mother was pregnant because it took her from me no more games no more songs only her eyes getting bigger in her head now this poor little sister whom id never seen haunted me reproaching me for my nineyearold jealousy in the night as i sweated in the thick london air i could hear her feeble cries growing faint with malnutrition or id see my oma her thick silveryblond hair about which she was so vain that she refused to bob it in her apartment on the renngasse i would sit with her at night while the maid brushed it the ends so long my grandmother could sit on them but now in my misery i would see her shaved as my fathers mother had always been under her wig which image tormented me more my oma shaved and helpless or my fathers mother my bobe whom i refused to kiss goodbye as i grew thinner and weaker in the london heat that last morning in vienna grew so loud in my head that i could hardly hear the world around me the cousins with whom i shared a bed not coming to england staying in bed refusing to get up to walk to the station with us oma and opa would pay for lingerls children but not the daughters of my fathers sisters those dark girls with nutshaped faces whom i so closely resembled oh the money opa had no money anymore except that little hoard of coins the coins that bought me my medical training could have bought my cousins lives my bobe stretching her arms out to me her beloved martins daughter and i with my omas jealous eyes on me giving her only a formal curtsy in farewell i lay in bed weeping begging my granny to forgive me i could hardly talk to carl these days anyway he wasnt much in london for me to talk to in the spring the orchestra went to holland to perform hed spent most of june and july in bournemouth and brighton where his fledgling chamber group was engaged to play a series of promenade concerts the few nights wed had together this summer ended with my walking away walking across london from his little flat to my bedsitter walking away from an energy and optimism that seemed incomprehensible to me only on the wards did the images recede when i changed the dressings on an old mans ulcerated wound or carefully cut open the newspapers in which some east end mother had stitched her sick baby i could be present in london with people whose needs i could meet when five of my classmates were on medical leave that winter id stepped up my work pace to pick up the slack the teaching staff didnt like me i was too serious too intense but they recognized my skill with patients even in my second year i think that was why claire had come looking for me shed shown up at the royal free for a conferenceactually on the new drugs that were starting to come in for tuberculosis afterward some professor probably suggested that a word from her might carry weight with me get miss herschel to relax take part in some of her years sports or dramatics it will make her a betterrounded person and ultimately a better doctor in the normal round of life our paths no longer crossed claire still lived with her mother but since id left cousin minnas i never ran into her claire was doing her senior housemans year at st annes in wembley which meant long days covering casualty as well as the postop and disease wardswomen even women like claire tallmadge got the dregs of the housemens jobs in those days when i looked up and saw her across the room i collapsed carl often accused me of being in love with claire oh i was but not in the way he imagined not erotically but with the infatuation a child has for an adulated adult i suppose the flattery of my mimicry even to the point of following her to the royal free kept claire paying a kind of attention to me that was why it was so painful later when she cut me off but at that particular moment it was more our different schedules our different homes that kept us apart still i was startled when she wrote me the following week the week after id collapsed in front of her to offer me the cottage when i crossed london by train and bus to meet her for tea she told me ted marmaduke and his brother wallace had bought the cottage to use when they went sailing after wallace was killed at el alamein ted didnt sail much vanessa hated boats the country real country bored her but ted wouldnt sell the place he even paid a local farm couple to keep the yard and premises in some kind of order claire said he imagined using it again when he and vanessa had childrenhe pictured five or six children who would grow up to share his love of sports since theyd been married a decade now without even one robust blond child i had a feeling that vanessas will would prevail here as in other matters but it wasnt my business i didnt care much about ted and vanessas lives ted never liked me i said when claire explained that her brotherinlaw was offering me the place so that i could get the fresh air and food i needed why would he let me have his country house isnt that the kind of encroachment he always warned you against i used to hear ted criticizing claire for her involvement with me crouching behind the garden wall id hear him say she should be careful my kind would only take advantage claire replying that i was a funny little monkey without a mother and what possible advantage could i take teds brother wallace another tall blond man with a hearty laugh putting in that shed be surprised people like me were always encroaching youre young claire inclined to think you know better than the rest of us i assure you when youve seen the world a bit youll think differently should i be embarrassed at how much i heard from the other side of the garden wall i suppose i supposeit was only my childish infatuation with claire that made me creep down there when i saw them all in the garden on sunday afternoons now claire flushed slightly war matured ted that and losing wallace you havent seen him have you since he got back i expect hell be quite a power in the city one of these days but at home hes much gentler than he used to be anyway when he and vanessa were over for dinner on sunday and i explained how ill you were how you needed rest and fresh air they both immediately thought of axmouth a local farmer named jessup will probably sell you food cheaply theres a decent doctor in axmouth you should be able to manage on your own ill come in december when my tour at st annes ends but if you feel desperate before that you can send me a telegram i could probably get away for a day in an emergency just as shed got me to school to the scholarships id needed she now organized all the details of my life she even validated my request for medical leave due to tuberculosis and persuaded the registrar that i would recover faster in the country with fresh food than at a sanitorium i felt powerless to resist her powerless to say id rather take my chances in london when the time came to leave town i didnt know what to say to carl hed returned to london from brighton a week earlier a succès fou in a state of such forceful energy that i could hardly bear to be around him in ten days he and the other cellini players were leaving for the second edinburgh arts festival his successes his plans his vision of chamber music these were so consuming that he didnt even notice how ill i was i finally wrote him a very awkward letter dear carl i am taking medical leave from the royal free i wish you great success in edinburgh i tried to think of some sweet way to close something that would evoke the evenings perched in the top balcony at the opera our long walks along the embankment the pleasure wed shared in his narrow bed at the hostel before he started making enough money for a real flat those times all seemed dead to me now as remote as my oma and my bobe in the end i only added my name putting the letter in the post outside waterloo before boarding the train to axmouth xxv paper trail as soon as i got to morrells i returned nick vishnikovs call he came on the line with his usual abrupt staccato vic was that witchcraft or did you have some kind of evidence so it wasnt suicide i stood at the kitchen counter letting out a long breath no gunpowder residue on the hand was the first pointer and then a blow to the cranium which must have stunned him long enough for the perp to shoot himthe junior who did the first autopsy didnt bother to check for other injuries what did you notice oh the blow to the head i said airily no actually i saw the details of his life not those of his death well whatever congratulationsalthough commander purling at the twentyfirst district isnt happy since his team didnt spot the problem on site he doesnt want it to be homicide but as i told him the soc photos show the gun just below the vics hand if hed killed himself he would have lost the gun up around his head and it would have fallen away from his arm not right under his hand so purlings assigned the case got to run before he could hang up i quickly asked if they were sure the sig trailside on the scene had killed fepple more witchcraft warshawski ill pass the question on to the lab later as i filled a bowl with water for the dogs i wondered if i should call commander purling at the twentyfirst district to report what i knew but it was so littlethe mystery phone call on friday night the mystery visitor to fepples officethe cops would get all that from the bank guard and fepples phone logs and anyway if i called him it would mean at best hours of explaining why i was involved at worsti could find myself in more trouble than i needed for having explored the scene of the crime on my own besides this wasnt my case it wasnt my problem my only problem was to try to get ajax to pay the sommers family what they were owed on aaron sommerss life insurance aaron sommers whose name appeared on an old ledger sheet in howard fepples briefcase with two crosses next to it i called cheviot labs and asked for kathryn chang oh yes barry gave me your sheet of paper i took a preliminary look at it from the watermark im saying its of swiss manufacture the baume works outside basel its a kind of cotton weave that they didnt make during the second world war because of the shortage of raw material so it dates from somewhere between and i can give you more precise dating than that when ive studied the inkthat will make it easier for me to date when the words were written i cant make that a priority though it will be at least a week because of other jobs i have ahead of you thats fine this is enough for me for now i said slowly trying to turn the information over in my mind do you knowwould this paper have been used primarily or exclusively in switzerland oh no by no means the baume works arent so important now but well into the s they were one of the biggest makers of fine paper and business paper in the world this particular stock was widely used for things like address books personal journals that kind of thing it is very unusual to see it treated like this as accounting paper the person who used it must have been veryoh let me say fond of himself it would be helpful of course if i could see the book this was torn from that would help me too but one thing id like to know in particular can you tell when the different entries were written not the exact yearbut well if some are more recent than others id like to know that right well include that in your report ms warshawski it seemed to me it was time to visit ralph again his secretary remembered me from last week but i couldnt see ralph his schedule was packed until sixthirty tonight however when i said i might be able to defuse alderman durhams protest she put me on holdas it turned out long enough for me to read the entire sports section of the heraldstar when she came back she said ralph could squeeze me in for five minutes at noon if i got there on the dot on the dot it is i hung up and turned to the dogs that means we go back home where you can lounge around the garden and i can put on panty hose i know you will feel bereft but ask yourselveswho really will be having more fun it was tenthirty now id had a wistful hope of climbing into morrells bed for a nap but i still had to drop photos of radbuka off at maxs for tim streeter and i wanted to get back to my own place to change into something more appropriate than jeans for a loop meeting lifes just a wheel and im caught in the spokes i sang as i shepherded the dogs once more back to the car all was still quiet at maxs when i stopped to drop off radbukas photographs i zipped down the drive to belmont dumped the dogs with mr contreras and ran up the stairs to my own apartment tonight was my dinner with the rossys my chance to chatter italian to cheer up bertrands homesick wife i put on a soft black trouser suit that could take me from meetings to dinner a turtleneck that i could remove when i got to the rossys so that the rose silk camisole underneath dressed up the outfit my mothers diamonddrop earrings i buttoned into a pocket pumps in my briefcase the crepesoled shoes id worn yesterday morning to step in fepplesi broke off the thought without completing it and ran back down the stairs the pinball back in action i drove down to my office then took the l into the loop at the ajax building on adams a small band of protesters was still circling the sidewalk near the entrance without alderman durham there to lead the charge the troops looked bedraggled every now and then theyd rouse themselves to chant something at the herd of people on their way from office to lunch but for the most part they merely talked among themselves posters drooping against their shoulders these seemed to be the same signs they had carried on fridayno reparations for slaveowners no highrises on the bones of slaves and so on but the flyer a dogged young man handed me on my way in had cut out the attacks on me literally cut outthe middle header asking me if i had no shame was gone leaving a gap between the merciless ajax and the compassionless birnbaums the text looked strange ajax insurance cashed her husbands lifeinsurance policy ten years ago when he died last week they sent their tame detective to accuse sister sommers of stealing it i guess this way they could just type my name back in if i reverted to chief villain i tucked the flyer into my briefcase at noon on the dot the executivefloor attendant brought me to ralphs antechamber ralph himself was still in a meeting in his conference room but his secretary buzzed him and after the briefest wait he emerged this time i got a grim nod not a grin and a hug does trouble always follow you vic he said when we were in his office with the door shut or does it just jump up to bite me anytime youre in the vicinity if you really only have five minutes dont spend it blaming me for alderman durhams pickets i sat on one of the hard tubular chairs while ralph leaned against the edge of his desk i came to suggest that you make the sommers family whole then you can issue a big pr statement about how your respect for the widows grief he cut me short we paid them ten thousand dollars in i wont doublepay a lifeinsurance policy the question is who got that money back in personally i dont think anyone in the sommers family ever saw it that check started and stopped at the agency door he folded his arms in an uncompromising line do you have proof of this you know dont you that howard fepple is dead theres no one he committed suicide because his agency was going down the toilet it was in our executive briefing this morning i shook my head old news he was murdered the sommers family file has disappeared theres no one from the agency left to explain what really happened ralph stared at me in angry disbelief what do you mean he was murdered the cops found his body they found the suicide note it was in the papers ralph listen to me barely an hour ago the medical examiner called to tell me the autopsy proves murder dont you think it was funny that the sommers family file disappeared at the same time fepple was killed what are you trying to do to me am i supposed to believe this on your sayso i shrugged call the medical examiner call the watch commander at the twentyfirst district im not trying to do anything but help my clientand give you a way of defusing the protest down there on adams all right lets hear it the scowl emphasized his incipient jowls make the sommers family whole i repeated steadily trying not to let my own temper get the better of me its only ten thousand dollars thats one roundtrip ticket to zurich for a member of your executive committee but its the difference between penury and comfort for gertrude sommers and the nephew who fronted for the funeral make a big pr splash out of it what can durham do then he may claim he forced you to take action but he cant go around saying you stole the widows mite ill think about it but it isnt your best idea personally i think its a beauty it shows how utterly reliable the company is even in the most unreliable of situations i could probably write the ad copy for you because it isnt your money i couldnt help smiling what will rossy storm in crying young man every penny of this is coming out of your stock options this isnt a joke vic i know the unfunny part is the connections nastyminded people will make about the sommers file vanishing did the company do something a decade back that they were eager to keep hidden we did notcategorically he cut off his own denial remembering that wed met over an ajax claim fraud is that what the cops think i dont know i can put out some feelers although if its any comfort to you what im hearing about the guy heading the investigation is that he doesnt want to break a sweat i stood up pulling a copy of the old ledger sheet from my briefcase this was the one document relating to sommers that was left in fepples office does it mean anything to you ralph looked at it briefly shaking his head impatiently what is this who are these people i was hoping you could tell me when i was here last week connie ingram that young woman from your claimsrecords unit left sommerss company file up here if it has copies of all the agency documents in it maybe its got a complete copy of this one i dont know who these other people are but the two crosses suggest theyre dead the original of this page is quite old and heres a funny thing about it ralph a forensics lab tells me the paper was made in switzerland before the war second world war i mean not the persian gulf his face tightened youd better not be trying to suggest edelweiss good heavens ralph the thought only drifted slightly through my mind the lab says the paper was sold to narcissists all over the worldit was apparently quite expensive but swiss paper a swissmade gun both in an insurance agency that is attracting a lot of attentionthe human mind isnt rational ralph it just puts contiguous events together and thats what mine is doing he looked at the paper now as if it were a cobra that had hypnotized him the buzzer on his desk phone sounded his secretary reminding him he was running late he jerked his head away with a visible effort you can leave this hereill have denise check the file to see if theres anything else in this handwriting in it right now i need to run to another meeting on reserves on our potential exposure from holocaust survivors and other matters worth a whole lot more than ten thousand dollars and than baseless accusations against edelweiss on my way down i stopped on the thirtyninth floor where claims processing took place unlike the executive floor with an attendant behind a mahogany console to monitor traffic there was no obvious person to ask the way to connie ingrams desk there also werent rosy chinese rugs floating on oceans of parquet hard mustard matting took me through a labyrinth of cubicles mostly empty because of the lunch hour near the south end of the floor i found someone sitting at her desk working the tribune crossword while she ate bean sprouts out of a plastic container she was a middleaged woman with tight dyed corkscrew curls but when she looked up she gave me a warm smile and asked what i needed connie ingram shes on the other side come on ill take you over its too hard to figure out where anyone in the maze is if youre not one of the rats yourself she slid her feet back into her pumps and took me across to the other side of the floor connie ingram was just returning to her desk with a group of other women they were giving the usual returntowork moans along with a few quick plans for the afternoon coffee break they welcomed me and my guide with friendly interest much better to have someone to talk to than stare at computer screens and files ms ingram i gave my own forthright girlfriends together smile im v i warshawskiwe met last week in ralph devereuxs office looking at the aaron sommers file her round face turned wary does mr rossy know youre here i held out my security pass turning my smile up a few watts im here at ralph devereuxs invitation do you want to call up to his secretary to ask or do you want me to call bertrand rossy to tell him what i need her coworkers ranged themselves around her protective inquisitive she muttered that she guessed that wasnt necessary but what did i want anyway to look at the file you know the agent who sold the policy is dead his copy of the file is missing i need to see the paperwork so i can try to figure out who filed the original death benefit claim mr devereux is considering the idea of paying the widow because of the confusion around the file the agents death and so on she flushed im sorry but mr rossy told me definitely not to show the file to anyone outside the company and anyway its still up on sixtythree how about the microfiche didnt you say you printed the documents from the fiche this is about an elderly woman who spent her life changing bedpans while her husband worked two shifts to make his premium payments if the policy was paid out because of a bookkeeping error or because the agent committed a swindle should this old woman have to suffer indignity on top of her bereavement instead of writing copy for ajax i could be putting out stuff for bull durham honestly its company policy not to show our files to outsiders you can ask my supervisor when she gets back from lunch im having dinner tonight with the rossys ill mention it to him then at that her face became even more troubled she liked to please people what if i and the allpowerful foreign boss were both angry with her but she was an honest young woman as well and in the end she stuck by the companys demands on her loyalty i didnt like itbut i certainly respected her for it i smiled my thanks for her time and left her with one of my cards in case she changed her mind xxvi hypnotic suggestion outside i turned the corner and went into the comparative quiet of the alley to check in with tim streeter he was at the zoo with calia radbuka had appeared in the park again as they were getting into tims car but tim had found him more annoying than alarming of course we both know that stalkers turn violent but at least as far as today went he seemed more bewildered than menacing he kept saying he only wanted a chance to speak to max to find out about his true family but calia started shrieking which brought agnes to the scene she yelled for the cops who did eventually come she saysid already taken off after him i did tell radbuka he would have to leave that max was swearing out a peace bond which meant he could be arrested for hanging around the premises i blinked is max doing that i called the hospital and told him he really should anyway everyone seems calm now agnes stayed at home to paint i called my brother and told him to get up to look after the house i wanted to get the kid out so that agnes doesnt freak thinking her daughters life is in imminent danger which it isnt guy is a nuisance but hes physically no match for any of us i frowned worried could he have followed you to the zoo no he was on a bike my brother phoned from the house half an hour ago to say he did a thorough search of maxs garden and the park across the street and didnt see any sign of radbuka hows calia now fine were looking at real walrusesim supposed to be getting tips on how to beg for fish seeing me cool keeps her cool a delivery truck backed into the alley its insistent beep making it impossible to hear anything else tim was saying i bellowed that id check at maxs later i skirted the edge of the truck feeling unusually ineffectual i hadnt made any progress on radbukas past i hadnt done anything for the sommers family lotty whose state was alarming me wouldnt talk to me rossys apartment was near hers on lake shore drive i supposed i could try to drop in on her tonight on my way to dinner but i couldnt think of a way to get her to confide in me i crossed michigan avenue to the statue garden by the art institute where i called the office to see whether mary louise was making any progress showing radbukas photo to neighbors of the various ulrich families listed around town shed been trying to dodge the assignment but when i told her about radbuka lurking around maxs she agreed we needed some kind of wedge if she could find someone who knew radbuka when he was still ulrich that might give us a starting point the easiest wedge would clearly come from getting rhea wiell to help out since i was in the loop already i decided to pay a surprise visit maybe shed be more responsive in person than on the phone and if she wouldnt give me background material on her patient maybe shed at least help come up with a strategy for controlling him i walked the length of michigan avenue to water tower place stopping partway up for something the shop called a vegetarian sandwich the mild day had drawn a throng of office workers outside for lunch i sat on a marble slab between a guy buried in a paperback and a couple of women who were smoking while denouncing someones horrible behavior in asking them to fill out a second set of time sheets the sandwich turned out to be a thick roll with a few slices of eggplant and peppers i crumbled up part of the roll for the sparrows who were pecking hopefully at my feet out of nowhere a dozen pigeons appeared trying to muscle the sparrows aside the guy with the paperback looked at me in disgust youre only encouraging pests you know he dogeared his page and got up i wonder if youre right i stood as well i always thought my work was keeping them at bay but you may be on to something his disgust changed to alarm and he turned hastily into the office building behind us i crumbled the rest of the bread for the birds it was almost one oclock morrell would be over the atlantic now away from land away from me i felt a little hollow below my diaphragm and increased my pace as if i could leave loneliness behind me at rhea wiells office a young woman was sitting in the waiting room her hands nervously clutching a cup of herbal tea i sat down and studied the fish in the aquarium while the woman darted suspicious looks at me what time is your appointment i asked onefifteen are youwhen is yours if my watch was right it wasnt quite ten after im a dropin im hoping ms wiell will have a break in her schedule this afternoon how long have you been seeing her has she been helpful very she didnt say anything else for a minute but as i continued to watch the fish and the silence built she added rheas helped me become aware of parts of my life that were shut away from me before ive never been hypnotized i said whats it like are you afraid i was too before my first session but its not like they show it in the movies its like riding an elevator down into the middle of your own past you can get off on these different floors and explore them only with the safety of having rhea right next to you instead ofwell being alone or being with the monsters who were there when you had to live through the time originally the door to the inner room opened the woman immediately turned to watch for rhea who came out with don strzepek the two were laughing in a kind of easy intimacy don looked wide awake while rhea instead of her flowing jacket and trousers had put on a red dress that fit snugly around the bodice when she saw me she flushed and withdrew slightly from don have you come to see me i have another appointment right now for the first time in our brief acquaintance her smile held genuine warmth i didnt take it personallyi knew it was the overflow from donbut it made my own response more natural something rather serious has come up i can wait until youre free but we ought to talk she turned to the waiting patient isabel im not going to start your session late but i need one moment alone with this woman when i moved with her to the entrance to her inner room don trailed after me paul radbuka has started stalking mr loewenthals family id like to talk to you about strategies for managing the situation stalking thats a fairly extreme criticism you may be misinterpreting his behavior but even if you are we definitely should discuss it she went behind her desk to look at her calendar i can fit you in at twothirty for fifteen minutes she nodded regally to me but when she glanced at don her expression softened again when she walked us out to the waiting area it was to him that she said ill see you at twothirty then looks as though things are going well with your book i said once we were out in the hall her work is fascinating don said i let her hypnotize me yesterday it was wonderful like floating in a warm ocean in a totally secure boat i watched him reflexively touch his breast pocket while we waited for an elevator have you stopped smoking or remembered buried secrets about your mother dont be sarcastic vic she put me in a light trance so i could see what it was like not a deeper one for memory recovery anyway she never uses a deeper trance until shes worked with a patient long enough to make sure they trust each other and to make sure the patients strong enough to survive the process arnold praeger and the planted memory guys will definitely be sorry theyve tried to trash her reputation when this book comes out shes put some kind of spell on you i teased as we rode to the lobby ive never heard you abandon journalistic caution before he flushed there are legitimate grounds for concern with any therapeutic method ill make that clear in the text this isnt an apology for rhea but a chance for people to understand the validity of recoveredmemory work ill give the planted memory camp their say but theyve never taken the time to understand rheas methods don had first met rhea wiell when i did four days ago and he was already a true believer i wondered why her spell didnt work on me when we met on friday shed realized i approached her with skepticism not dons admiration but she hadnt tried to charm me out of it id thought perhaps she didnt try as hard with women as with men but the young patient in the waiting room was clearly also a votary was mary louise right did rhea and i instinctively distrust each other because we both wanted to command the situation or was my gut telling me there was a problem with rhea i didnt think she was a charlatan but i did wonder if a steady diet of adulation from people like paul radbuka had gone to her head earth to vicfor the third time do you want coffee while we wait i realized with a jolt that we were standing outside the elevators on the ground floor is that what hypnosis is like i asked you become so lost in your own space that you lose awareness of the outside world don steered me outside so he could light a cigarette youre asking a novice but i think they consider losing yourself like that akin to a trance its called imaginative dissociation something like that i stood upwind from him while he finished his cigarette checking in again first with tim streeter who said there was nothing new to report and then with my answering service by the time id returned a couple of client calls don was ready to move into the hotel for a cup of coffee in the treefilled terrace at the ritz i got him to give me a digest of the research hed been doing the last four days he had a wealth of data about the way in which hypnosis had been used to treat people with traumatic symptoms one man whod had terrible fantasies about having his neck wrenched off his shoulders turned out to have seen his mother hanging herself when he was three his father was able to confirm all the details that the son produced under hypnosis the father had never discussed them with his son hoping that the boy had been too young to understand what he was watching there were also plenty of documented cases of people hearing what was said around them under total anesthesia and being able to reconstruct whole operatingroom conversations through hypnosis rhea herself had worked with a number of incest victims whose memories recovered under hypnosis had been validated by siblings or other adults were going to be using several pairs in one chapterthe holder of memory and the suppressor of memory but of course the most interesting chapter will be about radbuka so neither rhea nor i is at all happy to have you questioning the validity of what hes saying i rested my chin on my hands and looked at him squarely don i dont doubt the value of hypnosis or the validity of recovered memories under certain strict guidelines i sit on the board of a womens shelter and ive witnessed the phenomenon myself but in radbukas case its a question of who he isemotionally and well genealogically for want of a better word max loewenthal isnt lying when he says the radbukas arent related to him but paul radbuka so desperately wants the relationship to exist that he cant pay attention to reality i can understand it understand how growing up with an abusing father would make him reach out to other relatives if i could just have access to some background information about him i might be able to track down whereif at allhis life intersects with any of maxs london circle but he doesnt want you to have that information he called rhea at noon while i was with her to say you were doing everything you could to bar him from his family he implored her not to give you any details about him that explains why shes so cold to me im sure its to her credit that shes so protective of her patients but you were at maxs on sundayyou saw what radbuka was like even assuming all the things he remembered in hypnosis are trueit doesnt mean hes related to max just because he wants that to be so i tried to lighten the conversation by adding that would bring rheas work to the level of timothy leary on acid talking to his chromosomes to recover his previous incarnations vic don protested you really mustnt reduce this kind of therapy to a jay leno routine a week ago i might have made the same kind of cheap joke butif youd seen this process up close learned about the kinds of things people grapple with as they unblock the pastyoud be more respectful i guarantee it in the case of radbuka too rhea knows the guy has a lot of problems shes genuinely worried about what youre trying to do to him i looked at my watch and signaled for the check don i know youve only met me a few times during this past year but do you think your friend morrell would be in love with me if i was the kind of monster who deliberately drove a wedge between a war orphan and his family don smiled ruefully oh hell vic of course not but youre very close to loewenthal and his friends your own judgment could be distorted by your desire to protect them i was tempted to believe rhea wiell had given don some posthypnotic suggestion to eschew me and all my works but the real spell came from a deeper more fundamental source i realized watching his eyes light up when i said it was time to cross back over to the office building as my father used to say never try to stop a man with an ax or a man in love xxvii new disciple by the time i finished my conversation with rhea i was ready to bonk her on the head and take my chances on a selfdefense plea id started with the premise that we all wanted what was best for the main players in our little drama and that this meant not just paul but calia and agnes as well rhea gave one of those regal nods that made me want to revert to my streetfighting roots i concentrated on a painting of a japanese farmyard that hung above her couch and told her about pauls two attempts to accost calia the family is starting to feel as though theyre being stalked i said mr loewenthals lawyer wants him to swear out a peace bond but i thought if you and i talked we might head off an extreme confrontation i dont believe paul would stalk anyone rhea said hes not only very gentle but hes easily frightened im not saying he wasnt at maxs house she added as i started to object but i imagine him standing in the park like the little match girl in the fairy tale longing to be part of the festivities he can see through the window while none of the rich children will acknowledge his existence i smiled still on my best behavior unfortunately calia is a fiveyearoldan age where frightened needy grownups are terrifying her mother is understandably alarmed because she thinks someone might be threatening her child when paul comes out of the bushes at the two of them it scares them both his longing for a family may be making it hard for him to see how his behavior could appear to other people rhea bent her head a swanlike gesture that seemed to have a hint of acquiescence in it but why wont max loewenthal acknowledge him i wanted to scream because theres nothing to acknowledge you fatheaded fleabrain but i leaned forward with an expression of great earnestness mr loewenthal truly is not related to your client this morning he showed me the file he kept from his search for missing families in postwar europe the file includes a letter from the person who asked him to hunt for the radbukas on sunday when paul crashed his party mr loewenthal offered to go over these papers with him but paul didnt want to make an appointment for a more convenient time im sure mr loewenthal would still be glad for paul to see the papers if he thought that would set his mind at rest have you seen these documents don rhea turned to him with a touching display of female fragility if you could take a look at them if you agree withwith vic i would feel better don swelled slightly at her trust in him i tried not to make a mocking grimace but said i felt sure that max would want things done as quickly as possible i have a dinner engagement this evening but if dons free i can ask max to meet with him i added in the meantime it would be shocking if paul were arrested because of this unhappy misunderstanding so could you suggest that he stay away from the house until he hears from mr loewenthal if we could have a phone number where mr loewenthal could reach him rhea shook her head a contemptuous little smile at the corners of her mouth you really dont give up do you i am not going to let you have my clients home number or address he sees you as the person whos keeping him from his family if you were to show up on his front step it would be a major disintegrating event to his fragile sense of self i felt all the muscles in my neck clench with the effort not to lose my temper openly im not challenging the work youve done with him rhea but if i could see the documents he found in his fathersfoster fatherspapers i could use them to track down who in london might have been part of his family the journey he thinks he made from his unknown birthplace to terezin and then to london and chicago is so tortuous that we might never be able to follow it but at least the documents that told him his birth name might give a skilled investigator a place to start you say youre not challenging my work but in the next sentence you refer to the journey paul thinks he made this is a journey he did make even though the details were blocked from his conscious mind for fifty years like you i am a skilled investigator but one with greater experience than you in exploring the past the discreet temple bell chimed she turned to look at a clock on her desktop i need to clear my mind of all this conflict before my next patient arrives ill be certain to tell paul that he can only expect hostility if he keeps trying to see max loewenthal that will be helpful to all of us i said i have someone showing radbukas photograph to neighbors of families named ulrich in the hopes of finding his childhood home so if he reports back to you that someone is spying on himits true families named ulrich why would you want she broke off her dark soft eyes widening first in bewilderment then amusement if thats your best investigative effort vic then paul radbuka is definitely safe from you i studied her for a moment chin on hand trying to decipher what lay behind her amusement so ulrich wasnt his fathers name after all ill keep that in mind don where should i leave a message for you about whether max is free to talk to you tonight at morrells ill ride down with you vic give rhea a chance to center herself i have a cellphone number i can give you he got up with me but lingered inside her consulting room for a private leavetaking as i left i noticed another young woman in the waiting room looking eagerly toward the inner door it was a pity rhea and i had gotten off to such a bad start i would have liked to experience her hypnotic techniques to see whether they gave me the same rush they did her patients don caught up with me outside the elevators when i asked if he knew what the inside joke was about the name ulrich he shifted uncomfortably not exactly not exactly you mean you know sort of only that it wasnt his fathersfoster fatherslast name not what the name really was and dont ask me to find out rhea wont tell me because she knows youll try to wheedle it out of me i guess i should feel flattered that she thinks id be able to give me your cellphone number ill call max and get back to you but i have to run like rhea i need to center myself before my next appointment in the l going back to my car i called mary louise to tell her she didnt have to go doortodoor with radbukas picture after all i couldnt recap the whole conversation over the noise of the train but told her that it apparently wasnt his childhood name she had started south working her way west and north and had only reached her third address so she was happy to call it a day as i picked up my car at the western l stop i wondered idly what would happen if rhea wiell hypnotized lotty where would an elevator to the past take lotty from her behavior on sunday the monsters on those lower floors were pretty ferocious it seemed to me though that lottys problem wasnt that she couldnt remember her monsters but that she couldnt forget them i stopped in the office to check on mail and messages and whether i had any appointments for tomorrow that id forgotten a couple of new things had come up i entered them into my computer and pulled out my palm pilot to download them to the handheld device as i did so i suddenly thought of fepples mother telling me her gadgethappy son used a device like mine for a diary if hed kept his appointments up to date they should still be sitting in that machine in his office and i had a key i could go in happy and legal with the implicit consent of rhonda fepple i quickly returned a few phone calls looked at my email pulled up the missing persons bulletin board to see that questing scorpio hadnt answered my message and went south again to hyde park collins the fourtomidnight guard recognized me got some other tenants here we could do without if you want a hit list he said with heavy humor as i passed i smiled weakly and rode up to the sixth floor i had a hard time getting myself to open the door not because of the yellow crimescene tape sealing it but because i didnt want to face the remains of fepples life again i took a breath and tried the handle a woman in a nurses uniform heading to the elevator stopped to watch me the police or the building management had locked the office i took out my key and unlocked the door breaking the yellow tape as i pushed it open i thought that meant you cant go in the woman said you thought right but im a detective she walked over to peer around me into the room then backed away her face turning grey oh my god is that what happened in there oh my god if this is what can go on in this building im getting a job at the hospital hours or no hours this is terrible i was just as appalled as she was even though i more or less knew what to expect fepples body was gone but no one had bothered to clean up after him pieces of brain and bone had hardened on the chair and desk those werent visible from the door but what you could see was the mess of papers and on top of it grey fingerprint powder showing up nests of footprints on the floor the powder had drifted like dirty snow onto the desk the computer the strewn papers i thought briefly of poor rhonda fepple trying to sort through the wreckage i hoped she had the sense to hire help the police hadnt bothered to shut down the computer using a kleenex to protect my fingers i hit the enter key and brought the system back up i couldnt bring myself to sit on fepples chair or even touch it so i leaned across the desk to operate the keyboard even in my awkward posture it only took a few minutes to retrieve his computer datebook on friday hed had a dinner date with connie ingram hed even added a note says she wants to discuss sommers but she sounds hot for me i printed out the entry and scuttled out of the office as fast as i could move the foul scene the fetid air the horrible image of connie ingram sounding hot for fepple all made me feel like throwing up again i found a womens bathroom which was locked i stuck fepples door key in which didnt turn the lock but did get someone on the inside to open it for me i swayed over one of the sinks washing my face in cold water rinsing my mouth pushing the worst of the images out of my mindaway from my stomach connie ingram the earnest roundfaced claims clerk whose company loyalty wouldnt let me look at her files or who was so loyal that she would date a recalcitrant agent and set him up for a hit a sudden rage the culmination of the weeks frustrations swept over me rhea wiell fepple himself my vacillating client even lottyi was fed up with all of them and most of all with ralph and ajax chewing me out for the durham protest stiffing me over my request to see the company copy of aaron sommerss fileand staging this charade which theyd botched by stealing the guys handheld but not wiping the entry out of the computer i shoved open the bathroom door and stalked to the elevator the blood roaring in my head i zoomed to lake shore drive honking impatiently at any car daring to turn in front of me swooping through lights as they turned redbehaving like a mad idiot on the drive i covered the five miles to the grant park traffic lights in five minutes the evening rush hour had built in the park stalling me i earned the irate whistle of a traffic cop by cutting recklessly around the stack of cars onto one of the side roads flooring the car up to the inner drive as i got to the corner of michigan and adams i had to stand on the brakes the street was a mass of honking unmoving cars now what i wasnt going to get near the ajax building in my car with this kind of blockage i made an illegal and highly dangerous uturn and roared back to the inner drive by now id had so many nearmisses i was coming to my senses i could hear my father lecturing me on the dangers of driving under the influence of rage in fact once when hed caught me in the act hed made me come with him when he had to untangle a crumpled teenager from the steering wheel through his chest the memory of that made me take the next few blocks sedately i left the car in an underground garage and walked north to the ajax building as i got to adams street the congestion built this wasnt the normal throng of homebound workers but a pennedup crowd i threaded my way into it with difficulty moving along the edges of the buildings through the jam of people i could hear the megaphones the protestors had come back to life no deals with slaveowners they were shouting mixed with no money to mass murderers economic justice for all vied with boycott ajax no deals with thieves so posner had arrived in full throttle by the sound of it and durham had apparently come to rally his own troops in person no wonder the street was backed up sidling past the crowd i climbed up the steps to the adams l platform so that i could see what was going on it wasnt quite the mob that had created havoc outside the hotel pleiades last week but besides posner with his maccabees and durham with the eye team there were a couple of camera crews and a lot of unhappy people who wanted to get home these last pushed against me on the l steps snarling at both groups i dont care what happened a hundred years ago i want to get home today one woman was saying to her companions yeah durham s got a point but no ones going to pay attention to it if he makes you pay overtime to the day care because you cant get there on time and that other guy that one in the funny hat and the curls and all whats his problem hes saying ajax stole life insurance from the jews but it all happened a long time ago so who cares i had thought id call ralph from the street but there was no way i could carry on a phone conversation in this melee i climbed down from the platform and made my way along wabash past the cops who were trying to keep traffic moving past the entrances to ajax where security guards were letting frustrated commuters out one at a time around the corner on jackson to the alley behind the building where the buildings had their loading bays the one for ajax was still open i hoisted myself up to the metal lip where trucks decanted cargo and went inside an overweight man in ajax s blue security uniform slid off a stool in front of a large console filled with tv screens showing the alley and the building you lost im a fraud investigator ralph devereuxthe head of claimswants to talk to me but the mob out front is making it impossible to get near the front entrance he looked me over decided i didnt look like a terrorist and called up to ralphs office with my name he grunted a few times into the mouthpiece then jerked his head to bring me over to the phone hello ralph how glad i am youre still here we need to have a little conversation about connie ingram we do indeed i wasnt going to call you until tomorrow but since youre here well talk now and dont imagine you can come up with any excuse that will make your behavior acceptable i love you too ralph ill be right up the guard tapped the screens on the console to show me my route a door at the rear of the loading bay led to a corridor which would take me to the main lobby once inside i paused on my way to the elevators to stare at the dueling demonstrators durham this time in executive navy had the larger crowd but posner was controlling the chanting as his little band of maccabees circled past the door i stood transfixed standing at posners left elbow his childlike face beaming underneath his thinning curls was paul radbuka xxviii old lovers quarrel the elevator whooshed me to sixtythree so fast my ears filled but i barely noticed the discomfort paul radbuka with joseph posner but why should i be startled in a way it was a natural fit two men obsessed with memories of the war with their identity as jews what could be more likely than that theyd get together the executivefloor attendant had left for the day i went to the windows behind her mahogany station where i could see past the art institute to the lake at the far horizon the soft blue became lost in clouds so you couldnt tell where water ended and sky began it looked almost artificial that horizon as if some painter had started to stroke in a dirtywhite sky and then lost interest in the project i was due at the rossys at eight it was just on five now i wondered if i could tail radbuka home from herealthough perhaps hed be going back to posners house tonight maybe hed found a family who would take him in nurture him in the way he seemed to need maybe hed start leaving max alone vic what are you doing out here you called from the loading dock fifteen minutes ago ralphs angry anxious voice jolted me back to the present he was in shirtsleeves his tie loosened his eyes worried underneath his angry facade it was the worry that made me keep my own voice level when i answered him admiring the view it would be wonderful to leave all this turmoil and follow the horizon wouldnt it i know why im peeved about connie ingram but i dont have any idea whats got you so upset what did you do with the microfiche oolulah vishti banko his mouth set in a thin line what the hell is that supposed to mean your question made just as little sense to me i dont know any microfiche personally or by reputation so youd better start at the beginning i broke off dont tell me your microfiche for the sommers file is damaged very nice vic surprised innocence im almost convinced at that my calm disappeared i pushed past him to the elevator and hit the call button where are you going home i bit off my words i wanted to ask you why connie ingram was the last person to see howard fepple alive and why she made him think shed be a hot date and why after that really hot date fepple was dead and the agency copy of sommerss file had vanished but i dont need the garbage youre flinging at me i can take my questions directly to the cops believe me theyll talk to little miss company loyalty in a way that will get her to respond the elevator dinged to a stop behind me before i could get on ralph grabbed my arm since youre already here give me two more minutes i want you to talk to someone in my office if i lose my chance to tail a guy whos in your demonstration i am going to be one very cross detective ralph so make it succinct for me okay which raises another question in my mind why are you focusing on your wretched microfiche when the building is under siege he ignored my question moving fast along the rosy carpets to his office his secretary denise was still at her post connie ingram and a strange black woman were sitting stiffly on the tubular chairs they looked nervously at ralph when we came in ralph introduced the strange womankaren bigelow who was connies supervisor in claims just tell vic here what you told me karen she nodded turning to face me i know about the whole sommers situation i was on vacation last week but connie explained how shed had to leave the file up here with mr rossy and how this private detective might try to get her to reveal confidential company information so when shewhen youcame around asking to see the fiche connie came straight to me neither of us was too surprised as you know of course connie here stood her ground but she got kind of worried and went to check the microfiche the card that included the sommers file has gone missing not checked out or anything disappeared and i understand you were alone on the floor for some time miss i smiled pleasantly i see i have to confess i dont know where the fiche are stored or you might have legitimate grounds for suspicion to you who knows that rabbit warren on thirtynine its all familiar but to a stranger its impenetrable but theres one easy thing to do check for fingerprints mine are on file with the secretary of state because im a licensed investigator as well as an officer of the court get the cops in treat it like a real theft the room was silent for a minute then ralph said if you were in that cabinet vic youd have wiped it clean all the more reason to dust it if its covered with printsbesides connies which belong there since she just checked the draweror claims she didyoull know i wasnt in there what do you mean claims she did miss detective karen bigelow gave me a hard look its like this ms supervisor i dont know what kind of game ajax is playing with the sommers family claim but its a game whose stakes are mighty high now that a mans been killed fepples mother gave me a key to the agency office i went down there today to see if i could find any trace of his appointment calendar i paused to stare hard at connie ingram but her round face didnt show any special anxiety now whoever killed howard fepple swiped the sommers file they swiped his handheld electronic diary but they didnt think to wipe out the appointment from his computer orthey were even more squeamish than i was about getting near the machine since it had his brains and blood all over it both bigelow and connie flinched at that which only proved they didnt like the idea of brains and blood and computers all mixed together well guess who had an appointment with howard fepple last friday night young connie ingram here her mouth widened in a giant o of protest i never i never made an appointment to see him if he put that in his diary hes lying someone is i agreed i was with him friday afternoon and some very sophisticated person gave him a simple but slick method for ditching me this person came back in with him under cover of a group of lamaze parents and left with them probably after killing him connie ingram is the only appointment he showed for friday and next to it hed written says she wants to discuss sommers but she sounds hot for me i pulled the diary printout from my bag and waved it at her he wrote that down about me i only ever talked to him on the phone to ask him to doublecheck about the payment and that was last week right after you first came here mr rossy asked me to i live at home i live with my mother i would neveri never made that kind of phone call she buried her face in her hands crimson with shame ralph snatched the printout from me he looked at it then tossed it contemptuously aside i have a palm you can enter events after the dateanyone could have typed that in including you vic to deflect criticism away from your helping yourself to our microfiche another thing for technicians to look at i snapped you can backenter dates but you cant fool the machine it will tell you what day those keystrokes were typed it seems to me weve just about covered anything useful here i need to get these technical problems to the cops before little miss innocence here goes down and wipes out the hard drive tears were streaming down connies face karen mr devereux honest i was never down in that agents office i never said id go out with him even though he asked me to why would i he didnt sound like a nice person on the phone he asked you out on a date i interrupted her wailing when was that when i called down there after you were here last week i called him like i said like mr rossy and mr devereux asked me to to find out what he had in his files and he said he talked in this kind of nasty way he said lots of juicy stuff wouldnt you like to see it we could share a bottle of wine and go over the file together and i said no sir i just want you to send me copies of all your relevant documents so i can find out how this policy got a check issued on it when the policyholder was still alive and then he said more stuff really i cant repeat it and he seemed to think it would be fun to have a date but honestly i know i still live with my mother and im thirtythree but im not a desperate virgin likeanyway i never said i would see him if he put it in his calendar he was a liar and im not sorry hes dead so there she ran sobbing from the room does that satisfy you miss detective karen bigelow said coldly seems to me you could find something better to do than bully an honest hardworking girl like connie ingram excuse me mr devereux id better make sure shes all right she started to sail majestically from the room but i moved to block her path ms claims supervisor its great that you support your staff but you came up here to accuse me of theft before you go off to mop up connie ingrams tears i want that accusation cleared up she breathed heavily at me i heard from the girl who took you over to connies workstation that you were wandering around the floor you could have been in those files then well call the cops i wont have this kind of accusation made lightly about me besides which someone is trying to make sure no copies of that file remain i may be advising my client to sue ajax in which case if you cant find the documents youre going to look mighty stupid in court if thats your goal youd have all the more motive for stealing the fiche ralph said red lights of anger were starting to dance in front of me and ill bring an action for slander i moved to his desk and started pressing keys on the phone it had been a long time since id dialed the work number for my dads oldest friend on the force but i still knew it by heart bobby mallory has made a reluctant adjustment to my career as a detective but he still prefers that when we meet it be for family events what do you think youre doing ralph demanded as an officer answered the phone im doing what you should have done calling the cops i turned to the phone officer bostwick its v i warshawski is captain mallory in ralphs eyes glittered you have no authority to bring the cops into this building i will speak to this officer and tell him so it was a sign of the change in bobbys attitude toward me that although id never met officer bostwick he recognized my name he told me that bobby was unavailable was there a message a murder in the twentyfirst district officertheres evidence in the computer which was left running and left in the vics office i gave him fepples address and date of death commander purling may not have realized the importance of the computer but im at the ajax insurance company where the vic did a lot of business and there may be a question of checking the time when data was entered ajax bostwick said theyre having a lot of trouble these days durham and posner are out front right now arent they yes indeed the building is surrounded by demonstrators but the claims vice president thinks this agents death merits more of his attention than a few protesters doesnt sound like a few to me miss the way they were asking for backup out there on adams but give me the details about this computerill make sure a forensics unit gets down to it commander purling well with the robert taylor homes in his district he doesnt have time to do a lot of finesse work a discreet way of saying the guy was a lazy jerk i gave bostwick the details about fepple and the importance of the date adding that i had seen the victim shortly before he left for an appointment on friday evening bostwick repeated back what i said doublechecked the spelling of my name and asked where captain mallory could reach me if he wanted to discuss the situation i hung up and glared at ralph im respecting the privacy of your company and your authority over it but you had damned well better make a call like that yourself if you want to find out who really was in your microfiche cabinet especially if youre going to keep accusing me of theft we should know by the end of the day tomorrow or thursday at the latest when that date with connie ingram was entered in fepples computer if it was before i last saw him on friday then ms ingrams going to be crying for a bigger audience than us by the way what happened to your paper file the one rossy hung on to last week ralph and karen bigelow exchanged startled glances i guess he still has it the supervisor said it hasnt been checked back into our unit is his office up here lets go ask him about itunless you think i wandered in and stole it after we spoke at noon ralph he flushed no i dont imagine you did but why did you go down to the thirtyninth floor at noon without telling me youd been with me seconds earlier it was an impulse it only occurred to me when i got to the elevators you had pretty much stiffed me on the file and i was hoping ms ingram would let me see it can we at least go see rossy get the paper file back from him the chairman went down to springfield today the holocaust recovery act is coming up in front of the banking and insurance committeehe wanted to testify against it rossy went with him really my brows went up hed invited me to dinner tonight whatd he do that for ralphs flush deepened into resentment when he called yesterday to invite me he said it was because his wife was homesick and wanted someone she could speak italian with are you making that up no ralph im not making up anything i said this afternoon but maybe he forgot about the invitation when did he decide to go to springfield resentment was still uppermost in ralphs mind hey i just run the claims department apparently not too well if people make off with our files no one talks to me about deep subjects like legislative hearings rossys got an office on the other side of the floor his secretarys probably here you can ask her if hes coming back tonight ill walk you over to see if hes still got the file i should find connie mr devereux karen bigelow said but what should i do about the microfiche should i report the theft to security ralph hesitated then told her she should lock the cabinet and declare it offlimits conduct a deskbydesk search of your unit tomorrow someone may have inadvertently kept the fiche after looking up some other file if you dont find it by the end of the day let me know ill call security look you two i said impatient with this futile proposal connies name in fepples calendar is serious if she didnt set up the date someone did it using her name which means it was someone who knows her as a claims handler and that means a very limited universe especially since it wasnt me ralph knotted his tie and unrolled his cuffs according to you anyway xxix strange bedfellows we found rossys secretary in the chairmans conference room watching the earlyevening news with the chairmans secretary the head of the marketing departmentwhom id met at ajaxs hundredfiftiethbirthday celebrationand five other people who were never introduced we are demanding a boycott of all ajax insurance by america s jewish community posner was proclaiming to the camera preston janoff insulted the whole jewish community he insulted the sacred memories of the dead by his remarks in springfield today beth blacksins face replaced posners on the screen preston janoff is the chairman of the ajax insurance group he testified today against adoption of a bill that would require lifeinsurance companies to scan their books to see if they have any outstanding obligations to families of holocaust victims the camera switched to janoff standing in front of the legislative chamber in springfield he was tall silverhaired somber in a charcoal suit that suggested but didnt emphasize mourning we understand the pain of those who lost loved ones in the holocaust but we believe it would be an insult to the africanamerican to the native american and to other communities who have suffered greatly in this country to single out for special treatment people whose families were killed in europe and ajax did not sell life insurance in europe in the decades before the second world war for us to turn our files inside out on the off chance that one or two policies might come to light would place an extraordinary burden on our shareholders one of the legislators rose to ask if it wasnt true that edelweiss re of switzerland was now the owner of ajax our committee wants to know about edelweisss lifeinsurance policies janoff held up a copy of amy blounts history one hundred fifty years of life and still going strong i believe this booklet will show the committee that edelweiss was a small regional player in the lifeinsurance business in switzerland during the war the company has made copies available to all members of the legislature again any involvement with consumers in germany or eastern europe would have been very small a babble erupted as various members sprang to their microphones but the program returned us to the global studio where murray ryerson who occasionally did political commentary for global was speaking later this afternoon the house insurance committee voted eleventotwo to table the proposed bill which effectively kills it joseph posner has been leafletting telephoning and picketing in an effort to start a nationwide boycott of all ajax insurance products in retaliation its too early to tell if hes succeeding but we have heard that the birnbaum family will continue to use ajax for their workers compensation coverage business reputedly worth sixtythree million dollars in premiums to ajax this year alderman louis durham hailed janoffs speech and the vote with mixed reactions we were treated to a closeup of durham outside the ajax building in his beautifully cut jacket ideally we want to see compensation for victims of african slavery in this country or at the very least in this state but we appreciate chairman janoffs sensitivity to the issue to not letting jews dominate a discussion of reparations in illinois we will take our fight for reparations for the victims of slavery directly to the legislature now and we will fight until we win when the evening news anchor sitting next to murray in the studio came on the screen saying in other news the cubs lost their thirteenth straight today at wrigley janoffs secretary switched off the set this is wonderful newsmr janoff will be terrifically pleased she said he hadnt heard the vote when he and mr rossy left springfield chick can you go online and find out who voted with us ill call him in his car he was going straight from meigs to a dinner meeting a freshfaced young man obediently left the room was mr rossy going to dinner with him i asked the rest of the room turned to stare at me as if i had dropped in from pluto rossys secretary an extremely glossy specimen with shiny black hair and a tailored navy dress asked who i was and why i wanted to know i introduced myself explaining that rossy had invited me to dinner in his home this evening when rossys secretary took me back to her own desk to check her calendar the room started buzzing behind us if id been invited to the rossy home i must be powerful they needed to know who i was rossys secretary tapped rapidly across the corridor on very high heels ralph and i trailed in her wake yes ms warshawski i remember getting your number for mr rossy yesterday morning but he didnt tell me hed invited you to dinnerits not in my book shall i check with mrs rossy for you she is the decisionmaker on his social calendar her hand was already poised over the phone she hit a speeddial button talked briefly with mrs rossy and assured me that they were expecting me suzanne ralph said as she started to pack up her desk bertrand took a claims file away to study last week were anxious to get it backtheres an open investigation going on with it suzanne tapped into rossys inner office and came back almost immediately with the sommers file im so sorry mr devereux he left a message in his dictation that i was to get this back to you but he decided at the last minute to go to springfield with mr janoff in the flurry of getting him down there the file slipped my mind mr rossy wanted to make sure you knew how much he appreciated the work connie ingram did for him on this ralph grunted unenthusiastically he didnt want to admit doubts about his staff but my finding connie ingrams name in fepples diary was clearly troubling him i know connie ingram was helpful in tracking down the agents copy of the paper trail on this file i said did mr rossy ask her to call on fepplethe agentin person suzanne lifted her perfectly tweezed eyebrows as if astonished that a peon would try to worm her bosss secrets out of her youd have to ask mr rossy that perhaps youll have a chance to do so at dinner really vic ralph spluttered as we got back to his office what are you trying to suggest that connie ingram was involved in killing an insurance agent that rossy somehow ordered her to do it get a grip on yourself i thought of connie ingrams round earnest face and had to admit she didnt seem likely either as a murderer or a murderers tool but i want to know how her name got into fepples diary if she didnt make the appointment or if she didnt go down herself to his office and backenter it i added stubbornly ralph bared his teeth in a snarl i wouldnt put it past you to do it if you thought that would get you in the door that brings us back to where we started why dont you let me thumb through the sommers file so i can get out of here and leave you in peace somehow peace is not what you ever leave me in v i there was just enough of a double edge to his tone that i hastily took the file from him and started thumbing through the contents he stood over me while i carefully looked at each page i couldnt see anything odd either in the client payment reports or the claimpayment record aaron sommers had started paying weekly installments on may and had paid the policy in full in then a death claim signed by the widow and notarized had been filed in september and duly paid a few days later there were two copies of the canceled checkthe one connie had originally printed from the fiche and one which fepple had faxed to her from his files they looked identical a copy of rick hoffmans worksheet where hed typed up the figures for the weekly payments was attached to a letter to ajax alerting them to the sale i had hoped the signature would be in the same ornate writing as the document id found in fepples briefcase but it was a very ordinary nondescript hand ralph inspected each document as i finished with it i guess its okay he said when we got to the end guess is there something wrong he shook his head but he still looked puzzled everythings here everythings in order its like ten thousand other claim folders ive inspected in the last twenty years i dont know why something doesnt seem quite right you run along im going to stand over denise while she copies every document so that there are two witnesses to the contents it was after six now in the event that posner was still out front i wanted to get downstairs to see if i could pick up radbukas trail i was almost at the elevators when ralph caught up with me vicsorry i was out of line earlier but the coincidence of you being on the floor the fiche missing and knowing that you sometimes use well unorthodox methods i made a wry face youre right ralph but i really swear scouts honor that i was nowhere near your fiche i wish i knew what in hell was so important about this one lousy lifeinsurance case he slammed the flat of his hand against the elevator wall the agent who sold itrick hoffmanhes been dead for seven years now would the company still have a record of his home address his family anything about him he had a songuy whod be i dont know close to sixty nowmaybe he has papers that would shed some light on the situation it was a straw but we didnt have any more substantial building material right now ralph pulled a small notebook from his breast pocket and scribbled a note i start the afternoon accusing you of theft and end it as your errand boy ill see what i can find out i wish you hadnt called the cops though now theyll be around wanting to interrogate connie who i refuse to believe killed the guy she might have shot himif she had a gunif shed agreed to go see himand if hed stepped across the line but can you picture her scheming to make a murder look like suicide ive always been way too impulsive ralph butyou cant fling accusations at me without something more to go on than my unorthodox methods also you need to face the fact that someone was in that drawer your and ms bigelows solution is a bandaid the team investigating fepples murder should know that someone stole that microfiche you should get them in here regardless of the pr consequences as for connie ingram she should answer those questions but you can show youre a good guy by alerting ajax s legal team make sure senior counsel is with her when shes questioned she seems to trust ms bigelow have bigelow sit in on the interrogation a lot will hinge on when her name was entered into fepples computer and whether she has an alibi for last friday night the elevator door pinged as i got on ralph asked me casually where id been on friday night with friends who will vouch for me your friends would vic ralph said sourly cheer up i put a hand in between the doors to keep them from closing connie ingrams mother will do the same for her and ralph trust your instinct on that sommers file if your sixth sense is telling you something isnt quite right try to figure it out will you the street was quiet by the time i reached the lobby the bulk of homebound commuters were gone making it pointless for posner and durham to parade their troops a few extra cops lingered at the intersection but except for flyers scattered along the curb there was no sign of the mob that had been here when i arrived id missed a chance to tail radbuka home radbuka whose fathers name hadnt been ulrich on my way to the garage i stopped in a doorway to call max partly to tell him i didnt think radbuka would be around tonight partly to see if hed be willing to show don the papers about his search for the radbuka family this streeter fellow is very good with the little one max said its been a big help to have him here i think well ask him to stay on tonight even if you know that this man calling himself radbuka wont be coming around you should keep tim no question i cant guarantee radbuka wont bother you just that hes attached himself to joseph posner for the moment i saw him marching with posner outside the ajax building an hour agoand im betting thats making him feel accepted enough to keep him away from you overnightbut hes a loose cannon he could come shooting back i told him about my meeting with rhea wiell shes the one person who seems able to exercise some control over him but for some reason she isnt willing to if you let don look at your notes from your difficult trip to europe after the war he might persuade her that you really arent related to paul radbuka when max agreed i left a message on dons cellphone voice mail telling him he should call max it was sixthirtynot enough time for me to go home or to my office before dinner maybe i would try to drop in on lotty after all before going to the rossys sixthirty here onethirty in the morning in rome where morrell would be just about landing hed spend tomorrow in rome with the humane medicine team fly to islamabad on thursday and travel by land into afghanistan for a moment i felt bowed down by desolation my fatigue maxs worries lottys turmoiland morrell half a world away i was too alone in this big city a homeless man selling copies of streetwise danced over to me hawking his paper what he saw in my face made him change his pitch honey whatevers happening to you it cant be that bad you got a roof over your head right you got three squares a day when you take the time to eat them even if your mamas dead you know she loved youso cheer up ah the kindness of strangers i said fishing a single out of my jacket pocket thats right nothing kinder than strangers nothing stranger than kindness you heard it here first you have a blessed evening and keep that pretty smile coming i wont say he sent me on my way laughing with delight but i did manage to whistle whenever i feel afraid as i walked down the steps to the garage i took lake shore drive north to belmont where i got off and started nosing around for a parking place lotty lived half a mile up the road but street parking is at such a premium here that i grabbed the first space i saw it turned out to be a lucky opening only half a block from the rossys front door i had kept deferring phoning lotty on my way north i wouldnt do it from the street downtown because i didnt want background noise interfering i wouldnt do it from the car because its dangerous to drive and dial nowid do it as soon as id shut my eyes for five minutes emptied my mind gotten the illusion of rest so i could be strong enough for whatever emotional fastballs lotty pitched at me i pulled the lever so that the front seat was stretched almost horizontal as i leaned back i saw a limo pull up in front of rossys building i watched idly wondering if it was rossy being dropped at home by ajax s chairman ecstatic over todays favorable vote in springfield janoff and rossy would take a limo back from meigs field sharing a drink and a merry laugh in the backseat when no one got out after several minutes i lost interestthe car was waiting to pick up someone from the building rossy must be pretty ecstatic himself over todays vote edelweiss re had acquired ajax to serve as their us beachhead they wouldnt have been pleased at all if illinois had voted that they had to scour their records hunting out policies sold to people who were murdered in europea search like that would have cost a tidy bundle ajax must have tossed a fair amount of cash at the legislature to get the vote to go their waybut i suppose they figured that was cheaper than opening up their lifeinsurance book to public scrutiny of course it wasnt likely that ajax had sold many policies in central or eastern europe in the s unless they had a subsidiary that had done a lot of business there which i didnt think was the case insurance like most business had been regional before the second world war still edelweiss itself might have had a holocaust exposure but as ajax chairman janoff had contended today waving amy blounts history at the legislature edelweiss had only been a small regional player before the war i wondered idly how theyd turned into the international giant they were today maybe theyd made out like bandits during the war itselfthere must have been a lot of money to be made insuring all the chemicals and optics and crap the swiss produced for the german war effort not that it was relevant to the bill that the state was considering which only dealt with life insurance but people vote emotions not facts if someone showed that edelweiss had gotten rich on the third reichs war machine the legislature would punish them by making them open their lifeinsurance files the limo driver opened his door and stood up i blinked it was a chicago cop someone from the city on official business was up here when the building door swung open i sat up looking to see if the mayor was coming out the man who actually emerged made my jaw drop id seen that bullet head and perfectly tailored navy jacket downtown only two hours ago alderman louis bull durham a lot of powerful people lived on this stretch of lake shore drive but i was betting it was bertrand rossy hed been visiting while i was still staring at the front of rossys building wondering who was paying off whom i got a second jolt a figure in a bowler hat tassels visible under his open coat rose like a jackinthebox from the bushes and marched into the lobby i got out of my car and moved down the street so i could see into the front door joseph posner was gesticulating at the doorman what on earth was going on xxx party time when i jogged panting into the rossys foyer an hour later id temporarily forgotten durham and posner my mind was mostly on lotty whom id once again left in distressbut i was also very aware that i was late despite running the half mile down the street from her apartment id stopped breathless at my car to trade my turtleneck and crepesoled shoes for the rose silk camisole and pumps i stood still while i carefully put on my mothers earrings then combed my hair as i ran across the street i tried to apply a little makeup in the elevator on my way to the eleventh floor even so i felt disheveled when i got offand worse when my hostess left her other guests to greet me fillida rossy was a woman in her early thirties almost as tall as me her rawsilk palazzo pants with a nubby sweater in the same dull gold hugging her chest emphasized both her slenderness and her wealth her darkblond curls were pulled back from her face with a couple of diamond clips and another larger diamond nestled in the hollow above her breastbone she took my outstretched hand in both of hers and almost caressed it my husband has made me so interested in meeting you signora she said in italian your talk to him was so full of entertaining surprises he told me how you read his palm she led me forward by the hand to greet the other guests who included the italian cultural attaché and his wifea dark vivacious woman around fillidas agea swiss banking executive and his wifeboth much olderand an american novelist who had lived for many years in sorrento this is the detective about whom bertrand has been speaking the one who conducts her business among the palm readers fillida patted my own palm encouragingly like a mother presenting a shy child to strangers uncomfortable i withdrew my hand and asked where signor rossy was mio marito si comparta scandalosamente she announced with a vivid smile he has adopted american business habits and is on the telephone instead of greeting his guests which is scandalous but he will join us shortly i murmured piacere to the other guests and tried to switch my thinking from english and my conversation with lotty to italian and the rival merits of swiss french and italian ski slopes which was apparently what they had been discussing when i arrived the attachés wife exclaimed enthusiastically over utah and said that of course for fillida the more dangerous the slope the better she liked it when you invited me to your grandfathers place in switzerland our last year in school i stayed in the lodge while you went down the most terrifying run i have ever seenwithout even getting your hair out of place as i remember it your grandfather puffed out through his moustache and pretended to be nonchalant but he was incredibly proud is your little marguerita growing up similarly fearless fillida threw up her hands with their beautifully manicured nails and said her reckless days were behind her now i can hardly bear to let my babies out of my sight so i stay with them on the beginner slopes what i will do when they pine for the giant runs i dont know ive learned to pity my own mother who suffered agonies over my recklessness her gaze flickered to the marble mantelpiece where photographs of her children were standingso many of them that the frames were almost stacked on top of one another then you wont want to take them to utah the bankers wife said but there are good family slopes in new england skiing wasnt a subject i knew enough about to participateeven if i spoke italian often enough to plunge at once into the rapid talk i began to wish i had called to cancel and stayed with lotty who had seemed even more distressed and anxious this evening than shed been on sunday after id seen posner go into the rossys building id walked up the street to lottys not sure whether she would invite me up or not after some hesitation she had let the doorman admit me but she was waiting in the hall when i got off the elevator on her floor before i could say anything she demanded roughly what i wanted i tried not to let her harshness hurt me but said i was worrying about her she scowled as i told you earlier on the phone im sorry i spoiled maxs party but im fine now did max send you to check on me i shook my head max is occupied with calias safety hes not thinking about you right now calias safety her thick black brows twitched together max is a doting grandfather but i dont think of him as a worrywart no hes not a worrywart i agreed radbuka has been stalking calia and agnes stalking them are you sure hanging out across the street accosting them when they leave trying to make agnes admit that calia is related to him does that sound like stalking or just a friendly visit i snapped angry in spite of myself at her scornful tone she pressed her palms into her eyes thats ridiculous how can he think shes related i shrugged if any of us knew who he really was or who the radbukas really were it might make that question easier to answer her generous mouth set in a hard line i dont owe any explanationto you to max least of all to this absurd creature if he wants to play at being a survivor of theresienstadt let him play at lotty do you know hes playing at it my voice had risen the door at the opposite end of the hall opened a crack lotty flushed and took me into her own apartment i dont of course but maxmax didnt find any radbukas when he went to vienna after the war i mean i dont believeid like to know where this bizarre man came up with the name i leaned against the wall my arms crossed i told you i went out on the web and found the person looking for information about sofie radbuka i left my own message saying he or she should communicate with my lawyer if they wanted to initiate a confidential conversation her eyes blazed why did you take it on yourself to do that there are two impenetrable mysteries here sofie radbuka of the s in england paul radbuka of chicago today you want information about paul he wants information about sofie but neither of you is willing to divulge anything i have to start somewhere why why do you have to start anywhere why dont you leave it alone i seized her hands lotty stop look at yourself ever since this man came on the scene last week youve been demented youve been howling on the sidewalk and then insisting that the rest of us pay no attention because there isnt a problem i cant believe this isnt spilling over into the operating room youre a danger to yourself your friends your patients carrying on like this she jerked her hands away and looked at me sternly i have never compromised the attention i give my patients ever even in the aftermath of the war certainly not now thats just great lotty but if you think you can go on like this indefinitely youre wrong thats my business not yours now will you have the goodness to go back to this web address and retract your message i chose my words carefully lotty nothing can threaten the love i have for you its too deep a part of my life max told me he has always respected the zone of privacy you erected around the radbuka family i would do that too if it werent for this heartbreaking torment youre suffering that meansif you wont tell me yourself what is torturing you i need to find it out her expression turned so stormy i thought she was going to blow up again but she mastered herself and spoke quietly mrs radbuka represents a part of my past of which i am ashamed iturned my back on her she died while i was ignoring her i dont know that i could have saved her i mean probably i couldnt have saved her buti abandoned her the circumstances dont matter its only my behavior that you need to know about i knit my brow i know she wasnt part of your group in london or max would know her was she a patient my patientsi can treat them because our roles are so defined its when people are outside that box that i become less reliable ive never stinted a patient not ever not even in london when i was ill when it was bitterly cold when other students whisked through consultations as fast as possible its a relief a salvation to be in the hospital to be the doctor not the friend or the wife or the daughter or someone else utterly unreliable i took her hands again lotty youve never been unreliable ive known you since i was eighteen youve always been present warm compassionate a true friend youre beating yourself up for some sin that doesnt exist its true weve been friends this long time but you arent god you dont know all my sinsany more than i know yours she spoke dryly not the dryness of irony but as if she were too worn out for feeling but if this man this man who thinks hes one of the radbukas is threatening caliacalia is the mirror of teresz when i look at herteresz was the great beauty in our group not only that she had great charm even at sixteen when the rest of us were gauche when i look at calia teresz comes back so vividly if i really thought harm might come to calia she wouldnt finish the sentence if she really thought harm would come to calia she would finally tell me the truth orwhat in the silence that hung between us i caught sight of the time and blurted out that i had to be at dinner i didnt like the tautness in lottys face as she escorted me back to the elevator running down lake shore drive to the rossys i felt it was i who was the unreliable friend now in a living room weighted down with bronze sculpture nubbedsilk upholstery enormous oil paintings as i listened to the glittery chatter of skiing and whether a city like chicago could possibly produce firstclass opera i felt utterly untethered from the world around me xxxi rich tastes i moved away from the chatter to the french windows they stood open so that guests could pass through the heavy drapes to stand on a small balcony lake michigan lay in front of me a black hole in the fabric of the night visible only as a blot between the winking lights of airplanes heading for ohare and headlights of cars on the road below i shivered are you cold signora warshawski you shouldnt linger in the night air bertrand rossy had come through the window behind me i turned i dont often have the chance to see the view this clearly since ive been remiss in attending to my guests i can scarcely chide you for avoiding them as well but i hope you will join us now he held the curtain for me giving me no choice really except to return to the gathering irina he called in english to a woman in a traditional maids uniform signora warshawski needs a glass of wine i gather you spent the day saving millions of dollars for your shareholders i said also switching to english that must have been very gratifying having the legislature support you so quickly he laughed his dimples showing oh i was there only as an observer i was most impressed with preston janoff most impressed he is quite cool under attack an eleventotwo vote in committee sounds like the attack of the tabby cats he laughed again attack of the tabby cats what an original way you have of expressing yourself what is it caro fillida rossy who had come to me herself with a glass of wine took her husbands arm what is making you laugh so gaily rossy repeated my remark fillida smiled sweetly and echoed it again in english i must remember that an attack of the tabby cats who were they attacking i felt remarkably foolish and gulped my wine as rossy explained the legislatures vote ah yes you told me when you got in how clever of you to know firsthand about these legislative matters signora i must wait for bertrands reports she straightened his tie darling this lightning bolt is so bold dont you think how did you know the vote so exactly rossy asked by more divination i saw the news in janoffs conference room about other things im woefully ignorant such as he pressed his wifes fingers an assurance that she was the real center of his attention such as why louis durham would need to meet with you at home after the vote i didnt think he and ajax s senior staff were on such cozy terms or why that mattered to joseph posner fillida turned to me you are indeed an indovina signora i laughed when bertrand said you had read his palm but this is remarkable that you know so much of our private business her voice was soft uncritical but under her poised remote gaze i felt embarrassed i had imagined this as a bold stroke now it seemed merely crude rossy spread his hands life in chicago is not so different after all from bern and zurich here as there it seems that the personal touch with city governors is helpful in the smooth running of the company as to mr posnerone understands his disappointment after todays vote he clasped my shoulder lightly as laura bugatti the attachés wife joined us allora why do we discuss matters which no one else understands before i could respond two children of about five and six came in under the watchful eye of a woman in a grey nurses uniform they were both very blond the girl with a thick mane of hair down her back they were dressed for bed in nightwear that had kept a team of embroiderers busy for a month fillida bent over to kiss them good night and to instruct them to say good night to zia laura and zia janet zia laura was the attachés wife zia janet the american novelist both came to kiss the children while fillida smoothed her daughters long hair around her shoulders giulietta she said to the nanny we must put a rosemary rinse in margueritas hair its too coarse after a day in these chicago winds bertrand scooped his daughter up to carry her off to bed fillida folded down the collar of her sons pajama top and handed him to the nurse i will be in later my darlings but i must feed our guests or they will soon faint from hunger irina she added to the maid in the same soft voice i want to serve now she asked signor bugatti to escort me in giving his wife to the swiss banker on our way across the hall to the paneled dining room i stopped to admire an old grandfather clock whose face showed the solar system it struck nine as i was watching and the sun and planets began revolving around the earth enchanting isnt it signor bugatti said fillida has exquisite taste if the paintings and little bits of sculpture lining the rooms were hers she not only had exquisite taste but plenty of money to indulge it she had a whimsical side too next to a childs painting of the ocean she had placed snapshots of her children at the beach laura exclaimed over it oh look heres your little paolo at samos last summer hes adorable are you letting him swim in lake michigan please fillida said putting up a hand to adjust the photograph of her son he longs to go in dont suggest itthe pollution anyone who can brave the adriatic can tolerate lake michigan the banker said and everyone laughed do you agree signora warshawski i smiled i often swim in the lake myself but perhaps my system has built up a tolerance for our local pollution at least weve never isolated cholera in our coastal waters here in chicago oh but samos thats not the same as naples said the american novelist the aunt janet who had kissed an unwilling paolo good night a few minutes ago its so typical of an american to feel superior about life here without experiencing europe america has to be number one in everything even clean coastal waters in europe one cares much more for the wellrounded life so when a german firm becomes america s largest publisher or a swiss company buys chicago s biggest insurer theyre not really concerned with market domination i asked its a byproduct of the wellrounded life the banker laughed while rossy whod just rejoined usin a different more subdued tiesaid perhaps janet should have said that europeans mask an interest in medals or winning behind a cloak of civilization its bad manners to show off ones accomplishmentsthey should emerge casually by chance under cover of other conversation whereas americans are confirmed braggarts the novelist persisted were rich were powerful everyone must bend to our way of doing things irina brought in mushroom soup pale brown with cream drizzled in the shape of a mushroom cap she was a silent efficient woman whom i first assumed had come with the rossys from switzerland until i realized that fillida and rossy always broke into english to talk to her the table conversation ran on in italian for several caustic moments on the deficiencies of american power and american manners i felt my hackles rise its one of those funny things that no one likes the family to be criticized by outsiders even when the family is a collection of lunatics or bullies so todays vote in the illinois legislature wasnt about withholding lifeinsurance benefits from beneficiaries of holocaust victimsit was about keeping america from imposing its standards on europe i said the cultural attaché leaned across the table toward me in a manner of speaking yes signora this black counselorwhat is his name duramhe makes a valid point in my eyes americans are so eager to condemn at a distancethe atrocities of a war which were truly atrocious no one denies itbut americans are not willing to examine their own atrocities at home in the matter of indians or of african slaves the maid removed the soup dishes and brought in roast veal loin with an array of vegetables the dinner plates were creamcolored porcelain heavily encrusted in gold with a large h in the middleperhaps for fillida rossys birth name although offhand i couldnt think of italian names beginning with h laura bugatti said that despite mafia terrorism in italy or russia most european readers preferred to be shocked by american violence than their homegrown brand youre right the bankers wife spoke for the first time my family wont discuss violence in zurich but they are always quizzing me about murders in chicago are you finding this true now with this murder in your husbands firm fillida fillida ran her fingers over the ornate filigree on her knife she ate very little i noticednot surprising that she had deep hollows around her breastbone daccordo this murder was reported in the bologna paper i suppose because they knew i was living here my mother has been phoning every morning demanding that i send paolo and marguerita back to italy where theyll be safe in vain i tell her the murder was twenty miles from my front door in a part of town most unsavorywhich you could find certainly in milan perhaps even in bologna although i can hardly believe it not in your own hometown eh cara bertrand said if it is your home it must be the best town with nothing unsavory about it he was laughing saluting his wife with his wineglass but she frowned at him he scowled and put his glass down turning to the bankers wife fillidas soft voice apparently carried a lot of wallopno bologna jokes at this dinner tablechange your tie when she criticizes itchange the subject when shes annoyed at this one laura bugatti noticing fillidas irritation quickly exclaimed in a girlish breathless voice murder in bertrands firm how come i know nothing about this you are keeping important cultural information from me she pouted at her husband one of the agents selling insurance for ajax was found dead in his office the banker replied to her now the police are saying he was murdered not suicided as they first thought you worked for him didnt you signora warshawski against him i corrected he held the key to a disputed i fumbled for words my italian had never been geared to financial discussions finally i turned to rossy who translated lifeinsurance claim for me yes anyway he held the key to such a disputed claim with ajax and i could never get him to reveal what he knew so his death leaves you frustrated the banker said frustrated and greatly baffled because all the papers relating to the claim have vanished even today someone rifled a file cabinet at the company to remove documents rossy set his wineglass down with a snap how do you know this why wasnt i told i spread my hands you were in springfield i alas was informed because your signor devereux suspected i might have been responsible for the theft from my office he demanded from the claims department the copy in your office was intact i didnt tell him about ralphs nagging sense that something was amiss in the paper file so you never saw the agents documents in this case rossy ignored my suggestion not even when you went in after the death i laid my knife and fork carefully against the gold crust on my plate now how were you aware that i went into fepples office after he died i spoke with devereux this afternoon from springfield he told me that you had brought him some kind of document from the dead agents office the maid replaced our dinner plates with more goldrimmed dishes this time containing raspberry mousse circled by fresh fruit the dead mans mother gave me an office key and asked me to look for any evidence that the police were ignoring when i went in i found that one piece of paper which appeared to be a very old handwritten document the only reason i even associate it with the disputed claim is that the dead policyholders name was on it but whether it was about the claim or something else altogether i couldnt say laura bugatti once more clapped her hands but this is exciting a mysterious document can you tell who wrote it or when i shook my head the questions were making me uncomfortable there was no need for her to know id had the paper analyzed how disappointing rossy smiled at me i have boasted of your supernatural gifts surely like sherlock holmes you know fiftyseven different kinds of paper by their ash alas i said my powers are very erratic they extend more to people and their motivations than to documents then why are you even concerned fillida asked her fingers once again wrapped around the heavy handle of her unused spoon there was a kind of power in the soft remote voice it made me want to respond aggressively this is a claim affecting a poor africanamerican family on chicago s south side it would be a wonderful opportunity for ajax to make good the rhetoric that preston janoff uttered today to pay the grieving widow her ten thousand dollars the banker said so you are pursuing the matter merely out of nobility not because you have evidence his tone didnt make the words sound like a compliment and why try to tie it to bertrands firm at all the novelist added i dont know who cashed the check which ajax issued in i said returning to english to make sure i expressed myself clearly but two things make me think it was either the agent or someone at the company my study of the claimants family and the fact that the original file has disappeared not only from the agency but from the company as wellperhaps whoever took them didnt realize that a paper copy was still in mr rossys office ma il corpo the bankers wife said did you see the body isnt it true that his posture the placement of the weapon that all these made the police believe it was suicide signora bugatti is right i said europeans do long for the details of american violence unfortunately it was only after the murder that mrs fepple gave me a key to her sons office so i cant fill in the details of his body in death rossy frowned im sorry if we seem voyeuristic to you but as you heard the mothers in europe worry greatly about their daughters and their grandchildren perhaps though we can discuss something less bloodthirsty fillida nodded at him yes i think this is enough discussion of bloodshed at my dinner table why dont we return to the drawing room for coffee as the rest of the group settled themselves on the nubby strawcolored couches i offered thanks and apologies to fillida rossy una serata squisita but i regret that an early appointment tomorrow means i must depart without coffee neither fillida nor bertrand made any effort to keep me although fillida murmured something about sharing an evening at the opera although i cannot believe tosca can be sung anywhere outside of la scala it is heresy to me bertrand himself escorted me to the door assuring me heartily that id brought them much pleasure he waited with the door open until the elevator arrived behind him i heard the conversation turn to venice where fillida laura and janet all attended the film festival xxxii client in the slammer my face in the elevator mirror looked wild and haggard as though id spent years in a forest away from human contact i ran a comb through my thick hair hoping that my hollow eyes were merely a trick of the light i took a ten from my wallet and folded it into the palm of my hand in the lobby i gave the doorman what was supposed to be a charming smile with a comment on the weather mild for this time of year he agreed do you need a taxi miss i said i didnt have far to go i hope it isnt hard getting taxis laterthe rest of the rossys company seemed to be prepared to stick it out all night oh yes very cosmopolitan their parties people often stay until two or three in the morning mrs rossy is such a devoted mother it must be hard for her to get up with her children in the morning i said thinking of the way she had held and stroked them at bedtime the nanny takes them to school but if you ask me theyd be happier if she was less devoted at least the little guy hes always trying to get her to let go of him in public i guess hes seen in american schools little boys dont let their mothers hold them and fuss with their clothes so much shes such a softspeaking lady but she seems to run the show upstairs he opened the door for an older woman with a small dog commenting on the nice night they had for their walk the little dog bared its teeth under its mop of white hair you going to work there he asked when the pair were outside no oh noim a business associate of the husband i was going to sayi wouldnt take a job up there on a bet she has very european views on the place of the help including me im a piece of furniture who gets her cabs its her money what i hear that runs the show mister married the bosss daughter still asks how high when the family says jump thats what i hear anyway i fanned the flame gently im sure she must be good to work for or irina wouldnt have come from italy with her italy he held the door for a couple of teenage boys but didnt stop to chat with them irinas from poland probably illegal sends all her money to the family back home like all the other immigrants nah the missus brought a girl from italy with her to look after the kids so they wont forget their italian living here stuckup girl who doesnt give you the time of day he added resentfully gossip about the bosses keeps a dull job interesting so both women live here at least irina can sleep in after a late night like tonight are you kidding im telling you for mrs rossy servants are servants the mister no matter how late the guests stay hes up at eight ready for work and youd better believe it isnt the missus who gets up first thing to make sure that morning coffee is ready the way he likes it i know they entertain a lot i kind of expected to see alderman durham at dinner since hed been over here earlier or joseph posner i casually left the ten on the marble console where he had television screens showing him the elevators and the street posner oh you mean the jewish guy the doorman gracefully pocketed the ten without pausing for air not likely the missus would let either of them at the dinner table around sixthirty she comes sailing in talking on her cell phone i figure its to the mister since its in italian but she hangs up and turns to me she never shouts but she still gets the message across that she is pod big time my husband has invited some business associate to do business here tonight it will be a black man arriving who is to wait in the lobby until my husband gets here i am not able to entertain a strange man while i try to get ready for my guests by which she means her makeup and so forth so mr rossy was expecting alderman durham did he invite posner too the doorman shook his head posner showed up unexpected and got into quite a shouting match with me when i wouldnt let him go sailing up on his own mr rossy agreed to see him as soon as the alderman had left but posner only stayed up there fifteen minutes or so so posner must have been pretty angry at getting such a short audience huh oh mr rossys a good guy not like the missushes always good for a joke or a tip at least when she isnt lookingyoud think if you had a bundle you could spare a buck now and then when a guy runs all the way down to belmont for a cabanyway mr rossy managed to calm the jewish guy down in fifteen minutes i dont get the funny dress though do you we have a lot of jews in this building and theyre just as normal as you or me whats the point of the hat and the scarf and all that a taxi pulling up in front saved me from having to think of a response the doorman sprang into action as the taxi decanted a woman with several large suitcases i figured id learned what i could although it wasnt as much as i wanted to know i went out with him and crossed the street to my car i drove home across addison trying to make sense of the situation rossy had invited durham to see him before the demonstration after he got back from springfield and somehow posner knew about it so hed followed durham up here where rossy calmed his angry suspicions i didnt know anything specific about alderman durhams cupidityalthough those expensive suits wouldnt leave much left over for groceries if he bought them on his aldermans paybut most chicago pols have a price and it usually isnt very high presumably rossy had invited durham to his home to buy him off but what could rossy offer posner that would get that fanatic off his back it was close to midnight when i finally found a parking space on one of the side streets near my home i lived three miles west of the rossys when i moved into my little coop the neighborhood was a peaceful mostly bluecollar place but its become so crowded now with trendy restaurants and boutiques that even this late at night the traffic made the drive tedious an suv swerving around me in front of wrigley field reminded me to stop thinking and concentrate on traffic late as it was my neighbor and the dogs were still awake mr contreras must have been sitting next to his front door waiting for me because i was barely inside when he came out with mitch and peppy the dogs dashed around the tiny foyer snapping at me showing they were miffed at my long absence mr contreras was feeling lonely and neglected as was i even though i was exhausted after giving the dogs a short run around the block i joined the old man in his cluttered kitchen he was drinking grappa i opted for chamomile tea with a shot of brandy the enamel on the kitchen table was chipped the only picture was a calendar from the humane society showing a bundle of puppies the brandy was young and raw but i felt more at ease here than in the rossys ornate drawing room morrell take off today the old man asked i could kind of tell you was feeling blue everything okay i grunted noncommittally then found myself telling him in detail about coming on fepples body about the sommers family the missing money the missing documents and tonights dinner party he was annoyed that i hadnt told him sooner about feppleafter all doll you was in the kitchen with me when his murder come on the newsbut he let me get on with my tale after only a perfunctory grumble im tired im not thinking clearly but it seemed to me tonights dinner was a carefully orchestrated event i said at the time i got swept along on the conversational tide but now i feel as though they were herding me corralling me into talking about something very specific but whether it was finding fepples body or what id seen in the sommers file i dont know maybe both my neighbor suggested you say this gal in the claims department her name was in the agents computer but shes saying she never was near the place maybe she was maybe she was down there after he got shot and shes scared to admit it i slid peppys silky ears through my fingers thats possible if that were the case i can see ralph devereux being protective of herbut i have to confess i cant see that it would matter much to rossy or his wife not enough for them to invite me to dinner to pump me he said it was because his wife was lonely and wanted me to talk italian to her but she was surrounded by friends or sycophants at any rate and she didnt need me except to get information from i frowned thinking it over the news of fepples body must have come in so rossy could have called to see how much i knowbut i cant see why unless the company is more worried about this sommers claim than theyre admittingwhich means its the tip of some ugly iceberg that im not seeing it was such a lastminute invitationi wonder whether tonights cast of characters was already in place or if the rossys pulled them together on the spot knowing theyd play along especially laura bugattishes the wife of the italian cultural attaché her job was to be the excited ingenue whats that supposed to mean she was the breathless airhead who could ask crude questions without seeming to know what she was doing although that could be her real personality the truth is they all made me feel big and crude even the american who was there some very acidulated writer i hope ive never spent money on any of her books its almost like i was invited to be the entertainment there was a show going on which i was starring in but i was the only one who hadnt seen the script whether money buys happiness or not i couldnt say but one thing ive known for years cookie and thats that money sure dont buy character which youve got ten times more of than any set of gotrocks who want to invite you to dinner just so they can jerk you around i kissed his cheek and got up i was too blearyeyed to think let alone talk moving almost as stiffly as the old man i went upstairs to bed taking peppy with me both of us needed extra petting tonight the message light on my home machine was flashing i was so exhausted i thought id let it go but then i wondered if morrell had tried to reach me the first message was indeed from him missing me loving me bonetired but too excited to sleep me too i muttered replaying his voice several times the second message was from my answering service amy blount had called twice shes angry and insisting that you get in touch with her at once but wouldnt give details amy blount oh yes the young woman whod written a hundred fifty years of ajax history at once not now though not at one in the morning on a day that had started twenty hours ago i switched off my phone shed my suit and tumbled into bed without taking off the camisole or my mothers diamond drop earrings for the first time in over a week i slept through the night finally staggering out of bed when peppy nosed me awake a little after eight my right ear hurt from where my mothers earring had pressed into it in my sleep the left one was lost in the bedding i fumbled around until i found it and got both of them back in my safe next to my gun diamonds from my mother handguns from my father perhaps fillida rossys writer friend could turn that into a poem while id been sleeping my answering service and mary louise had both left messages saying that amy blount had again demanded to speak to me i groaned and went to the kitchen to make coffee i sat on the back porch nursing a double espresso while peppy sniffed around the yard until i felt awake enough to stretch out my stiff joints finally after doing a full workoutincluding a fast four miles over to the lake and back with the dogs protesting at the speed i made them goi reconnected myself to the outside world i reached christie weddington at my answering service vic mary louise has been trying to reach you along with a bunch of other people amy blount called again and someone named margaret sommers margaret sommers my clients wife who thought i was out to rob or maim her husband i took the details of my messages and told christie she could switch urgent calls over to my cell phone i wandered into the kitchen with my portable phone prepared to make breakfast while talking to margaret sommers i called her office where they told me shed gone home for a family emergency i went back to the living room to get the home number from my palm pilot she answered on the first ring shouting at me what did you say to the police about isaiah nothing the unexpected attack took me offguard whats happened to him youre lying arent you they came and got him this morning right out of the docherty works in front of his buddies and everything saying he had to talk to them about howard fepple now who but you would have turned them on to my husband i wished id stayed in bed mrs sommers i have not discussed your husband with the police and i know nothing about what happened this morning if you want to talk to me about it start at the beginning without hurling accusations at me is he under arrest or just brought into the station for questioning she was angry and upset but she did her best to choke back her invective isaiah had called her from work to say the cops were taking him in for fepples murder she didnt know the station number but it was the one at twentyninth and prairie because shed rushed up there but they hadnt let her see isaiah did you talk to any of the detectives who are questioning him can you give me their names there were two whose names shed managed to get even though they were acting like god almighty not having to tell her anything i didnt recognize either of them did they tell you anything like why they brought your husband in to begin with oh they were so mean i could kill them myself and not think twice about it treating me like it was all a big joke you want to stick around and yell at us honey we could lock you up right next to him listen to you two make up lies together those were their very words i could easily imagine the exchange as well as margaret sommerss impotent fury but they must have had some grounds for arresting him were you able to figure that out i told you because you talked to them i know this has all been a horrible shock i said gently i dont blame you for your anger but try to think of a different reason because truly ms sommers i didnt say anything to the police about your husband indeed i had nothing to say to them whatyou didnt tell them about him being in the office on saturday i felt a chill in my stomach he was he went to fepples office why did he do that when did he go there we went back and forth a few times but she finally seemed to accept that i hadnt known about it margaret sommers had pushed isaiah into going to see fepple in person that was what it boiled down to although she tried to dress it up as my fault they couldnt trust me i wasnt doing anything but cozying up to the insurance company shed talked to the aldermanseeing fepple was actually his suggestion so when isaiah wouldnt set up an appointment she did it herself from the office on friday afternoon the alderman i asked which alderman would this be alderman durham of course on account of isaiahs cousin being part of the eye movement and all hes always been very helpful to us only fepple said we couldnt come on friday because he was completely booked he tried to put us off but i pointed out we worked all week we couldnt meet some university professors schedule hopping in and out of our jobs so he acted like i was trying to make him give me a million dollars but he said if i was going to make such a big deal out of it calling the alderman like i threatened to do we could see him on saturday morning so we drove up there together im tired of isaiah letting people push him around like he does there wasnt any answer when we knocked and i was furious thinking hed made the appointment without any intention of keeping it but when we opened the door we saw him laying there dead not right away mind you because the office was dark but pretty soon just a minute i said when you called you accused me of siccing the cops on your husband what made you say that she didnt think she was going to tell me but then she blurted out that the cops had gotten a call they said it was from a man a black man but i figured that was just their talk their way of trying to get under my skin no brother i know of would accuse my husband of murder maybe the detectives had been trying to ride her and isaiah but maybe it was a brother whod phoned in the tip i let it pass in her current distress margaret sommers needed to blame someone it might as well be me i went back to their visit to fepples office on saturday when you were in there did you look for mr sommerss uncles file did you take any papers away with you no once we got into the office and saw him lying there with hisoh i cant stand even to say it we left as fast as we could but theyd touched enough my client must have left his fingerprints somewhere in the room and thanks to me the police had stopped looking at fepples death as a suicide so margaret sommers wasnt completely wrong i had ensured her husbands arrest xxxiii turmoil i drummed a series of jangly chords on the piano after margaret hung up lotty often criticizes me for what she calls my ruthless search for truth knocking over people in my path without thinking about their wants and needs if id known being so clever about fepples death would get isaiah sommers arrestedbut it was useless to beat myself up for pushing the cops to do a proper investigation it had happened now i had to deal with the aftermath anyway what if isaiah sommers really had shot fepple hed told me on monday he had an unlicensed browning but that didnt preclude his also having an unlicensed sigalthough theyre pricey not the gun of choice for your average homeowner i hit two adjacent keys so hard that peppy backed away from me staging fepples death to look like suicide too subtle for my client maybe his wife had engineered itshe certainly had a temper i could see her growing furious enough to shoot fepple or me or any number of people if they stepped in front of her gun i shook my head the shot that killed fepple hadnt been fired in rage someone had gotten close enough to put a gun in fepples mouth stunning him first or having an accomplice who stunned him first vishnikov told me the whole job had looked professional that didnt fit margaret sommerss angry profile i had forgotten breakfast while i was talking to her it was after ten i was suddenly very hungry i walked down the street to the belmont diner the last vestige of the shops and eateries of lakeviews old workingclass neighborhood while i waited for a spanish omelette i called my lawyer freeman carter isaiah sommerss most urgent need was for expert counsel which i had promised margaret sommers before we hung up she had bristled at my offer of help they had a very good lawyer in their church who could take care of isaiah which matters more to you saving your husband or saving your pride id asked after a pregnant pause she muttered she guessed theyd take a look at my lawyer but if they didnt trust him right off they wouldnt keep him freeman quickly took in my sketch of the situation right vic i have an assistant who can go down to the twentyfirst district for the time being you have an alternative theory of the murder fepples last known appointment was on friday night with a woman from ajax insurance connie ingram i didnt like tossing her to the wolves but i wasnt going to have the states attorney railroad my client either i told freeman about the situation with the sommers policy documents someone in the company doesnt want those papers around but my client couldnt possibly be the one who stole the microfiche out of the ajax claimsdepartment file cabinets of course the company may say i did it for himbut we can cross that bridge if the road goes that far and did you vic freeman was at his dryest scouts honor no freeman im as hot to see those documents as every other person in this benighted town but so far ive only looked at one sanitized version ill keep sniffing around for evidence about the murder in case the worst happens and we have to go to trial barbara the waitress whos worked at the belmont diner longest brought my omelette as freeman hung up you know you look like every other yuppie in lakeview with that thing stuck to your ear vic thanks barbara i try to fit into my surroundings well dont make a habit of it were thinking of banning them altogether im sick of people shouting their business to an empty table what can i say barbara when youre right youre right you want to put my food under the heat lamp while i go outside for my next call she snorted and moved to the next table the place was filling with people on their morning coffee breaksthe mechanics and repairmen who keep the area yuppies comfortable i ate half the omelette quickly taking the edge off my hunger before phoning amy blount a strange woman answered checking my identity before passing me on to ms blount like margaret sommers amy blount was angry but she was more restrained about it she wished i had gotten back to her soonershe was under considerable stress and hated hanging about for my phone call how soon could i get down to hyde park i dont know whats the problem oh ive told the story so many times i forgot you dont know it i had a breakin at my apartment she had come home at ten last night from a lecture in evanston to find her papers strewn about her computer damaged and her floppy disks missing when she called the cops they didnt take it seriously but those are my dissertation notes theyre irreplaceable i have the dissertation written up and bound but the notes i would use those for another book the police dont understand they say its impossible to track down all the burglaries in the city and since no valuables are missingwell i dont have valuables just my computer how did the intruders get in through the back door even though i have a gate across it they broke through it without any of the neighbors paying the least attention hyde park is supposed to be such a liberal neighborhood but everyone scuttles away at the first sign that anyone around them is in trouble she added bitterly where are you i asked at a friends i couldnt stay in the middle of all that mess and i didnt want to clean it up until someone saw it who would pay attention to the problem i took her friends address and told her either i or mary louise would be there within the next two hours she tried to argue me into coming sooner but i explained that emergency detectives were like emergency plumbers we had to fit the job in around all the other broken boilers i finished the omelette but skipped the steak friesmy usual weakness but if i ate one id eat them all and then id be too logy to think very fast and the day was looking like one that would require einsteinlike thought i didnt wait for my bill but put fifteen dollars on the table and trotted back up racine to my car i had a couple of errands to run in the financial district before going in to my office as i drove downtown i called mary louise to make sure she was able to work some more hours this afternoon so that she could go see amy blounts apartment she was pretty terse with me but i told her shed see me soon enough to offload her complaints in person since i was down by the citycounty building anyway i went inside to find alderman durhams office naturally he had one on the south side in his own ward but aldercreatures mostly hang out in the loop where the money and power are i scribbled a note on my card in re the widows mite and isaiah sommers after a mere fifteen minutes wait the secretary scooted me ahead of other supplicants who gave me dirty looks for jumping the queue the alderman had a young man with him wearing the navy blazer with the empower youth energy insignia on it a gold eye with eye on youth embroidered around it the alderman himself was dressed in harris tweed his shirt having the palest green stripe in it to match the green in the tweed he shook my hand genially and waved me to a seat so you have something to say about the widows mite ms warshawski have you kept up with that story alderman you know margaret sommers took your advice and insisted on a meeting with the agent howard fepple only to walk in and find him dead im sorry to hear it that must have been a shock for her she got a worse one this morning her husband has been brought in for questioningthe cops got a tip they think he murdered feppleout of outrage over the guy robbing his aunt of her mite so to speak he nodded slowly i can understand their reasoning but im sure isaiah wouldnt have killed a man ive known him for years you see for years because his aunt bless her had a son who was one of my boys before he passed isaiah is a fine man a churchgoing man i dont see him as a murdering man do you see who might have phoned in an anonymous tip to the police alderman their technicians say theyre pretty sure it was an africanamerican male who made the call he gave a great mirthless smile and you thought to yourself who do i know whos an africanamerican male louis durham were all alike after all we black men animals at heart arent we i looked at him steadily i thought to myself who has been having surreptitious meetings with the european chief of the insurance company that holds the paper on aaron sommers i thought to myself i dont see what enticements those two men could offer each otherkill the holocaust asset recovery act in exchange for shutting down the demonstrations outside the ajax building but what if mr rossy wanted something morewhat if he wanted isaiah sommers to take the fall for the murder so that he could close the claim file and get the mess out of his hair what if in exchange for shutting off your demonstration and getting someone to finger isaiah sommers rossy said hed fly to springfield to kill the ihara bill for you you have a reputation as an investigator warshawski this isnt worthy of you durham stood and moved to the door the young man in the eye blazer followed him i perforce got up to leave as well yes but remember durham im shamelessyou wrote that on your placards yourself i picked up my car from the west loop garage where id parked more puzzled than angered by the encounter what had he hoped to learn from me that got me in to see him so readily what were he and rossy doing together had one of his people really made that phone call that led to isaiah sommerss arrest i couldnt put the pieces together in any meaningful way i was negotiating the tricky intersection at armitage where three streets come together underneath the kennedy expressway when tim streeter called vic not to alarm you but theres a bit of a situation my heart skipped a beat calia whats happened where are you oh help hang on i laid down rubber under the kennedy forced a semi turning onto the expressway to stand on his brakes with a loud blaring of his horn and pulled into a gas station on the other side vic calm down the kids here with me were at the childrens museum in wilmette agnes is fine its at the hospital this guy posner you know the one whos been yeah yeah i know who he is okay hes shown up at the hospital with a group of pickets denouncing mr loewenthal and dr herschel for keeping jewish families apart the kid and i were supposed to drop in on mr loewenthal for a brownbag lunchmoms working on her presentation for the gallerybut when we got to the hospital posner and his gang were out in force oh damn him and the horse he rode in on too so much adrenaline was running through me that i was ready to bounce up to bryn mawr avenue and take posner apart with my own hands radbuka there yeah thats when we got a bit of a situation i didnt realize what it was at first thought it might be a labor dispute or righttolifers wasnt until we got close up that i made out the signs and then radbuka saw the kid and wanted to make a move on her i hustled her out of there but the cameras were rolling she may be on tv tonight hard to say called mr loewenthal from the car and came on up here he interrupted himself briefly to talk to calia who was whining in the background that she needed to see her opa now id better go but i told mr loewenthal if he needs extra support to call my brother ill stick with the little one when wed hung up i sat with my head in my hands trying to order my mind i couldnt just fly north to the hospital without doing something for isaiah sommers i forced myself to continue to my office where mary louise greeted me with a severe reprimand over once again making myself so inaccessible overnight it was no way to run this kind of business if i wanted to unplug myself from the world to sleep i should let her know so she could cover for me youre right it wont happen againput it down to sleep deprivation clouding my judgment heres whats going on though i sketched out the situations with sommers with amy blount and now the demonstration outside beth israel i can understand why radbuka wants to hook up with posner but what does posner get out of attacking max and lotty he went to see rossy last nightim wondering if rossy somehow set him on to beth israel who knows why someone like posner does anything mary louise said impatiently look i only have two more hours to give you today i dont think its very helpful for you if i spend it going over conspiracy theories and really vicit makes sense for me to deal with sommerss situationi can call the finch to get the details of the investigation and give freemans assistant some support but why did you agree to go all the way down to the south side for this amy blount the cops are right you knowthis kind of b e is a dime a dozen we just file reportsthey do i meanand keep a lookout for stolen goods if she didnt lose anything valuable why waste your time on it i grinned conspiracy theory mary louise she wrote a history for ajax ralph devereux and rossy are all hot on whos stealing ajax files or leaking ajax files to durham at least they were worrying about that last week maybe rossys spiked durham s guns for now if amy blounts papers and floppies have been rifled i want to know whats missing is it something the alderman wanted for his campaign on slave reparations or is there really some junkie out there whos so addled that he thinks he can sell history papers for enough money to buy a fix she scowled its your business just remember when youre writing the rent and insurance checks in two weeks why you dont have more cash flow this month but you will go down to hyde park to look over ms blounts place after youve gotten sommerss situation squared away with the finch like i said vic its your business its your money to waste but quite frankly i cant see what good ill do you by going to hyde park or what benefit youll get from joining joseph posner up at the hospital ill have a chance to talk to radbuka which ive been desperate for and maybe ill find out what rossy and posner had to say to each other she sniffed and turned to the phone while she called the finchterry finchley her old commanding officer from her days in the central districti went to my own desk i had a handful of messages one from an important client and a half dozen emails i dealt with them as quickly as i could and took off xxxiv road rage hospital rage any old rage the hospital was on the citys northwest side far enough from the trendy neighborhoods that nearby traffic usually flowed fast today though when i was about a mile away the main road got so heavy i tried the side streets five blocks from beth israel i came to a total halt i looked around frantically for an alley so i could escape to an alternate route but as i was about to make a uturn it dawned on me that if the jam came from gapers rubbernecking at posners demonstrators traffic would be blocked on all sides of beth israel i pulled over to an empty meter and sprinted the last half mile sure enough i found posner and several dozen protesters in the middle of the kind of crowd he seemed to adore chicago cops were furiously directing traffic at the intersection staff in greenandgold hospital security blazers were trying to guide patients to side entrances television crews were filming the last had attracted a crowd of gawkers it was just on oneanyone coming back from lunch had probably stopped to enjoy the show i was too far back to read the signs but i could hear a chant that chilled my heart max and lotty have a heart dont smash survivors lives apart i ran around to the back to the service entrance where i opened my wallet and flashed my pi license in the face of a security guard so fast he couldnt tell whether it was an fbi badge or a credit card by the time hed figured that out i had disappeared into the labyrinth of halls and stairwells that make security at any hospital a nightmare i tried to keep my bearings but still ended up in radiation oncology and file storage before finding the main lobby i could hear shouting from the group outside but i couldnt see anything beth israel is an old brick building without a plateglass front or even any windows low enough to see outside hospital guards who were completely unused to this kind of chaos were doing an ineffectual job of keeping gawkers from blocking the main entrance an older woman sobbed helplessly to one side that shed just had outpatient surgery that she needed a taxi to get home while a second woman with a newborn looked around anxiously for her husband i stared at the scene for an appalled moment then told the guards to keep people away from the door tell them that anyone who obstructs the entryway is facing a fine the back exit is free and clearget these patients out through there send an sos to the cab companies to use the rear i watched until the startled guard started giving orders through his walkietalkie before i marched down the corridor to maxs office cynthia dowling maxs secretary interrupted a heated telephone exchange when she saw me cynthia why doesnt max get the cops to arrest that group of yahoos she shook her head the boards afraid of alienating major donors beth israel is one of the big jewish charities in town most of the calls weve been getting since posner hit the news have agreed with you but old mrs felstein is one of posners supportersshe survived the war in hiding in moldavia you know but when she came here she made a fortune in gum balls lately shes been active in lobbying swiss banks to release holocaust victims assets and shes pledged twenty million dollars for our new oncology wing so if she sees posner carried off to a paddy wagon shell cancel but if someone whos having a heart attack dies because they cant get here youd face a lawsuit that would more than offset any pledge she made thats maxs decision his and the boards and of course theyre aware of the pitfalls her phone console started to blink she pressed a button mr loewenthals office no i know you have a onethirty deadline as soon as mr loewenthal is available ill let him have your message yes i wish we werent in the business of saving lives here it would make us better able to drop everything to respond to media deadlines mr loewenthals office please hold mr loewenthals office please hold she looked at me distracted with her hand over the phone this place is so inefficient the stupid temp the clerical pool sent me went to lunch an hour ago shes probably out front enjoying the show and even though im the executive directors secretary the clerical office wont send me another backup okay okay ill leave you to it i have some questions for posnertell max if you see him that i wont implicate the hospital when i got to the main lobby i elbowed my way through to the front of the crowd which was once again pushing against the revolving doors as soon as i got outside i saw the reason for their avidity the demonstrators had stopped marching and were clumped together behind joseph posner who was shouting at a small woman in a hospital coat youre the worst kind of antisemite a traitor to your own people and you mr posner are the worst kind of abuser of human emotion exploiting the horrors of treblinka for your own aggrandizement i would have known that voice anywhere anger making her clip off words like so many cigar ends i pushed past two of posners maccabees to reach her side lotty what are you doing here this is a losing battleattention is this guys meat and drink posner his nostrils flaring with anger his mouth distorted in defiance looked like a picture captioned the gladiator waiting for the lion in my childhood illustrated history of rome lotty a small but ferocious lion shook me off mind your own business for once victoria this man is defaming the dead for his own glory and hes defaming me then well take it to a court of law i said there are television cameras catching every word on tape go ahead take me to court if you dare posner turned as he spoke to make sure both his supporters and the reporters heard him i dont care if i spend five years in jail if that will make the world understand my peoples cause your people i kept my voice light scornful are you moses now will it make you happier if i call them my followers or my team whatever you call them they understand that it may be necessary to suffer or make sacrifices to get where we want to be they understand that some of that suffering can take the form of ridicule from ignorant secularists like yourself or this doctor here what about the suffering of patients i asked an elderly woman cant get home after surgery because youve blocked the front door if her family sues you for millions in damages will your people understand that victoria i dont need you to fight my battles for me lotty said her voice tight with anger or to draw this imbeciles fire i ignored her by the way mr posner you know that your people have to keep movingthey can be arrested if they stand around gawking i hardly need a strange woman to instruct me in the law posner said but he gestured to his followers to start circling again paul radbuka was hovering near posners elbow his mobile clowns face registering first delight at posners rebuttal derision as lotty spokeand anger as he suddenly recognized me reb joseph this womanshes a detective shes my enemy shes the person whos turning my family against me the television crews which had been focusing their cameras on lotty and posner suddenly switched to radbuka and me beyond the lights i heard someone say is that warshawski the detective whats she doing here beth blacksin called excitedly vic has the hospital hired you to investigate posners claims are you working for max loewenthal i cupped my hands around my eyes so i could see past the glare of the camera lights i have a private question for mr posner beth its not anything to do with the hospital i tapped posner on the arm telling him id like him to come with me away from the cameras posner said sternly that he couldnt talk privately with a woman i smiled brightly dont worry if your impulses get the better of you i can break one of your arms maybe both but if you prefer i can ask my question out loud on camera everything i have to say about this lotty herschel and about you too can be on camera radbuka butted in you think you can come up here to keep me away from my family just like you hired that bully to stay with my little cousin over at maxs but you wont get away with it rhea and don are going to help me take my story to the world posner tried to get radbuka to be quiet telling him hed take care of the detective to me he added that he had nothing to hide bertrand rossy i said softly then looked toward the cameras and raised my voice beth im asking mr posner about his meeting with a rough gesture posner turned his back to the cameras i dont know what you think you know but youd be making a mistake to talk about him on television what meeting mr posner one of the reporters asked is this anything to do with the defeat of the asset recovery bill on tuesday you know im going to ask you about him about why you pulled your demonstration away from ajax i said softly to posner its up to you whether its on or offmike you like publicity and they are using directional mikes so if i raise my voice theyll pick up our conversation even if theyre not right on top of us posner couldnt afford to look indecisive in front of his troops just to keep you from defaming my movement on television i will talk to you away from the hospital but not alone he called to another man to join him ordering the rest of the group to wait in the groups bus until he got back the television crews watched in astonishment as the demonstrators drifted off toward the parking lot then they plunged forward with a babble of excited questions for posner and me what had made him decide to cancel the demonstration we achieved our goals this afternoon posner said grandly we have made the hospital realize that jewishbacked institutions are just as liable as secular ones to become complacent and indifferent to jewish needs we will be back however max loewenthal and charlotte herschel can feel assured of that what about you dr herschel what do you think of their assertion that youre keeping paul radbuka from his family she curled her lip im a surgeon with a fulltime practice i dont have time for comic books in fact this man has kept me from my patients for long enough she turned on her heel and went back into the hospital the reporters surged forward wanting to know what id said to posner who was my client did i suspect fraud in posners group or in the hospital who was financing the demonstrations i told beth and the other reporters that as soon as i had interesting information id share it with thembut that for right now i didnt know about any fraud involving posner or the hospital but beth i added what brought you up here we were tipped off you know how that works warshawski she gave me an urchins grin not by him thougha woman called the station could have been anyone though posner annoyed that id stolen the limelight snarled at me to come with him if i wanted to talk to him he didnt have all day to spend on foolish women with imaginary ideas he moved rapidly down the drive with his chosen henchman i lengthened my stride to catch up with him a couple of reporters kept up a halfhearted pursuit radbuka who hadnt followed the other demonstrators to the bus began declaiming that max was his cousin but wouldnt admit it and i was the beast of babylon who was keeping max from talking to him but the reporters already had that story they werent interested in the rerun if i wasnt going to give the cameras raw meat there wasnt anything to keep them around beth israel any longer the crews wrapped up their equipment and headed to their vans xxxv amateur sleuth the crowd realizing the show was over because the cameras had disappeared began drifting away by the time posner and i were at the corner of catalpa the driveway in front of the hospital was almost empty i laughed to myself i should send max a bill for this i turned to see what radbuka was doing he stood alone at the bottom of the drive his hurt feelings at being abandoned by both posner and the cameras darkening his mobile face he looked around uncertainly then ran down the street after us i turned back to posner who was impatiently tapping his watch so mr posner lets talk about you and bertrand rossy i have nothing to say about him his chin jutted out at a lofty angle the gladiator is not afraid of death nothing about your meeting with him last night nothing about how he persuaded you to abandon your protest outside ajax for one here at beth israel he stopped in the middle of the sidewalk whoever told you i met with him is lying i have private reasons for being here they have nothing to do with rossy lets not start our nice little chat with accusations about lying i saw you at rossys placei had dinner with him and his wife last night i didnt see you now that disclaimer is pretty pure proof that you were there i gave a supercilious smile posner was so used to being the daddy in the story that i figured the way to keep him rattled was to treat him as if i found him childish reb joseph i dont think you should talk any more to this woman the sidekick said shes trying to trick you into saying something that will discredit us remember what radbuka said that shes been keeping him from his family thats not true either i said im eager for paul to rejoin his true family but im curious about the situation between your holocaust asset recovery group and ajax insurance i know you know preston janoff was in springfield yesterday killing the illinois asset recovery act so what made you abandon ajax id think today your wrath against them would be greater than ever my bet is that bertrand rossy told you something last night or offered you a nice little bribe that made you withdraw from the loop to come up here youre right leon posner turned away from me this woman doesnt know anythingshes playing a guessing game to keep us from disturbing her rich friends at the hospital even though i was getting tired of being this woman instead of having a name i kept my voice genial i may not know anything but i can make guesses that beth blacksin at global will listen to and believe me i did see you at the rossys last nightif i tell her that shell be parked on your doorstep for a week posner had turned to leave but at that he looked back at me darting a worried glance at leon then up the street to see if the cameras were there i smiled i know that you were furious when you got to rossys place so i figure it was because you knew he was talking to alderman durham you were afraid ajax was going to offer durham some special deal that would undercut your movement rossy refused at first to see you at all when you showed up in the lobby but you threatened over the house phone to expose him for doing business with durham even so rossy said he wouldnt see you if durham learned you were there you arrived at rossys place angry but by the time you and he finished you were all smiles again so rossy gave you something not money perhaps but information he knows youre aggressive with jewishrun institutions that you think are too secular so maybe he told you something that combined both insurance and one of chicago s leading jewish charities beth israel you should bring your protest up here he told you force the media to shine a light on the hospital and max loewenthal standing on the corner in front of the cozy cup café i gave posner a chance to answer he didnt say anything but he was looking worried nervously chewing his cheek what could it have been did he say oh the hospital has been denying medical benefits to holocaust survivors no that would be too crudethe media would have been all over that one maybe he said oh max loewenthal got some kind of big bond package for the hospital in exchange for helping kill the bill it sounds crazy of course because it is crazy and in your heart of hearts you know any suggestion rossy made is crazy if you didnt youd be blaring it to the world but bertrand rossy would be happy because it would distract public attention from ajax s role in killing the asset recovery act how am i doing is this the story you want me to share with beth blacksin and the rest of chicago that youre bertrand rossys dupe while i was speaking radbuka kept trying to interrupt to say they were here strictly on the issue of max and his family but i raised my voice and talked past him posner kept chewing his cheek you cant prove any of this very lame mr posner after all youre making accusations against beth israel that you cant prove i can prove that you spent fifteen minutes with bertrand rossy last night i dont have to prove that your conversation followed my story linei only have to start the story moving around chicago the wires and internet services will take it from there because rossy means edelweiss which means not only local but also international news are you trying to imply that im selling out the ihara committee posner demanded i shook my head i dont know if you are or not but of course if your group finds out that you wasted precious resources on a wildgoose chase i dont expect theyll be very supportive of your leadership whatever you may choose to believe i take our mission with utter seriousness alderman durham may be on the streets for votes he may leave the streets for money but neither of these you know that rossy offered him money to shut down his protest i interrupted he pressed his lips together without answering but you did follow durham to rossys place last night do you follow him every night reb joseph isnt like you radbuka burst out he doesnt set out to spy on people make their lives miserable deny them their rights everything he does is aboveboard anyone could tell you that rossy talked to durham last night we all saw durham go over to rossys car when it was stuck in traffic on adams what did durham get in with rossy no he leaned over to talk to him we could all see rossys face when he opened the window and leon said hey thats the guy whos really running ajax these shut up leon said you werent asked to take part in this conversation go wait in the bus with the rest of the group until reb joseph has finished with this woman radbuka stuck out his lower lip in a babyish pout you cant order me around i sought out reb joseph because hes doing something for people like me whose lives were destroyed by the holocaust i didnt risk being arrested today so i could be bossed around by a loser like you look radbuka you only came along to take advantage leon paul posner chided them this is only grist for this womans mill to see us fighting each other save your energies for our common enemies leon subsided but paul wasnt part of the movement he didnt need to obey posner any more than he did leon in one of his rapid mood shifts he turned angrily on posner i only came along on your march last night and this one today to get help in getting to my family now youre accusing my cousin max of cutting secret deals with the illinois legislature do you think im related to someone who would act like that no i put in quickly i dont think your relatives would do anything so awful what happened last night after durham talked to rossy on the street did they drive off together or did the cops take durham in a separate car i didnt know the police took him radbuka said ignoring shushing gestures from posner and leon responsive as usual to anyone paying him serious attentioneven when it was an ostensible enemy like myself all i know is durham went off and got in his own car we walked down to the corner of michigan and saw him it was parked right there in a noparking zone but of course he had a policeman guarding it sleazebag that he is and reb joseph didnt trust durham so he decided to follow him very enterprising i smiled patronizingly at posner so you skulked around in the bushes outside rossys building until you saw durham come out and then rossy whos got a lot of charm talked you into believing some stupid rumor about the hospital it wasnt like that not at all posner snapped when i saw him with durham i wanted to seeid been aware for some time that durham was trying to sabotage our efforts to force european banks and insurers to provide redress for the outright theft which they engineered in the wake of you can assume i understand the underlying issue mr posner but durham didnt manufacture the grounds for his protest theres a growing group of people who believe companies which benefited from african slavery should pay reparations in the same way that companies which benefited from jewish or polish slave labor should his beard jutted toward me at an aggressive angle thats a separate issue were concerned about actual money in bank accounts and unpaid lifeinsurance policies that european banks and insurers have stolen youve been working for one black man in chicago whose claim was denied after he paid up his policy im trying to do the same for tens of thousands of people whose parents thought they were leaving their children a financial cushion and i wanted to know why louis durham showed up outside ajax so convenientlyhe never started campaigning for slave reparations until we started our campaign to force ajax to pay off lifeinsurance policies i was startled so you thought rossy was bribing him to march against you to disrupt operations at his own company you should take it to oliver stone but i guess you took it to rossy himself did he say yes yes i confess if youll only picket beth israel instead of ajax ill stop giving money to louis durham are you being stupid on purpose posner spat at me naturally rossy denied any collusion but he also assured me he would do a thorough internal search for any policies at ajax or edelweiss that belonged to holocaust victims and you believed him i gave him a week he convinced me he was serious enough to have one week then what are you doing here i asked why not give the boys some time off he came to help me paul radbuka pink with excitement turned on me as suddenly as hed accepted me a moment earlier just because you wont let me see my family just because you hired thatthat brownshirt to keep me from talking to my little cousin that doesnt mean theyre not my family let max loewenthal see how it feels to be ostracized for a change paul you really need to understand that he is not related to you you are not only making them and yourself miserable by stalking mr loewenthals family you are running a serious risk of being arrested believe me life in prison is terrible radbuka scowled max is the one who belongs in prison treating me with this kind of contempt i looked at him baffled about how to penetrate his dense cloud of denial paul who was ulrich really that was my foster father are you going to try to make me confess he was my real father i wont he wasnt but rhea says that ulrich wasnt his name his face turned from pink to red dont try to call rhea a liar youre the liar ulrich left behind documents in code they prove that my name is really radbuka if you believed in rhea youd understand the code but you dont youre trying to destroy her you want to destroy me i wont let you i wont i wont i wont i watched in alarm as he began shaking wondering if he was having a seizure of some kind when i moved to try to help him posner barked at me to keep my distance he was not going to allow a woman to touch one of his followers even if radbuka himself was not aware of the danger a womans touch posed he and leon supported radbuka over to a bench at the bus stop i watched for a moment but radbuka seemed to be calming down i left the men to it and walked slowly up the street back to the hospital hoping for a word with max before returning to my office posner made a certain kind of sense i told max when his weary secretary got him to give me five minutes with his ideas about ajax bribing durham to start demonstrating but really he must be as crazy as paul radbuka to stage a demonstration here how are things going with your donors max doesnt often look his age but this afternoon his skin was drawn tight and grey across his cheekbones i dont understand any of this victoria morrells friend don strzepek came over last night in good faith i let him look at my old notes i thought he believed them surely a friend of morrells wouldnt have been abusing my trust but those notesthey dont have enough detail about the radbukas for anyone to know if this guy paul is a relative or notunless theres something in your file i didnt see he made a tired gesture just that letter of lottys which you read surely don wouldnt have used that to encourage paul to believe he was a relative would he i dont think so max i said but not with total confidence i was remembering the glow in dons eyes when he looked at rhea wiell i can try to talk to him tonight though if youd like yes why dont you do that he sat heavily at his desk his face an effigy i never thought i would be happy to see the last of my family but i will be glad when calia and agnes get on that plane xxxvi rigmarole new word for the same old story i slowly walked back to my car and drove down to my office obeying every speed limit every traffic sign the mornings adrenalinefueled fury was long gone i stared at the stack of messages mary louise had left for me then caught up with morrell at his hotel in rome where it was nine at night the conversation both cheered and further depressed me he said the kinds of things one wants to hear from a lover especially when the lover is about to go into the land of the taliban for eight weeks but when we hung up i felt more forlorn than ever i tried to take a nap on the cot in my back room but my mind wouldnt shut down i finally got up again and determinedly went through the messages returning phone calls halfway through the pile was a note to call ralph at ajax the company had decided to make the sommers family whole i got back to him at once mind you vic this is a onetimeonly event ralph devereux warned when i called him dont expect to make it a habit ralph this is wonderful newsbut whose idea was it yours rossys did alderman durham call and urge you on to do this he ignored me and another thing i would greatly appreciate it if you let me know the next time you sic the cops on my employees youre right ralph i got caught up in an emergency at a hospital but i should have called you did they arrest connie ingram mary louise had left a typed report about sommers and about amy blount which i was trying to scan while i talked between mary louises police contacts and freeman carters skill the state had let isaiah sommers go home but theyd made it clear he was their frontrunner the trouble was not his prints on the door per se the finch said the techs had confirmed what the twentyfirst district cops had told margaret sommers theyd received an anonymous phone tipprobably from a black malewhich was what made them print the room no but they came right here to the building to question her right to the sacred halls of ajax itself when he sputtered a request to can the sarcasm that it disrupted everyones workday to have cops in the building i added connie ingram was lucky lucky to be a white female maybe its embarrassing to have the cops question you in your office but they took my client away from his workstation in cuffs they hauled him over to twentyninth and prairie for a chat in a windowless room with a bunch of guys watching through the oneway glass hes only eating at home tonight because i hired him the best criminal lawyer in town ralph brushed that aside karen bigelowconnies supervisor rememberkaren sat in on the interrogation along with one of our lawyers connie was extremely upset but the police seemed to believe her or at least they didnt arrest her the trouble is vic they pulled phone records for fepples office and found several calls from her extension including one the day before he was killed she says she did call him several times to get him to fax his copies of the sommers documents to her but janoff is pissed at having cops in the place rossy is pissed and frankly vic im not very happy myself i put down the notes to give him my full attention poor connie its a hard reward for doing your duty to be grilled by the cops i hope the company doesnt abandon her ralph what deal did rossy do with durham and posner to get them to call off their protests what the hell are you talking about he suddenly was really angry not just blustering i mean that rossy swung down adams street yesterday while i was upstairs with you he called durham over to his car met with him an hour later at his home and finished up by talking privately to joseph posner today posner was picketing beth israel hospital while durham s left the arena i called city hall just now durham was in his office listening to pleas for exceptions to zoning ordinances in stewart ridge ralph blew frosty air across the line to me is it so strange that the managing director tries for a oneonone with the guys who want to shut down his company hes stuck in traffic like every other stiff in the loop last night and sees his chance dont try to spin that into a conspiracy for me ralph remember when we met remember how you got that bullet in your shoulder the memory still rankled how his boss had betrayed both him and the company what could rossy possibly be doing that would involve a worthless agent on chicago s south side edelweiss couldnt have anything to do with howard fepple use your head vic im trying but it isnt telling me anything very intelligible listen ralph i know you have mixed feelings about me but youre a savvy insurance guy put these things together for me all the sommers documents disappear except for the paper fileabout which you think theres something amiss although you cant put your finger on itand that file spent a week in rossys office throw this in either connie ingram or someone pretending to be her set up a date with fepple for last friday night who besides ajax personnel knew shed been talking to him next fepples dead and his copy of the file disappears and rossy invites me to dinner very much on the spur of the moment whereupon fillida and her italian friends pump me in concert about fepple his death and his files and finally theres that odd document i found in fepples papers the one i showed you with sommerss name on it what does all this add up to in your mind that we dropped the ball on sommers and on fepple ralph said coldly preston janoffs been over this with the head of agency management wanting to know why we kept a relationship with a guy who produced a policy a month for us in his good years janoffs agreed to make the sommers family whole well send out a check tomorrow on a total exception basis as i said but other than thatvic the rossys guests know youre a detective theyre avid about american crime its natural they should pump you and tell me this what earthly reason could bertrand rossy have for getting involved with a loser like fepple whom he never even heard of before last week he was right that was the crux of the problem i couldnt think of a reason ralph i was hearing last night that its fillidas money that runs edelweiss that bertrand married the bosss daughter thats not news her mothers family founded the company in the s they were swiss and theyre still the majority shareholders shes a funny woman very chic very softspoken but definitely in charge of whats said and done in the rossy home i gather she keeps close watch on what happens on adams street as well rossys a substantial guy just because he married up doesnt mean he doesnt do the job well anyway i dont have time for gossip about my managing directors wife i have work to do oh kiss my mistletoe i said but the line was dead i dialed back into ajax and asked for rossys office his secretary the cool wellgroomed suzanne put me on hold rossy came on in a surprisingly short time when i thanked him for last nights dinner he said my wife so enjoyed meeting you last night she says you are refreshing and original ill add that to my resumé i said politely which earned me one of his hearty laughs you must be pleased that joseph posners stopped haunting the ajax premises of course we are any day without a disturbance in a big company is a good one he agreed yep it may not surprise you to learn hes moved his protesters up to beth israel hospital he spun me some rigmarole which he says you gave him about you promising a private search of the edelweiss and ajax policies if hed leave ajax alone and haunt beth israel instead im sorry this word is new to me rigmarole farragoa bunch of nonsense what could the hospital possibly have to do with missing holocaust assets that i dont know ms warshawski or vici feel i can call you vic after our friendly evening last night about the hospital and holocaust assets you would have to talk to max loewenthal is that all did you discover any new or unusual information about that unusual piece of paper from mr fepples office i sat up very straight i could not afford to be inattentive the paper is at a lab but they tell me it was made at a plant outside basel sometime in the thirties does that ring a bell with you my mother was only just born in ms warshawski so paper from that era means very little to me does it mean anything to you nothing yet mr rossy but ill keep your intense interest in it in mind by the way theres a rumor floating around the street that alderman durham only started his campaign on slave reparations after ajax got worried about the holocaust asset recovery pressure have you heard that his laugh bounced along the line again the bad thing about being a senior officer is that one becomes too isolated i dont hear rumors which is a pity as they are after all the oil that turns the industrial engine are they not that is an interesting rumor certainly definitely but it is also news to me i wonder if its also news to signora rossy this time he paused fractionally before continuing it will be when i tell her as you gathered last night no affair of ajax is too small for her keen interest and i will tell her we have another new english expression from you rigmarole i left a meeting for this rigmarole goodbye what had that netted me just about nothing but i dictated it to my wordprocessing center at once so i could study it when i wasnt feeling so overwhelmedi still had a bunch more calls to make i went back to mary louises notes first before calling my lawyer freeman on the run as usual said he was convinced personally of isaiah sommerss innocence but the anonymous phone tip and the fingerprints werent good signs then i guess we need to find the real killer i said with dogged cheerfulness i dont think the guy can afford your fee vic he cant afford yours either freeman but im still asking you to look after him freeman chuckled so this will get added to your unpaid balance i send you a big chunk of change every month i protested yep youve gotten the balance down to thirteen thousandbefore sommerss fees of course but youll go find me some evidence excellent i was sure we could count on you in the meantime i keep reminding the states attorney that fepple had a date friday night with someone using the name connie ingram whom he was anxious to keep you from seeing im running vicwell talk tomorrow that outstanding balance at freemans was one of my biggest headaches it had gotten out of hand last year when id had serious legal troubles but even before that it had always hovered in the fourfigure range ive been putting a thousand on it every month but it seems like every month i also generate some new need for his billable hours i called isaiah sommers when i told him that someone had ratted him out to the cops he was flabbergasted who could have done that ms warshawski how do you know she didnt do it herself margaret sommers hissed on the extension the cops had a tip from a man by the way ms sommers who sounded africanamerican to them on the replay my sources in the department say theyre pretty sure the call really was anonymous i will keep looking into the situation but it would be helpful if you could tell me of anyone who hates you enough to turn you in for murder you cant keep looking he mumbled i cant afford to pay you dont worry about that part the investigation is getting big enough that someone else will pay the bill he didnt need to know the someone would be me by the way not that its much consolation when youre worrying about a murder charge but ajax is going to pay your aunt the value of the policy funny how that happened just as your bill was going to grow margaret snapped maggie maggie pleaseshe just said someone else would be taking care of her bill ms warshawski this is wonderful news margaret shes just worried like i am too of course but mr carter he seems like a good lawyer a real good lawyer and hes sure you and he together can get this bad business straightened out its good when the client is happy trouble was he seemed to be alone in his good cheer his wife was miserable as was amy blount and paul radbuka me max and most especially lotty she had left the hospital for her clinic after her confrontation with posner but when i phoned mrs coltrain said dr herschel wouldnt interrupt her schedule to talk to me i thought of her vehement outcry yesterday evening that shed never stinted a patient that it was a relief to be in the hospital to be the doctor not the friend or the wife or the daughter oh lotty who were the radbukas i cried to the empty room whom do you feel you betrayed not a patient shed said that last night someone shed turned her back on whose death consumed her with guilt it had to have been someone in england otherwise how had questing scorpio gotten the name a relative was all i could imagine perhaps a relative who appeared in england after the war that lotty couldnt cope with someone she had loved in vienna but whom the horrors of war had so damaged that lotty turned away from her i could see it could see doing it myself so why couldnt she talk to me about it did she really think i would judge her i checked questing scorpio again but there was still no response to my posting what else could i dobesides go home to walk the dogs make dinner go to bed sometimes routine is soothing but at other times its a burden i searched for edelweiss on the web to see if i could come up with any information about fillida rossys family i sent the query through both lexis and proquest and went back to the phone calling don strzepek he answered my greeting cautiously remembering that we hadnt parted very cordially yesterday any word from the intrepid journalist hes made it as far as rome without a scratch i guess theyre off to islamabad tomorrow dont worry about him vic hes been in worse places than kabul hard as it is for me to think of any offhand i mean its not a war zone these daysno ones going to shoot at him he may get heckled but hes more likely to be the object of curiosity at least among the kids i felt a little better don on a different subjectwhat did you think after you saw maxs notebooks last night do you agree that he didnt know the radbukas before he made that trip to vienna after the war yes it was clearly dr herschels connection more than maxs especially since it was she who fainted at the party on sunday when she heard sofie radbukas name she seemed to have an awful lot of detail about exactly how to hunt down the apartment on the leopoldsgasse he added hesitantly im wondering if the radbukas were her family so radbuka can start stalking her instead of max you know he was at beth israel today with posner and his maccabees screaming to the world that lotty and max were trying to keep holocaust survivors from their birth families i know it must be painful for them but paul really is a tormented spirit vic if he could just find someplace to anchor himself it would calm him down have you actually talked to the recoveredmemory poster boy yourself i asked is there any hope of getting him to show you those papers his father left behind the ones that proved to him that his father was with the einsatzgruppen and that he himself was a camp survivor named radbuka don paused to make a hissing noisepresumably inhaling smoke i did meet him briefly this morningi guess before he joined posner at the hospital hes pretty agitated these days rhea wouldnt let me ask him too many questions for fear of getting him more upset he wont let me see the papershe seems to think i might be a rival for rheas affection so hes clamming up on me i couldnt suppress a snort of laughter ive got to hand it to rhea for sticking with the guy hed have me in the locked ward at elgin within a week if i tried to follow his gyrations around the dance floor although of course you are a rival i can see his point of view what does rhea say she says she cant betray a patient confidence which of course i respect her for although my old reporters instincts make that hard to do he gave a little laugh that managed to sound both rueful and admiring she encouraged his involvement with posner because posners giving him a sense of real family but of course we didnt know when we saw him they were going to go picket max at the hospital im seeing her for dinner tonight so ill talk to her about it then i made a little structure out of paper clips while i chose my words don i asked radbuka today who ulrich was and he had kind of a fit on the street saying it was his foster fathers name and that i was accusing rhea of being a liar but you know yesterday she made quite a point that ulrich wasnt the guys name she even seemed to be laughing at me a little over that he sucked in another lungful of smoke id forgotten that i can try to ask her again tonight butvic im not going to play man in the middle between you and rhea no don i dont expect you to all i wanted him to do was be on my side pump her for information and feed it to me that wasnt really asking him to be in the middle but if you can persuade her that max isnt related to the radbuka family maybe she in turn can persuade paul to stop making a scene up at beth israel only don for gods sake please dont feed lotty to rhea as a substitute for max i dont know if the radbukas were cousins or patients or enemy aliens in london whom lotty was close to but she wont survive the kind of harassment pauls been giving max i waited for his response but he wouldnt promise me anything i ended up slamming the phone down in disgust before giving up detecting for the day i also phoned amy blount mary louises report had said that the breakin at her place had been the work of a pro not a random smashandgrab the padlock on the gate was intact mary louise had written someone had run a torch around it taking the gate apart the scorch marks on the kitchen door were obvious because you were interested in her connection to ajax i asked her specifically about any ajax documents she didnt have originals she had scanned various thcentury files to a floppy which was missing in fact all her dissertation notes were missing the perps damaged her computer as well nothing else was gone not even her sound system i talked terry into sending down a proper forensics crew but were still not likely to find the perps i commiserated with ms blount over her misery then asked if her paper files had been tampered with oh yes those are gone too all my research notes who could want them if id known i was sitting on such hot material id have published my dissertation by now id have a real job instead of hanging on in this rathole writing diddly corporate histories ms blount what papers had you copied from the ajax files i did not take classified internal documents i did not hand confidential company information to alderman durham ms blount please i know this has been a tough twentyfour hours but dont jump on me im asking for quite a different reason im trying to figure out what is going on at ajax insurance these days i explained what had been happening since id visited her on fridayprimarily fepples death sommerss problems connie ingrams name appearing on fepples appointment register the real oddity was the fragment of a document i found she listened carefully to everything i said but my description of the handwritten document didnt sound like anything shed seen ill be glad to look at iti could come by your office tomorrow sometime offhand it sounds like something out of an old ledger but i cant interpret all those marks unless i see them if it has your clients name on it it would be recent at least by my standards the papers i copied dated from the s because my research is on the economics of slavery she was suddenly depressed again all that material is missing i suppose i can go back to the archives and recopy it its the sense of violation that gets me down and the pointlessness of it all xxxvii my kingdom for an address melancholy gave me a restless nights sleep i got up at six to run the dogs i was in my office by eightthirty even though i stopped for breakfast again at the diner even though i made a detour to lottys clinic on my way down i didnt see hershe was still at the hospital making rounds as soon as mary louise came in i sent her to the south side to see if any of sommerss friends could help figure out who had fingered him i called don strzepek back to see if hed had any luckor id had any luckin getting rhea to take pauls harassment of max seriously he gave an embarrassed cough she said she thought it was a sign of strength in him that he was making new friends but she could see that he might need a greater sense of proportion so shell talk to him i couldnt keep the impatience out of my voice she says shell bring it up at his next regular appointment but she cant take on the role of managing her patients lives they need to function in the real world fall pick themselves up like everyone else if they cant do that then they need more help than she can give them shes so amazing he crooned ive never known anyone like her i cut him short halfway through his love song asking him if that highsixfigure book advance was clouding his objectivity on paul radbuka he hung up hurt i wasnt willing to discover rheas good points i was still snarling to myself over that conversation when murray ryerson called from the heraldstar beth blacksin had told him about my private conversation with posner yesterday at the demonstration for old times sake v i he wheedled me far off the record what was that about far off the record murray may horace greeley rise from the dead and wither your testicles if you talk even to your mother about this let alone blacksin scouts honor warshawski he had never betrayed such a confidence in the past off the record i dont know what it means but posner and durham both had private audiences with bertrand rossy the managing director of edelweiss re whos in chicago overseeing their takeover of ajax i was wondering if rossy had offered posner something to get him to stop protesting at ajax and move on to beth israel but i didnt get anywhere with asking posner he might talk to youwomen scare him maybe its just you v iyou scare me and im twice posners size durham thoughno ones ever pinned anything on him even though the mayor has the cops sticking to him like his underwear guys one smooth operator but if i learn something splendid about either of them i promise ill share i felt a little better when id hung up it was good to have some kind of ally i took the l downtown to meet with clients who actually were paying me to do sophisticated work on their behalf and got back to my office a little before two the phone was ringing as i unlocked the door i got to it just as the answering service did it was tim streeter in the background i could hear calia howling timwhats going on we have a small situation here vic ive been trying to call you for the last few hours but you didnt have your phone on our pal was back this morning i have to admit my guard was down i assumed he was concentrating on posner these days anyway you know he goes everywhere by bicycle calia and i were in the park on the swings when he came roaring across the grass on his bike he grabbed at calia of course i had her in my arms before he touched her but he got that nibusher you know that little blue dog she takes everywhere behind him i could hear calia scream not nibusher hes ninshubur the faithful hound he misses me he needs me right now i want him now tim oh hell i said max needs to get a restraining order on this guyhes like a disintegrating roman candle these days and that damned therapist is zero helpnot to mention strzepek i should have been following paul made sure i got his home address will you call your brother and tell him i want him ready to tail radbuka home from posners office or rhea wiells or wherever he next pops up will do i couldnt follow him out of the park of course because i needed to stay with the kid this is not a good situation max and agnes know okay let me talk to calia for a minute at first calia refused to talk to aunt vicory she was tired she was scared and she was reacting the way kids do digging her heels in but when tim said i had a message about nebbisher she reluctantly came to the phone tim is very naughty he let the bad man take ninshubur and now he says his name wrong tim feels bad that he didnt look after ninshubur for you sugar but before you go to bed tonight ill try to have your doggy back to you im leaving my office right now to start looking okay okay aunt vicory she said in a resigned voice when tim came back on the line he thanked me for drying up the tearshed been starting to feel desperate hed reached agnes at her gallery appointment she was on her way home but hed rather protect the israeli prime minister in syria than look after another fiveyearold i drummed my fingers on the desktop i called rhea wiell who was fortunately between appointments when i explained the situation and said it would be really helpful if we could get the dog back today she said she would bring it up with paul when she saw him friday morning of course vic all he wants it for is as a talisman of the family that he sees as denying his ties to them in the early days of his treatment with me he would take little things from my office thinking i didnt see him doing it cups from the waiting room or one of my scarves as he became stronger he stopped doing that you know him better than i do rhea but poor calia is only five i think her needs come first here could you call him now and urge him to return it or let me have his phone number so i can call him i hope youre not making up this whole episode in an effort to try to get his home number from me vic under the circumstances i doubt you of all people could persuade him to see you he has an appointment with me in the morning ill talk to him about it then i know don is convinced that max loewenthal is not related to paul but max certainly holds the key to pauls door to his european relatives if you could get max to agree to see him max offered to see him when paul crashed the party on sunday he doesnt want to see maxhe wants max to embrace him as a family member if you could get paul to let us look at his family papers no she said sharply i thought as soon as you called that youd come up with some other way of trying to wheedle me into letting you see those and i was right i will not violate pauls privacy he endured too many violations as a child for me to do that to him she hung up on me why couldnt she see her prize exhibit belonged in the locked ward at menard or on heavy doses of antipsychotics that irritated thought gave me an idea i looked up the number for posners holocaust asset recovery committee on touhy when a man answered i pushed my nose down to make my voice sound nasal this is casco pharmacy in river forest i said i need to reach mr paul radbuka he doesnt work here the man said oh dear were filling his prescription for haldol but we dont have his address he left this phone number you dont know where we can reach him do you we cant fill a prescription for this kind of drug without an address well you cant use our address hes not on staff here very good sir but if you do have some way for me to reach him this is the only phone number he gave us the man put the receiver down with a bang leon did that guy radbuka fill out a form when he came in on tuesday were starting to get his phone calls and i for one have no wish to act as his answering service i heard talk back and forth on the floor most of it complaining about radbuka and why did reb joseph want to burden them with such a difficult person i heard leon the trusted henchman posner brought with him to our talk outside the hospital yesterday rebuke them for questioning reb josephs judgment before picking up the phone himself who is this casco pharmacy in river forest we have a prescription for haldol were trying to fill for mr paul radbuka and we need his home address this is a powerful antipsychotic drug we cannot dispense it without some way of reaching him i spoke in a nasal singsong as if id been trained to reel off the bureaucratic litany by heart yeah well can you make a note in your records not to use this number this is a business office where he sometimes does volunteer work but we cant take his messages heres his home address my heart was beating as hard as if i were hearing a message from my lover i copied down a number on roslyn street then read it back forgetting in my excitement to use my nasal singsong but what difference did that make now i had what i wanted and i hadnt needed to break rhea wiells jaw to get it xxxviii heartbreak house roslyn was a tiny street barely a block long that emptied onto lincoln park radbukas house was on the south side near the park end it was an old greystone whose front like most of the houses in this exclusive block was set close to the street i wanted to smash down the door charge in and forcibly confront radbuka but i made as discreet a survey as i could this close to lincoln park a lot of joggers dogwalkers and other athletes kept passing me even though it was still a bit early in the afternoon for people to be home from work the front door was a massive piece of wood with a peephole making it possible for radbuka to study his visitors keeping myself out of its range i rang the bell vigorously leaning on it for four or five minutes when there wasnt an answer i couldnt resist the idea of going inside to see if i could find the documents that proved to him that radbuka was his name i tried the front doorit would be ridiculous to risk being spotted breaking and entering if i could get in easilybut the brass knob didnt turn i didnt want to stand with my picklocks in full view of so many joggers id have to go in through the back id had to park three blocks from roslyn street i returned to my car and took a navy coverall from a box in the back a patch on the left pocket proclaimed peoples power service that and a tool belt completed an easy piece of camouflage i took them into the womens rest room in the conservatory and came out a minute later my hair covered in a blue kerchief looking like a piece of the service woodwork the yuppies would overlook back at radbukas house i tried the bell again then went up a narrow strip of flagstones along the houses east side leading to the back it was bisected by a tenfoothigh gate with a lock set in the middle the lock was a complex dead bolt i crouched down with my picklocks trying to ignore the passersby in the hopes they would do the same to me i was sweating freely by the time i got the tumblers pressed back the lock had to be opened by a key no matter which side of the gate you were on i wedged a piece of paper into the bolt hole to keep the tongue from reengaging the lots on roslyn were narrowbarely wider than the houses themselvesbut deep without the service alleys and garages that run between most streets in the city an eightfoothigh wooden fence somewhat dilapidated separated the garden from the street behind pauls father must have made a fortune doing whatever he did for the son to afford this house on this street but either depression or lack of money made paul let it go the garden was a tangle of overgrown bushes and kneehigh weeds as i waded through them to the kitchen entrance several cats snarled at me and moved off a shiver ran down my spine the lock here seemed identical to the gate so i used the same combination of picks and had it open in less than a minute before going into the kitchen i pulled on a pair of latex gloves just so i wouldnt forget to do it later i grabbed a dish towel from above the sink and wiped the outside knob on the back door the kitchen cabinets and appliances hadnt been replaced in a good thirty years the pilots on the old stove glowed blue in the dim light the enamel was chipped down to metal along the edges of the oven door the cabinets were the kind of thick brown pressed wood that had been popular in my childhood paul had eaten breakfast here this morning the milk hadnt begun to curdle in the cereal bowl hed left on the table the room was cluttered with old newspapers and mail a calendar still hung near the pantry but it wasnt filthy paul seemed to keep on top of his dishes more or less which was more than could be said for me much of the time i went down the hall past a dining room with a substantial table that could have seated sixteen a breakfront held a collection of china a delicate pattern of blue flowers on a creamy background it looked as though there was enough china to give sixteen people a fivecourse meal without stopping to wash any plates but the dust on the dishes showed that nothing like that had been attempted recently all of the rooms on the ground floor were like this filled with heavy carved furniture but covered in dust haphazard stacks of paper stood everywhere in the living room i found a copy of the süddeutsche zeitung dating back to a photograph on the wall by the fireplace showed a boy and a man in front of a cottage with a lake in the background the boy was presumably paul around ten or eleven the man presumably ulrich a barrelchested balding figure who stood next to his son smiling but stern paul was looking anxiously up at his father but ulrich stared straight ahead at the camera you wouldnt look at the picture and say oh these two must be relatedeither physically or by love a sitting room next to the main living room had apparently served as ulrichs study originally hed probably decorated it to look like some periodfilm version of an english country library with a double leather kneehole desk a leather armchair and shelves for books covered in tooled leathera complete shakespeare a complete dickens thackeray trollope in english and goethe and schiller in german the books had been flung about with a furious hand pages were crumpled spines brokena wanton display of destruction the same violent hand had taken the desk apart the drawers stood open papers pulled from them and tossed on the floor had paul done this attacking his dead father by pounding on his possessions or had someone been searching the house ahead of me and for what who besides me cared about the papers linking ulrich to the einsatzgruppen or had ulrich had other secrets i couldnt take the time right now to sift through the books and papers especially since i didnt know what i was looking for id have to get mary louise and the streeter brothers to sort them later if we could get paul out of the house long enough radbukas silver mountain bike stood in the formal tiled entryway so hed come back here after snatching ninshubur perhaps the mornings emotional upheaval had exhausted him and hed tucked himself in bed with the little blue dog i went up a carved wood staircase to the second floor and started with the rooms at the south end of the hall where the stairway opened the biggest with its set of heavy silver brushes monogrammed with a curlicue u and what looked like either an h or a k must have belonged to ulrich the bedstead and wardrobe were massive carved pieces that might have been three hundred years old had ulrich brought all this heavy furniture with him from germany from some opulent wartime looting or was buying them his sign to himself of success in the new world the musty smell in the room made me doubt that paul had changed the linens since his fathers death those six or seven years ago i poked through the wardrobe and dresser drawers wondering if ulrich had left anything in his pockets or tucked beneath his severe pajamas i was beginning to get discouraged an old house filled with stuff that hadnt been sorted out in thirty yearsi doubted if seven maids with seven mops could get through it in under a year my spirits flagging i went across the hall fortunately that room and another further up the passage were both empty not even holding bedsteadsno houseguests for the ulrichs pauls own bedroom was the last one on the left it was the only room in the house with new furniture he had made an effort to spruce it upperhaps to separate himself from his fatherwith the most extreme angular examples of modern danish design i looked through it carefully but didnt see ninshubur so had he gone out againto rheacarrying the dog with him as a trophy a bathroom separated pauls bedroom from a hexagonal room overlooking the rank back garden heavy drapes in a dull bronze shut out any outside light i flipped on the overhead light to reveal an extraordinary sight a large map of europe was attached to one wall red pins were stuck into it when i got close enough to read the lettering i saw they marked the concentration camps of the nazi era the big ones like treblinka and auschwitz and others like sobibor and neuengamme that id never heard of another smaller map next to it showed the paths of the einsatzgruppen through eastern europe with einsatzgruppe b circled and underlined in red other walls had the photographs of horror weve all become used to emaciated bodies in striped clothes lying on boards faces of children their eyes large with fear crammed into railway cars helmeted guards with alsatians snarling at people behind barbed wire the chilling smoke from crematorium chimneys so startled was i by this display that i noticed the most shocking sight almost as an afterthought i think my brain first saw it as one more garish exhibit but it was horribly real crumpled faceforward beneath the bronze drapes lay paul radbuka blood staining the floor around his outflung right arm i stood frozen for an interminable second before darting around the papers littering the floor to kneel next to him he was lying partly on his left side he was breathing in rasping shallow gasps bloody bubbles popping out of his mouth the left side of his shirt was soaked with blood that had formed a pool on the floor beneath him i ran to the bedroom and grabbed the comforter and a sheet my own knees were stained now with blood my right hand as well from where id pushed against the floor while feeling for his pulse i returned to radbuka draping the comforter over him turning him gently within its warmth so i could see where the blood was coming from i ripped his shirt open the dog ninshubur greenybrown with blood fell out i tore a length of sheet and pressed it against radbukas chest blood continued to come from a wound on the left side but it was oozing not spurting he wasnt bleeding from an artery when i lifted the pad i could see an ugly gash near the breastbone the telltale jagged tear of bullet into flesh i tore another piece of sheet and made a pad which i pressed firmly against the hole then tied it into place with a long strip i wrapped him in the comforter head to toe leaving just enough of his face showing that he could get oxygen through the labored breaths he was taking keep you warm buddy until the paramedics get here the only phone i remembered was in the living room i ran back down the stairs leaving a trail of bloodstains on the carpet and called the front door will be open i said this is an extreme emergency gunshot wound to the chest victim unconscious breath shallow paramedics should come up the stairs to the north end of the floor i waited for a confirmation then unlocked the front door and ran back upstairs to radbuka he was still breathing wheezing as he exhaled gasping as he sucked in air i felt the pad it seemed to be holding as i adjusted the comforter i felt a lump in his pocket that must be his wallet i pulled it out wondering if it would have some proof of identity that would let me know his birth name no drivers license an atm card for the fort dearborn trust in the name of paul radbuka a mastercard same bank same name a card saying that in an emergency one should call rhea wiell at her office no insurance card nothing to show any other identity i slipped the wallet gently back into his pocket it dawned on me that i didnt look my best with my latex gloves now red with blood and my picklocks in my tool belt if the cops came with the paramedics i didnt want to have to answer awkward questions about how i got in i ran into the bathroom washed my gloved hands quickly but thoroughly and opened one of the windows in pauls bedroom i tossed the picklocks at an overgrown shrub in the garden disturbing a cat that took off with a heartstopping yowl it disappeared between two broken boards in the back fence back in the room with paul i picked up ninshubur did you save his life you poor little bloodstained hound howd you do it i inspected the damp plush figure it was the dog tags id given calia for him one of them was bent and dimpled where the bullet had struck they were too soft to stop or deflect a bullet but maybe theyd helped slow it down i know youre a piece of evidence buti doubt youd tell a forensics team much well get you cleaned up and back to your little girl i think i couldnt think of a better way to secure ninshubur than the one paul had used i wrapped him in the last piece of sheet unbuttoned my coveralls and tucked him inside my blouse i listened to pauls breath and checked my watch four minutes since id called one more minute and id call again i got up and looked at the rest of the shrine wondering what the shooter had wanted so badly that heor she of coursehad shot paul to get it whoever had rifled ulrichs study had looked in here with the same ferocious impatience the books were hurled open in the same horrifying fashion i didnt touch them in case there were fingerprints but they seemed to be a major collection of holocaust writings memoirs histories ranging from elie wiesel to william shirer with everything in between i saw lucy dawidowiczs war against the jews flung against judith isaacsons seed of sarah if paul had read this stuff day after day he might have had a hard time distinguishing his memories from everyone elses i was starting down the stairs to use the phone again when i finally heard footsteps in the front hall and a loud shout up here i called taking off the latex gloves and stuffing them in a pocket the paramedics trotted up with their stretcher i directed them to the end of the hall following so as not to get in their way you his wife the medics asked no a family friend i said i was supposed to collect something from him and walked in on thisthis chaos he isnt married doesnt have any family that i know of can you come to the hospital to fill out the forms hes got independent means he can pay the bill himself if necessary i think his wallet has something in it about whom to notify in an emergency what hospital will you take him to compassionate hearttheyre the closest go to the reception desk in the er to fill out the forms when you get there can you help take this blanket away were going to shift him to the stretcher when i picked up the comforter a key fell outsomething paul had been holding that had dropped from his flaccid grasp i squatted to pick it up while they slid him to the stretcher being moved jolted him briefly awake his eyes flickered open not quite focusing and he saw me kneeling at face level hurts who you im one of rheas friends paul remember i said soothingly youre going to be okay do you know who shot you ilse he said on a rasping breath ilse bullfin rhea tell rhea ss know where bullfin i repeated doubtfully no he said correcting me in a weak impatient voice i still couldnt make out the last name clearly the paramedics started down the hall every second counted i trotted along to the top of the stairs as they started down paul thrashed on the stretcher trying to focus on me with his cloudy eyes rhea ill make sure she knows i said shell look after you it seemed a harmless enough comfort to offer him xxxix paul radbuka and the chamber of secrets radbuka passed out again as soon as hed taken in my reassurance the medics told me to stay in the house until the police came as the cops would want to question me i smiled and said sure no problem and locked the front door behind them the cops might come at once in which case id be trapped here but in case i had a few minutes grace i ran back up to the hexagonal room i pulled the gloves back on then looked helplessly at the mess on the floor at the drawers with papers pulled partway out of file folders in two minutes what could i possibly find i noticed a second smaller map of europe over the desk with a route drawn on in thick black marker starting in prague where paul had written terezin in a wobbly hand moving to auschwitz then to the southeast coast of england and finally a heavily drawn arrow pointing west toward america berlin vienna and lodz were all circled with question marks near themi guessed he had marked his putative birthplaces and his reconstructed route through wartime europe to england and america so so faster girl dont waste time i looked at the key that had dropped out of the comforter when the medics moved him it was an oldfashioned one with squaredoff wardsit could be to any kind of oldfashioned lock not a file cabinet but to one of the rooms a closet something in the basement or the third floor where i hadnt looked i wouldnt have time for that this room was his shrine something in here that the perpetrators hadnt found not a desk lock too big for that no closets anywhere i could see but these old houses always had closets in the bedrooms i pulled back the drapes revealing windows in the three pieces of wall that made up a kind of fake turret here the drapes hung beyond the windows covering the whole side of the room i walked behind them and came on the closet door the key worked in it perfectly when i found a pull cord for an overhead light i could hardly take in what i was looking at it was a deep narrow room with the same tenfoot ceiling as the bedroom the lefthand wall was covered in pictures some in frames some taped going up well above my head a number were photographs of the man whod been in the picture in the living room the one i assumed was ulrich these had been terribly disfigured heavy red and black swastikas covered them blocking out the eyes the mouth on some paul had written words you can see nothing because your eyes are coveredhow does it feel when someone does it to you cry all you want schwule youll never get out of here how do you feel now youve been locked in here all alone you want some food beg for it the words were venomous but puerile the work of a child feeling powerless against a horribly powerful adult in that interview paul had given on global tv hed said his father used to beat him used to lock him up the slogans scrawled on his fathers photographs were these the words hed heard when hed been locked in here no matter who paul was whether he was ulrichs son or a terezin survivor if hed been locked in here heard that torment small wonder he was so unstable it wasnt clear whether the room was to punish ulrich or to serve as pauls refuge interspersed with ulrichs disfigured face were pictures of rhea paul had cut them from magazines or newspapers and then apparently taken them to a studio to have prints madeseveral shots which had been cut out of newsprint were repeated in glossy framed photographs around these he had draped the things hed lifted from rheas office her scarf one of her gloves even some pale lavender tissues the cup hed taken from the waiting room stood underneath with a wilted rose in it hed also added memorabilia about max to the wall it made my stomach ache seeing the way hed accumulated information on maxs family in one short week there was a set of photographs of the cellini ensemble with michael loewenthals face circled programs from the chicago concerts theyd given last week photocopies of newspaper articles about beth israel hospital with maxs quotes circled in red maybe paul had been heading here to add ninshubur to the shrine when his assailant shot him the whole idea of the place was so horrible i wanted to run away from it i shuddered convulsively but forced myself to keep looking among the pictures of rhea was a woman i didnt recognize a framed fivebyseven photograph in a silver frame it showed a middleaged woman in a dark dress with large dark eyes and heavy brows over a mouth that was smiling in a kind of wistful resignation a placard hed attached to the frame said my savior in england but she couldnt save me enough facing the wall of pictures stood a little foldup bed shelves of canned food a tengallon water jug and a number of flashlights and underneath the cot an accordion file tied up in a black ribbon a disfigured photograph of ulrich was glued to the outside with the triumphant scrawl ive found you out einsatzgruppenführer hoffman dimly from the world outside the closet i heard the insistent ring of the front doorbell it jolted me awake away from the horrific symbols of pauls obsession i pulled the picture of his english savior from the wall stuffed it into the accordion folder jamming the folder inside my shirt behind the bloody little dog i ran down the stairs two at a time bolted down the hall and flung myself out the kitchen door i lay down in the rank grass thankful for the protection of the bloodstained coverall the accordion file pushed unpleasantly into my breasts i inched my way around the side of the house i could see the tail end of a cop car but no one was watching the side of the house they were expecting to find me the helpful family friend within still lying in the grass i looked around for the bush where id tossed my picklocks when id retrieved them i crawled stealthily to the back fence where i shed the bloodstained boiler suit and my kerchief stuffing the picklocks into the back pocket of my jeans i found the boards where id watched the cat vanish earlier pried them apart and shoved my way through as i walked down lake view street to my car i joined the crowd of gapers watching the cops force their way into radbukas house i tsked to myself in disapproval i could have shown them how to do it in a much neater way also they should have had someone at the side gate to watch for anyone trying to leave through the back these were not the best of chicago s finest my front felt damp looking down i saw that ninshubur had bled through the sheet and onto my blouse having discarded my bloodstained coverall to avoid being conspicuous i now looked as though id played the central role in openheart surgery i turned away clasping my arms across my sodden front feeling ninshubur squishing against the accordion file bending over as if in intense stomach pain i jogged the three blocks to my car i took my shoes off they were covered in blood which i didnt want to transfer to my car in fact they were the same crepesoled shoes id worn when id stepped in howard fepples remains on monday maybe it was time to kiss them goodbye i pulled a brown paper bag from a nearby garbage canister and stuck them into that i didnt have an alternate pair in the trunk but i could go home and change i found an old towel in the trunk and a rather rank tshirt left over from pickup softball this past summer i pulled the shirt over my bloodstained blouse inside the car i took out the faithful hound and wrapped him in the towel on the seat next to me his brown glass eyes stared at me balefully you are still a hero but one badly in need of a bath and i need to call tim to tell him about radbuka morrell had only been gone two days and i was already talking to stuffed animals not a good sign back at racine avenue i ran up the stairs in my stocking feet ninshubur clutched tightly in one hand peroxide for you my friend i found the bottle under the sink and poured it liberally onto ninshuburs head it foamed up around his brown eyes i took a brush and scrubbed hard all over his head and chest murmuring can this little paw ever be sweet again i left him to soak in a pan of cold water while i went into the bathroom to turn on the taps in the bathtub like the faithful dog ninshubur i was smeared in blood id take my blousea beloved soft cotton in my favorite dark goldto the cleaners but the brathe roseandsilver bra morrell had likedi bundled into a plastic bag for the garbage i couldnt stand the thought of pauls blood against my breasts even if i could get those brown stains out of the silver lace while the tub filled i called tim streeter up at maxs to let him know i had the faithful dog and that paul would definitely not be in a position to bother them before calia and agnes boarded the plane on saturday ive got the dog soaking in a basin of peroxide ill put him in the dryer before i leave the house again and hope hell look respectable enough that he wont freak out calia when she gets him back tim let out a sigh of relief but who shot radbuka a woman paul called her ilsei didnt quite get the last nameit sounded something like bullfin im utterly baffled by the way the police dont know i was in there and id like them to continue in blissful ignorance i never heard anything about you knowing where the dude lived tim said dropped the dog on the street did he bicycling away i laughed something like that anyway im going to take a bath ill come up in a couple of hours i want to show max a picture and some other stuff hows the kid doing shed fallen asleep in front of the television watching arthur agnes whod canceled her appointment at the gallery was curled up on the couch next to her daughter tim was standing in the playroom doorway where he could see both of them and michaels on his way into town agnes called him after this latest incident he wants to stay close until agnes and calia fly home on saturday hes already in the air landing at ohare in an hour or so even so i think you should hang on although there probably isnt any other risk to calia i said just in case that prize fanatic posner decides to carry on for his fallen disciple he agreed but added that babysitting was harder work than moving furniture id rather carry a grand piano up three flights of stairs at least when you got there youd know where the piano was and youd be done for the day i switched my house phone over to the answering service while i soaked obsessively sponging my breasts as if blood had seeped through the pores of my skin i shampooed my hair several times as well before i finally felt clean enough to leave the tub wrapped in a terry cloth robe i returned to the living room id dropped the accordion file on the piano bench when id run into the apartment for a long moment i stared down at ulrichs disfigured face which looked even worse for the blood that had seeped onto it id been wanting to see these papers since paul showed up at maxs last sunday now that they were within my reach i almost couldnt bear to read them they were like the special present of my childhood birthdayssometimes wonderful like the year i got roller skates sometimes a disappointment like the year i longed for a bicycle and got a concert dress i didnt think i could bear to open the file and find well another concert dress i finally undid the black ribbon two leatherbound books fell out on the front of each was stamped in peeling gold letters ulrich hoffman so that was why rhea wiell had smirked at me ulrich was his first name i could have called every ulrich whod ever lived in chicago and never found pauls father a black ribbon hung from the middle of one of the books i set the other down and opened this one to its marker the paper and the ornate script on it looked much the same as the fragment id found in howard fepples office a person who was fond of himself that was what the woman at cheviot labs had said using expensive paper for keeping accounting notes a domestic bully king only of the tiny empire of his son or an ss man in hiding the page i was looking at held a list of names at least twenty maybe thirty even in the difficult script one name in particular halfway down the page caught my eye next to it in a hand so heavy it cut through the paper paul had written in red sofie radbuka my mother weeping for me dying for me in heaven all these years praying for me my skin crawled i could hardly bear to look at the page i had to treat it as a problem a conundrum like the time in the pd when id represented a man who had skinned his own daughter his day in court where i did my best my god because id managed to dissociate myself and treat it as a problem all the entries followed the same format a year with a question mark and then a number the only variation i saw was that some had a cross followed by a check mark others just a cross did this mean they had died in or with or something i opened the second book this one held similar information to the scrap id found in fepples office columns of dates all written european style most filled in with check marks while some were blank what had howard fepple been doing with a piece of ulrich hoffmans old swiss paper i sat down hard on the piano bench ulrich hoffman rick hoffman was that paul radbukas father the old agent from midway with his mercedes and the books he carried around with him to check off who paid him whose son had an expensive education but never amounted to anything buthad he sold insurance in germany as well the man whod owned these books was an immigrant i dug rhonda fepples number out of my briefcase her phone rang six times before the answering machine picked up with howard fepples voice eerily asking for me to leave a message i reminded rhonda that i was the detective who had been to her house on monday i asked her to call me as soon as possible giving her my cellphone number then went back to stare at the books again if rick hoffman and ulrich were the same man what did these books have to do with insurance i tried to match the entries with what i knew of insurance policies but couldnt make sense of them the front of the first book was filled with a long list of names with a lot of other data that i couldnt decipher the list went on for pages i shook my head over it i squinted at the difficult ornate writing trying to interpret it what about it had made paul decide ulrich was with the einsatzgruppen what was it about the name radbuka that had persuaded him it was his the papers were in code hed screamed at me outside the hospital yesterdayif i believed in rhea id understand it what had she seen when hed shown these pages to her and finally who was the ilse bullfin who had shot him was she a figment of his imagination had it been a gardenvariety housebreaker whom he thought was the ss or was it someone who wanted these journals or was there something else in the house that the person had taken as shehewhoevertossed all those papers around even laying out these questions on a legal pad at my dining room table didnt help although it did make me able to look at the material more calmly i finally put the journals to one side to see if there was anything else in the file an envelope held ulrichs ins documents starting with his landing permit on june in baltimore with son paul hoffman born march vienna paul had xd this out saying paul radbuka whom he stole from england the documents included the name of the dutch ship they had arrived on a certification that ulrich was not a nazi ulrichs residentalien permits renewed at regular intervals his citizenship papers granted in on these paul had smeared nazi war criminal revoke and deport for crimes against humanity paul had said on television that ulrich wanted a jewish child to help him get into the states but there wasnt any reference to pauls religion or to ulrichs in the landing documents my brain would work better if i got some rest it had been a long day what with finding pauls body and his unnerving refuge i thought of him again as a small child locked in the closet terrified his revenge now as puny as when hed been a child xl confession i slept heavily but unpleasantly tormented by dreams of being locked in that little closet with swastikaed faces leering down at me with paul dancing dementedly outside the door like rumpelstiltskin crying youll never know my name it was a relief when my answering service brought me back to life at five a woman named amy blount had called she said she had offered to look at a document for me and could stop by my office in half an hour or so if that was convenient i really wanted to get up to maxs on the other hand mary louise would have left a report on her days interviews with isaiah sommerss friends and neighbors come to think of it ulrich hoffmans books might mean something to amy blount after all she was a historian she understood odd documents i put ninshubur in the dryer and called ms blount to say i was on my way to my office when i got there i made copies of some of the pages in ulrichs books including the one with pauls heavy marginalia while i waited for ms blount i looked over mary louises neatly typed report she had drawn a succession of blanks on the south side none of isaiah sommerss friends or coworkers could think of anyone with a big enough grudge against him to finger him to the cops his wife is an angry woman but at the bottom i believe she is on his sidei dont think she set him up terry finchley tells me the police right now have two competing theories connie ingram did it because fepple tried to assault her they dont like this because they believe what she says about not going to his office they do like it because her only alibi is her mother who sits in front of the tube most nights they also cant get around the forensic evidence showing that fepple or someone entered his hot date in his computer on thursday when everyone agrees fepple was still alive isaiah sommers did it because he thought fepple was robbing his family of ten thousand dollars they all could use they like this better because they can actually put sommers at the scene they cant prove he ever owned a caliber sig but they cant trace the gun anyway terry says theyd risk going to court if they could completely discount connie as a suspect he also says they know that with freeman carter and you acting for sommers they need to have castiron evidence they know mr carter would demolish them in court since they cant put the sig in sommerss hands any more than anyone elses the only odd thing here is sommerss cousin colbythis is his other uncles son the one he told you might have stolen the policy to begin with he hangs on the fringe of durhams empower youth energy hes been flashing cash lately and everyone is surprised because he never has any this cant be the original lifeinsurance money i scribbled on the page because that was cashed in almost a decade ago i dont know if its significant or not but poke at it tomorrow morning see if you can find anyone who knows where he got it as i dropped the report back on mary louises desk amy blount came to the door she had on her professional wardrobe the prim tweed suit with a severe blue shirt her dreadlocks were once again tied back from her face with the formal attire her manner had become more guarded again but she took ulrichs two journals and looked at them carefully comparing them with the photocopy of the fragment id found in fepples office she looked up with a rueful smile that made her seem more approachable i hoped i was going to perform some kind of hocuspocus on this impress you beyond expressionbut i cant if you hadnt told me youd found it in a german mans home id have guessed some jewish organizationthe names all look jewish to me at least the ones on the document you found in the midway insurance office someone was keeping track of these people marking off when they died only th sommers is still alive you think sommers is a jewish name i was startled i only associated it with my client in this context yesits there with brodsky and herstein after all i looked at the paper again myself could this be a different aaron sommers altogether was that why the policy had been paid out because fepples father or the other agent had confused my clients uncle with someone else with the same name but if it was just a case of simple confusionwhy had someone cared enough to steal all the papers relating to the sommers family im sorry i said realizing id missed what else shed been saying the dates what are they attendance records payment records it doesnt take sherlock holmes to say they were written by a european person and you know the man was german other than that i cant help you i didnt find anything like this in the files i looked at but of course ajax has company files not client records she didnt seem quite ready to leave so i asked her if she had heard any further accusations from bertrand rossy about feeding ajax material to alderman durham she played with a large turquoise ring on her index finger twisting it and looking at it under the light that was a strange event she said i suppose thats really why i wanted to come by to ask your opinionor to trade professional opinions i hoped i could tell you something about your document so that you could give me your opinion about a conversation i was intrigued you did your best ill do mine thisis not an easy thing for me to tell you and you would oblige me by promising to keep it confidential that is not to act on it i frowned without knowing in advancei cant promise that if it makes me party to a crime or if the information would help clear my client of a potential murder charge oh your mr sommers you mean your nonjewish mr sommers its not that kind of information itsits political it could be damaging politically and embarrassing for me to be known as someone who gave out the information then i can safely promise you that i will hold what you say in confidence i said gravely it concerns mr durham she said her eyes on her ring as a matter of fact he did ask me to give him documents from the ajax files he knew i was working on their historyeverybody did mr janoffyou know the chairman of ajaxwas quite gracious about introducing me to people at the gala they held for their hundredfiftieth anniversary even if he was a bit patronizingyou know how they do it heres the little gal who wrote up our history if id been white or a man would he have introduced me as the little guy but at any event i met the mayor i even met the governor and some of the aldermen including mr durham the day after the gala hemr durham that iscalled he wanted me to give him anything i had found in the archives which would support his claim i told him it wasnt mine to give and that even if it were i didnt believe in the politics of victimhood she looked up briefly he didnt take offense insteadwell i dont know if youve met him in person but he can have a great deal of charm and he exercised it on me i also wasrelievedthat he didnt start haranguing me as a race traitor or something of that ilk as people do sometimes when you dont go in lockstep with them he said he would leave the door open for further discussions and has he i prodded when she stopped he called me this morning and said he would take it as a favor if i would overlook his having asked me for the material he said it had been out of line for him and he was embarrassed to think that i might have thought of him as a man who would behave with such little attention to ethics she turned her head away now that im here this seemsyou know someone stole all my research notes and youre worrying whether he might have engineered the theft and that hes called to ask you to lay off because he already has what he needs she nodded miserable still unable to look at me when he called this morning i was only annoyed i thought how gullible do you believe i really am although i didnt say it you want my professional opinion just with that bit of informationid agree with you you see an empty cream jug and a cat licking its whiskersyou dont need to be marie curie to add two and two together but theres another little wrinkle on this i told her about rossy and durham talking in the middle of tuesday afternoons demonstration and durham going up to rossys apartment an hour later ive wondered if ajax was trying to buy off durham nowyour news makes me wonder if durham was trying to blackmail rossy was there anything in the data that edelweiss would pay blackmail to keep quiet i didnt see anything that struck me as that kind of secret nothing on holocaust files for instance or even a serious slavery exposure but there were hundreds of pages of archives things i copied that i thought i might look at later for a different project for instance id have to be able to see them and of course i cant she turned her head so i wouldnt see the tears of frustration durham and rossy what had brought them together posner had said it was only after he had started demonstrating outside ajax that durham began his campaignbut that didnt prove anything except durham s flair for the limelight i leaned forward youre a trained thinker i told you yesterday whats been going on around here now durham s demonstration has completely stopped he was a big presence at the ajax building last week and up to tuesday afternoon when rossy spoke to him i called his office they say theyre pleased that ajax blocked the holocaust asset recovery act since it didnt include an african slave reparations section so theyre putting their demonstrations on hold she flung up her hands it could be that simple i suppose it could have nothing to do with my papers at all i see its a complicated problem im sorry to say that i have another appointmentim teaching a seminar at the newbery library at sevenbut if you can give me one of the photocopies ill study it later if something occurs to me ill call you i walked out with her locking everything carefully i brought the photocopies id made along with the two books themselves i wanted max to look at the material to see if he understood the german the original might be easier for him to decipher than a photocopy i stopped at home to collect ninshubur from the dryer the little dog was still slightly damp and he was a paler blue than he used to be but the stains around his head and left side were almost gone a week of being dragged around by a child would soon mix enough dirt into his fur to make the faint line of blood unnoticeable before i left i tried rhonda fepple again but she was either still out or not up to answering the phone i left my name and cellphone number a second time i was getting into my car when i decided to go upstairs to my safe for my smith wesson someone was shooting guns awfully close to me if they started firing right at me i wanted to be able to shoot back xli family party as i drove north i turned on the local news police were anxious to speak to the woman who had admitted paramedics to the home of a lincoln park shooting victim she told paramedics she was a family friend but didnt give a name by the time police arrived to investigate the crime scene she had fled shedding the navy service coverall she was wearing its possible she belonged to a cleaning service and surprised a robbery in progress since no obvious valuables were missing the police are not releasing the name of the victim who is in critical condition following surgery to remove a bullet from his heart dang why hadnt i thought to say i was with a cleaning service my navy coverall had been perfect for it hopefully the paramedics thought i was an illegal immigrant who had fled to avoid revealing my papers to the cops hopefully i hadnt left my prints on anything hopefully the person who had shot paul hadnt been hanging around the house when i walked up to it to my surprise when i got to maxs not only was michael loewenthal there but also carl tisovand lotty the strain was still evident in the lines around lottys mouth and forehead but she and carl actually seemed to be laughing together agnes loewenthal greeted me exuberantly i know i shouldnt be so pleased that someones lying in hospital but im ecstaticchristmas and my birthday tied up in one gorgeous package and michael here to enjoy it with us carl bowed to me with an extravagant flourish and handed me a glass of champagne they were all drinking except lotty who seldom touches alcohol you came with michael i asked he nodded max is after all my oldest friend on the planet if anything happenedwell a child is more important than one concert more or less and lotty even decided the same thing about one operation more or less then we got here and found we could relax that that delusional menace wont be around again at least not while the little one is here before i could respond calia hurled herself into the living room yelling give me my ninshubur agnes promptly went to her urging her to display a few manners i pulled the dog from my briefcase your little puppy had a big adventure today he saved a mans life and he had to have a bath hes still a bit damp she grabbed the dog from me i know i know he jumpted into the river and carried the princess to safety hes wet because ninshubur the faithful hound leapt from rock to rock heedless of any danger did that bad man take his collar where are his tags like mitch now mitch wont know him i took off his collar to give him his bath ill get it back to you tomorrow youre bad aunt vicory you stoled ninshuburs collar she butted my leg aunt vicory is good agnes remonstrated she went to a lot of trouble to get your little dog back i want to hear you say thank you calia ignored her running around the room like a demented bumblebee bouncing off furniture off michael off me and off tim who had appeared with a tray of sandwiches excitement over the sudden arrival of her father whom she hadnt expected to see for some time and excitement over the days events had sent her completely over the top at any rate she didnt need my explanation of why her dog was damp and stainedit fit perfectly with the story of the faithful hound michael and agnes tolerated her antics for about three minutes before marching upstairs with her to the nursery suite when they had gone max asked for a detailed capitulation of the events around pauls shooting i told him everything including the frightening display devoted to himself and his family in pauls closet so you dont know who could have shot paul max said when id finished i shook my head and i dont even know if it was someone who was after the books i found in that dreadful closet maybe the fact that he was telling everyone he had papers proving his father was with the einsatzgruppen made some real nazi conspirators seek him out they didnt know he was a lunaticthey thought he was on to them so they shot him the evil temptress of course ilse bullfin seduced paul in order to get him to open the front door who max demanded sharply didnt i tell you i asked him who shot him and he said a woman named ilse i know i didnt get the last name quite right it sounded kind of like bullfin could it have been wölfin max asked saying the name in a fast low voice i strained to hear the difference between what he said and what paul had said vull youre saying not bull yes i suppose it could bethe two sounds are very close is she german do you know her ilse wölfinilse koch known as the shewolf a most monstrous concentrationcamp guard if thats who this poor devil thinks shot himumph id like to lay all this in front of a psychologistthis shrine his obsession with the holocaust i dont suppose hed let anyone besides this rhea wiell actually talk to him but i dont know if you could even count on it being a woman who shot him i dont know enough about delusionshe might confuse an assailant with an ss guard but would he still know the difference between a man and a woman what do you think lotty lotty shook her head the lines of strain deeper in her face that kind of pathology is beyond me we only know hes been deluding himself for a week about his relations with youbut confusing you with his brother hasnt made him think you were his mother after all max shifted uneasily what hospital did you say he was going to compassionate heart i could send someone over therehes so eager to be listened to he might talk to another doctor but that doctor could not tell you any revelations this man paul might make lotty protested you have no standing to get someone to reveal patient confidences to you max looked absurdly guilty he had clearly been planning to send a friend from beth israel who might as a favor to max violate the standards of confidentiality but whats in these books that made him keep them secret carl said do they show some reason to believe thats why he was shot i pulled the accordion file out of my briefcase id forgotten the picture of the woman id taken along i laid it on the coffee table in front of the three his savior in england you can see hes labeled it i said i couldnt help wonderingwell do you know her carl frowned at the dark wistful face london he said slowly i dont remember who except that its a long time ago during the war years maybe or right after he had this on this wall in the middle of his shrine to the therapist he worships lotty said in a high queer voice you know who she is i asked lotty looked grim i know who she isi can even show you the book where he found this picture if max has it on his shelves but why she interrupted herself to dart from the room we heard her running up the stairs her tread as always light that of a young woman max looked at the picture i dont recognize the face this isnt the doctor in london lotty worshiped as a child is it carl shook his head claire tallmadge was very fairthe perfect english rose i always thought that was part of lottys infatuation with her it used to make my blood boil how lotty would let that family call her the little monkey victoria lets see these books you brought with you i handed over the accordion file max and carl recoiled from the disfigured face on the front of it who is this carl demanded pauls father i said paul had a ton of photographs of him in that secret room all marked up like this not the bloodthat got there when i took it away with me lotty returned with a book which she held open at a page of photographs anna freud we all stared from pauls picture to the identical shot on the page dumbfounded until carl said of course you took me to hear her speak but she looked differentthis is such an intimate picture she was a refugee from vienna like us lotty explained i admired her to an extraordinary degree i even volunteered at the nursery she ran in hampstead during the war you know washing dishes the kind of thing an unskilled teenager could do minna used to lash out at mewell never mind that for a time i imagined i would follow anna freud and become an analyst myself butwell never mind that either why is this man claiming her as his savior does he imagine he was in the hampstead nursery the rest of us could only shake our heads bewildered what about these i handed over the ledgers ulrich max breathed looking at the peeling gold leaf stamped on the front how stupid of me to forget it is more often a first name than a last no wonder you couldnt find him what are these i think they must have something to do with insurance i said but you can see that paul had put them in here with the label einsatzgruppenführer ulrich hoffman since they were locked in his secret room im assuming these documents convinced him his name was radbuka but i frankly dont get it i showed them to a young historian whos been working in the ajax archives she said it looked like a jewish organizations ledgers would that be possible max picked up the second volume and squinted at it its been a long time since i tried reading this kind of oldfashioned german handwriting these are addresses i think it could be some kind of jewish welfare association i suppose a list of names and addressesperhaps the group all bought insurance together i dont understand the other numbers though unless your historian friend is right maybe s radbuka brought sixtyfive people with her and k omschutz brought fiftyfour he shook his head unsatisfied with that explanation and looked back at the books schrei what city has a street calledoh johann nestroy the austrian fairytale writer is this vienna lotty i dont remember either nestroy or schreigassen lottys skin looked waxen she took the book from max her arms jerky as if she were a marionette she looked at the page where he was pointing her finger moving slowly along the lines reading the names under her breath vienna yes it should be vienna leopoldsgasse untere augarten strasse you dont remember those streets where was your family driven after the anschluss her voice was a harsh squawk we lived on bauernmarkt max said we werent relocated although we had three other families all strangers pushed into our flat i cant say ive wanted to keep these street names in my head all these years im surprised you remember them his voice was pregnant with meaning lotty looked at him grimly i hastily intervened before they could start fighting this looks like the same paper stock and the same handwriting i found on a sheet of paper in the bag of a dead insurance agent on the south side which is why im assuming these are insurance documents the old agent was named rick hoffman and im betting hes pauls fatherstepfather or whatever would rick be a nickname for ulrich it could be max smiled wryly if he wanted to fit into america he would have picked a name everyone could pronounce instead of something alien like ulrich if he sold insurance he would have felt a special incentive to fit in i said ah yes i do believe this is an insurance journal carl turned to a page that was filled with names and dates with check marks like the fragment in fepples office didnt your family buy insurance like this loewenthal the agent came into the ghetto every friday on his bicycle my father and all the other men would pay their twenty or thirty korunas and the agent marked them off in his book you dont remember such a thing oh well you and lotty came from the haute bourgeoisie these weekly payments they were for people on small incomes my father found the whole process humiliating that he couldnt afford to go to an office pay his money up front like an important manhe used to send me down with the coins tightly wrapped in a twist of newspaper he started looking through the pages of tiny ornate writing my father bought his policy through an italian company in it occurred to me that i should claim that life insurance not that it was so much money but why should the company get to keep it i went through a long rigmarole but they were adamant that without the death certificate and without the policy number they would do nothing for me his mouth twisted bitterly i hired someonei was in a position to hire someonewho went back through the companys records and found the policy number for me but even so they never would pay it because i couldnt present the death certificate they are incredible thieves in their glass skyscrapers with their black ties and tails i make it an absolute policy that the cellini accepts no money from any insurance companies the management is livid over it but i think it could be my fathers coins wrapped in a scrap of newspaper that theyre using to buy their way onto artistic boards they wont sit on mine max nodded in sympathy lotty murmured all money has someones blood on it i suppose do you think these numbers are insurance sales then i asked after a respectful pause and the crosses that means the person died he put a check against those he could confirm perhaps in my bag on the floor my cell phone started to ring it was rhonda fepple speaking in the drugged halfdead voice of the newly bereaved had there been an arrest the police didnt tell her anything i took the phone out to the kitchen with me and told her the progress of the investigation if such it could be called before asking her if rick hoffman had been german german she repeated as if i had asked if he were from pluto i dont remember i guess he was foreign now that you mention iti remember mr fepple swearing out some legal forms for him when mr hoffman wanted to become a citizen and his son was his name paul paul i think so that could be right paul hoffman yes thats right what did paul come around and kill my boy was he jealous because howie inherited the agency could paul hoffmanradbuka be a murderer he was such a confused person butmurderer still maybe he had thought howard fepple was part of some einsatzgruppen conspiracyif he knew fepple had one of ulrichs old ledger books he might be crazy enough to think he had to destroy fepple it seemed absurd but everything involving paul radbukahoffman defied reason wouldnt your son have mentioned it if hed seen paul hoffman recently he might not have if he had some secret plan in mind rhonda said listlessly he liked to keep secrets to himself they made him feel important that seemed too sad an epitaph more to brace myself than her i asked if she had anyone to talk to to help her through this timea sister or a minister perhaps everything seems so unreal since howie died i cant make myself feel anything even getting the house broken into didnt upset me like youd think it would when did that happen her tone was as apathetic as if she were reciting a grocery list but the information jolted me i think it was the day afterafter they found him yes because it wasnt yesterday what day would that be tuesday did they take anything theres nothing here to take really but they stole my boys computer i guess gangs from the city come out here looking for things to steal to sell for drugs the police didnt do anything not that i care really none of it matters nowi wasnt ever going to use a home computer thats for sure xlii lottys perfect storm i stared out the kitchen window at the dark garden the same person who shot paul must have broken into rhonda fepples house theyshe ilse wölfinhad killed fepple not because of the sommers file but for some altogether different reasonto get the fragment from ulrich hoffmans ledgers id found in fepples bag and then theyd careened around chicago looking for the rest of the books howard fepple excited over the next big thing that was going to make him rich had put the bite on a lethal hand i shook my head fepple didnt know about hoffmans journals hed gotten roused by something he saw in the sommers policy file hed been excited hed told his mother shed be driving a mercedes of her own hed found out how rick hoffman made money from his lousy client list not because of the ledgers behind me i heard raised voices the front door slam a car start could it be simpler than that could paul hoffmanradbuka have murdered fepple maybe he was deluded enough to imagine that fepple was part of his fathers einsatzgruppe but thenwho had shot paul i couldnt make sense of any of it gerbil on treadmill going round and round what had fepple noticed that i wasnt getting or what paper had he seen that his murderer had taken away these secret papers of pauls which i thought would explain everything had only left me more confused i went back to an earlier issue there had been an aaron sommers on the fragment of ulrichs journals id found in fepples bag was that my clients uncle or had there been two aaron sommersesone jewish one black connie ingram had talked to fepple that was a point of certaintyeven if shed never gone to see him she had spoken to him he had entered her name in his appointment software maybe she really had gone to fepples officeunder ralphs orders i recoiled from the thought under rossys orders if i showed connie ingram a copy of ulrichs journals would she tell me whether shed seen something like this in fepples copy of the sommers file i went back to the living room lotty had left she gets more bizarre every time i see her carl complained she looked at that page where your lunatic had written in red that sofie radbuka was his mother in heaven made a melodramatic speech and took off to do what she decided to go visit the therapist rhea wiell max said frankly i think its high time someone talked to the woman that is i know youve tried to do so victoria but lottyshes in a professional position to confront her is lotty going to try to see rhea tonight i asked its a little late to pay an office visit id think her home address is unlisted dr herschel was going to go to her own clinic tim said from the corner where hed been silently watching the rest of us she said she had some kind of directory in her office that ought to provide ms wiells home address i guess she knows what shes doing i ignored carls derisive comment i must say id like to watch that confrontation the princess of austria versus the little flower my moneys on rheashe has that myopia which constitutes a perfect armor max ill let you have some privacy i know its been a long tough week even though pauls misfortune has brought you some breathing room but i wanted to ask you about the abbreviations in these books where are they i wanted you to see i was shuffling through the papers on the coffee table as i spoke lotty took them with her carl said she didnt she couldnt have theyre crucial those ledgers talk to her then carl shrugged with supreme indifference and poured himself another glass of champagne oh hell i started to get up intent on running after lotty then thought again of a pinball in motion and sat back down i still had the copies id made of the journal pages although id wanted max to study the originals he might figure something out from copies he took the pages carl leaning over his shoulder max shook his head victoria you have to remember we havent spoken or read german at all regularly since we were ten years old these cryptic entries could mean anything what about the numbers then if my young historians speculation is correct that this was some kind of jewish association would the numbers refer to anything special max hunched his shoulders theyre too big to be members of a family too small to be financial numbers and anyway the values jump around quite a bit they cant be bankaccount numbers eithermaybe theyre the numbers for safedeposit boxes oh its all a big if i slapped the papers against the table in frustration did lotty say anything else i mean besides going to her officedid she say whether these entries meant anything special to her after all the radbuka name thats the one she knows carl made a sour face oh she had one of her typical histrionic fits she doesnt seem to be any more mature than little calia screeching around the living room i frowned do you really truly not know who sofie radbuka was carl he looked at me coldly i said everything i know about it last weekend i dont need to expose myself further even if lotty did have a lover with that name which i dont believeat least not someone she left school to be with in the countrywhy would seeing the name make lotty so jumpy and tormented all these years later the inside of her mind is as opaque to me asas calias toy dog when i was a young man i thought i did understand her but she walked away from me without one word of explanation or farewell and we had been lovers for three years i turned helplessly to max did she say anything when she saw the name in the book or did she just leave max stared in front of him not looking at me she wanted to know if someone thought she needed to be punished and if so didnt they realize that selftorture was the most exquisite punishment yet devised because victim and tormentor were never separated the silence that followed was so complete we could hear the waves breaking on lake michigan from the far side of the park i gathered my papers together carefully as though they were eggs which would crack at a false touch and stood up to go max followed me out to my car victoria lotty is behaving in a way that i cant fathom ive never seen her like this except maybe right after the war but then we were allwell the losses we experiencedfor her as for me for carl for my beloved teresz we were all devastated so i didnt notice lotty as particularly so for all of us those losses are a wound that always hurts in bad weather so to speak i can imagine that i said yes but thats not what im trying to tell you in lottys case in all these years she has never discussed them shes always kept herself energetically focused on the task at hand not just nowadays when all our lives keep us busy with the present and a more recent past but never he smacked my car roof bewildered astonished at her reticence the flat hard sound contrasted unpleasantly with his low voice right after the war there was a sort of shock and even for some people a sense of shame about those many many dead peopleat least jewish peopledidnt talk about it in a public way we werent going to be victims hanging around the table for crumbs of pity among the survivors of the dead oh we mourned in private but not lotty she was frozen i think its what made her so ill that year that she left carl when she came back from the country the next winter she had this patina of briskness that has never left her until now until this person paul whoever he is appeared victoria after i lost teresz i never thought i would be in love again and i never imagined with lotty she and carl had been a couple a passionate couple also my own mind was in the pasti kept thinking of her as carls girl despite their long estrangement but we did come together in that way as i know youve seen our love of music her passion my calmwe seemed to balance each other but now he couldnt figure out how to end the sentence finally he said if she doesnt return soonreturn emotionally i meanwell lose each other forever i cant cope right now with more losses from the friends of my youth he didnt wait for me to say anything but turned on his heel and went back into the house i drove soberly back to the city sofie radbuka probably i couldnt have saved her life lotty had said to me was this a cousin who had died in the gas chambers a cousin whose place on the train to london lotty had taken i could imagine the guilt that would torment you if that had happened i survived at her expense her parting remark to max and carl about selftorture i was following the winding road past calvary cemetery whose mausoleums separate evanston from chicago when don strzepek called vicwhere are you among the dead i said bleakly whats up vic you need to get down here your friend dr herschel is carrying on in a really outrageous way wheres here what do you mean wheresoh im calling from rheas house she just left to go to the hospital did dr herschel beat her up i tried not to sound too eager christ vic this is really serious dont joke around pay attention did you know that paul radbuka was shot today rhea got the word partway through the afternoon shes been terribly upset for dr was he killed i put in he was fucking lucky home invaders shot him in the heart but what the surgeon told rhea was they used a lowenoughcaliber gun that the bullet lodged in the heart without killing him i dont understand it myself but apparently it does happen amazingly enough he should make a complete recovery anyway dr herschel somehow got hold of some papers of pauls he stopped as the connection hit him do you know about these his fathers ledgers yes i was just looking at them up at max loewenthals i knew dr herschel took them with her how did loewenthal get them i pulled into a bus stop on sheridan road so i could concentrate on the conversation maybe paul brought them up to him so that max would understand why they were related i heard him light a cigarette the quick sucking in of smoke according to rhea paul kept them under lock and key not that shes been to his house mind you but he described his safe place to her he brought his books in to show her but he wouldnt let rhea whom he totally trusts keep them overnight i doubt he would have lent them to loewenthal a sheridan road bus pulled up next to me an exiting passenger angrily pounded the hood of my car why dont you give me the details if you have them where did this happen did some beth israel patient get fed up at the posner demonstrations and open fire no it was in his home hes pretty muzzy now with anesthetic but what hes said to the cops and to rhea is that a woman came to the door wanting to talk to him about his father foster father i interrupted him don does he know who shot him can he describe her is he sure its a woman he paused uncomfortably as a matter of fact heuh well hes a little confused on that point the anesthetic is making him a little hallucinatory and he says it was someone named ilse wölfin the shewolf of the ss thats immaterial what matters is that dr herschel called rhea and told her they needed to talk that paul was dangerously unstable if he believed these papers proved he was radbuka and where did he get the idea that sofie radbuka was his mother of course rhea refused to see her so dr herschel announced she was going to compassionate heart of mary to talk to paul in person can you believe it his voice went up half an octave in outrage guy is lucky to be alive just out of surgery hell shes a surgeon she should know better rheas gone over there to stop her but youre an old friend shell listen to you go stop her warshawski i find this request pretty ironic don ive been begging rhea for a week to use her influence with paul hoffman as i guess his name really is and shes been stiffing me as if i were a plague carrier why should i help her now be your age vic this isnt a playground if you dont want to keep dr herschel from looking like a fool you should stop her from seriously hurting paul a cop flashed his spotlight on me i put the mustang in gear and turned the corner past a giordanos pizza parlor where a bunch of teenagers were smoking and drinking beer a woman with shortcropped dark hair walked past with a yorkie who lunged fiercely at the beerdrinkers i watched them cross sheridan road before i spoke again ill meet you at the hospital what i say to lotty depends on what shes doing when we get there but youre going to love ulrich hoffmans journals they really are in code and if rhea broke it shes wasted on the world of therapyshe ought to be in the cia xliii bedside manners compassionate heart of mary was perched on the fringe of lincoln park where parking spaces are so scarce ive seen people get into fistfights over them for the privilege of sitting in on lotty and rheas encounter i had to pay the hospital garage fifteen dollars i got to the lobby at the same time as don strzepek he was still miffed at me over my parting crack at the reception desk they said it was past visiting hours but when i identified myself as pauls sisterjust arrived from kansas citythey told me i could go up to the fifth floor to the postop ward don glared at me bit back a hot denial and said he was my husband very good i applauded as we got on the elevator she believed it because were clearly having a little marital tiff he gave a reluctant smile how morrell puts up with youtell me about hoffmans journals i pulled one of the photocopies from my case he peered at it while we walked down the hall to pauls room the door was shut a nurse in the hallway said a doctor had just gone in to look at him but as i was his sister she guessed it was all right if we joined them when we pushed open the door we heard rhea paul you dont need to talk to dr herschel if you dont feel like it you need to stay calm and work on healing yourself there will be plenty of time to talk later she had placed herself protectively between his bed and the door but lotty had gone around to his right side threading her way through all the different plastic bags hanging over him despite his greying curls paul looked like a child his small frame barely showing under the covers his rosy cheeks were pale but he was smiling faintly pleased to see rhea when don went to stand next to her his smile faded don noticed it too and moved slightly apart paul im dr herschel lotty said her fingers on his pulse i knew the radbuka family many years ago in vienna and in london i trained as a doctor in london and i worked for a time for anna freud whose work you so greatly admire he turned his hazel eyes from rhea to lotty a tinge of color coming into his face whatever agitation shed displayed to carl and max lotty was perfectly calm now i dont want you to get excited in any way so if your pulse starts to go too fast were going to stop talking at once do you understand that you should stop talking right now rhea said not able to keep anger from disturbing her vestal tranquillity don seeing pauls attention on lotty took rheas hand in a reassuring clasp no paul whispered she knows my english savior she knows my true family shell make my cousin max remember me i promise you i wont get agitated i have ulrichs journals lotty said i will keep them safe for you until you are able to look after them again but im wondering if you can answer a question for me about them you wrote a note in them next to s radbukas name that sofie radbuka was your mother im wondering how you know that i remembered it he said i moved next to lotty and matched my tone to hers when you took ulrichs journals to rhea she helped you remember that radbuka was your real name didnt she paul there was a long list of namesczestvo vostok radbuka and many others when she hypnotized you you remembered that radbuka was your real name that must have been a very wonderful but very frightening moment across the bed from us don gasped and moved involuntarily away from rhea who said to him it wasnt like that this is why this conversation must stop now paul intent on my question didnt hear her yes yes it was i could seeall the dead all the people einsatzgruppenführer hoffman had murdered falling into the lime pit screaming lotty interrupted him you have to stay calm paul dont dwell on those painful memories right now you remembered that past and then out of all that list of names you choseyou rememberedradbuka across the bed rhea looked murderous she tried again to halt the interview but pauls attention was focused on lotty not her i knew because id been in england as a small boy it had to be had to be lotty asked he was very sensitive to peoples emotions when he heard the unexpected harshness in her voice he flinched and looked away before he could get too upset i changed the subject what led you to know ulrich was an einsatzgruppenführer he listed the dead in each family or shtetl that he was responsible for murdering he whispered ulrich always bragged about the dead the way he bragged about torturing me i survived all that killing my mother threw me into the woods when she saw them starting to push people with their bayonets into the lime pit some person took me to terezin but of course i didnt know then that was where we were going ulrich must have known one person got away from him he found me in england brought me here to torture me over and over for the crime of surviving you were very brave i said you stood up to him you survived hes dead did you know about those books of his before he died they were locked up in his desk living room he beat me when i looked in those drawers when i was small when he died i took and kept in my special place and someone came today to get those books ilse he said ilse wölfin i knew she came to the door first she was friendly learned from mengele friends first then torture she said she was from vienna said ulrich took these books to america shouldnt have after the war i didnt understand at first then i tried to get to my secret place hide from her pulled out her gun first what did she look like i asked ignoring an impatient aside from lotty to stop fierce big hat sunglasses horrible smile when he was selling insurance here in chicago did ulrich talk to you about these books i asked trying to figure out a way to ask if hed been at the midway agency lately wondering if hed been stalking howard fepple the dead give us life ulrich used to say remember that you will be rich he wanted me be doctor wanted me make money from the dead i didnt want to live among dead i didnt want to stay in closet tortured me called me sissy queer always in german always in language of slavery tears started to seep down his face his breath began coming in labored spurts lotty said you need to rest you need to sleep we want you to recover im going to leave you now but before i go who did you talk to in england what helped you remember your name was radbuka his eyes were shut his face drawn and grey his tally of the dead hed killed himself bragged in his books listed their names searched each name on the internet found one in england sofie radbuka how i knew which name mine and that i was sent to anna freud in england after the war had to be lotty kept her hand on his pulse while he fell asleep the rest of us watched dumbly while lotty checked the iv drips coming into his arms when she left the room rhea and i followed hot spots of color burned in rheas face she tried to confront lotty in the hall but lotty swept past her to the nurses station where she asked for the charge nurse she began an interrogation about the drugs paul was getting don had come out of pauls room more slowly than the rest of us he started a lowvoiced conversation with rhea his face troubled lotty finished with the charge nurse and sailed on down the hall to the elevator i ran after her but she looked at me sternly you should have saved your questions victoria there were specific things i was trying to learn but your questions sidetracked him and finally got him too upset i wanted to know how he latched on to anna freud as his savior for instance i got in the elevator with her lotty enough of this crap isnt pushing carl into the void enough do you want to drive max and me away from you as well you got angry the first time paul mentioned england i was trying to keep you from losing him and alsowe know what those journals meant to paul hoffman id like to know what they meant to ulrich where are they by the way i need them for right now youll have to do without them lotty i cant do without them i need to find out what they mean to people who dont see the dead in them someone shot paul for them it may be that this fierce woman in sunglasses killed an insurance agent named howard fepple for them his mothers house was broken into on tuesday someone searched it probably for these notebooks amy blount i suddenly thought her place had been burgled on tuesday also surely it was too big a coincidence to think it wasnt connected to these hoffman journals she had seen the ajax archives what if the fierce woman in sunglasses thought ulrich hoffmans books had landed in the archives and thought perhaps amy blount hadnt been able to resist them which meantit was someone who knew amy blount had been in those archives it all came back to the folks at ajax ralph rossy and durham on the sideline anyway i added aloud as the elevator doors opened onto the lobby if they mean that much to someone youre risking a lot by holding on to them that is definitely my lookout not yours victoria ill return them to you in a day or so theres something i need to look for in them first she turned on her heel and stalked away from me following a hallway signposted to the doctors parking area don and rhea appeared from another elevator don saying dont you see sweetheart this lays you open to the kind of criticism people like praeger make that you lead people to these memories he knew he had been in england after the war she said that isnt something i thought of or led him to and those memories of the lime pitsdon if youd been thereive listened to many bonechilling memories from my patients but ive never wept before id always kept my professional detachment but to see your own mother thrown alive into a pit shed been forced at gunpoint to fill with lime to hear those screamsand then to know that the man responsible for your own mothers death had such power over you locking you into a small closet beating you taunting youit was utterly shattering i can see that i said breaking into this private conversation but there are so many curious leaps in his story even if ulrich somehow knew this one small boy escaped the lime pit how did he keep track of him all through the vicissitudes of war first in terezin and then to england if ulrich really was an einsatzgruppenführer hed have had plenty of chances to kill the kid during the war but on ulrichs landing papers it says they docked in baltimore from a dutch merchant ship which sailed from antwerp that doesnt mean he didnt start from england rhea said as for your other point a man with a guilty conscience might do anything ulrich is dead we cant ask him why he was so obsessed by this small boy but we know he thought having a jewish child would help him get past immigration problems in america so if he knew where paul was it was natural for him to take him pretending to be his father ulrich had an official denazification certificate i objected nor was there any mention of pauls jewishness in the landing documents ulrich probably destroyed those once he was here and felt safe from prosecution rhea said i sighed you have a pat answer for everything but paul has a shrine to the holocaust its filled with books and articles on survivor experiences if hes immersed himself in these he could be confusing other peoples histories with his own past after all he says he was only twelve months old when he was sent to terezin would he really know what hed been seeing if in fact he had witnessed his mother and the rest of his town being murdered in the way he describes you know nothing about psychology or about survivors of torture rhea said why dont you stick to the things you know about whatever those might be i do understand vics point rhea don said we need to talk seriously about your book unless theres something specific in these journals of ulrichs saying this boy i brought with me is not my son hes someone named radbukawell i need to examine them in detail don i thought you were on my side rhea said her myopic eyes filling with tears i am rhea thats why i dont want you to expose yourself by publishing a book that has holes someone like arnold praeger and the planted memory folks can find so easily vic i know youre guarding the originals like the national vault but would you let me examine them i could do so in your office under your eye i made a face lottys walked off with them which makes me angry but also worriedif paul was shot by someone looking for them theyre about as safe to lug around as naked plutonium shes promised to return them by the weekend i did copy about a dozen pages and you can look at those buti understand the problem well thats just dandy don said exasperated how did you get hold of all this material to begin with how do you know about pauls shrine you were in his house werent you i nodded reluctantlythe situation was past the point where i could keep my presence on the scene a secret i found him right after hed been shot and got the ambulance to him the place had been ransacked but he had a closet hidden behind the drapes in his holocaust shrine his assailant didnt think to look there it was a truly dreadful place i described it again the wall of photographs the telltale balloon comments coming out of ulrichs mouth those things you say he took from your office rhea they were there draped around pictures of you id like to see it don said maybe theres some other crucial piece of evidence you overlooked you could go in and welcome i said once is enough for me neither of you has a right to violate pauls privacy by going into his house rhea said coldly all patients idealize their therapists to some extent ulrich was such a monstrous father that paul juxtaposes me against him as an idealized form of the mother he never knew as for your going into the house vicyou called me this morning wanting his address why do that if you knew where he lived if hed been shot how did you get inside are you sure you werent the woman down there shooting him because of your rage over his wanting to prove a close relationship with your friends i didnt shoot the little goober even though he was acting like a great pain in the neck i said softly my eyes hot but i do have a sample of his blood now on my clothes i can send it out for a dna profile that will prove once and for all whether hes related to maxor carl or lotty she stared at me in dismay i pushed brusquely past her before she or don could speak xliv the lady vanishes i wondered if paul was safe in his hospital room if ilse the shewolf learned he had survived her shot would she come back to finish the job i couldnt ask for a police posting without explaining about ulrichs journals and my mind boggled at the task of trying to make the cops understand that story especially when i didnt fully understand it myself i finally compromised by going back to the fifth floor to tell the charge nurse that my brother was scared of his attacker coming back to kill him we worry about paul i said i dont know if youve noticed but he lives in a world of his own he thinks the nazis are after him did dr herschel tell you when she was talking to you that it would be best if no one goes in to see him unless i or his doctor or the therapist rhea wiell is here as well hell get so agitated that he could get into serious respiratory difficulties right now she told me to write up something for the nursing station she let me use her computer in the back room then taped my message up at the station and said she would make sure the central switchboard routed any calls or visitors to them before going home i went to my own office to send morrell an email recounting the events of the day so far no one has beaten me up and left me to die on the kennedy i wrote but ive been having a strenuous time i finished with an account of the conversation in pauls hospital room youve done so much work with torture victimscould this be a dissociative protection identifying with victims of the holocaust the whole situation is really spooky i ended with the messages of love and longing one sends to distant lovers what had sustained lotty over the years against such feelings had her sense of torment made her think she deserved loneliness and longing when i got home i sat on the back porch with mr contreras and the dogs for a long time not talking much just drawing comfort from their presence in the morning i decided it was time to visit ajax insurance again i phoned ralph from my own office and talked to his secretary denise as usual his calendar was full once again i pleaded my case forcefully but with charm and goodwill once again denise arranged to fit me in twenty minutes from now if i could get to ajax by ninethirty i grabbed my briefcase with the photocopies from ulrichs journals and ran down to the corner of north for a cab when i reached ralphs office denise told me he would be back from the chairmans office in two minutes she settled me in his conference room with a cup of coffee but ralph came in almost immediately pressing his fingers along the corners of his eyes he looked too tired for this early in the day hi vic we have a big exposure in the carolina flood zone i can give you five minutes and then i have to move on i laid my photocopies on his conference table these are from the journals of ulrichrickhoffman the agent who sold aaron sommers his lifeinsurance policy all those years ago ulrich kept what seems to be a list of names and addresses followed by a set of cryptic initials and check marks do they mean anything to you ralph bent over the papers this handwriting is just about impossible to read is there any way to get it clearer blowing up the image seems to help unfortunately i dont have the originals to work with right now but i can read some of thisive been looking at it a couple of days denise he shouted to his secretary can you come here a minute denise obediently trotted in not showing any annoyance at the peremptory summons and took a couple of sheets to her copier she came back with various sizes of blowups ralph looked at them and shook his head guy was really cryptic ive seen a lot of agency files anddenise he shouted again call that gal in claims handling connie ingram get her up here will you in his normal tone he added to me i just remembered what was odd about that file that disputedclaim file conniell know the answer he turned to the page showing the names and addresses omschutz gersteinare these names whats notvoy nestroy not notvoy a woman i know says its a street in vienna austria you mean we had an agent on the south side selling insurance in vienna austria its possible he started his insurance career there before the war i dont know i was hoping youd look at these and be able to tell whether they were insurancerelated or not a definite no would be almost as helpful as a definite yes ralph shook his head rubbing his forehead again i cant tell you if it is insurance these numbers the w and the w they could refer to a weekly paymentalthough hell i dont know the german for week maybe it doesnt start with w also what was the currency do these amounts make sense for payment figures and these others if this is insurance they could be policy numbers although they dont look like ones that im familiar with he held it out to me can you read them whats the initial letter this thing that looks like a bee attacking a flower and then a string of numbers and thenis that a q or an o and then theres an l hell vici dont have time for this kind of puzzle it might be insurance but i cant tell i guess i could ask rossyhe might know if its a european system but if it dates to before the warwell theyve changed all their systems since the war hes a young guy wasnt even born until he probably wouldnt know i know it seems like its just a puzzle i responded but i think that insurance agent fepple was killed because of it yesterday someone who was probably looking for these papers shot rick hoffmans son denise came to the conference room door to let ralph know connie ingram had arrived connie come on in you doing okay no more interviews with the police i hope look connie that claim file thats been causing everyone such a headacheaaron sommers there werent any personal notes from the agent in it something about it bugged me when i picked it up from mr rossy and looking at these i remembered thats what was missing he turned to me to explain see vic the agent would work up a sheet numbers whatever hed have a letter or some notes or something that would end up in the filewe rely on their private assessment especially in life insurance guy can have a doctor in his hip pocket to clear him on a physical but the agent sees him sees he lives like me on french fries and coffee and tells the company the prospect either isnt a good risk or needs to be rated higher or whatever anyway there wasnt anything in the sommers file so connie whats the storydid you ever see any agent report in that file when you looked at it he might have had handwriting like this ralph handed one of the sheets to connie her eyes widened and she put a hand over her mouth what is it connie i asked nothing she said quickly this writing is so queer i dont know how anyone could read it ralph said but did you ever see any notes from the agentwhat was his name ulrich hoffmaneither written or typed you didnt youre sure what happens when we pay a claimdo we deepsix all the background paper i find that hard to believeinsurance thrives on paper denise stuck her head through the doorway your london call mr devereux ill take it in my office over his shoulder as he left the conference room he said lloyds about these flood losses leave the copies thereill show em to rossy connie think carefully about what you saw in the file i collected my set of copies and handed denise the blowups shed made connie scuttled out the door while i was thanking denise for her help i didnt see connie when i got to the elevator either shed found a car waiting for her or she was hiding in the womens bathroom in case it was the latter i moved away from the elevators to admire the view of the lake the executivefloor attendant asked if she could help me i said i was just collecting my thoughts after another five minutes connie ingram appeared looking around like a scared rabbit i was tempted to jump out and yell boo but i waited near the window until the elevator light dinged then trotted over to get into the car with her as the doors closed she looked at me resentfully as she pushed the button for thirtynine i dont have to talk to you the lawyer said so he said to call him if you came around my ears filled as the elevator fell you can do it as soon as you get off did he also tell you not to talk to mr devereux are you going to figure out an answer about whether you saw any agency notes in the file in case he forgets that he askedi know hes got a lot on his mindill be calling regularly to remind him the door opened at thirtynine she shot out without responding to my genial farewell i took the l back to my office where i found an email from morrell i realized that even i who thought i was a sophisticated traveler had my expectations of the setting shaped by rudyard kipling i wasnt prepared for the starkness the grandeuror most especially the way one feels obliterated by the mountains you find yourself wanting to make defiant gestures im here im alive acknowledge me as far as your question about paul hoffman or radbuka of course i am not an expert but i do think someone who has been tortured as he apparently was tortured by his father could become very fragile emotionally it would be painful to think your own father tortured youyou would imagine there must be something terribly wrong with you that provoked such behaviorchildren inevitably blame themselves in difficult situations but if you could believe you were persecuted because of your historic identityyou were a jew you were from eastern europe you survived the death campsthen it would both glamorize your torture give it a deeper meaning and protect you from the pain of believing you were a terrible child whose father was justified in assaulting you thats how i see it at any rate my beloved pepperpot i already miss you more than i can say its horribly unsettling to have half the population missing from the landscape i miss not just your facei miss seeing womens faces i printed out the section that dealt with paul and faxed it to don strzepek at morrells home machine with a scrawl for what its worth i wondered how don had left things with rhea last night would he go ahead with his book on recovered memories with her or would he wait to see if max and lotty wanted to do a dna match that was a mighty thin thread paul hoffman had hung his identity on searching the web for the names in those insurance records of ulrichs until he found a query about one of them hed used that thread to attach himself to england immediately after the war thinking about it reminded me of the picture of anna freud that paul had hung in his closet his savior in england i called up maxs house and spoke with michael loewenthalagnes had been able to reschedule her appointment at the gallery so he was minding calia he went to the living room for me and came back with the name of the biography lotty had brought down from maxs study last night were coming into chicago for a last look at the walruses in the zoo ill drop it off at your office no with pleasure vicwe owe you a lot for your care of our petite monster but i confess to an ulterior motive calia is being a brat about the dogs collar we could pick it up i groanedid left the wretched thing in my kitchen i told michael if i didnt get up to evanston with it tonight id mail it to calia in london sorry vicno need for that much trouble ill stop by in about an hour with the book by the way have you spoken to lotty mrs coltrain called from the clinic concerned because lotty had canceled all her appointments for today i told him our parting last night had been rocky enough that i hadnt felt like calling her but when michael hung up i dialed lottys home number it rang through to her crisp voice on the machine giving various numbers to use if this was a medical emergency and urging friends to leave their messages after the tone i thought uneasily of a lunatic going around town shooting people to get at hoffmans journals but surely the doorman wouldnt let anyone in who didnt belong there i called mrs coltrain who was at first relieved to hear from me but became agitated when she found out i didnt know anything about lottys situation when shes really ill she does cancel her appointments of course but she always talks to me about it did someone else call you worry made my voice sharp no its justshe left a message on the office answering machine i couldnt believe it when i got in so i took it on myself to call her at home and then to ask mr loewenthal if shed said anything to anyone at the hospital no one there has heard anything not even dr barberyou know they cover for each other in emergencies one of dr herschels teaching fellows is coming in at noon to look after any acute problems that come up in here butif she isnt ill where is she if max didnt know nobody did i told mrs coltrain id check in at lottys apartmentneither of us saying it both of us picturing lotty lying unconscious on the floor i found lottys building management in the phone book and got through to the doorman who hadnt seen dr herschel today does someone in the building have keys could i get in to see if shes all right he consulted a list lotty had left max and my names as people to call in any emergency he guessed the super could let me in if i didnt have keys when was i coming in twenty minutes hed get gerry up from the basement where he was supervising a boilerrepair crew mary louise called as i was leaving she was on the south side with gertrude sommersyes the clients auntwho wanted to tell me something in person id forgotten about sending mary louise down to check on the clients dubious cousinid left the note for her yesterday afternoon but so much was going on it seemed like a month ago i tried not to sigh audibly i was tired and tired of running from one end of chicago to the other i told mary louise that unless some crisis developed at lottys place id be at gertrude sommerss apartment in about ninety minutes xlv heard on the street the doorman at lottys building had seen me a number of times but he and gerry the building super still insisted on proof of my identity before gerry took me up to the eighteenth floor the precaution which would normally have made me impatient gave me some reassurance about lottys safety when we got to her apartment gerry rang the bell several times before undoing her locks he went with me through the rooms but there was no sign of lotty and no sign that any violent struggle had taken place while gerry watched in mounting disapproval i looked through the drawers in the side room that lotty uses as a home office and then in lottys bedroom for ulrichs journals gerry followed me from room to room while i imagined the places that people conceal thingsbehind clothes under rugs and mattresses inside kitchen cabinets behind pictures on the wall slipped in among the books on her own shelves you dont have a right to be doing that miss he said when i was poking through lottys underwear drawer you married gerry kids you know if your wife or one of your daughters was having a dangerous pregnancy who everyone would tell you she should see dr herschel who takes her duties so seriously she never even calls in sick unless shes running a fever that she thinks would affect her judgment now shes suddenly vanished im hoping for any sign that would tell me whether she left voluntarily or not whether she packed a bag anything he wasnt sure he believed me but he didnt make further efforts to stop me of ulrichs journals there wasnt a sign so she must have taken them with her she had left under her own steam she must have is her car in the garage i asked he called down to the doorman on his walkietalkie jason said hed go out to look thats how an intruder could infiltrate wait until the doorman goes to the garage then follow another tenant inside when we got downstairs jason was back at his station dr herschels car was herehe once again abandoned his station to take me out to look it was locked and i didnt want to show off my parlor tricks by opening it in front of him so i peered through the tinted windshield unlike me lotty doesnt leave her car strewn with papers old towels and stinking tshirts there wasnt anything on the seats i gave each of them my card and asked jason to question people as they came home about whether anyone had seen her leave that way we can keep it casual i said when he started to object otherwise ill have to bring the police in which im very reluctant to do the two men exchanged glances the building management would be annoyed if the cops came around to question the tenants they pocketed their tens with suitable dignity and agreed not to let anyone up to dr herschels apartment unless max or i was here and you do keep an eye on the lobby even when youre running another errand i persisted we dont leave the lobby unattended maam jason was annoyed i can always see it on the tv monitor in the garage and when i go on break gerry stays here to cover for me i knew it wasnt a foolproof system but id lose their cooperation if i criticized it any further i sat in the mustang for a bit massaging the back of my neck what had happened to her that lotty had a life of which i knew nothing had become abundantly clear in the last ten days just because shed hugged her secrets to herself did that mean i had to respect this secrecy but conversely did my friendship my love my concern any of those give me the right to invade a privacy shed gone to such lengths to protect i thought it over probably not as long as those damned books of ulrichs werent going to put her at risk but they might if only i could find someone who could interpret them for me maybe they would mean something to bertrand rossy i slowly put the car into gear and made the difficult drive to the south side every week it gets harder to cross the heart of chicago too many people like me sitting one to a car at the entrance to the expressway at north avenue i stopped for gas price was still going up i know we pay less than half what they do in europe but when youre used to cheap fuel a thirtydollar fillup is a jolt i crawled down the ryan to eightyseventh the exit nearest gertrude sommerss at her building nothing seemed to have changed from two weeks ago from the derelict chevy out front to the despairing wail of the baby within mrs sommers herself was still rigidly erect in a dark heavily ironed dress her expression as forbidding as before i told that other girl she might as well go she said when i asked if mary louise was still there i dont like to talk to the police about my family even though she says shes private not with the police anymore she looks and talks like police she gave the word a heavy firstsyllable stress i made an effort to put lotty out of my mind to concentrate on what gertrude sommers had decided to tell me she waved me to a chair at the pressedwood table along the far wall then seated herself with the sighing sound of stiff fabric against stocking her back was rigidly upright her hands folded in her lap her expression so forbidding that it was hard for me to meet her gaze at bible study on wednesday night the reverend spoke to me about my nephew not my nephew isaiah the other one colby do you think if his father had named him for a prophet like mr sommerss other brother named isaiah colby would be an upright man as well or would other temptations have always proved too strong for him whether this was a rhetorical question or not i knew better than to try to answer she was going to need time to come to the point i would have to let her get there on her own i slipped a hand into my pocket to turn off my cell phone i didnt want its ringing to interrupt her ive been worried about isaiah since mr sommers passed he found money for the funeral out of his own pocket he took it on himself to hire you with money out of his own pocket to find out what happened to mr sommerss lifeinsurance money now for acting like that good samaritan the police are hounding him with that wife of his gnawing on him from behind thats a good job he has at the engineering works a fine job shes lucky to have a man whos a hardworking churchgoer like mr sommers was before him but shes like a baby wanting what she cant have she looked at me sternly in my heart ive been blaming you for isaiahs troubles even though isaiah kept saying you were trying to end them not foment them so when the reverend spoke to me about my nephew colby i didnt want to hear but the reverend reminded me ears they have and hear not eyes they have and see not so i knew the time had come for me to listen umhmm she nodded as if she were lecturing herself in that little grunt so i listened to the reverend telling me that colby was flashing money around the neighborhood and i thought what are you trying to tell methat colby has my husbands insurance money but the reverend said nothing like that colby got paid for helping do a job a job i said if my nephew colby is getting money for working then im on my knees to praise jesus but the reverend told me not that kind of job the reverend said hes been hanging out with some of those empower youth men and i said the alderman does a lot of good in this neighborhood i wont believe any ill of him and the reverend said i hear you sister sommers and i dont believe ill of him either i know what he did for your son when he was a boy what he did for you and mr sommers when your boy was afflicted with the scourge of muscular dystrophy but a man doesnt always know what the left hand of his left hand is doing and some of the aldermans left hands are finding their way into peoples pocketbooks and cash registers she gave another little grunt unhnnh her lips folded over in bitterness at having to repeat ill of her family to me a stranger a white woman so the reverend says ive been hearing that your nephew colby got paid good money to make a telephone call to the police to tell them his cousin isaiah had been in the office of that insurance agent who defrauded you of your husbands money and then got murdered and if ever cain hated abel for being righteous in the eyes of the lord your nephew colby has always hated his cousin isaiah with that same hatred i hear the reverend said i hear he gladly made that phone call and i hear that when these same left hands of the aldermans left hand wanted a gun that colby knew where to find it and when they went breaking into an apartment in hyde park with a blowtorch colby was glad to stand lookout for them i wont go to the police against my own family i told the reverend but its not right for isaiah to lie in jail as he will if the worst comes about from these police questions because of the hatred of his cousin so when the other girl came around this morning wanting to ask me about colbybecause someone had been telling her stories about him as welli remembered you and i saw the time had come to talk to you the news was so startling that i hardly knew what to say alderman durhams eye team deployed to kill howard fepple that hardly seemed possible in fact i didnt think it could be possible because the guard at the hyde park bank would have noticed themyou wouldnt mistake durham s eye troops for expectant parents going up to a lamaze class but it must have been some eye hangerson who broke into amy blounts apartment i pressed my palms against my eyes as if that would bring any clarity to my vision finally i decided to tell gertrude sommers a good deal of the events of the last week and a half including the old journals that ulrich hoffman entered his payments in i dont understand any of this i finished but i will have to talk to alderman durham and theni may have to talk to the police as well one man is dead another critically wounded i dont understand what possible connection there is here between these old books of hoffmans and the alderman i halted except that rossy had singled out durham on the street on tuesday he was just back from springfield where theyd killed the holocaust asset recovery act where ajax had thrown its weight behind durham s slavereparations rider and the demonstrations had stopped rossy was from a european insurance company carl had thought ulrichs records looked similar to the ones a european insurance agent had kept on his father many years ago was that what connected rossy to the midway insurance agency i picked up my briefcase and pulled out the photocopies of ulrichs journal mrs sommers watched me affronted at first by my inattention then interested in the papers what is that it looks like mr hoffmans handwriting is this his record of mr sommerss insurance no but im wondering if its a record of someone elses insurance that he sold in europe sixtyfive years ago look at this but it isnt an e its an n so it cant be an edelweiss policy number or it is but they have their own company code i suppose you know what youre talking about young lady but it doesnt mean a thing to me not one thing i shook my head these numbers dont mean anything to me but other things are starting to make a horrible kind of sense except for what her husbands insurance policy had to do with all this i would give a months pay and put icing on it if i could see what howard fepple had found when he looked at aaron sommerss file but if ulrich had sold insurance for edelweiss before the war if hed been one of those men coming into the ghetto on his bicycle on friday afternoons as carl had been describing last nightbut edelweiss had been a small regional carrier before the war so they said so they said in one hundred fifty years of life i got up abruptly i will get your nephew isaiah cleared of all charges against him one way or another although exactly how ill do that i have to say i honestly dont know right this minute as for your nephew colbyim not a fan of housebreaking or people supplying others with guns for crimes however i have a feeling that colbys in more danger from his accomplices than he is from the law i have to go now if my suspicions are correct the heart of this mystery is downtown or maybe in zurich not here xlvi ancient history in my car i turned my phone back on and called amy blount i have a different question for you today the section of your ajax history where you talked about edelweisswhere did you get that material the company gave it to me i made a uturn one hand on the wheel one on the phone i braked to avoid a cat that suddenly streaked across the road a little girl followed screaming its name the car fishtailed i dropped the phone and pulled over to the curb my heart pounding i had been lucky not to hit the girl sorryim demented right now trying to do too many things at once and driving stupidly i said when id recovered enough to reestablish the connection were these archival records financials anything like that a summary of financials all they wanted on edelweiss was that little bit at the end the book is really about ajax so i didnt see the need to look at edelweiss archives she was defensive what was in the summary highlevel numbers assets and reserves principal offices yearbyyear though i dont remember the details i suppose i could ask the ajax librarian a couple of men came out of a derelict courtyard they looked at the mustang and then at me and gave a thumbsup gesture for both of us i smiled and waved i need a way to find out if they had an office in vienna before the war edelweisss numbers didnt matter come to think of it maybe they really had been a small regional player in the thirties but they could still have been selling insurance to people who were obliterated in the wars blistering furnaces the illinois insurance institute has a library which might have something that would help you amy blount suggested i used it when i was doing research for the ajax book they have a strange hodgepodge of old insurance documents theyre in the insurance exchange building you know on west jackson i thanked her and hung up my phone rang as i was negotiating the merge onto the ryan at eightyseventh but nearly hitting that child a few minutes ago made me keep my attention on the road although i couldnt stop speculating about edelweiss they bought ajax a coup acquiring america s fourthlargest propertycasualty insurer at firesale prices and then found themselves facing legislation demanding recovery of holocaustera assets including lifeinsurance policies their investment could have turned from gold mine to bankruptcy court if they had a huge arrears of unpaid lifeinsurance claims all coming due at once swiss banks were fighting tooth and claw to keep heirs of holocaust victims from claiming assets deposited in the frantic years before the war european insurers were stonewalling just as hard it must be relatively rare for children to know their parents had insurance even if others like carl had been sent downstairs with money to pay the agent i was betting he was unusual in knowing what company held his fathers policy when my father died it was only on going through his papers that i found his life insurance when not only your family but your house maybe even your entire town has been obliteratedyoud have no records to turn to and if you did the company would treat you the way it had carl denying the claim because you couldnt present a death certificate they really were a prize group of bastards those banks and insurers my phone rang again but i picked it up only to switch it off if those books of hoffmans contained a list of lifeinsurance policies bought by people like carls father or maxs people who died in treblinka or auschwitz it wasnt such a large list that edelweiss would lose much from paying the claims all it would do is give several hundred people the knowledge that their parents or grandparents had bought policies and give them the policy numbers it wasnt as if thered be a stampede on edelweiss assets unless of course states began passing holocaust asset recovery acts such as the one ajax torpedoed last week the company would have had to make an audited search of its policy filesof all the hundred or so companies that made up the ajax group now including edelweissand prove that it wasnt sitting on policies belonging to the dead of the war in europe that might have cost them a bundle would fepple have grasped this possibility could he have found enough information in aaron sommerss file to use it in an attempt at blackmail hed been excited at a way to make money if this was it was it a big enough reason for someone at ajax to kill him and who would have been the triggerman ralph the jolly bertrand his softassteel wife i accelerated around a couple of tripletrailer semis impatient to start gathering any kind of information right now i was building a house from cards i needed facts good hard mortar and cement turning onto jackson boulevard heading east into the loop i drummed my fingers on the steering wheel in an agony of impatience at every stoplight just west of the river under the shadow of union station and its disreputable surrounding bars i found an empty meter i jammed in a fistful of quarters and ran the four blocks east to the insurance exchange the exchange is a tired old building near the southwest corner of the loop and the illinois insurance institute proved to be one of the tireder offices in it oldfashioned hanging lights held a couple of malfunctioning fluorescent bulbs which blinked in an irritating way on the woman who sat inside the entrance she squinted up at me from a mailing she was assembling like an owl who isnt used to seeing strangers in its neck of the forest when i explained that i was trying to find out how big edelweiss insurance had been in the s and whether theyd had an office in vienna she sighed and put down the sheaf of papers she was folding i dont know that kind of thing you can look in the library if you want but im afraid i cant take time to help you she pushed back her chair and opened the door to a murky room in the back it was stuffed beyond the firecode limit with shelves of books and papers things are kind of in chronological order she said waving an arm vaguely toward the left corner the further back you go in time the more likely they are to be in ordermost people only come here to consult current documents and its hard for me to find the time to keep them organized it would be a real help if youd leave everything in the same shape you find it if you want copies of anything you can use my machine but its a dime a page the ringing phone sent her scurrying back to the front room i went to the corner shed waved at for such a small space it held a depressing amount of materialshelves of national underwriter and insurance blue books speeches to the american insurance institute addresses to international insurance congresses hearings before the us congress to see whether ships sunk in the spanishamerican war had to be covered under marine policies i moved along as fast as i could using a set of rolling stairs to climb up and down until i found the section with documents dating to the s and s i flipped through them more speeches more congressional hearings this time on insurance benefits for world war i veterans my hands were black with dust when i suddenly found it a squat fat book whose blue cover had faded to grey le registre des bureaux des compagnies dassurance européennes printed in genève in i dont read french wellunlike spanish its not close enough to italian for me to follow a novelbut a list of european insurancecompany offices didnt demand a linguist i was almost holding my breath when i took it underneath the dim lamp in the middle of the room where i squinted painfully at the tiny print the books organization was difficult to figure out in bad light in a language i didnt know but i finally saw they had grouped offices by country and then by asset size in switzerland the biggest company in had been nesthorn followed by swiss re zurich life winterer and a bunch of others edelweiss was far down on the list but it had a footnote which was in even smaller type than the body of the report even tilting the page to see it under different light holding it so close to my nose i sneezed a half dozen times i couldnt make out the tiny print i looked toward the front room the overworked factotum was apparently still stuffing letters into envelopes it would be a shame to disturb her by asking to borrow the book i tucked it into my briefcase thanked her for her help and told her id probably be back in the morning what time do you open up usually not until ten but mr irvine hes the executive director he sometimes comes in in the morningsoh my look at your lovely jacket im sorry everything in there is so filthy but its just me i dont have time to dust all those old books thats okay i said heartily it will clean i hoped my lovely silkwool herringbone now looked as though it had been dyed grey by an inexpert hand i ran all the way back to my car and could hardly bear the traffic that slowed me on my way back to my office at my desk i used a magnifying glass to pick my way through the french footnote as best i could the acquisition recent of edelweiss ag by nesthorn ag the most big company in switzerland would appear in the year following when the edelweiss numbers would not be somethingseen available it didnt matter until that time something something company reportage would be independent a merger between nesthorn and edelweiss and now the company was called edelweiss i didnt understand that part but i went on to the listing of offices edelweiss had three one each in basel zurich and bern nesthorn had twentyseven two in vienna one in prague one in bratislava three in berlin they had an office in paris which had done a brisk business the viennese office on porzellangasse had led the pack of twentyseven in sales with a volume almost thirty percent greater than any of its closest competitors had that been ulrich hoffmans territory riding around on his bicycle entering names in his ornate script doing a landoffice business among families worried that the antijewish laws in germany would soon affect them as well those numbers in ulrichs books that started with n could be nesthorn lifeinsurance policies and after the merger with edelweissi turned to my computer and logged on to lexisnexis the results for my previous search on edelweiss were there but these were only contemporary documents i scanned them anyway they told me about the acquisition of ajax edelweisss decision to participate in a forum on european insurance companies and dormant holocaust lifeinsurance policies there were reports on thirdquarter earnings reports on their acquisition of a london merchant bank the hirs family was still the majority shareholder with eleven percent of the outstanding shares so the h on fillida rossys china was her grandfathers name the grandfather with whom she used to ski those difficult slopes in switzerland a reckless risktaker behind her soft voice and fussing over rosemary rinses for her daughters golden mane i saved this set of results and started a new search looking for old background on nesthorn and edelweiss the database didnt go back far enough for articles about the merger i let the phone ring through to my answering service as i struggled with a vocabulary and grammar too complex for my primitive ability la revue de lhistoire financière et commerciale for july had an article that seemed to be about german companies trying to establish markets in the countries they had occupied during the war le nouveau géant économique was making its neighbors nervous in one paragraph the article commented that on voudrait savoir the biggest company of insurance swiss had changed its name from nesthorn to edelweiss because there are too many persons who remember them from their histoire peu agréable their lessagreeable history would that be surely that didnt refer to selling life insurance whose claims they wouldnt pay it must have to do with something else i wondered if the other articles explained what i attached them to an email to morrell who reads french do either of these articles explain what nesthorn insurance did in the forties that made them less agreeable to their european neighbors how are you coming with getting a permit to travel to the northwest frontier i hit the send key thinking how strange it was that morrell thirteen thousand miles away could see my words at virtually the same time i sent them i leaned back in my chair eyes closed seeing fillida rossy at dinner stroking the heavy flatware with the h engraved on the handle what she owned she touched clutchedor what she touched she owned that restless smoothing of her daughters hair her sons pajama collarshe had stroked my own hand in the same disquieting way when she brought me forward to meet her guests on tuesday night could she feel so possessive of the edelweiss company that she would kill to safeguard it from claimants paul hoffmanradbuka had been so certain it was a woman who had shot him fierce sunglasses big hat could that have been fillida rossy she was certainly commanding enough behind her languid exterior i remembered bertrand rossy changing his tie after her soft comment that it was rather bold her friends too had hurried to make sure nothing in the conversation annoyed her on the other hand alderman durham kept swimming around the submerged rocks of the story my clients cousin colby who had done lookout duty for the breakin at amy blounts place and who had fingered my client to the police was on the fringes of durham s eye team the meeting between durham and rossy on tuesdayhad rossy agreed to kill the holocaust asset recovery act in exchange for durham giving him a hit woman who could shoot paul hoffmanradbuka durham was such a wily political creature it was hard to believe hed do something that would so lay him open to blackmail nor could i see a sophisticated man like rossy getting himself tangled up in a hiredmurder rap it was hard to understand why either of them would involve the other in something as crude as the breakin at amy blounts i called durham s office the aldermans secretary asked who i was what i wanted im an investigator i said mr durham and i met briefly last week im sorry to say that some of the people on the fringe of his extremely wonderful empower youth energy project have shown up as part of a murder investigation im working on before i give their names to the police i wanted to do the alderman the courtesy of letting him hear about them from me first the secretary put me on hold as i waited i thought again about the rossys maybe i could take a quick run up there to see if the maid irina would talk to me if she could give the rossys an alibi for last friday night well it would at least eliminate them from consideration as fepples murderers durham s secretary came back to the phone the alderman was in committee meetings until six hed meet me at his south side office at sixthirty before going to a community church meeting i didnt want to be alone on durham s home turf the way things were shaping up i told the secretary id be at the golden glow at sixfifteen durham could see me on my ground xlvii bourbon with a twist i skimmed through my messages both in my inbox and onscreen michael loewenthal had dropped off the biography of anna freud the day had been so long id completely forgotten that conversation i had also completely forgotten the little dog tags for ninshubur the biography was too fat for me to read clear through in a quest for paul hoffman or radbuka i looked at the photographs at anna freud sitting next to her father in a café at the hampstead nursery where lotty had washed dishes during the war i tried to imagine lotty as a teenager she would have been idealistic ardent but without the patina of irony and briskness which kept the world at arms length from her now i flipped to the back to look up radbuka in the index the name wasnt there i checked concentration camps the second reference was to a paper freud had written on a group of six children who came to england from terezin after the war six children aged three and four who had lived together as a little unit looking after one another forming a bond so tight that the adult authorities didnt think they could survive apart no names were mentioned no other history it sounded like the group hoffmanradbuka had described in his television interview last week the group where ulrich had found him wrenching him away from his little friend miriam could paul really have been part of it or had he appropriated their story to his own i went back online to see if i could find a copy of the paper freud had written about the children an experiment in group upbringing a central research library in london would fax it to me at the cost of a dime a page cheap at the price i entered a creditcard number and sent the order then looked at my phone messages the most urgent seemed to be from ralph who had called twiceto my cell phone when i was heading onto the ryan three hours ago and just now when id been trying to decipher the less agreeable part of nesthorns past he was in a meeting naturally but denise his secretary said he badly wanted to see the originals of the material i had shown him this morning i dont have them i said i saw them very briefly yesterday when i made the copies i gave him but someone else took them for safekeeping theyre quite valuable documents i gather is it bertrand rossy whod like to look at them or ralph himself i believe mr devereux showed the blowups i made to mr rossy at a meeting this morning but mr devereux did not indicate whether mr rossy was interested in them will you take this message down exactly as i give it to you tell ralph that it is really honestly true that i dont have them someone else took them i have no idea where the person who took them is nor where that person stowed them tell him this is not a joke it is not a way of stalling him i want those books as badly as he does but i dont know where they are i made denise read the message back to me i hoped it would convince rossy if it was rossy pushing on ralph for them that i truly didnt have ulrichs books i hoped i hadnt fingered lotty in the process that thought unnerved me if i hadi couldnt take time to sit and fret if i hustled i could get to the rossys before my appointment with durham i drove the two miles back to my apartment and took one of my mothers diamond drops from the safe her photograph on the dresser seemed to watch me sternly my dad had given her those earrings on their twentieth anniversary id gone with him to the tucker company on wabash when he picked them out and put down a deposit and id gone back with him when he made the final payment i wont lose it i told her photograph i hurried out of the room away from her eyes as i passed the bathroom i caught sight of my own face in the mirrored door i had forgotten the dust that id collected at the insurance institute if i was going to be presentable at the rossy building i needed a clean jacket i took a rose woolrayon weave that hung loosely concealing the bulge of my shoulder holster the herringbone i tossed into the hall closet with my bloodstained gold blouse then i remembered my idea of profiling pauls dna in case i wanted to pursue that i wrapped the gold blouse in a clean plastic bag and put it in my bedroom safe an apple from the kitchen would have to do for a late lunch i was too nervous today to sit still for a proper meal i saw ninshuburs collar on the sink and stuck it in my pocketid try to find time to get up to evanston with that tonight if i could i clattered down the stairs sketched a wave at mr contreras who stuck his head out the door when he heard me and drove across addison past wrigley field where the vendors were setting up their carts for one of the cubsmercifullyfinal games of the season from a marginally legal parking space outside their building i called to the rossy apartment fillida rossy answered the phone i hung up and leaned back in the front seat to wait i could give the project until six when id need to leave for my meeting with the alderman at fourthirty fillida rossy came through the front door with her children and their nanny who was carrying a large gym bag as she had on tuesday evening fillida was fussing endlessly with their clothes retying the girls sash smoothing the collar outside the boys monogrammed sweater when he jerked away she started wrapping the girls long hair around her hands all the time talking to the nanny she herself was dressed in jeans with a crinkly warmup jacket someone drove a black lincoln navigator to the entrance while the driver put the gym bag into the back fillida held both children tightly apparently giving some last instructions to the nanny she climbed into the front seat without acknowledging the man who held the door and put her bag into the car for her i waited while the children disappeared up the street with the nanny before crossing over to go into the building it was a different doorman on duty this afternoon than the one id met on tuesday you just missed mrs rossy no ones up there but the maid she speaks english but not too great he said when i said that id lost one of my earrings at dinner and was hoping mrs rossy had found it he added you can see if shell understand you i tried to explain over the house phone who i was and what i wanted my fathers mother spoke polish but my dad didnt so the language hadnt been part of my childhood still a few halting phrases got me upstairs where i showed irina the earring she shook her head starting to give me a long discourse in polish i had to apologize and tell her i didnt understand i all clean on next day and dont see nothing but at party i hear you speak italy i ask why if your name warshawska she gave it the polish pronunciation with the appropriate ending for a woman my mother was italian i explained my father was polish she nodded i understand children talk like mother talk in my family same in mrs fillidas family same mr rossy he speak italy english germania france but children only italy english i clucked sympathetically over the fact that no one in the household could communicate with irina mrs rossy is a good mother is she always talking to her children irina threw up her hands when she see children she always holding alwayslikelike cat or dog she mimed petting clothes oh my god they has beautiful clothes much much money i buy all for my children what she pay on one dress for marguerita children much money but not happy no has friend mister he very good man happy always polite she no she cold but she doesnt like to leave the children alone does she i doggedly tried to keep the conversation on track i mean they entertain here but does she go out and leave the children behind irina looked at me in surprise of course mrs rossy left the children she was rich she went to the gym to go shopping to see friends it was only when she was home last friday i thought i saw her at a dance at the hilton hotel you know for charity i had to repeat the sentence a couple of different ways before irina understood me she shrugged is possible was not here i not know where she and mister going i in bed early not like today when many people coming for dinner my hint to leave i tried offering her a tip for her help but she flung up her hands in disgust she was sorry about my earring she would keep looking for it as i drove up the street i passed the children returning from their walk they were punching at each other from either side of the nannyhappy families as tolstoy said so the rossys hadnt been home on friday night that didnt mean theyd been in hyde park shooting howard fepple still i could see fillida phoning him saying her name was connie ingram persuading him she was hot for him i could see her coming in with him and all the lamaze parentsperhaps her husband melting into the group as welltwining herself around fepple in his chair bertrand slips into the office whacks the back of his head she puts the sigs barrel into his mouth at the spray of blood and bone she jumps off places the gun under his chair shes cool but not cool enough to remember to get his hand on the gun so that the morgue will find gunpowder residue on it then she and bertrand search the office find the sommers file and take off yesterday fillida went to hoffmans house how had she found the address when i hadnt been able to oh of course through ulrich they knew his name they were looking for him looking for those records of edelweissnesthorn sales it must have made rossys eyes jump out of their sockets when connie ingram brought the sommers file up to ralphs office last week the agent he was looking for ulrich hoffman right under his nose in chicago maybe it took them a while to figure it out but eventually they realized if he was dead they could still get his address a bunch of different ways old phone books for instance i could see all of this happening but how could i prove any of it if i had world enough and time i could probably find theyd gone to ameritech for old phone books the cops hadnt been able to trace the sig that killed fepple perhaps fillidas friend in the italian consulate had brought it in with her under diplomatic cover laura darling i want to bring my guns with me the americans are so bizarre about gunsthey all carry them the way we do pocketbooks but they will make my life a misery of forms if i try to carry my own through customs with me as i cruised down lake shore drive for my meeting with durham i thought uneasily about paul hoffman in his hospital bed where had fillida rossy been going on a friday afternoon with her gym bag did she work out this late in the day or did the bag hold a gun for finishing the job on paul at the lights on chicago avenue i called the hospital there was a block on his room so they wouldnt connect me that was good could they give me a status report his condition had been upgraded to serious when id found a meter a few blocks south of the glow i called tim streeter up at maxs max hadnt come home from work yetposner had been back at the hospital today the demonstrations had been more subdued but the board was meeting late to discuss the problem tim was bored they really didnt need him any longer if i could get calia ninshuburs collar they would all be happy oh that wretched collar i told tim if i couldnt get up to evanston tonight calia would have to accept receiving it in the mail when she returned home more important was my dilemma about pauls safety which i explained to him tim said hed talk to his brother to see if one of the women on their team would look after paul for a few days he himself needed a break from bodyguarding four days of calia had turned him prematurely white when we finished i leaned my head wearily against the steering wheel too much was going on that i didnt understand and couldnt control where had lotty gone shed stalked angrily off into the night last night driven homeand disappeared i dialed her apartment where her clipped voice came on again from the machine lotty please call me if you are picking up your messages im seriously worried i called back up to evanston intending to leave a message for max but hed just walked in the door victoria have you had any word from lotty no mrs coltrain called wanting to know if you had been able to get into her apartment oh nutscalling mrs coltrain back went out of my headim spinning in too many directions right now i told max about my tour through the apartment this morning and asked if he could tell mrs coltrain about it himself if lotty disappeared of her own free will how could she leave without letting us know i added surely she must know how much this would upset all her friends not to say mrs coltrain and her clinic staff shes seriously disturbed max said something has knocked her offbalance so that shes thinking only of some small world not the bigger one with her friends in it her whole behavior isits frightening me victoria im tempted to call it some kind of longdelayed posttraumatic breakdown as if she held so much in for so many decades that its hitting her with the force of a tidal wave if you get any kind of word from her no matter the hour let me know at once as i will you it helped that max was as troubled as i posttraumatic stressits a diagnosis bandied about so glibly these days that one forgets how real and terrifying a condition it is if max was right it could explain lottys unbearable edginess lately as well as her sudden evaporation i wished i hadnt gotten myself bogged down in the trailing tentacles of the investigation i wanted to find her now i wanted to console her if that lay within my power i wanted to bring her back to life but i was frighteningly aware that i had few powers i wasnt an indovina i was barely making progress slogging through quicksand as an investigator i climbed stiffly out of the car it was sixthirty i was late for my meeting with the alderman i walked up the street to the golden glow its the closest thing i have to a private club not that its private but ive been a regular for so many years that they let me run a tab that i pay once a month sal barthele who owns the place flashed me a smile but didnt have time to come around to say hellothe horseshoe mahogany bar which her brothers and i had helped her retrieve from a gold coast mansion when it went under the wrecking ball ten years ago was threedeep with weary traders the half dozen little tables with their signature tiffany lamps were also crowded i scanned the room but didnt spot the alderman durham came in just as jacqueline who was working the floor whizzed past me with a full tray she handed me a glass of black label without breaking stride and went on to a table where she served eight drinks without checking the order i took a deep swallow of scotch steadying myself from my worries about lotty bracing myself to talk to the alderman jacqueline saw me edge my way to the door to greet durham she flashed an arm at me pointing to a table in the corner sure enough just as durham had given me an easy greeting the five women clustered at the table hopped up to leave by the time the alderman and i were sitting down half the bar had emptied as people ran to catch sevenoclock trains id wondered if he would come with an escort now that the room had cleared i could see two youths in their eye blazers standing just inside the door so investigator warshawski you are still on your quest to link africanamerican men with any crime that floats by your nose it was a statement not a question i dont have to go on a quest i said with a gentle smile the news gets handdelivered to me colby sommers has not only been flashing a roll but telling everyone and their dog rover what he did towell i hate to say earn that demeans the hard work that most people do for a living lets call it scoring call it what you want ms warshawski call it what you want it doesnt change the ugly truth behind the insinuations when jacqueline hovered briefly in front of us he ordered makers mark and a twist i shook my headone whisky is my limit when im in a tricky conversation people say youre smart alderman people say youre the one man who can give the mayor a run for his money in the next election cycle i dont see it myself i know colby sommers was a lookout when a couple of eye youths broke into amy blounts apartment earlier this week when you and i talked on wednesday i was wondering about an anonymous tip the cops got one to frame isaiah sommers now i know colby sommers made that phone call i know that isaiah and margaret sommers went to fepples agency the saturday morning his body was lying there brains and blood all over everything on your advice i guess what i dont know is what bertrand rossy could possibly offer you to make you get up to your neck in his problems durham smiled a genial smile that didnt reach his eyes you dont know much ms warshawski because theres no way you can know folks in my ward its no secret that colby sommers hates his cousin everyone along eightyseventh street knows that if he tried to frame isaiah for murder and if he got involved in the fringes of hardcore crime it doesnt shock me the way it might you i understand all the indignities all the centuries of injustice that make black men turn on themselves or turn on their own community i doubt you could ever understand such things but if colby has tried to harm his cousin ill make a call to the local police commander see if i cant help sort that out so that isaiah doesnt suffer needlessly i hear things too alderman i twirled the last small mouthful of whisky in my glass one of the most interesting is about you and reparations for descendants of slaves an important issue a good one to put the mayor in a bind overhe cant afford to alienate the international business community by pushing it he cant afford to look bad to his constituents by ignoring it especially since he backed the city councils condemnation of slavery so you understand local politics detective maybe that means youll vote for me if i ever run for an office that covers whatever chardonnay district you live in he was deliberately trying to goad me i gave him a quizzical smile to show i understood the effort even if i didnt get the reason oh yes i understand local politics i understand it might not look so good if people found out that you only started on your campaign when bertrand rossy came to town when hepersuadedyou to take the spotlight off joseph posner and the holocaust asset issue by banging the drum over reparations for slavery those are mighty ugly words detective and as you know i am not a patient man when it comes to people like you slandering me slander now that assumes a baseless accusation if i wanted to take the trouble or ask say murray ryerson at the heraldstar to take the trouble im betting we could find some substantial chunk of change moving from rossy to you either something from him personally or something on an ajax corporate check im betting from him personally and maybe he was even savvy enough to give you cash but someone will know about it its just a question of digging deep enough he didnt flinch bertrand rossy is an important businessman around town even if he is from switzerland and like you say one of these days i might want to run for mayor of chicago it cant hurt me to have support in the business community but most important to me is my own community where i grew up and where i know most people by their first names theyre the chicagoans who need me theyre the ones i work for so id best be getting to a meeting with them he drained his glass and signaled for a check but i waved a hand to jacqueline meaning sal should add it to my bar tab i didnt want to be indebted to alderman durham for anything not even one mouthful of scotch whisky xlviii bodies building at the end of the trading day the south loop empties fast the streets take on the forlorn and tawdry look that human spaces acquire when theyve been abandoned every piece of garbage every abandoned can and bottle stood out on the empty streets the l screeching overhead sounded as remote and wild as a coyote on the prairie i walked the three blocks to my car very fast looking around every few steps into doorways and alleys zigging back and forth across the street who would come for me firstfillida rossy or durham s eye gang durham had not only brushed me off hed done so with a studied offensiveness that was designed to make me angry as if he hoped that focusing on racial injustice would keep me from thinking about the specifics of the crimes colby sommers was involved in so what wasnt i supposed to think about it seemed to me i was getting a tolerably clear picture of why ulrichs journals mattered and of how howard fepple had been killed i was also starting to see the connection between durham and rossy they had a beautifully dovetailed set of needs rossy handed durham an attentiongetting campaign issue gave him the cash to fund it and manipulated the legislature into linking the holocaust with slave reparations making it too big an issue for them to touch durham in exchange took the spotlight away from ajax edelweiss and holocaust asset recovery it was lovely in a perverted way what i didnt understand was what howard fepple had seen in the sommers file that made him think he had a big payday coming i supposed it could have been something to do with ulrichs european lifeinsurance bookthat fepple like me like anyone in insurance knew edelweiss couldnt afford an exposure on holocaust lifeinsurance policies but that didnt explain how ulrich had made his money thirty years ago he wouldnt have been blackmailing his swiss employers because thirty years ago holocaust bank accounts and holocaust lifeinsurance policies didnt matter to state legislatures or the us congress ulrich must have been doing something more local he didnt seem like a criminal mastermind just an ugly guy who horribly abused his son and found a quiet way to turn a plug nickel into a silver dollar a man lurched out of the shadows in front of me i didnt know i could get my hand inside my shoulder holster so fast when the man asked for the price of a meal old ezra filling the air around him sweat trickled down the back of my neck i stuck the gun in my jacket pocket and fished in my bag for a dollar but hed seen the gun and ran down a side street on unsteady legs i drove back to my office keeping an uneasy eye on the rearview mirror checking for tails when i got to tessas and my warehouse i parked away from the building i had my gun in my hand when i let myself in before settling at my desk i searched tessas studio the hall the bathroom and all the subdivisions of my officeits hard to break in to our building but not impossible i put in a call to terry finchley at the police department hed been mary louises commanding officer her last three years on the force and was the person she still turned to for inside information on police investigations i knew he wasnt involved in the sommers murder directly but he knew about the investigation because hed been getting information about it to mary louise he wasnt in either i hesitated then left a message for him with the desk sergeant colby sommers is a hangeron with the eye team he knows something about howard fepples murder he also was involved in the breakin in hyde park where you sent the forensics unit on wednesday the sergeant promised to pass it on when i switched on my computer i felt unreasonably let down that morrell hadnt responded to my email of course it was the middle of the night in kabul and who knew where he wasif hed gone into the backcountry already he wouldnt be anywhere near a phone hookup lotty off in some desolate place that i couldnt penetrate morrell at the ends of the earth i felt horribly alone and sorry for myself the fax of anna freuds article on the six toddlers from terezin had come in i turned to it resolutely determined not to wallow in selfpity the article was long but i read it through with total attention despite the clinical tone of the piece the heartbreaking destruction of the children came through clearlydeprived of everything from parental love to language fending for themselves as toddlers in a concentration camp somehow coming together to support one another after the war when the british admitted a number of children from the camps to help them learn to live in a terrorfree world freud took over the care of these six they were far too young for any of the other programs and they were such a tight little group that the social workers were afraid of separating them afraid of the added trauma that separation would create in their young lives they were all close but two had formed a special bond with each other paul and miriam paul and miriam anna freud whom paul hoffman called his savior in england cutting her photograph from her biography to hang in his chamber of secrets freuds paul born in berlin in sent to terezin at twelve months just as paul hoffman had claimed for himself in the interview on television the only one of the six about whose family nothing was known so if your name was paul and your father was a german who brutalized you locked you in a closet beat you for any signs of feminine character maybe you would start to think this is my story the children in the camps but paul and miriam werent anna freuds childrens real names in a study of real people freud had used code names to protect their privacy paul hoffman hadnt understood that hed read the article absorbed the story imagined his little playmate miriam for whom he cried so piteously on television last week the hairs stood up on the back of my neck i felt an overwhelming desire for my own home and bed for privacy away from other peoples soulsickening traumas i wasnt up to driving north to evanston i put ninshuburs little collar in a padded mailer addressed it to michael loewenthals london home with a note for customs used goods no declared value and dropped it in a mailbox with some airmail postage i kept an eye out on the street all the way home but neither fillida nor the eye team seemed to be stalking me i was happy when mr contreras waylaid me as i came into the lobby when he learned i hadnt eaten all day except for my apple he exclaimed no wonder youre discouraged doll i got spaghetti on the stove it aint homemade like youre used to but its plenty good enough for an empty stomach it was indeedi ate two bowls of it we drove the dogs to a park and let them romp in the dark i fell early to sleep in the night i had my most dreaded nightmare the one where i was trying to find my mother and only came on her as she was lowered into her grave wrapped in so many bandages with tubes coming from every arm that she couldnt see me i knew she was alive i knew she could hear me but she gave no sign i woke from it weeping saying lottys name aloud to myself i lay awake for an hour listening to sounds from the world outside wondering what the rossys were doing before falling back at last into a fitful sleep at seven i got up to run to the lake with the dogs while mr contreras followed us in my mustang the idea that i might be in danger worried him powerfully i could see he was going to stick close at hand until the edelweiss business was resolved the lake was still warm even though the september days were drawing short i went into the water with the dogs while mr contreras threw sticks for them i swam to the next rock outcropping and back when i rejoined the three of them i was tired but refreshed the misery of the previous night eased from my mind as we drove home i turned on the radio to catch the news at the top of the hour presidential election blahblah violence on the west bank and gaza blahblah in our top local story police have released the identity of a woman whose body was found early this morning in the sundown meadow forest preserve a countryside couple came on the body when they were running their dogs in the woods a little before six this morning countryside police now tell us that her name was connie ingram thirtythree of lagrange she lived with her mother who became worried when her daughter did not return from work last night she doesnt have a boyfriend mrs ingram said she often stayed late on fridays to go for a drink with her girlfriends at work but she always caught the when her daughter failed to come home by the last train mrs ingram called local police who told her they didnt take a missing persons report until someone had been gone for seventytwo hours still by the time mrs ingram talked to lagrange police her daughter was already dead the cook county medical examiner estimates that she was strangled around eight pm ingram had worked at ajax insurance in the loop since graduating from high school coworkers say she had recently been troubled by accusations from chicago police that she was involved in the murder of longtime ajax insurance agent howard fepple earlier this week countryside and lagrange authorities are cooperating fully with the chicago police in the investigation in other local news a south side man was shot and killed in an apparent driveby shooting as he was walking home from the l last night colby sommers had been involved in alderman louis durhams empower youth energy program as a boy the alderman said he is sending condolences to the family is the end of summer getting you down turn to i turned off the radio and pulled over to the curb mr contreras looked at me in alarm whats up doll she a friend of yours youre white as my hair right now not a friendthe young woman in the claims department ive been telling you about yesterday morning when i went down to ajax ralph devereux taxed her with knowing something about these wretched old journals that lottys wandered off with connie ingram disappeared for a few minutes on her way to the elevator i thought she was hiding from me but maybe she was in bertrand rossys office seeking advice fepple must have sent a sample of his goods to the company how else had they known he really could blackmail them hed sent them to poor little connie ingram because she was in touch with him she went directly to bertrand rossy because rossy was taking a personal interest in the work she was doing on the sommers file it must have been almost unbearably exciting for a claims handler to be pulled out of the pit by the glamorous young executive from the new owners in zurich he swore her to secrecy he knew she wouldnt betray his interest in the case to ralph to her boss karen bigelow to anyone because he could gauge her excitement pretty clearly but she was a company woman she was worried when she left ralphs office she wanted to be loyal to the claims department but she needed to consult rossy first so what did rossy do arranged a secret meeting with her at the end of the day we cant talk now my schedule is full ill pick you up at the bar across the street after work but dont tell anyone we dont know who in this company we can trust something like that taken her to the forest preserve where she might have imagined sex with the boss and strangled her when she turned to smile at him the scenario made me shudder in disgust if i was right peppy leaned her head across the backseat and nuzzled me whimpering my neighbor wrapped a towel around me you get into the passenger seat doll im driving you home tea honey milk you need that and a hot bath right now i didnt fight him even though i knew i couldnt afford to sit around for very long while he boiled water for tea and fussed around with bread and eggs i went upstairs to shower standing under the hot water drifting my mind turned up what ralph had said yesterday to connie something like i didnt think we ever deepsixed papers in an insurance company if fepple had sent her samples of his wares so to speak shed have kept them i turned off the water abruptly and dried myself quickly say rossy took care of the claims master file cleaning out anything in ulrichs handwriting hed found the microfiche copynothing simpler than for him to roam the floors of the building after hours just checking on local operations hunt for the right drawer abstract the fiche and destroy it but id guess connie had a desk filethe documents she needed to consult every day on a case while she was actively working on it it probably hadnt occurred to rossyhed never done a days clerical work in his life and i bet fepples stuff was in it i scrambled into my clothes jeans running shoes and the softly cut blazer to conceal my gun i ran down the stairs to mr contrerass place where i took the time to drink the hot sweet tea hed made and eat scrambled eggs i was impatient to be goingbut i owed him the courtesy to sit at the table for fifteen minutes while i ate i explained what i wanted to do muting his protest at my taking off again the clinching argument in his eyes was that the sooner i got going on rossy and ajax the sooner id be able to start looking for lotty xlix clerical work i ran back up to my apartment to collect my bagand to call ralph so id know where he was instead of bouncing around town hunting for him my phone was ringing when i got upstairs it stopped before i got my door opened but started again as i rummaged in my briefcase for my palm pilot vic it was don strzepek dont you ever check your messages ive left four in the last hour don knock it off two people connected with my investigation were murdered last night which is way bigger in my mind than returning your phone calls well rhea was lucky she wasnt murdered last night a masked gunman broke into her place looking for those damned books of ulrich hoffmans so if you can clean the snot off your nose and be responsive go get them back from dr herschel before someone else is hurt broke into her home i was horrified how do you know they were after ulrichs books the attacker demanded them rhea was terrified the bastard tied her up held a gun on her started tossing stuff out of her bookshelves going through her personal things she had to say that lotty had them i felt the air drain from me as if id been kicked in the solar plexus yes i can see that my voice was as dry as the dust under my dresser but don was full of his own alarms and didnt notice at four this morning rhea woke to find someone standing over her with a gun the person was completely covered in a ski mask gloves a bulky jacket rhea couldnt tell if it was a man or a woman a black person or a white but the attackers size and ferocity made her think it was a man he pulled a gun on her forced her downstairs taped her hands and feet to a diningroom chair the intruder had said you know what we want tell us where youve hidden them she protested that she didnt know so the man had growled out the books of her patient paul hoffman dons voice shook prick said hed already searched her office she says it was the worst part in a way that she had to keep asking him to repeat what he was sayinghe apparently spoke in a kind of growl that was hard to understand something deep in the throat thats why she couldnt even tell the sex of the speaker also well you know how it is when youre terrified especially if youre not used to physical attacksyour brain doesnt process stuff normally and thispeople look so horrible in ski masks and everything its paralyzing to see someone in that getup they dont look human it flitted through my mind that rhea could test her own theories by getting herself hypnotized to see what she could recall of her assailant but the episode had been too traumatic for me to make sport of her so she said dont shoot me dr herschel took the books the assailant was tossing her china on the floor she watched him smash a teapot that her grandmothers greatgrandmother brought from england in dons voice took on a sharp edge he said heshewhoeverknew rhea was the person closest to paul hoffmanhe knew his name and everythingand she was the only person hoffman would have given the books to so rhea said someone else had taken the books from the hospital last night when the bastard threatened her she gave them dr herschels name not everyone has your physical stamina vic he added when i didnt say anything it may be okay i said slowly lottys disappeared and taken the books with her if theyre still looking for ulrichs journals it confirms that lotty disappeared on her own that she wasnt coerced the police have been around i presume did she tell them about the connection to paul hoffman oh yeah i could hear him sucking in a mouthful of smoke then rhea plaintive in the background reminding him that she hated cigarette smoke and his sorry sweet into the mouthpiece although not addressed to me was that where fillida rossy had been going so fast with her gym bag yesterday afternoon down to water tower place to search rhea wiells office no ulrich journals in the office so the rossys waited until the middle of the night after the end of their dinner party rossy returned from murdering connie the two of them entertained bertrand sparkling with wit and then went off to terrorize rhea wiell in her home what did rhea say to the cops i asked she told them youd been in pauls house thursday so you may get a visit from the investigating team shes a neverending ray of sunshine then i remembered my carefully worded message to ralph yesterday afternoonthat i didnt have ulrichs books that someone else had taken them away id been trying to protect lotty but all id done was expose rhea wiell naturally the rossysor whoever was after the bookshad looked first for the person hoffman was closest to i could hardly complain if shed sicced them onto me in turn hell don im sorry i cut short his expostulation look whoever is after these books is lethal im totally utterly thankful that they didnt shoot rhea butif they go to lottys and dont find the notebooks there they may think rhea was lying they may come after her again and be more ferocious this time or they may think she gave them to you can you go away for the weekend go to new york go to london go somewhere where you can feel reasonably safe he was shaken we talked about the possibilities for several minutes but before he hung up i said look don ive got more bad news for you on your recovered memory project i know seeing those books of ulrichs already raised some doubts in your mind but this story of pauls that he was a kid in terezin who was taken to england where hoffman scooped him up im afraid he may have adapted that from someone elses history i told him about anna freuds article if you can find out what happened to the real paul and miriam in that articlewell id hate for you to take your pauls history public a lot of readers would recognize freuds article and know he had appropriated the story of those kids maybe the evidence will prove hes right don spoke without much conviction the children couldnt have stayed with anna freuds staff forever they have to have grown up somewhere one of them could well have come to america with ulrich who might have called him paul thinking that was his real name he was trying hard to hang on to the shreds of his belief in his bookand in rhea maybe i said doubtfully ill send you a copy of the article the children were placed in adoptive homes through a foster parents organization under freuds supervision i have a feeling they would have made sure paul went to a stable twoparent home not into the custody of a widowed immigrant even if he wasnt an einsatzgruppenführer youre trying to ruin my book just because you dont like rhea he grumbled i kept my temper with an effort youre a wellrespected writer im trying to keep you from making a fool out of yourself with a book that would be poked full of holes the minute it hit the street it seems to me thats my lookout mine and rheas oh boil your head don i said my sympathy gone i have two murders to attend to i dont have time for this kind of crap i hung up and found ralph devereuxs home number hed moved away from the gold coast apartment where hed lived when i used to know him but he was still in the city in the trendy new neighborhood on south dearborn i got his voice mail on a saturday he might be out running errands or playing golf but someone on his staff had been murdered i bet he was in the office sure enough when i called over to ajax ralphs secretary answered the phone denise v i warshawski i was very sorry to hear about connie ingram is ralph in im going to be there in about twenty minutes to talk to him about the situation she tried to protest he was down the hall meeting with mr rossy and the chairman hed called all his claims supervisors to come in and they were waiting in his conference room the police were there right now interrogating the staffthere was no way he could fit me in i told her i was on my way when i got to ajax i had a bit of luck detective finchley was in the lobby talking to one of his juniors the finch a slender black man in his late thirties is always perfectly turned out even on a saturday morning his shirt was ironed to knife creases along the collar he called me over as soon as he saw me vic i didnt get your message about colby sommers until this morning idiot on duty last night didnt think it was important enough to page me at home and now the dirtbag is dead driveby theyre calling it what do you know about him i repeated what gertrude sommers had told me it was all based on word from the reverend at her church trouble is i talked to louis durham about it last night youre not saying durham s responsible for this are you he was indignant ms sommerss reverend says the left hand of durham s left hand isnt always as well washed as it should be if durham talked it over with someone on his eye team maybe they felt the heat was getting too close id check with ms sommers find out who this reverend ishe seems pretty well plugged into the neighborhood anytime youre within five miles of a case it gets totally screwed up terry complained why are you here this morning dont tell me you think alderman durham shot connie ingram im here to see the head of the claims departmenthe values my opinion more than you do that was a liebut terryd gone out of his way to hurt my feelings i wasnt going to expose myself to more insults by telling him my theories about fepple ulrich and the swiss the insult was worth it though when i moved past him to the elevators the security staff didnt challenge methey figured i was one of terrys detectives i rode up to the sixtythird floor where the executivefloor attendant was at her station even though it was a saturday morning poor connie ingram in life shed been a minor cog in the large corporate engine in death she caused senior executives to devote their weekends to her care detective warshawski i said to the attendant mr devereux is expecting me the police i thought you were finished up here that was detective finchleys team but im overseeing the whole case including the agency murder you dont need to calli know my way to devereuxs office she didnt try to stop me when an employee has been murdered and the police are in even executivefloor staff lose their poise ralphs secretary looked at me with a worried frown but she also didnt try to send me away hes still with mr rossy and the chairman you can wait out here if you want is karen bigelow in the conference room i can talk to her in the meantime denises frown deepened but she got up from her desk to escort me to the conference room when i went in the seven people at the long oval table were talking in a jerky desultory way they looked up eagerly but sank back in their seats when they saw it was me not ralph karen bigelow connies supervisor recognized me after a moment and pinched her lips together in a scowl karen you remember ms warshawski shed like a word when the bosss secretary says that its tantamount to a command bigelow didnt like it but she pushed away from the table and came with me to the outer office i made the conventional overturesi was very sorry to hear of the death i knew it must be quite a shockbut she wasnt going to unbend for me my own lips tightened all right lets do this the hard painful way we all know connie was in touch with howard fepple before he died and that he sent her copies of documents from his agency file i want to see her desk file i want to see what he sent her so you can go to the police and blame this poor dead girl some more thank you no i smiled grimly so there is a desk filei wasnt sure if we could go see it well find in it the reason for howard fepples death and for her own not because she had i dont have to listen to this bigelow turned on her heel i shouted over her own raised voice not because she had anything to do with his death but because the documents were dangerous in a way that she didnt understand ralph walked into his office at that unfortunate moment vic he snarled in fury what the hell are you doing here no dont bother answering karen whats warshawski trying to persuade you to do the other six supervisors had come to the conferenceroom door at my shout the expression on ralphs face made them scuttle back to their seats before he had time to order them to move she wants to see poor little connies desk file on the sommers case ralph karen bigelow said ralph turned a ferocious glare onto me someone must have been chewing him out down in the chairmans office dont you ever daredarecome into this building and try to suborn my staff behind my back again you have a right to be angry ralph i said quietly but two people are dead and a third is in critical condition because of whatever scam the midway agency was working around the aaron sommers claim im trying to find out what it was before anyone else is shot the chicago cops are working on it his mouth was tight with anger just leave them to it i would if they were getting anywhere close but i know things they dont or at least im putting together things that they arent then tell them about it i would if i had any real evidence thats why i want to see connies desk file he stared at me bleakly then said karen go back to the conference roomtell the rest of the team ill be with you in two minutes denise do we have coffee rolls whatever could you get on that please anger was still making a pulse throb in his temple but he was trying hard not to take it out on his staff he motioned me to his inner office with a jerk of his headi didnt need nice treatment all right two minutes to sell me and then im meeting with my staff he shut the door and stared pointedly at his watch the agent who originally sold aaron sommers his policy in was involved in something illegal i said howard fepple apparently didnt know about it until he looked up aaron sommerss file i was in the office with him when he did it was clear it held somethingdocuments notes i dont know whatthat grabbed his attention when he faxed his agency material to connie im presuming he included something that he thought gave him a way to blackmail the company no one knows what the original agent ulrich hoffman was up to all the copies of the original sommers policy documents have disappeared the only thing left is the sanitized version you yourself said yesterday that there should be handwritten notes from the agent in it but those have all disappeared if connie kept a desk copy its gold and its dynamite so his arms were crossed in an uncompromising attitude i took a deep breath i believe connie was reporting directly privately to bertrand ros goddamn you no he bellowed what the hell are you up to ralph please i know this must seem like déjà vu all over again me coming in accusing your boss but listen for just one minute ulrich hoffman used to be an agent for edelweiss in vienna during the thirties back when it was called nesthorn he sold burial policies to poor jews came the war who knows what he did for eight years but in ulrich landed in baltimore somehow moved on to chicago and started doing the only work he knew selling burial policies to poor people in this case africanamericans on chicagos south side im sure all this history is fascinating ralph interrupted me with heavy sarcasm but my staff is waiting for me old ulrich kept a list of his viennese clients the lifeinsurance policies that edelweiss claims they never sold i hissed their line has been they were a small regional company they werent involved with people who died in the holocaust edelweiss was a small company back then but nesthorn was the biggest player in europe if ulrichs books come to light then this charade rossy and janoff played in springfield on tuesdaygetting the legislature to kill the holocaust asset recovery actis going to cause a backlash the size of a tidal wave damn you vic you cant prove any of this ralph smacked his aluminum desktop so hard he winced in pain no because those wretched journals of ulrichs keep disappearing but believe me rossy is hot on their trail the head office in zurich cant afford for this to come to light edelweiss cant afford for anyone to see those books of ulrichs im betting rossy and his wife engineered howard fepples death im betting he killed poor little connie im betting he told her she was on a topsecret project working just for him that she couldnt tell anyone not karen not you not her mother he was handsome rich powerful she was a plain little cinderella toiling in the ranks he probably was her prince charming fantasy come to life she was loyal to ajax and he was ajax no conflict for her there but a lot of excitement ralph was very white he unconsciously massaged his right shoulder where hed taken a bullet from his old boss ten years ago i presume the police are connecting connies murder to ajax or you all wouldnt be gathered here on a saturday i said the girlswomenshe usually had a drink with on friday nights say she canceled because she had to work late ralph said leadenly she certainly left the building when everyone else did according to her coworkers when one of them teased her about having a date that she didnt want to tell them about she became very embarrassed said it wasnt like that but shed been asked to keep it confidential the cops are looking at the company so will you let me take a look at connies desk file no his voice was barely above a whisper now i want you to leave the building and in case youre imagining stopping on thirtynine to hunt for it yourself dont im sending karen down to connies desk right now to collect all her papers and bring them up here im not going to have you riding through my department like a cowgirl herding mavericks will you promise me one thing two things actually will you look through connies papers without telling bertrand rossy about it and will you let me know what you find im not promising you anything warshawski but you can rest assured that im not jeopardizing whats left of my career by taking this story to rossy l jumped for joy before i left ralphs office i gave denise another copy of my card hes going to want to get in touch with me i said with more confidence than i felt make sure he knows he can reach me on my cell phone anytime this weekend i almost couldnt bear not seeing connie ingrams desk file myself but karen bigelow rode with me as far as the thirtyninth floor assuring me that she would summon building security if i followed her to connies workstation when i left the building i turned into a whirlwind of useless activity don strzepek had decided not to take my advice on leaving town i got him to persuade rhea to let me visit her in her town house on clarendon hoping a firsthand description of her attacker would tell me one way or another if it had been one of the rossys that was my first wasted hour don let me into the house past a waterfall with lotus flowers floating in it to a solarium where rhea sat in a large armchair her luminous eyes peered at me from a cocoon of shawls while she sipped herbal tea and don held her hand she stepped me through the events of the night before when i tried to press her on anythingthe height the build the accent the strength of her assailant she leaned back in the chair a hand over her forehead vic i know you mean well but i have been over this ground not just with donald and the police but with myself i put myself in a light trance and spoke the whole incident into a tape recorder which you may listen toif any detail had stuck out i would have recalled it then i listened to the tape but she refused to reinduce a trance so that i could question her myself i suggested that she might have noticed the color of the eyes glittering through the ski mask the color of the mask or of the bulky jacket the person woreher trance recital didnt cover any of those points at that she became wearily belligerent if she had thought such questions would produce useful answers she would have asked them herself don could you help vic find her way out im exhausted i didnt have time to waste on anger or arguments i went back past the lotus petals only venting my feelings by pinging a penny against the buddha at the top of the waterfall i next drove down to the south side to colby sommerss mother to try to gather any information about isaiahs cousins last evening on the planet various relations were comforting her including gertrude sommers who talked with me softly in one corner colby had been a weak boy and a weak man he had liked to feel important by hanging out with dangerous people and now sadly hed paid the price but isaiah isaiah was a different story she wanted to make sure i knew that i could not let isaiah share colbys fate i nodded bleakly and turned to colbys mother she hadnt seen her son for a week or two she didnt know what hed been up to she did give me the names of some of colbys friends when i tracked them to a local pool hall they put their cues aside watching me with a glittering hostility even when i broke through the haze of reefer and bitterness that enveloped them they didnt tell me much yes colby had hung with some brothers who did sometimes run errands for durham s eye team yes hed been flashing a roll for a few days colby was like that when he was in the money everyone got a share when he was flat everyone else was expected to ante up last night hed said he was going to be doing something with the eye brothers but names no they knew no names neither bribes nor threats could shake them i left frustrated terry didnt want to suspect alderman durham and the guys on the south side were too intimidated by the eye team to rat them out i could go see durham again myself but that would be wasted energy when i didnt have a viable lever and anyway right now my worries about lotty and ulrichs journals made it more important that i try to figure out a way to get to the rossys i was wondering if there was some way i could start checking their alibis for last night without showing myself too obviously when my cell phone rang i was northbound on the ryan in that stretch where sixteen lanes cross each other again and again in something like a maypole dancenot the place to distract myself i pulled off at the nearest exit to answer id hoped for ralph but it was my answering service mrs coltrain had called me from lottys clinic it was urgent i should get back to her at once shes at the clinic i looked at the dashboard clocklottys saturday hours were ninethirty to one it was past two now i dont know the weekend operators at my service this man read me the number mrs coltrain had given him and hung up it was the clinic all rightperhaps shed stayed on to do some paperwork mrs coltrain is usually calm even majesticin all the years shes managed the flow of people at lottys storefront ive only seen her flustered once and that was when the clinic was invaded by an angry mob when i called back today she sounded as agitated as she had that day six years ago oh ms warshawski thank you for calling isomething strange has come upi didnt know what to doi hope youit would be good if youi dont want to impose are you busy whats wrong mrs coltrain has someone broken in itsits something from dr herschel shesheuhsent a packet of dictation from where i demanded sharply it doesnt say on the packet it came federal express ive beentrying to listen to it something strange has happened but i dont want to bother you ill be there as fast as i can half an hour at the outside i made a u on pershing and accelerated back onto the ryan calculating route calculating time i was ten miles south of the clinic here but the expressway curved sharply west before it reached the irving park road exit better to get off on damen and drive straight north eight miles to damen eight minutes unless the traffic glued then three miles on city streets to irving another fifteen minutes my knuckles were white on the steering wheel i was clutching it so hard what was wrong what was in the tape lotty was dead lotty was a hostage somewhere and mrs coltrain couldnt bear to tell me on the phone the light at damen was interminable steady old paint i admonished myself no need to shoot out the tires on the beemer that crowded around me to prove i had a right to the intersection when i finally got to the clinic i parked at a reckless angle and jumped out mrs coltrains silver eldorado was the only car in the tiny parking strip lotty had installed on the clinics north edge the whole street had a saturday afternoon sleepiness to it a woman with three small children and a large trolley of laundry was the only person i saw i ran to the front and tried the door but it was locked i pushed the afterhours bell after a long pause mrs coltrain asked in a quavering tinny voice who it was when i identified myself there was another long pause before she buzzed me in the lights were turned off in the waiting room i suppose to deter wouldbe patients from thinking anyone was here in the greenish light that filtered in through the glass fire blocks i felt as though i were under water mrs coltrain wasnt at her station behind the counter the whole building appeared desertedabsurd since she had just buzzed me in sharply calling her name i pushed open the door that led to the examining rooms mrs coltrain i called again im back here dear her voice came to me faintly from lottys office she never called me dear even after knowing me for fifteen years im always ms warshawski i pulled out my smith wesson and ran down the hall she was behind lottys desk her cheeks white underneath her powder and rouge i couldnt take in the scene at first it took me a second to notice ralph he was wedged into a back corner of the room on one of lottys patient chairs his arms tied to the chair arms a piece of surgical tape over his mouth his grey eyes black in his very white face i was trying to take this in when his face contorted he jerked his head toward the door i turned bringing up my gun but bertrand rossy was close behind me he grabbed my gun arm and my shot went wide he was using both hands on my right wrist i kicked him hard on his shin his hold slackened i kicked again harder and wrenched my gun hand away up against the wall i panted fermatevi fillida rossy spoke sharply behind me stop or i will shoot this woman she had appeared from some hiding place to stand behind mrs coltrains chair she held a gun against mrs coltrains neck fillida looked strange i realized after a moment that she had covered her blond hair in a black wig mrs coltrain was shaking her mouth moving wordlessly my lips tight with fury i let rossy take the smith wesson he pinned my arms behind me wrapping them with surgical tape in english fillida your newest victims cant understand you she just said i should stop or she would shoot mrs coltrain i added to ralph so ive stopped is that another sig fillida do your friends at the consulate smuggle them in from switzerland for you the cops cant trace the one you used on howard fepple rossy hit me on the mouth his smiling charm had sure disappeared we have nothing to say to you in any language whereas you have much to say to us where are herr hoffmans notebooks you have a lot to say to me i objected for instance why is ralph here rossy made an impatient gesture it seemed easiest to bring him but why ohoh ralph you found connies desk file and you took it to rossy i begged you not to do that ralph shut his eyes tightly unwilling to look at me but rossy said impatiently yes he showed me that silly girls notes silly conscientious little creature keeping all her desk records it never occurred to meshe never said a word to me of course not i agreed she took her clerical procedures for granted you know nothing of the details of work at that level they had killed so many people these two i couldnt think of a way to talk them out of killing three more string them out string them out while it comes to you above all keep your voice calm conversational dont let them see youre terrified so was fepple threatening to reveal that edelweiss really had a huge holocaust policy exposure would connie ingram even have understood the implications of that of course not rossy said impatient in the sixties and seventies herr hoffman began to submit death certificates to edelweiss for his european clientsthe ones he had sold life insurance to in vienna before the war can you believe such a thing fillida was incensed over hoffmans effrontery he collected the life insurance for many viennese jews he didnt even know that they were dead he had no proper procedures he made up the death certificates it is a total outrage the way he stole money from me and my family but aaron sommers wasnt a viennese jew i objected sidetracked for a moment by the lesser problem bertrand rossy snapped impatiently oh this hoffman he must have become crazy either that or forgetful he had insured an austrian jew named aaron sommers in and a black american of the same name in so he submitted a death claim for the black man instead of the jew it was all so foolish so unnecessaryand yet for us so fortunate he was the one agent we hadnt been able to find with a large book of prewar jewish policies and then it turned out he was right here in chicago that day in devereuxs office when i looked in the sommers papers and saw ulrich hoffmans signature on his agency work sheet i could hardly believe my fortune the man we had been seeking for five years was right here in chicago im still astounded that you and devereux didnt notice my excitement he paused to congratulate himself on his public performance but fepple he was a total idiot he found one of hoffmans old registers in the sommers file together with some blank signed death certificates he thought he could blackmail us over the false death certificates he didnt even understand that the holocaust claims were more important much more important bertrand enough of this history fillida said in italian get her to tell you where the doctor is fillida you must speak english i said in english youre in america now and these two unfortunates cant understand you then understand this rossy said unless you tell us where those books are at once we will kill both these friends of yours not fast with a bullet but slowly with great pain that woman last night the therapist of hoffmans son she said this jewish doctor has them these are my books they belong to my family to my company they must come back to me fillida said her accent strong her english not as smooth as her husbands but this clerk opened the safe and nothing is in it everybody knows you are the friend of this jewish doctor the best friend so you tell us where she is shes disappeared i said i thought you guys had her its a relief to know shes safe please dont make the mistake of assuming we are stupid rossy said this office clerk is totally expendable now that shes opened the doctors safe is that why poor connie ingram had to die i asked because she couldnt tell you where ulrich hoffmans notebooks were or because she would have told ralph or the cops about fraudulent death certificatesyour own obsession with hoffman and howard fepple she was a very loyal employee of the company i feel regret over her death you took her out for a lovely dinner treated her with the kind of charm that persuaded grandpapa hirss little girl to marry you and then took her to the forest preserve to kill her did you let her think you were attracted to her does it cheer you up the thought that a naive young woman responds to you the same way the rich bosss daughter does fillida curled her lip scornfully che maniere borghesi why should i bother my head if my husband gratifies the fantasies of some poor little creature shes complaining that i have bourgeois manners i explained to ralph and to mrs coltrain who was staring straight ahead glassy with shock in her world if your husband sleeps with the staff its just a throwback to those old medieval customs the queen of the castle doesnt bother her head over it because shes still queen what is it fillida because youre the queen you shoot anyone who doesnt bow to you because youre queen of edelweiss no one is allowed to get money from the companyyoull shoot them if they submit a claim you need to hold edelweiss the way you hold your silverware and your daughters hair dont you you are ignorant it is my familys company the edelweiss my mothers grandfather he started this company only then of course it was called the nesthorn the jews forced us to change the name after the second world war but they cannot force us to let go of our company i am protecting the future of my children of paolo and marguerita that is all she was angry but she kept her gun pointed at mrs coltrain that that cretin howard fepple could think he could drain money from us it is unbelievable and the jews only wanting money all the time believing they could come to demand more money from us that is an affront an outrage speak quickly now tell me where are these books of signor hoffman i felt very tired very aware of how weak and ineffectual i was with my arms pinned behind me oh those jews paying their few pennies a week to nesthorn so that you could ski at mont blanc and shop on monte napoleane and now their grandchildren their own little paolos and margueritas want the company to pay what you owe them that is a terribly bourgeois attitude dont they understand the aristocratic outlookthat you get to collect the premium and never have to pay on the policies its a pity the chicago police have such a limited worldview when theyve matched fibers from berties clothes to connie ingrams body well that will make a big impact on a bourgeois jury believe me the police require a reason to think about bertrand at all fillida shrugged elegant shoulders i myself do not see such a thing happening paul hoffman could identify you fillida your hand slipped badly on the trigger there didnt it that lunatic he couldnt identify me in a thousand years he thinks i am a concentrationcamp guard who would even suggest me as being in his house max loewenthal he knows whats happening here carl tisov dr herschel herself you and bertie are like a couple of elephants going musth through the jungle you cant keep killing everyone in chicago without getting caught out yourselves rossy looked at his watch we need to be going soon if alderman durham will only get here fillida he advised against bullet wounds so break the clerks arm persuade this detective that we are serious in our quest fillida turned her gun over and slammed the stock against mrs coltrains arm mrs coltrain screamed the pain ripping her out of her shocked frozenness the horrible noise turned everyone toward her in that brief window of distraction i launched myself at rossy i whirled kicking him hard in the stomach turning again as he lashed out at me to kick him on the kneecap he was punching at me but he wasnt a street fighter i was i ducked underneath his flailing arms and butted him square in the solar plexus he gagged and backed away out of the corner of my eye i saw fillida taking aim i hit the floor i was demented now unable to use my hands i lay on my back kicking at rossy over and over i was screaming in rage in impotent fury as fillida came around to the front of the desk to point her gun at me i didnt want to die like this helpless on the floor behind me i heard ralph give an enraged grunt he got to his feet dragging the chair with him and flung himself at fillida just before she fired his blow knocked her off balance her gun went off but she fell with ralph in his chair falling on top of her she screamed as he crashed onto her abdomen mrs coltrain stood up behind the desk i have called the police mr rossy as i believe your name is they will be here at any moment her voice wobbled a bit but she was back in command of her clinic hearing that majestic tone the same one she used to keep small children from fighting in the waiting room i lay on the floor and laughed li wily coyote i sat on the edge of ralphs bed holding his right hand between both of my own it was late on saturday night but the charge nurse told me he wouldnt sleep until hed talked to me i dont have much luck with my corporate loyalties he said why couldnt i listen to you the second time around if i wouldnt the first so many people dead poor connie and me with another bullet in the shoulder i guess i just cant stand for you to be right can i at least they got your left shoulder this time i said now youre symmetrical ralph youre a good guy and a team player you wanted your team to be as good as you were and i was telling you they werent youre too honest yourself to believe the worst of the people around you and anyway you saved my life i cant possibly feel anything but overflowing gratitude i brought his right hand to my lips thats generous his eyes flickered shut for a moment connie why did she i dont think she was being disloyal to you or to the company but i imagine rossy turned her head there was the big boss in from the new owners in switzerland telling her to report directly to him that she shouldnt tell anyone what he said to her because someone in the company was embezzling and it might be anyone you her immediate supervisor karen i imagine that was how he worked it anyone who had spent fourteen years toiling as a claims clerk would have been thrilled but she had that extra quality of loyalty and reliability he said not to talk she kept quiet and then he was sophisticated he was glamorous its a warning to me to cut out cheeseburgers ralph said with a gleam of humor guys only two years younger than me i need to look more glamorous to my young claims handlers so he romanced her and strangled her what a horrible ending for her can they make it stick terry finchley the detective in charge he got a search warrant theyre looking at rossys clothes fingerprintsthey may get a match with the marks on her neck he and fillida were so singlemindedly arrogant they probably didnt try too hard to conceal evidence fillida thats another story she could face a lot of chargesfepples murder attacking paul hoffman attacking rhea wiell but shes attractive rich theyre searching for her prints or clothes fibers or anything at pauls house but shes going to be hard for the states attorney to nail down at least those cheeseburgers of yours did some good when you came down on her you cracked her pelvis she wont ski anywhere anytime soon he smiled briefly the twisted smile that reminded me of the old ralph and shut his eyes i thought he had drifted off to sleep but as i started to get up he looked up at me again what was alderman durham doing at the clinic i saw him as they were carrying me off on a stretcher oh fillida and bertrand had gone berserk i said they thought theyd get a bomb blow the three of us up make it look as though antiabortion terrorists had been responsible they told durham to get one for themthey assumed that theyd bought him that he was just another one of their servants whod do what they wanted see rossy had been doing favors for durham in exchange for some muscle rossy got the legislature to block the holocaust asset recovery act unless it included slavery reparations he gave durham money so durham could build a war chest to run for mayoralong with this highprofile issue slavery reparations to build a citywide platform on in return for all this help durham directed rossy to some south side muscle when rossy wanted to break in to amy blounts apartment to see if she had the hoffman notebooks but hes a wily coyote the aldermanhe never put anything in writing he never directly told rossy he could find muscle for him rossy thought hed bought durham but the alderman wants to be mayor more than he wants to be al capone he called the cops told them the rossys were trying to get a bomb at the clinic so the cops were on their way even though they got there kind of late the alderman now looked like mr virtue hed given me a bit of a smirk in passing the smirk of the man whod gotten clean away with having colby sommers killed and who had a nice stash to launch his citywide campaign besides hed confessed to terry finchley more in sorrow than in outrage that some of the young men on his eye team werent as rehabilitated as he would have wished and the finch normally one of the citys straightest levelest cops had read me a lecture on my prejudice in flinging accusations at the alderman if i had to win every match in order to be happy id be a mighty sad detectivebut this was one round where the loss stuck in my craw the charge nurse came into the room hes recovering from trauma youve had your five minutes twice over out you go now ralph was asleep i bent to kiss his forehead where the shock of greying hair still flopped over down in the beth israel parking lot i dug my fingers into my shoulders before climbing into my car they were still sore from being tied behind my back id gone home to rest when i finally finished talking to the cops but i was still beat at home id felt honor bound to tell mr contreras what had happened before stumbling up to bed i slept a few hours but i woke up still tired clear to the bone all that death all the energy id spent trying to figure it out had turned on such sordidness fillida rossy protecting her greatgrandfathers company protecting her wealth and position not that she was the lady macbeth behind bertrandhe didnt need his wife to screw his courage to the sticking point hed had his own arrogance his own sense of entitlement when i got up before driving to the hospital to see ralph id gone to my office to email morrell how i wish you were here how i need your arms around me tonight he wrote back at once with love commiserationand a précis of the articles on edelweiss id sent him yesterday not that it mattered now just another little part of fillidas familys wealth nesthorn had insured a lot of nazi bigwigs during the war and had even forced people in occupied holland and france to buy life insurance from them in the sixties they thought it would be prudent to change their name to edelweiss because local resentment against the nesthorn name still ran high in western europe standing in the parking lot i gave a bark of mirthless laughter and shook my shoulders out again a giant figure loomed out of the shadows and moved toward me murray i gasped my gun in my hand before i knew id drawn it dont freak me after a day like this one he put an arm around me youre getting too old for these tall buildings warshawski youre right about that i agreed putting my gun away without ralph and mrs coltrain id be on a slab about now not to mention durham he said durham i snapped i know hes painting himself as mr clean but that lying piece of politician knows he got away with murder maybe maybe but i had a few words with the aldercreature this afternoon off the record unfortunately but he said that last night he looked at you looked at rossy figured hed better bet on the local talent said hed read some of your file saw that you often got your butt whipped good but usually landed on top who knows warshawskihe gets to be mayor maybe youll be police superintendent and you can run his press office i said dryly guy did a lot of mean nasty stuff including cheerfully helping frame isaiah sommers for howard fepples murder he didnt know it was isaiah sommers not from what my gofers in the police department tell me i mean he didnt know isaiah was a relative of the sommers family who hed helped out back in the s murray kept his arm around my shoulders when he found that out he forced rossy to settle gertrude sommerss claim and he tried to get the cops to keep an open mind on the murder investigation its why they didnt charge isaiah sommers now its your turn i want to see these mystery journals or ledgers or whatever that the rossys were stampeding through town trying to find i want them too i pulled away from his arm and turned to face him lottys vanished with them when i told murray about lottys disappearance after the fracas with rhea at paul hoffmanradbukas bedside he looked at me somberly youre going to find her right why did she take the books away i shook my head i dont know they told her something that they didnt tell anyone else i leaned into my car for my briefcase and found a set of the photocopies id made of the journal pages you can have this you can run it if you want he squinted at the sheet in the dim light but what does it mean i leaned wearily against my car and pointed at the line that read omschutz k nestroy hf nöl as i understand it were looking at a record for k omschutz who lived at nestroy street in vienna the hf means he was in apartment f at the rear of the building the numbers are the policy numbers with a tag meaning it was an austrian lifeinsurance policyö for österreichthe austrian for austria okay after a minutes squinting scrutiny he nodded this other sheet just gives the face value of the policy in thousands of austrian schillings and the weekly payment schedule it wasnt a code it meant something quite clear to ulrich hoffman he knew hed sold k omschutz a policy with a face value of fiftyfour thousand schillings and a weekly payment of twenty schillings a week as soon as ralph devereux at ajax realized that it applied to prewar lifeinsurance claims he put it together with the material that he found on his dead claims handlers desk that was what made him blow caution to the winds and storm into bertrand rossys office this morning ralph had gone over this with me when i got to the hospital tonight his mouth twisted in bitter mockery over his recklessness i was utterly weary of the entire business but murray was so excited at getting even a few pages of the hoffman journals as a scoop that he could hardly contain himself thanks for letting me scoop the town warshawski i knew you couldnt stay mad at me forever what about rhea wiell and paul hoffman or radbuka beth blacksin was feeling mighty peeved after she got to the clinic this afternoon and found out that whole business could turn out to be a fraud blacksin had been hovering behind the cops with the ubiquitous camera crews at the clinic id answered as many questions then as i could so i wouldnt have to face them later i told them about the rossys about the holocaust claims and ulrichs notebooks i didnt know what don was planning to do with his book but i didnt feel any special desire to protect him i told the cameras about paul hoffman about the anna freud material about pauls chamber of secrets when beths eyes lit up at the thought of getting that scene on tape i remembered lottys fury at the way in which books and movies titillate us over the horrors of the past don wanting to put it all in a book for envision press beth knowing her contract was coming due seeing her shows ratings zoom if she filmed pauls private horrors i told murray id walked out on them midsentence i dont blame you getting the news doesnt mean we have to carry on like jackals at suppertime he opened the car door for mean unusual act of gallantry lets go downtown to the glow v i you and i have a lot of catching up to doon life not just life insurance i shook my head i need to go up to evanston to see max loewenthal ill take a rain check though murray leaned down and kissed me full on the lips then quickly closed my car door in my rearview mirror i watched him standing there watching me until my car had turned down the exit ramp lii the face in the picture beth israel was near enough to the expressway that i took it up to evanston it was past ten now but max had wanted to talk things over he was feeling deeply lonely tonight since calia and agnes had left for london and michael and carl had flown west to rejoin the cellini in san francisco max fed me cold roast chicken and a glass of st emilion something warm and red for comfort i told him what i knew what i was guessing what i thought the fallout would be he was more philosophical than i about alderman durham but he was disappointed that posner hadnt been implicated in any of the scandal youre sure he wasnt playing a role somehow something that you could expose that would force him away from the hospital hes just a fanatic i said accepting another glass of wine although theyre actually more dangerous than people like durham who are playing the gamewell as a gamefor power or position or money but if we catch up with lotty and find those books of ulrichs then we can publicize those lifeinsurance policies that edelweiss or nesthorn sold during the thirties we can force the illinois legislature to revisit the holocaust asset recovery act and posner and his maccabees will go back downtown to ajax or the state of illinois building which will get him out of your hair lotty and the notebooks max repeated turning his wineglass round and round in his hands victoria while calia was here and i was concerned about her safety i wasnt worrying so intensely about lotty also i see now now that hes gone back to the tour i was protecting myself from carls scorn lottys high flair for drama he keeps calling her recent behavior the way she disappeared on thursdaycarl says its the same thing she did all those years ago in london turning her back walking away without a word its what she did to him you know and he says i am a fool if i think that isnt what shes doing to me she leaves she says nothing for weeks or months and then perhaps she returns or perhaps not but theres never an explanation and you think i prodded when he was quiet i think shes disappeared now for the same reason she disappeared then whatever that was he burst out if i was twenty as carl was then i might be as hurt in my own sense of self and less worried about her ones passions run higher at twenty but i am very worried about her i want to know where she is i called her brother hugo in montreal but theyve never been close he hasnt heard from her in months and has no idea whats going through her head or where she might have run to victoria i know you are worn i see it in the fine lines around your mouth and eyes but can you do anything to find her i massaged my sore shoulders again im going to the clinic in the morning lotty actually did fedex a packet of dictation to mrs coltrainshe was transcribing it when fillida rossy jumped her mrs coltrain says theres nothing to indicate where lotty isits a short tape leaving instructions about her surgical schedule but mrs coltrain is going to let me into the clinic in the morning so i can listen to it myself and inspect the wrapping she hopes it will mean something to me also she says lotty left papers on her desktop maybe theyll tell me something beyond thati can try to ask the finch or captain mallory to pull lottys phone recordsthey would show who she called the night she disappeared airline lists there are other things i could do but they wont happen fast well hope for something in her own papers max insisted that i stay the night youre asleep on your feet victoria you shouldnt be out driving unless youre desperate to go to your own home you can sleep in my daughters old room theres even some kind of nightshirt in there thats clean it was his own fear and loneliness that made him want me there as much as his concern for my wellbeing but both were important reasons to me i called mr contreras to reassure him of my safety and was glad actually to climb one flight of stairs to a bed instead of spending another half hour in my car to reach one in the morning we drove down together to the clinic mrs coltrain met us at nine looking as sedately groomed as if rossys and attempted murder were no more harrowing than sick women and screaming children fillida hadnt broken her arm when she smashed it with the gun stock but she had given mrs coltrain a deep bruise her forearm was resting in a sling to protect the damaged area she wasnt quite as calm as she appeared when shed settled us at her workstation with the tape player she confided you know miss warshawski i think i am going to get someone in on monday to take the doors off those closets in the examining rooms i dont think i can go in there without being afraid someone is hiding behind the door that was what fillida had done hidden in an examiningroom closet until she thought the clinic was empty and then jumped mrs coltrain at her workstation when fillida realized that the notebooks werent on the premises shed forced mrs coltrain to bring me to the clinic now mrs coltrain played the tape for max and me but although we listened to it clear to the end through half an hour of staticky silence on the second side neither of us got anything out of it except that dr barber was to take lottys two urgent surgical cases on tuesday and mrs coltrain was to work with the chief of surgery to reschedule the others mrs coltrain took us back to lottys office so i could inspect the papers lotty had left on her desk my stomach muscles clenched as we walked down the hall i expected to find the chaos wed left behind last night broken chairs blood overturned lamps and the police mess on top of it but the broken furniture was gone the floor and desk were scoured clean the papers neatly laid on top when i exclaimed over the tidiness mrs coltrain said she had come in early to make things right if dr herschel showed up she would be so distressed to find all that wreckage and anyway i knew i couldnt face it for thirty seconds so full of all that violence lucy choi the clinic nurse she came in at eight we gave it a good goingover together but i kept out all the papers that were on dr herschels desk yesterday you sit down here ms warshawski and look them over it felt strange to sit behind lottys desk in the chair where she had so often greeted me sometimes brusquely more often with empathy but always with a high energy i turned over the papers a letter from the archivist at the national holocaust museum in washington dated six years back telling dr herschel that they regretted not being able to find any records of the people whom she was trying to trace shlomo and martin radbuka although they could confirm the deaths of rudolph and anna herschel in they referred her to several data banks that traced holocaust victims which might be more helpful her correspondence with those other data banks showed that no one had had any useful information for her lotty had also left out a stack of newsletters from the royal free hospital in london where shed done her medical training i turned over the pages stuck between two of the sheets was a photograph it was an old picture the edges creased from much handling which showed a very young woman fair whose eyes even in the faded paper sparkled with life her hair was bobbed and curled in the style of the s she was smiling with the provocative selfconfidence of someone who knows herself beloved whose desires were seldom denied it was inscribed on the back but in german in a heavy european script which i couldnt decipher i handed it to max who frowned over it im not good with this old german but its written to someone named martin a love message fromi think it says lingerlinscribed in then shes rewritten it to lotty think of me dearest little charlotte anna and know that i am always thinking of you who is this dr herschels mother do you think mrs coltrain picked up the picture respectfully by the edges what a beautiful girl she was when this was taken dr herschel should keep it in a frame on her desk perhaps its too painful for her to see that face every day max said heavily i turned to the newsletters they were like all such documents filled with tidbits of information about graduates amazing achievements of the faculty status of the hospital especially under the severe retrenchments forced by the shrinking national health budgets claire tallmadges name jumped out at me from the third one i looked at claire tallmadge mrcp has given up her practice and moved to a flat in highgate where she welcomes visits from former students and colleagues dr tallmadges unbending standards earned her the respect of generations of colleagues and students at the royal free we will all sadly miss the sight of her erect presence in her tweed suits moving through the wards but the fellowship being established in her honor will keep her name bright among us dr tallmadge promises to keep busy with writing a history of womens medical careers in the twentieth century lotty herschels story the long road back when i reached the rise overlooking the place i couldnt go on i couldnt move at all my legs suddenly weakened at the knees and i sat abruptly to keep from falling after that i remained where i landed looking over the grey and blowing ground hugging my knees to my chest when i realized id left my mothers photograph behind id become frantic i searched my suitcase at least a dozen times and then i called the various hotels where id stayed many times no dr herschel we havent found it yes we understand the importance even then i couldnt resign myself to its loss i wanted her with me i wanted her to protect me on my journey east as she hadnt protected me on my journey west and when i couldnt find her picture i almost turned around at wienschwechat airport except at that point i couldnt imagine where id go back to i walked the city for two days trying to see behind its bright modern face the streets of my childhood the flat on the renngasse was the one place i recognized but when i rang the bell the woman who now lived in it greeted me with contemptuous hostility she refused to let me inside anyone could pretend they had been a child in an apartment she knew better than to fall for confidence tricksters it must have been the nightmare of this family of squatters someone like me coming back from the dead to reclaim my home from them i made myself go to the leopoldsgasse but many of those crumbling old buildings had disappeared and even though i knew the right intersection to look for nothing looked familiar to me my zeyde my orthodox grandfather had threaded his way through this warren with me one morning to a vendor who sold ham my zeyde traded his overcoat for a greased paper full of thinsliced fatty meat he wouldnt touch it himself but his grandchildren needed protein we could not starve to death to uphold the laws of kashruth my cousins and i ate the pink slices with guilty pleasure his overcoat fed us for three days i tried to recreate that route but i only ended up at the canal staring into the filthy water so long that a policeman came to make sure i wasnt planning to jump i rented a car and drove into the mountains up to the old farmhouse at kleinsee even that i couldnt recognize the whole area is a resort now that place where we went every summer the days filled with walks horseback rides botany lessons with my grandmother the nights with singing and dancing my herschel cousins and i sitting on the stairs peeping into the drawing room where my mother was always the golden butterfly at the center of attentionthe meadows were now filled with expensive villas shops a ski lift i couldnt even find my grandfathers housei dont know if it was torn down or turned into one of the heavily guarded villas i couldnt see from the road and so finally i drove east if i couldnt find a trace of my mother or my grandmothers in life then i would have to visit their graves slowly so slowly other drivers spewed epithets at merich austrian they took me to be from my rental license plates even at my slow pace i couldnt help finally reaching the town i left the car continued on foot following the signposts in their different languages i know people passed me i felt their shapes go by some stopping above me talking at me words flew by me words in many languages but i couldnt understand any of them i was staring at the buildings at the bottom of the hill the crumbling remnants of my mothers last home i was beyond words beyond feeling beyond awareness so i dont know when she arrived and sat crosslegged next to me when she touched my hand i thought it was my mother finally come to claim me and when i turned eager to embrace her my disappointment was beyond recounting you i choked out a word not bothering to hide my bitterness yes she agreed not who you wanted but here anyway refusing to leave until i was ready to leave taking a jacket and wrapping it around my shoulders i tried for irony you are the perfect sleuth tracking me down against my will but she said nothing so i had to prod to ask what clues had led her to me the newsletters from the royal freeyou left them on your office desk i recognized dr tallmadges name and remembered you and carl arguing over her that night at maxs ii flew to london and visited her in highgate ah yes claire who saved me from the glove factory she saved me and saved me and saved me and then she dropped me as if i were a discarded glove myself all those years all those years that i thought it was out of disapproval and now i see it wasi couldnt think of a word for what it was lies perhaps carl used to get so angry i brought him to the tallmadges for tea several times but he despised them so much that he finally refused to return i was so proud of them all of claire and vanessa and mrs tallmadge and their crown derby tea service in the garden and he saw them as patronizing me the little jewish monkey they could feed bits of apple to when it danced for them i was proud of carl too his music was something so special that i was sure it would make them all but especially claire realize i was speciala gifted musician was in love with me but they patronized that as well as if i was the monkeys organgrinder carl told me furiously after theyd asked him to bring his clarinet along one day he started playing debussy for the clarinet and they talked among themselves and applauded when they realized hed finished i insisted it was only ted and wallace marmaduke vanessas husband and brotherinlaw they were philistines i agreed but i wouldnt agree that claire had been just as rude that quarrel took place the year after ve day i was still in high school but working for a family in north london in exchange for room and board claire meanwhile was still living at home she was applying for her first housemans job so our paths seldom crossed unless she went out of her way to invite me to tea as she did that day but then two years later after shed finished saving me that last time she wouldnt see me or answer my letters when i returned to london she didnt return the phone message i left with her mother although perhaps mrs tallmadge never delivered itwhat she said to me when i called was dont you think dear that its time you and claire led your own lives my last private conversation with claire was when she urged me to apply for an obstetrics fellowship in the states to make a fresh start she even saw that i got the right recommendations when i was applying after that the only times i saw her were at professional meetings i looked briefly at victoria sitting on the ground beside me in her jeans watching me with a frowning intensity that made me want to lash out i would not have pity if youve been to see claire then you must know who sofie radbuka was she was cautious knowing i might bite her and said hesitantly she thought it was me so youre not the perfect detective it wasnt me it was my mother that flustered her and i took a bitter pleasure in her embarrassment always so forthright making connections tracking people down tracking me down let her be embarrassed now my need to talk was too great though after a minute i said it was me it was my mother it was me it was my mothers name i wanted her not only then but every day every night i wanted her only then most especially i think i thought i could become her or if i took her name she would be with me i dont know now what i was thinking when i was born my parents werent married my mother sofie the darling of my grandparents dancing through life as if it were one brightly lit ballroom she was a light and airy creature from the day of her birth they named her sofie but they called her the butterfly schmetterling in german which quickly became lingerl or lingling even minna who hated her called her madame butterfly not sofie then the butterfly became a teenager and went dancing off with vienna s other bright young things to go slumming in the matzoinsel like a modernday teenager going to the ghetto picking up black lovers she picked up moishe radbuka out of the belarus immigrant world martin she called him giving him a western name he was a café violinist almost a gypsy except he was a jew she was seventeen when she became pregnant with me he would have married her i learned from the family whispers but she wouldntnot a gypsy from the matzoinsel so then everyone in the family thought she should go to a sanatorium have the child give it up discreetly everyone except my oma and opa who adored her and said to bring the baby to them sofie loved martin in her way and he adored her the way everyone in my world did or at least the way i imagine they did dont tell me otherwise dont feed me the words of cousin minna slut harlot lazy bitch in heat all those words i heard for eight years of my london life four years after me came hugo and four years after him came the nazis and we all moved into the insel i suppose you saw it if youve been tracking me the remains of those cramped apartments on the leopoldsgasse my mother became thin and lost her sparkle who could keep it at such a time anyway but to me as a childi thought at first living with her all the time would mean she would pay attention to me i couldnt understand why it was so different why she wouldnt sing or dance anymore she stopped being lingling and became sofie then she was pregnant again pregnant sick when i left for england too sick to get out of bed but she decided to marry my father all those years she loved being lingerl herschel coming to stay with her parents when she wanted her old life on the renngasse going to the insel to live with martin when she wanted him but when the iron fist of the national socialists grabbed all of them herschels and radbukas and squeezed them into a ball together in the ghetto she married martin perhaps she did it for his mother since we were living with her so my mother for a brief time became sofie radbuka in my child years on the renngasse even though i wanted my mother to stay with me i was a wellloved child my grandparents didnt mind that i was small and dark like martin instead of blond and beautiful like their daughter they were proud of my brains that i was always number one or two in my class in my few years in school they even had a kind of patronizing affection for martin but they thought his parents were an embarrassment when they had to give up their tenroom flat on the renngasse and move in with the radbukas my omashe acted as though she had been asked to live in a cow byre she held herself aloof she addressed martins mother formally as sie never as du and me i wanted my oma herschel to keep loving me best i needed that love there were so many of us all cramped together i needed someone to care about mesofie was caught up in her own misery pregnant sick not used to any kind of hardship getting spite from the radbuka cousins and aunts who felt shed mistreated their own darling martinmoisheall those years but dont you see it made me treat my other grandmother rudely if i showed my bobe my granny radbuka the affection she craved from me then my oma would push me away on the morning hugo and i left for england my bobe my granny radbuka longed for me to kiss her and i would only curtsy to her i choked down the sobs that started to rise up in me victoria handed me a bottle of water without saying anything if she had touched me i would have hit her but i took her water and drank it so ten years later when i found myself pregnant found myself carrying carls child that hot summer it all grew dark in my head my mother my omamy grandmother herschel my bobemy grandmother radbuka i thought i could make amends to my bobe i thought she would forgive me if i used her name only i didnt know her first name i didnt know my own grannys name night after night i could see her thin arms held out to hold me to kiss me goodbye night after night i could see my embarrassed curtsy knowing my oma was watching me no matter how many nights i recalled this scene i could not remember my bobes first name so i used my mothers i wouldnt have an abortion that was claires first suggestion by when i was tagging around after claire trying to learn enough science so that i could be like her be a doctor all my family was already dead right here in front of us they shaved my omas silver hair i can see it falling on the floor around her like a waterfall she was so proud of it she never cut it my bobe she was already bald under her orthodox wig the cousins i shared a bed with whom i resented because i didnt have my own canopied bed anymore they were dead by then i had been saved for no reason except the love of my opa who found the money to buy a passage to freedom for hugo and me all of them my mother too who sang and danced with me on sunday afternoons they were here here in this ground burned to the ashes that are blowing in your eyes maybe their ashes are gone as well maybe strangers took them away bathing their eyes washing my mother down the sink i couldnt have an abortion i couldnt add one more death to all those dead but i had no feelings left with which to raise a child it was only the thought that my mother would come back that kept me going during the war when i lived with minna were so proud of you lottchen she and my oma would say you didnt cry you were a good girl you did your lessons you stayed first in your class even in a foreign language you tolerated the hatefulness of that prize bitch minnai would imagine the war ending and them embracing me with those words its true that by we were already hearing reports in the immigrant world about what was happeninghere in this place and in all the other places like it but how many were dying nobody knew and so each of us kept hoping that our own people would be spared but in the wave of a hand they were gone max looked for them he went to europe but i couldnt i couldnt bear it i havent been to central europe since i left in until nowbut he looked and he said they are dead so i felt horribly trapped i wouldnt abort the pregnancy but i could not keep the baby i would not raise one more hostage to fortune that could be snatched from me at a moments notice i couldnt tell carl carlif hed said lets get married lets raise the child he would never have understood why i wouldnt it wasnt because of my career which would have been destroyed if id had a baby nownow girls do it all the time it isnt easy to be a medical student and a mother but no one says thats it your career is over believe me in a baby meant your medical training was finished forever if id told carl told him i couldnt keep the child he would have always blamed me for putting my career first he would never have understood my real reasons i couldnt tell himanything no more families for me i know it was cruel of me to leave without a word but i couldnt tell him the truth and i couldnt lie so i left without speaking later i turned myself into the saver of women with difficult pregnancies i think i imagine every time i leave the operating room that i have saved not myself but some small piece of my mother who didnt live long after the birth of that last little sister so my life went on i wasnt unhappy i didnt dwell on this past i lived in the present in the future i had my work which rewarded me richly i loved music max and ii never thought to be a lover again but to my surprise and my happiness as well that happened between us i had other friends andyou victoria you became a beloved friend before i noticed it happening i let you draw close to me i let you be another hostage to fortuneand over and over you cause me agony by your reckless disregard for your own life she muttered something some kind of apology i still wouldnt look at her and then this strange creature appeared in chicago this disturbed ungainly man claiming to be a radbuka when i knew not one of them survived except for my own son when you first told me about this man paul my heart stopped i thought perhaps it was my child raised as he claimed by an einsatzgruppenführer then i saw him at maxs and realized he was too old to be my child but then i had a worse fear the idea that my son might somehow have grown up with a desire to torment me i thinki wasnt thinking i dont know what i thought but i imagined my son somehow rising up to conspire with this paul whoever he is to torture me so i flew to claire to demand that she send me to my child when claire came to my rescue that summer she said she would place my child privately but she didnt tell me she gave him to ted marmaduke to her sister and her brotherinlaw who wanted children they couldnt have want have want have its the story of people like them whatever they want that they must get and they got my child claire cut me out of her life so that i should never see my son being raised by her sister and her husband she pretended it was disapproval of my thinking so little of my medical training that i would get pregnant but it was really so i would never see my child it was so strange to me seeing her last week sheshe was always my modelof how you behave of doing things the right way whether at tea or in surgery she couldnt bear for me to see she was less than that all those years of her coldness her estrangement were only due to that english sin embarrassment oh we laughed and cried together last week the way old women can but you dont overcome a gap of fifty years with one days tears and embraces wallace ted and vanessa called my baby wallace marmaduke for teds brother who died at el alamein they never told him he was adopted they certainly never told him he had jewish ancestryinstead he grew up hearing all the lazy contempt i used to hear when i crouched on the far side of mrs tallmadges garden wall claire showed me a photograph album shed kept of his life shed had some notion shed leave it for me if she died before me my son was a small dark child like me but then so had claire and vanessas father been a small dark man perhaps vanessa would have told him the truth but she died when he was seventeen claire sent me a note at the time a note so strange i should have realized she was trying to tell me something that she couldnt put into words but i was too proud to look behind the surface back then imagine wallaces shock when ted died last fall he went through teds papers and found his own birth certificate mother sofie radbuka instead of vanessa tallmadge marmaduke father unknown when it should have been edward marmaduke what a shock what a family uproar he wallace marmaduke was a jew he was a churchwarden a regular canvasser for the tories how could he be a jew how could his parents have done this to him he went to claire convinced there was some mistake but she decided she couldnt extend the lie that far no mistake she told him he was going to burn the birth certificate he was going to destroy the idea of his birth identity forever except that his daughteryou met his daughter pamela shes nineteen it seemed to her romantic the unknown birth mother the dark secret she took her fathers birth certificate away with her she posted that notice on the internet that questing scorpio you found when she heard i had shown up she came at once to my hotel bold like all those tallmadges with the selfassurance of knowing your place in the universe is secure can never be taken from you shes very beautiful victoria ventured dr tallmadge brought her to my hotel so i could meet her she wants to see you again she wants to learn to know you she looks like sofie i whispered like sofie at seventeen when she was pregnant with me only i lost her picture i wanted her with me but i lost her i wouldnt look at victoria at that concern that pity i would not let her or anyone see me so helpless i bit my lip so hard it bled salt into my mouth when she touched my hand i dashed her own away but when i looked down my mothers photograph lay on the ground next to me you left it on your desk among the royal free newsletters she said i thought you might want it anyway no one is truly lost when you carry them with you your mother your oma your bobe dont you think that whatever became of them you were their joy you had been saved they knew that they could carry that comfort with them i was digging my fingers into the ground clutching at the roots of the dead weeds i was sitting on she was always leaving me my mother would come back and leave come back and leave and then she left me for good i know that im the one who left they sent me away they saved me but it felt to me as though once again she had left and this time she never came back and theni did the same thing if someone loved me as carl once did i left i left my son even now i left max i left you i left chicago everyone around me should experience the same abandonment i did i dont mind that my son cant endure the sight of me leaving him the way i did i dont mind carls bitterness i earned it i sought it what he will say now when i tell him the truth that he did have a son all those years ago whatever ugly words he showers on me i will deserve them no one deserves that pain victoria said you least of all how can i feel angry with you all i have is anguish for your grief as does max i dont know about carl but max and iwere in no position to be your judges only your friends little nineyearold lotty setting off alone on your journey your bobe surely forgave you cant you now forgive yourself the fall sky was dark when the awkward young policeman shone his flashlight on us he did not like to intrude he said in halting english but we should be leaving it was cold the lighting was bad on this hillside i let victoria help me to my feet i let her lead me
