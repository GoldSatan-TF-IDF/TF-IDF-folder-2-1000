jeffery deaver the twelfth card the sixth book in the lincoln rhyme series to the memory of christopher reeve a lesson in courage a symbol of hope some people are your relatives but others are your ancestors and you choose the ones you want to have as ancestors you create yourself out of those values i the threefifths man tuesday october chapter one his face wet with sweat and with tears the man runs for freedom he runs for his life there there he goes the former slave does not know exactly where the voice comes from behind him to the right or left from atop one of the decrepit tenements lining the filthy cobblestoned streets here amid july air hot and thick as liquid paraffin the lean man leaps over a pile of horse dung the street sweepers dont come here to this part of the city charles singleton pauses beside a pallet stacked high with barrels trying to catch his breath a crack of a pistol the bullet goes wide the sharp report of the gun takes him back instantly to the war the impossible mad hours as he stood his ground in a dusty blue uniform steadying a heavy musket facing men wearing dusty gray aiming their own weapons his way running faster now the men fire again these bullets also miss somebody stop him five dollars gold if you catch him but the few people out on the streets this early mostly irish ragpickers and laborers trooping to work with hods or picks on their shoulders have no inclination to stop the negro who has fierce eyes and large muscles and such frightening determination as for the reward the shouted offer came from a city constable which means theres no coin behind the promise at the twentythird street paintworks charles veers west he slips on the slick cobblestones and falls hard a mounted policeman rounds the corner and raising his nightstick bears down on the fallen man and then and the girl thought and what happened to him sixteenyearold geneva settle twisted the knob on the microfiche reader again but it would move no farther shed come to the last page on this carriage she lifted out the metal rectangle containing the lead article in the july edition of coloreds weekly illustrated riffling through the other frames in the dusty box she worried that the remaining pages of the article were missing and shed never find out what happened to her ancestor charles singleton shed learned that historical archives regarding black history were often incomplete if not forever misplaced where was the rest of the story ahfinally she found it and mounted the carriage carefully into the battered gray reader moving the knob impatiently to locate the continuation of the story of charless flight geneva s lush imagination and years of immersing herself in books had given her the wherewithal to embellish the barebones magazine account of the former slaves pursuit through the hot foul streets of nineteenthcentury new york she almost felt she was back there rather than where she really was at the moment nearly years later in the deserted fifthfloor library of the museum of africanamerican culture and history on fiftyfifth street in midtown manhattan as she twisted the dial the pages streamed past on the grainy screen geneva found the rest of the article which was headlined shame the account of a freedmans crime charles singleton a veteran of the war between the states betrays the cause of our people in a notorious incident a picture accompanying the article showed twentyeightyearold charles singleton in his civil war uniform he was tall his hands were large and the tight fit of the uniform on his chest and arms suggested powerful muscles lips broad cheekbones high head round skin quite dark staring at the unsmiling face the calm piercing eyes the girl believed there was a resemblance between them she had the head and face of her ancestor the roundness of his features the rich shade of his skin not a bit of the singleton physique though geneva settle was skinny as a gradeschool boy as the delano project girls loved to point out she began to read once more but a noise intruded a click in the room a door latch then she heard footsteps they paused another step finally silence she glanced behind her saw nobody she felt a chill but told herself not to be freaked it was just bad memories that put her on edge the delano girls whaling on her in the school yard behind langston hughes high and that time tonya brown and her crew from the st nicholas houses dragged her into an alley then pounded her so bad that she lost a back tooth boys groped boys dissed boys put you down but it was the girls who made you bleed get her down cut her cut the bitch more footsteps another pause silence the nature of this place didnt help dim musty quiet and there was no one else here not at eightfifteen on a tuesday morning the museum wasnt open yet tourists were still asleep or having their breakfasts but the library opened at eight geneva had been waiting here when they unlocked the doors shed been so eager to read the article she now sat in a cubicle at the end of a large exhibit hall where faceless mannequins wore nineteenthcentury costumes and the walls were filled with paintings of men in bizarre hats women in bonnets and horses with weak skinny legs another footstep then another pause should she leave go hang with dr barry the librarian until this creepy dude left and then the other visitor laughed not a weird laugh a fun laugh and he said okay ill call you later a snap of a cell phone folding up thats why hed been pausing just listening to the person on the other end of the line told you not to worry girl people arent dangerous when they laugh they arent dangerous when they say friendly things on cell phones hed been walking slowly because thats what people do when theyre talking even though what kind of rude claimerd make a phone call in a library geneva turned back to the microfiche screen wondering you get away charles man i hope so yet he regained his footing and rather than own up to his mischief as a courageous man would do continued his cowardly flight so much for objective reporting she thought angrily for a time he evaded his pursuers but escape was merely temporary a negro tradesman on a porch saw the freedman and implored him to stop in the name of justice asserting that he had heard of mr singletons crime and reproaching him for bringing dishonor upon all colored people throughout the nation the citizen one walker loakes thereupon flung a brick at mr singleton with the intent of knocking him down however charles dodges the heavy stone and turns to the man shouting i am innocent i did not do what the police say geneva s imagination had taken over and inspired by the text was writing the story once again but loakes ignores the freedmans protests and runs into the street calling to the police that the fugitive is headed for the docks his heart torn his thoughts clinging to the image of violet and their son joshua the former slave continues his desperate run for freedom sprinting sprinting behind him comes the gallop of mounted police ahead of him other horsemen appear led by a helmeted police officer brandishing a pistol halt halt where you are charles singleton i am detective captain william simms ive been searching for you for two days the freedman does as ordered his broad shoulders slump strong arms at his sides chest heaving as he sucks in the humid rancid air beside the hudson river nearby is the tow boat office and up and down the river he sees the spindles of sailing ship masts hundreds of them taunting him with their promise of freedom he leans gasping against the large swiftsure express company sign charles stares at the approaching officer as the clop clop clop of his horses hooves resonate loudly on the cobblestones charles singleton you are under arrest for burglary you will surrender to us or we will subdue you either way you will end up in shackles pick the first and you will suffer no pain pick the second you will end up bloody the choice is yours i have been accused of a crime i did not commit i repeat surrender or die those are your only choices no sir i have one other charles shouts he resumes his flight toward the dock stop or we will shoot detective simms calls but the freedman bounds over the railing of the pier like a horse taking a picket in a charge he seems to hang in the air for a moment then cartwheels thirty feet into the murky waters of the hudson river muttering some words perhaps a plea to jesus perhaps a declaration of love for his wife and child though whatever they might be none of his pursuers can hear fifty feet from the microfiche reader fortyoneyearold thompson boyd moved closer to the girl he pulled the stocking cap over his face adjusted the eyeholes and opened the cylinder of his pistol to make sure it wasnt jammed hed checked it earlier but in this job you could never be too certain he put the gun into his pocket and pulled the billy club out of a slit cut into his dark raincoat he was in the stacks of books in the costume exhibit hall which separated him from the microfichereader tables his latexgloved fingers pressed his eyes which had been stinging particularly sharply this morning he blinked from the pain he looked around again making sure the room was in fact deserted no guards were here none downstairs either no security cameras or signin sheets all good but there were some logistical problems the big room was deathly quiet and thompson couldnt hide his approach to the girl shed know someone was in the room with her and might become edgy and alert so after hed stepped inside this wing of the library and locked the door behind him hed laughed a chuckle thompson boyd had stopped laughing years ago but he was also a craftsman who understood the power of humor and how to use it to your advantage in this line of work a laugh coupled with a farewell pleasantry and a closing cell phone would put her at ease he reckoned this ploy seemed to work he looked quickly around the long row of shelves and saw the girl staring at the microfiche screen her hands at her sides seemed to clench and unclench nervously at what she was reading he started forward then stopped the girl was pushing away from the table he heard her chair slide on the linoleum she was walking somewhere leaving no he heard the sound of the drinking fountain and her gulping some water then he heard her pulling books off the shelf and stacking them up on the microfiche table another pause and she returned to the stacks once again gathering more books the thud as she set them down finally he heard the screech of her chair as she sat once more then silence thompson looked again she was back in her chair reading one of the dozen books piled in front of her with the bag containing the condoms razor knife and duct tape in his left hand the club in his right he started toward her again coming up behind her now twenty feet fifteen holding his breath ten feet even if she bolted now he could lunge forward and get her break a knee or stun her with a blow to the head eight feet five he paused and silently set the rape pack on a shelf he took the club in both hands he stepped closer lifting the varnished oak rod still absorbed in the words she read intently oblivious to the fact that her attacker was an arms length behind her thompson swung the club downward with all his strength toward the top of the girls stocking cap crack a painful vibration stung his hands as the baton struck her head with a hollow snap but something was wrong the sound the feel were off what was going on thompson boyd leapt back as the body fell to the floor and tumbled into pieces the torso of the mannequin fell one way the head another thompson stared for a moment he glanced to his side and saw a ball gown draped over the bottom half of the same mannequin part of a display on womens clothing in reconstruction america no somehow shed tipped to the fact that he was a threat shed then collected some books from the shelves as a cover for standing up and taking apart a mannequin shed dressed the upper part of it in her own sweatshirt and stocking cap then propped it on the chair but where was she the slap of racing feet answered the question thompson boyd heard her sprinting for the fire door the man slipped the billy club into his coat pulled out his gun and started after her chapter two geneva settle was running running to escape like her ancestor charles singleton gasping like charles but she was sure she had none of the dignity her ancestor displayed in his flight from the police years ago geneva sobbed and screamed for help and stumbled hard into a wall in the frenzy of panic scraping the back of her hand there she go there she go the skinny little boygirlget her the thought of the elevator terrified her being trapped so she chose the fire stairs slamming into the door at full speed she stunned herself a burst of yellow light in her vision but the girl kept right on going she leapt from the landing down to the fourth floor tugging on the knob but these were security doors and didnt open from the stairwell shed have to use the door on the ground floor she continued down the stairs gasping for breath why what was he after she wondered skinny little oreo bitch got no time fo girls like us the gunthats whatd made her suspicious geneva settle was no gangsta girl but you couldnt be a student at langston hughes high school in the heart of harlem without having seen at least a few guns in your life when shed heard a distinctive click very different from the cell phone closing she wondered if the laughing man was just fronting here for trouble so shed stood casually gotten a drink of water ready to bolt but shed peeked through the stacks and spotted the ski mask she realized there was no way to get past him to the door unless she kept him focused on the microfiche table shed stacked up some books noisily then stripped a nearby mannequin dressed it in her hat and sweatshirt and rested it on the chair in front of the microfiche machine then shed waited until he approached and when he had shed slipped around him bust her up bust the bitch up geneva now stumbled down another flight the tap of footsteps above her jesus lord he was following hed slipped into the stairwell after her and was now only one landing away half running half stumbling cradling her scraped hand she raced down the stairs as his footsteps grew closer near the ground floor she leapt four steps to the concrete her legs went out from underneath her and she slammed into the rough wall wincing at the pain the teenager climbed to her feet hearing his footsteps seeing his shadow on the walls geneva looked at the fire door she gasped at the chain wrapped around the bar no no nothe chain was illegal sure but that didnt mean the people who ran the museum wouldnt use one to keep thieves out or maybe this man had wrapped it around the bar himself thinking she might escape this way here she was trapped in a dim concrete pit but did it actually seal the door only one way to find out go girl geneva pushed off and crashed into the bar the door swung open oh thank suddenly a huge noise filled her ears pain searing her soul she screamed had she been shot in the head but she realized it was the door alarm wailing as shrilly as keeshs infant cousins then she was in the alley slamming the door behind her looking for the best way to go right left get her down cut her cut the bitch she opted for right and staggered into fiftyfifth street slipping into a crowd of people on their way to work drawing glances of concern from some wariness from others most ignored the girl with the troubled face then from behind her she heard the howl of the fire alarm grow louder as her attacker shoved the door open would he flee or come after her geneva ran up the street toward keesh who stood on the curb holding a greek deli coffee carton and trying to light a cigarette in the wind her mochaskinned classmate with precise purple makeup and a cascade of blonde extensions was the same age as geneva but a head taller and round and taut as a drum round where she ought to be with her big boobs and ghetto hips and then some the girl had waited on the street not having any interest in a museum or any building for that matter with a nosmoking policy gen her friend tossed the coffee cup into the street and ran forward sup girl you all buggin this man geneva gasped felt the nausea churn through her this guy inside he attacked me shit no lakeesha looked around where he at i dont know he was behind me chill girl you gonna be okay lets get outa here come on run the big girl who cut every other pe class and had smoked for two years started to jog as best she could gasping arms bouncing at her sides but they got only half a block away before geneva slowed then she stopped hold up girl whatchu doing gen the panic was gone itd been replaced by another feeling come on girl keesh said breathless move yo ass geneva settle though had made up her mind anger was what had taken the place of her fear she thought hes goddamn not getting away with it she turned around glanced up and down the street finally she saw what she was looking for near the mouth of the alley shed just escaped from she started back in that direction a block away from the africanamerican museum thompson boyd stopped trotting through the crowd of rushhour commuters thompson was a medium man in every sense mediumshade brown hair medium weight medium height mediumly handsome mediumly strong in prison hed been known as average joe people tended to see right through him but a man running through midtown draws attention unless hes heading for a bus cab or train station and so he slowed to a casual pace soon he was lost in the crowd nobody paying him any mind while the light at sixth avenue and fiftythird remained red he debated thompson made his decision he slipped off his raincoat and slung it over his arm making sure though that his weapons were accessible he turned around and started back toward the museum thompson boyd was a craftsman who did everything by the book and it might seem that what he was doing now returning to the scene of an attack that had just gone bad was not a wise idea since undoubtedly the police would be there soon but hed learned that it was times like this with cops everywhere that people were lulled into carelessness you could often get much closer to them than you otherwise might the medium man now strolled casually through the crowds in the direction of the museum just another commuter an average joe on his way to work its nothing less than a miracle somewhere in the brain or the body a stimulus either mental or physical occurs i want to pick up the glass i have to drop the pan thats burning my fingers the stimulus creates a nerve impulse flowing along the membranes of neurons throughout the body the impulse isnt as most people think electricity itself its a wave created when the surface of the neurons shifts briefly from a positive charge to a negative the strength of this impulse never varies it either exists or it doesnt and its fast mph this impulse arrives at its destination muscles glands and organs which then respond keeping our hearts beating our lungs pumping our bodies dancing our hands planting flowers and writing love letters and piloting spacecraft a miracle unless something goes wrong unless youre say the head of a crime scene unit searching a murder scene in a subway construction site and a beam tumbles onto your neck and shatters it at the fourth cervical vertebra four bones down from the base of the skull as happened to lincoln rhyme some years ago when something like that occurs then all bets are off even if the blow doesnt sever the spinal cord outright blood floods the area and pressure builds and crushes or starves the neurons compounding the destruction as the neurons die they release for some unknown reason a toxic amino acid which kills even more ultimately if the patient survives scar tissue fills the space around the nerves like dirt in a grave an appropriate metaphor because unlike neurons in the rest of the body those in the brain and spinal cord do not regenerate once dead theyre numb forever after such a catastrophic incident as the men and women of medicine so delicately put it some patients the lucky ones find that the neurons controlling vital organs like lungs and heart continue to function and they survive or maybe theyre the unlucky ones because some would rather their heart stopped cold early on saving them from the infections and bedsores and contractures and spasms saving them too from attacks of autonomic dysreflexia which can lead to a stroke saving them from the eerie wandering phantom pain which feels just the same as the genuine article but whose searing aches cant be numbed by aspirin or morphine not to mention an utterly changed life the physical therapists and the aides and the ventilator and the catheters and the adult diapers the dependencyand the depression of course some people in these circumstances just give up and seek out death suicide is always an option though not an easy one try killing yourself if all you can move is your head but others fight back had enough the slim young man in slacks white shirt and a burgundy floral tie asked rhyme no responded his boss in a voice breathless from the exercise i want to keep going rhyme was strapped atop a complicated stationary bicycle in one of the spare bedrooms on the second floor of his central park west town house i think youve done enough thom his aide said its been over an hour your heart rates pretty high this is like bicycling up the matterhorn rhyme gasped im lance armstrong the matterhorn s not part of the tour de france its a mountain you can climb it but you cant bike it thank you for the espn trivia thom i wasnt being literal how far have i gone twentytwo miles lets do another eighteen i dont think so five eight rhyme bargained the handsome young aide lifted an acquiescing eyebrow okay rhyme had wanted eight anyway he was elated he lived to win the cycling continued his muscles powered the bicycle yes but there was one huge difference between this activity and how youd pedal a stationary bike at golds gym the stimulus that sent the impulse along the neurons came not from rhymes brain but from a computer via electrodes connected to his leg muscles the device was known as an fes ergometer bike functional electrical stimulation uses a computer wires and electrodes to mimic the nervous system and send tiny jolts of electricity into muscles making them behave exactly the same as if the brain were in charge fes isnt much used for daytoday activity like walking or using utensils its real benefit is in therapy improving the health of badly disabled patients rhyme had been inspired to start the exercises because of a man he much admired the late actor christopher reeve whod suffered an even more severe trauma than rhymes in a horsebackriding accident through willpower and unflagging physical effort and surprising much of the traditional medical community reeve had recovered some motor ability and sensation in places where hed had none after years of debating whether or not to have risky experimental surgery on his spinal cord rhyme had finally opted for an exercise regimen similar to reeves the actors untimely death had inspired rhyme to put even more energy than before into an exercise plan and thom had tracked down one of the east coasts best spinal cord injury doctors robert sherman the md had put together a program for him which included the ergometer aquatherapy and the locomotor treadmill a large contraption fitted with robotic legs also under computer control this system in effect walked rhyme all this therapy had produced results his heart and lungs were stronger his bone density was that of a nondisabled man of his age muscle mass had increased he was nearly in the same shape as when hed run investigation resources at the nypd which oversaw the crime scene unit back then hed walk miles every day sometimes even running scenes himself a rarity for a captain and prowl the streets of the city to collect samples of rocks or dirt or concrete or soot to catalog in his forensic databases because of sherman s exercises rhyme had fewer pressure sores from the hours and hours his body remained in contact with the chair or bed his bowel and bladder functions were improved and hed had far fewer urinary tract infections and hed had only one episode of autonomic dysreflexia since hed started the regimen of course another question remained would the months of grueling exercise do something to actually fix his condition not just beef up the muscles and bone a simple test of motor and sensory functions would tell him instantly but that required a visit to a hospital and rhyme never seemed to find the time to do it you cant take an hour off thom would ask an hour an hour when in recent memory does a trip to the hospital take an hour where would that particular hospital be thom neverland oz but dr sherman had finally pestered rhyme into agreeing to undergo the test in half an hour he and thom would be leaving for new york hospital to get the final word on his progress at the moment though lincoln rhyme was thinking not of that but of the bicycle race he was presently engaged in which was on the matterhorn thank you very much and he happened to be beating lance armstrong when he was finished thom removed him from the bicycle bathed then dressed him in a white shirt and dark slacks a sitting transfer into his wheelchair and rhyme drove to the tiny elevator he went downstairs where redhaired amelia sachs sat in the lab a former living room marking evidence from one of the nypd cases that rhyme was consulting on with his one working digit the left ring finger on the touchpad controller rhyme deftly maneuvered the bright red storm arrow wheelchair through the lab to a spot next to her she leaned over and kissed him on the mouth he kissed her back pressing his lips against hers hard they remained like this for a moment rhyme enjoying the heat of her proximity the sweet floral smell of soap the tease of her hair against his cheek how fard you get today she asked i could be in northern westchester by now if i hadnt been pulled over a dark glance at thom the aide winked at sachs water off a duck tall willowy sachs was wearing a navy blue pantsuit with one of the black or navy blouses that she usually wore since shed been promoted to detective a tactical handbook for officers warned wearing a contrasting shirt or blouse presents a clearer target at the chest area the outfit was functional and frumpy a far cry from what shed worn on the job before she became a cop sachs had been a fashion model for a few years the jacket bulged slightly at the hip where her glock automatic pistol rode and the slacks were mens she needed a rear wallet pocket the only place she felt comfortable stashing her illegal but often useful switchblade knife and as always she was wearing sensible paddedsole shoes walking was painful for amelia sachs thanks to arthritis when do we leave she asked rhyme for the hospital oh you dont have to come better to stay here and get the evidence logged in its almost logged anyway its not a question of having to come i want to he muttered circus its becoming a circus i knew it would he tried to lob a blameful look at thom but the aide was elsewhere the doorbell rang thom stepped into the hall and returned a moment later trailed by lon sellitto hey everybody the lieutenant squat and wearing his typically rumpled suit nodded cheerfully rhyme wondered what his good mood was due to maybe something to do with a recent arrest or the nypd budget for new officers or maybe only that hed lost a few pounds the detectives weight was a yoyo and he complained about it regularly given his own situation lincoln rhyme didnt have any patience when somebody groused about physical imperfections like too much girth or too little hair but today it seemed that the detectives enthusiastic spirit was work related he waved several documents in the air they upheld the conviction ah rhyme said the shoe case yep rhyme was pleased of course though hardly surprised why would he be hed put together the bulk of the case against the murderer there was no way the conviction would have collapsed it had been an interesting one two balkan diplomats had been murdered on roosevelt island the curious strip of residential land in the middle of the east river and their right shoes stolen as often happened when faced with tough cases the nypd hired rhyme on as a consulting criminalist the au courant jargon for forensic scientist to help in the investigation amelia sachs had run the scene and the evidence had been gathered and analyzed but the clues had not led them in any obvious directions and the police were left to conclude that the murders had somehow been inspired by european politics the case remained open but quiescent for some time until an fbi memo went around the nypd about a briefcase abandoned at jfk airport the case contained articles about global positioning systems two dozen electronic circuits and a mans right shoe the heel had been hollowed out and inside was a computer chip rhyme had wondered if it was one of the roosevelt island shoes and sure enough it was other clues in the briefcase led back to the murder scene as well spy stuffshades of robert ludlum theories began to circulate immediately and the fbi and the state department went into overdrive a man from langley showed up too the first time rhyme could remember the cia taking an interest in one of his cases the criminalist still laughed at the disappointment of the globalconspiracyloving feds when a week after finding the shoe detective amelia sachs led a tactical team in a takedown of a businessman from paramus new jersey a gruff fellow who had at best a usa today grasp of foreign politics rhyme had proven through moisture and chemical analysis of the composite heel material that the hollowingout had occurred weeks after the men had been killed he found too that the computer chip had been purchased from pc warehouse and that the gps information not only wasnt secret it had been downloaded from websites that were a year or two out of date a staged crime scene rhyme had concluded and went on to trace stone dust in the briefcase to a kitchen and bathroom countertop company in jersey a fast look at the phone records of the owner and credit card receipts led to the conclusion that the mans wife was sleeping with one of the diplomats her husband had found out about the liaison and along with a tony soprano wannabe who worked for him in the slab yard killed her lover and the mans unfortunate associate on roosevelt island then staged the evidence to make the crime seem politically motivated an affair yes though not a diplomatic one rhyme had offered dramatically at the conclusion of his testimony in court undercover action yes though not espionage objection the weary defense lawyer had said sustained though the judge couldnt keep from laughing the jury took fortytwo minutes to convict the businessman the lawyers had of course appealed they always do but as sellitto had just revealed the appellate court upheld the conviction thom said say lets celebrate the victory with a ride to the hospital you ready dont push it rhyme grumbled it was at that moment that sellittos pager went off he looked at the screen frowned and then pulled his cell phone off his belt and made a call sellitto here whats up the big man nodded slowly his hand absently kneading his belly roll hed been trying atkins lately eating a lot of steaks and eggs had apparently not had much effect shes all rightand the perpyeahthats not good hold on he looked up a ten twentyfour call just came in that africanamerican museum on fivefive the vic was a young girl teenager attempted rape amelia sachs winced at this news exuding sympathy rhyme had a different reaction his mind automatically wondered how many crime scenes were there did the perp chase her and possibly drop evidence did they grapple exchanging trace did he take public transportation to and from the scene or was a car involved another thought crossed his mind as well one that he had no intention of sharing however injuries sachs asked scraped hand is all she got away and found a uniform on patrol nearby he checked it out but the beast was gone by thenso can you guys run the scene sachs looked at rhyme i know what youre going to say that were busy the entire nypd was feeling a crunch many officers had been pulled off regular detail and assigned to antiterrorism duty which was particularly hectic lately the fbi had gotten several anonymous reports about possible bombings of israeli targets in the area the reassignments reminded rhyme of sachss stories her grandfather would tell about life in prewar germany grandpa sachss fatherinlaw had been a criminal police detective in berlin and was constantly losing his personnel to the national government whenever a crisis arose because of the diverted resources rhyme was busier than hed been in months he and sachs were presently running two whitecollar fraud investigations one armed robbery and a coldcase murder from three years ago yep really busy rhyme summarized either rains or it pours sellitto said he frowned i dont quite get that expression believe thats never rains but it pours a statement of irony rhyme cocked his head love to help i mean it but weve got all those other cases and look at the time i have an appointment now at the hospital come on linc sellitto said nothing else youre working ons like this the vics a kid thats one bad actor going after teenagers take him off the street and who knows how many girls well save you know the city doesnt matter what else is going on some beast starts going after kids the brassll give you whatever you need to nail him but thatd make it five cases rhyme said petulantly he let the silence build up then reluctantly he asked how old is she sixteen for christs sake come on linc a sigh he finally said oh all right ill do it you will sellitto asked surprised everybody thinks im disagreeable rhyme scoffed rolling his eyes everybody thinks im the wet blanket theres another cliché for you lon i was just pointing out that we have to consider priorities but i think youre right thiss more important it was the aide who asked your helpful nature have anything to do with the fact youll have to postpone your hospital visit of course not i didnt even think about that but now you mention it i guess we better cancel good idea thom it isnt my idea you engineered it true he was thinking but he now asked indignantly me you make it sound like ive been attacking people in midtown you know what i mean thom said you can have the test and be back before amelias through with the crime scene there might be delays at the hospital why do i even say might always are sachs said ill call dr sherman and reschedule cancel sure but dont reschedule we have no idea how long this could take the perp might be an organized offender ill reschedule she said lets plan on two three weeks ill see when hes available sachs said firmly but lincoln rhyme could be as stubborn as his partner well worry about that later now weve got a rapist out there who knows what hes up to at the moment probably targeting somebody else thom call mel cooper and get him in here lets move every minute we delay is a gift to the perp hey hows that expression lon the genesis of a cliché and you were there chapter three instinct portables beat cops develop a sixth sense for knowing when somebodys concealing a gun veterans on the forcell tell you its really nothing more than the way the suspect carries himself less a matter of a pistols heaviness in pounds than the weight of consequences of having it close to you the power it gives you the risk of getting caught too carrying an unlicensed weapon in new york comes with a cracker jack prize an automatic stint in jail you carry concealed you do time simple as that no amelia sachs couldnt say exactly how she understood it but she knew that the man leaning against a wall across the street from the museum of africanamerican culture and history was armed smoking a cigarette arms crossed he gazed at the police line the flashing lights the officers as she approached the scene sachs was greeted by a blond nypd uniform so young he had to be a rookie he said hi there i was the first officer i sachs smiled and whispered dont look at me keep your eyes on that garbage pile up the street the rookie looked at her blinked sorry garbage she repeated in a harsh whisper not me sorry detective said the young man who sported a trim haircut and a nameplate on his chest that read r pulaski the tag had not a single ding or scratch on it sachs pointed to the trash shrug he shrugged come on with me keep watching it is there smile i how many cops does it take to change a lightbulb sachs asked i dont know he said how many i dont know either its not a joke but laugh like i just told you a great punch line he laughed a little nervous but it was a laugh keep watching it the trash sachs unbuttoned her suit jacket now were not laughing were concerned about the garbage why ahead right im not laughing im looking at the trash good the man with the gun kept lounging against a building he was in his forties solid with razorcut hair she now saw the bulge at his hip which told her it was a long pistol probably a revolver since it seemed to swell out where the cylinder would be heres the situation she said softly to the rookie man on our two oclock hes carrying bless him the rookie with spiky littleboy hair as shiny beige as caramel kept looking at the garbage the perp you think its the perp in the assault dont know dont care i care about the fact that hes carrying what do we do keep on going we pass him watching the garbage decide were not interested head back toward the scene you slow up and ask me if i want coffee i say yes you go around to his right hell keep his eyes on me why will he watch you refreshing naiveté he just will you double back get close to him make a little noise clear your throat or something hell turn then ill come up behind him sure ive got itshould i you know draw down on him no just let him know youre there and stand behind him what if he pulls his gun then you draw down on him what if he starts to shoot i dont think he will but if he does then you shoot him whats your first name ronald ron how long you out three weeks youll do fine lets go they walked to the garbage pile concerned but then they decided it was no threat and started back pulaski stopped suddenly hey how bout some coffee detective overacting hed never be a guest on inside the actors studio but all things considered it was a credible performance sure thanks he doubled back then paused shouted how do you like it uhm sugar she said how many sugars jesus lordshe said one got it hey you want a danish too okay cool it her eyes told him just coffees fine she turned toward the crime scene sensing the man with the gun study her long red hair tied in a ponytail he glanced at her chest then her butt why will he watch you he just will sachs continued toward the museum she glanced in a window across the street checking out the reflection when the smokers eyes swiveled back toward pulaski she turned quickly and approached jacket pulled aside like a gunfighters dust coat so she could get her glock out fast if she needed to sir she said firmly please keep your hands where i can see them do as the lady says pulaski stood on the other side of the guy hand near his weapon the man glanced at sachs that was pretty smooth officer just dont move those hands are you carrying a weapon yeah the man replied and its bigger than what i used to carry in the three five the numbers referred to a precinct house he was a former cop probably working security thats right let me see your ticket with your left hand you dont mind keep your right where it is he pulled out his wallet and handed it to her his carry permit and security guards license were in order still she called it in and checked out the guy he was legit thanks sachs relaxed handing him back the papers not a problem detective you got yourself some scene here looks like nodding toward the squad cars blocking the street in front of the museum well see noncommittal the guard put the wallet away i was patrol for twelve years retired on a medical and was going stir crazy he nodded at the building behind him youll see a couple other guys carrying round here thiss one of the biggest jewelry operations in the city its an annex for the american jewelry exchange in the diamond district we get a couple million bucks worth of stones from amsterdam and jerusalem every day she glanced at the building didnt look very imposing just like any other office building he laughed i thought itd be a piece of cake this job but i work as hard here as when i was on a beat well good luck with the scene wish i could help but i got here after the excitement he turned to the rookie and said hey kid he nodded toward sachs on the job in front of people you dont call her lady shes detective the rookie looked at him uneasily but she could see he got the message one that sachs herself had been going to deliver when they were out of earshot sorry pulaski said to her you didnt know now you do which could be the motto of police training everywhere they turned to go the guard called oh hey rookie pulaski turned you forgot the coffee grinned at the entrance to the museum lon sellitto was surveying the street and talking to a sergeant the big detective looked at the kids name tag and asked pulaski you were first officer yes sir whatsa story the kid cleared his throat and pointed to an alley i was positioned across the street roughly there on routine patrol at about oheightthirty the victim an africanamerican female sixteen years of age approached me and reported that you can just tell it in your own words sachs said sure okay what it was i was standing right about there and this girl comes up to me all upset her names geneva settle junior in high school she was working on a term paper or something on the fifth floor pointing to the museum and this guy attacks her white six feet wearing a ski mask was going to rape her you know that how sellitto asked i found his rape pack upstairs you looked in it sachs asked frowning with a pen thats all i didnt touch it good go on the girl gets away comes down the fire stairs and into the alley hes after her but he turns the other way anybody see what happened to him sellitto asked no sir he looked over the street you set up the press perimeter yes sir well its fifty feet too close get em the hell away pressre like leeches remember that sure detective you didnt know now you do he hurried off and started moving the line back wheres the girl sachs asked the sergeant a solid hispanic man with thick graying hair said an officer took her and her friend to midtown north theyre calling her parents sharp autumn sunlight reflected off his many gold decorations after they get in touch with them somebody was going to take em to captain rhyme s place to interview her he laughed shes a smart one know what she did what she had an idea there might be some trouble so she dressed up this mannequin in her sweatshirt and hat the perp went after that bought her time to get away sachs laughed and shes only sixteen smart sellitto said to her you run the scene im going to get a canvass going he wandered up the sidewalk to a cluster of officers one uniform and two anticrime cops in dressdown plain clothes and sent them around the crowd and into nearby stores and office buildings to check for witnesses he rounded up a separate team to interview each of the half dozen pushcart vendors here some selling coffee and doughnuts at the moment others setting up for lunches of hot dogs pretzels gyros and falafel pitabread sandwiches a honk sounded and she turned the cs bus had arrived from the crime scene unit hq in queens hey detective the driver said getting out sachs nodded a greeting to him and his partner she knew the young men from prior cases she pulled off her jacket and weapon dressed in white tyvek overalls which minimized contamination of the scene she then strapped her glock back on her hip thinking of rhymes constant admonition to his cs crews search well but watch your back give me a hand with the bags she asked hefting one of the metal suitcases containing basic evidencecollection and transport equipment you bet a csu tech grabbed two of the other cases she pulled on a handsfree headset and plugged it into her handitalkie just as ron pulaski returned from his press pushback duty he led sachs and the crime scene officers into the building they got off the elevator on the fifth floor and walked to the right to double doors below a sign that said booker t washington room thats the scene in there sachs and the techs opened the suitcases started removing equipment pulaski continued im pretty sure he came through these doors the only other exit is the fire stairwell and you cant enter from the outside and it wasnt jimmied so he comes through this door locks it and then goes after the girl she escaped through the fire door who unlocked the front one for you sachs asked guy named don barry head librarian he go in with you no where is he now his office third floor i wondered if maybe it was an inside job you know so i asked him for a list of all his white male employees and where they were when she was attacked good sachs had been planning to do the same he said hed bring the list down to us as soon as he was done now tell me what ill find inside the girl was at the microfiche reader its around the corner to the right youll see it easy pulaski pointed to the end of a large room filled with tall rows of bookshelves beyond which was an open area where sachs could see mannequins dressed in period clothing paintings cases of antique jewelry purses shoes accessories your typical dusty museum displays the sort of stuff you look at while youre really wondering what restaurant to eat at after youve had enough culture whats security like around here sachs was looking for surveillance cameras on the ceiling zip no cameras no guards no signin sheets you just walk in never easy is it no mano detective she thought about telling him that maam was okay not like lady but didnt know how to explain the distinction one question did you close the fire door downstairs no i left it just the way i found it open so the scene could be hot hot the perp couldve come back i you didnt do anything wrong pulaski i just want to know well i guess he couldve yeah all right you stay in the doorway here i want you to listen for what well the guy shooting at me for instance but probably better if you heard footsteps or somebody racking a shotgun first watch your back youre saying she winked and started forward to the scene so shes crime scene thought thompson boyd watching the woman walk back and forth in the library studying the floor looking for fingerprints and clues and whatever it was they looked for he wasnt concerned about what she might find hed been careful as always thompson was standing in the sixthfloor window of the building across fiftyfifth street from the museum after the girl got away hed circled around two blocks and made his way into this building then climbed the stairs to the hallway from which he was now looking over the street hed had a second chance to kill the girl a few minutes ago shed been on the street for a moment talking to officers in front of the museum but there were way too many police around for him to shoot her and get away still hed been able to take a picture of her with the camera in his mobile phone before she and her friend had been hustled off to a squad car which sped west besides thompson still had more to do here and so hed taken up this vantage point from his prison days thompson knew a lot about law enforcers he could easily spot the lazy ones the scared ones the ones who were stupid and gullible he could also spot the talented cops the smart ones the ones who were a threat like the woman he was looking at right now as he put drops in his perpetually troubled eyes thompson found himself curious about her as she searched the scene she had this concentration in her eyes looking sort of devout the same look thompsons mother sometimes used to get in church she disappeared from view but whistling softly thompson kept his eyes on the window finally the woman in white returned to view he noted the precision with which she did everything the careful way she walked her delicate touch as she picked up and examined things so as not to hurt the evidence another man mightve been turned on by her beauty her figure even through the jumpsuit it was easy to imagine what her body was like but those thoughts like usual were far from his mind still he believed he sensed some small enjoyment inside him as he watched her at work something from his past came back to him he frowned looking at her walking back and forth back and forthyes that was it the pattern reminded him of the sidewinder rattlesnakes his father would point out when they were hunting together or going for walks in the texas sand near the family trailer outside amarillo look at them son look aint they something but dont you get too close theyll kill you in a kiss he leaned against the wall and continued to study the woman in white moving back and forth back and forth chapter four how does it look sachs good she replied to rhyme via their radio connection she was just finishing walking the grid the word referring to a method of searching a crime scene examining it the way youd mow a lawn walking from one end of the site to the other then returning slightly to the side and then doing the same once more but the second time walking perpendicular to the first search looking up and down too floor to ceiling this way no inch or angle was left unseen there are a number of ways to search crime scenes but rhyme always insisted on this one good means what he asked testily rhyme didnt like generalizations or what he called soft assessments he forgot the rape pack she replied since the motorola link between rhyme and sachs was mostly a means to bring his surrogate presence to crime scenes they usually dispensed with the nypd conventions of radio protocol like ending each transmission with a k did he now might be as good as his wallet for iding him whats he got in his little weird rhyme its got the typical duct tape box cutter condoms but theres also a tarot card picture of this guy hanging from a scaffold wonder if hes a genuine sicko or just a copycat rhyme mused over the years many killers had left tarot cards and other occult memorabilia at crime scenes the most notable recent case being the washington dc snipers of several years earlier sachs continued the good news is that he kept everything in a nice slick plastic bag excellent while perps might think to wear gloves at the crime scene itself they often forgot about prints on the items they carried with them to commit that crime a discarded condom wrapper had convicted many a rapist whod otherwise been compulsive about not leaving his prints or bodily fluids at a scene in this case even if the killer thought to clean off the tape knife and condoms it was possible that hed forgotten to wipe the bag she now placed the pack in a paper evidence bag paper was generally better than plastic for preserving evidence and set it aside he left it on a bookshelf near where the girl was sitting im checking for latents she dusted the shelves with fluorescent powder donned orange goggles and shone an alternative light source on the area als lamps reveal markings like blood semen and fingerprints that are otherwise invisible playing the light up and down she transmitted no prints but i can see hes wearing latex gloves ah thats good for two reasons rhymes voice had a professorial tone he was testing her two she wondered one came immediately to mind if they were able to recover the glove they could lift a print from inside the fingers something else perps often forgot but the second she asked him obvious it means hes probably got a record so when we do find a print afisll tell us who he is statebased automated fingerprint identification systems and the fbis integrated afis were computer databases that could provide print matches in minutes as opposed to days or even weeks with manual examinations sure sachs said troubled that shed blown the quiz what else rates the assessment good they waxed the floor last night and the attack happened early this morning so youve got a good canvas for his footprints yep therere some distinct ones here kneeling she took an electrostatic image of the print of the mans tread marks she was sure they were his she could clearly see the trail where hed walked up to genevas table adjusted his stance to get a good grip on the club to strike her and then chased her down the hall shed also compared the prints with those of the only other man whod been here this morning those of ron pulaski whose mirrorshined issue shoes left a very different impression she explained about the girls using the mannequin to distract the killer and escape he chuckled at her ingenuity she added rhyme he hit her well the mannequin really hard a blunt object so hard he cracked the plastic through her stocking cap then he mustve been mad she fooled him he smashed the microfiche reader too blunt object rhyme repeated can you lift an impression when he was head of the crime scene unit at the nypd before his accident rhyme had compiled a number of database files to help identify evidence and impressions found at scenes the blunt object file contained hundreds of pictures of impact marks left on skin and inanimate surfaces by various types of objects from tire irons to human bones to ice but after carefully examining both the mannequin and the smashed microfiche reader sachs said no rhyme i dont see any the cap geneva put on the mannequin geneva thats her name oh go on she was momentarily irritated as she often was that he hadnt expressed any interest in knowing anything about the girl or her state of mind it often troubled her that rhyme was so detached about the crime and the victims this he said was how a criminalist needed to be you didnt want pilots so awed by a beautiful sunset or so terrified of a thunderstorm that they flew into a mountain the same was true with cops she saw his point but to amelia sachs victims were human beings and crimes were not scientific exercises they were horrific events especially when the victim was a sixteenyearold girl she continued the cap she put on the mannequin dispersed the force of the blow and the microfiche readers shattered too rhyme said well bring back some of the pieces of what he hit there might be some transfer there sure there were some voices in the background at rhymes he said in an odd troubled tone finish up and get back here soon sachs im almost done she told him im going to walk the grid at the escape route rhyme whats the matter silence when he spoke next he sounded even more bothered i have to go sachs it seems i have some visitors who but hed already disconnected the woman in white the pro had disappeared from the window of the library but thompson boyd wasnt interested in her anymore from his perch sixty feet above the street he was now watching an older cop walking toward some witnesses the man was middleaged heavy and in a godwrinkled suit thompson knew this sort of officer too he wasnt brilliant but hed be like the bulldog he resembled there was nothing that would stop him from getting to the heart of a case when the fat cop nodded toward another man a tall black man in a brown suit walking out of the museum thompson left his vantage point and hurried downstairs pausing at the ground floor he took his pistol out of his pocket and checked it to make sure nothing had become lodged in the barrel or cylinder he wondered if it had been this the sound of opening and closing the cylinder in the library that had alerted the girl that he was a threat now even though nobody seemed to be nearby he checked the pistol absolutely silently learn from your mistakes by the book the gun was in order hiding it under his coat thompson walked down the dim stairway and exited through the far lobby on fiftysixth street then stepped into an alley that took him back toward the museum there was no one guarding the entrance to the other end of the alley at fiftyfifth undetected thompson eased up to a battered green dumpster stinking of rotting food he looked into the street it had been reopened to traffic but several dozen people from offices and shops nearby remained on the sidewalks hoping for a look at something exciting to tell their officemates and families about most of the police had left the woman in white the kissing snake was still upstairs outside were two squad cars and a crime scene unit van as well as three uniformed cops two plainclothes ones and that fat rumpled detective thompson gripped the gun firmly shooting was a very ineffective way to kill someone but sometimes like now there was no option if you had to shoot procedures dictated you aimed for the heart never the head the skull was solid enough to deflect a bullet in many circumstances and the cranium was also relatively small and hard to hit always the chest thompsons keen blue eyes looked over the heavy cop in the wrinkled suit as he glanced at a piece of paper calm as dead wood thompson rested the gun on his left forearm aimed carefully with a steady hand he fired four fast shots the first one hit the thigh of a woman standing on the sidewalk the others struck his intended victim just where hed aimed the three tiny dots appeared in the center of his chest theyd become three rosettes of blood by the time the body hit the ground two girls stood in front of him and though their physiques were totally opposite it was the difference in their eyes that lincoln rhyme noticed first the heavy one dressed in gaudy clothes and shiny jewelry her fingernails long and orange had eyes that danced like skittish insects unable to look at rhyme or anything else for more than a second she made a dizzying visual circuit of his lab the scientific instruments the beakers chemicals the computers and monitors wires everywhere at rhymes legs and his wheelchair of course she chewed gum loudly the other girl short skinny and boyish had a stillness about her she gazed at lincoln rhyme steadily one fast glance at the wheelchair then back to him the lab didnt interest her thiss geneva settle explained the calm patrolwoman jennifer robinson nodding at the slim girl the one with the unwavering eyes robinson was a friend of amelia sachs whod arranged for her to drive the girls here from the midtown north house and thiss her friend robinson continued lakeesha scott lose the gum lakeesha the girl gave a beleaguered look but stuffed the wad somewhere in her large purse without bothering to wrap it the patrolwoman said she and geneva went to the museum together this morning only i didnt see nothing lakeesha said preemptively was the big girl nervous because of the attack he wondered or was she uncomfortable because rhyme was a crip both probably geneva was dressed in a gray tshirt and black baggy pants and running shoes which rhyme guessed was the fashion among high school students nowadays sellitto had said the girl was sixteen but she looked younger while lakeeshas hair was done in a mass of thin gold and black braids tied so taut that her scalp showed genevas was cropped short i told the girls who you are captain robinson explained using the title that was some years out of date and that youre going to ask them some questions about what happened geneva wants to get back to her school but i said shed have to wait i have some tests geneva said lakeesha tsked a sound through her white teeth robinson continued genevas parents are out of the country but theyre getting the next flight back her uncles been staying with her while theyve been away where are they rhyme asked your parents my fathers teaching a symposium at oxford hes a professor she nodded literature at hunter rhyme chided himself for being surprised that a young girl from harlem would have intellectual globetrotting parents he was angry for stereotyping but mostly piqued that hed made a flawed deduction true she was decked out like a gangsta but he mightve guessed she had academic roots shed been attacked during an earlymorning visit to a library not hanging out on the street corner or watching tv before school lakeesha fished a package of cigarettes out of her purse rhyme began theres no thom walked through the doorway smoking in here he lifted the pack away from the girl and stuffed it back into her bag unfazed that two teenagers had suddenly materialized on his watch thom smiled soft drinks you got coffee lakeesha asked i do yes thom glanced at jennifer robinson and rhyme who shook their heads i like it strong the big girl announced do you thom asked so do i to geneva anything for you the girl shook her head rhyme glanced longingly at the bottle of scotch sitting on a shelf nearby thom noticed and laughed the aide disappeared to rhymes distress patrolwoman robinson said ive got to get back to the house sir ah you do rhyme asked dismayed you sure you couldnt stay a little longer cant sir but you need anything else just gimme a call how about a babysitter rhyme didnt believe in fate but if he had he would have noted a deft jab here hed taken on the case to avoid the test at the hospital and now was being paid back for the deception by suffering through an immensely awkward half hour or so in the company of two high school girls young people were not his forte so long captain robinson walked out the door he muttered yeah thom returned a few minutes later with a tray he poured a cup of coffee for lakeesha and handed geneva a mug which rhyme smelled contained hot chocolate i took a guess youd like something anyway the aide said you dont want it you can leave it no thats fine thanks geneva stared at the hot surface took a sip another lowered the cup and gazed at the floor took several more sips youre all right rhyme asked geneva nodded i am too lakeesha said he attacked both of you rhyme asked naw not me lakeesha looked him over you like that actor broke his neck she slurped her coffee added more sugar slurped again thats right an you cant move nothin not much damn keesh geneva whispered chill girl just you know damn silence again only eight minutes had passed since theyd arrived it seemed like hours what should he do have thom run out and buy a board game there were of course questions that had to be asked but rhyme was reluctant to do so himself interviewing and interrogation were skills he didnt possess when he was on the force hed questioned suspects maybe a dozen times and had never had one of those ohjesus moments when the grillee broke down and confessed sachs on the other hand was a natural at the art she warned rookies that you could blow an entire case with a single wrong word she called it contaminating the mind the counterpart to rhymes numberone sin contaminating a crime scene lakeesha asked how you move round in that chair shhh geneva warned i only askin well dont aint no harm in asking nothin lakeesha had lost her skittishness completely now rhyme decided she was actually pretty savvy she acts uneasy at first making it seem like shes naive vulnerable that you have the advantage but all the while shes sizing things up once shes got a handle on the situation she knows whether or not to trot out the bluster in fact rhyme was thankful for something to make conversation about he explained about the ecu the environmental control unit how the touch pad under his left ring finger could direct the movement and speed of the wheelchair one finger keesha glanced at one of her orange nails that all you can move thats right other than my head and shoulders mr rhyme geneva said looking at a red swatch which sat large and obvious on her thin wrist about those tests the first ones in a couple of hours how longll this be school rhyme asked surprised oh you can stay home today im sure after what happened your teachersll understand well i dont really want to stay home i need to take the tests yo yo girl time out here the man say you can take a pass all one hundred percent phat and you sayin no come on that wack geneva looked up into her friends eyes and youre taking your tests too youre not skipping it aint skippin you got a pass the big girl pointed out with flawless logic rhymes phone rang and he was grateful for the interruption command answer phone he said into the handsfree microphone def lakeesha said lifting her eyebrows look at that gen i want one of them eyes narrowing geneva whispered something to her friend who rolled her eyes and slurped more coffee rhyme sachss voice said theyre here sachs rhyme said in a brittle voice geneva and her friend and im hoping youre rhyme she repeated it was a particular tone something was wrong what is it the scene was hot after all he was there yep never left or doubled back are you okay yeah it wasnt me he was after what happened got up close into an alley fired four shots he wounded a bystanderand he killed a witness his name was don barry he was in charge of the library at the museum he took three rounds in the heart died instantly youre sure the shooters the same yep the shoe prints i found from his shooting position match the ones in the library lon was just starting to interview him he was standing right in front of him when it happened he get a look at the doer nope nobody did he was hiding behind a dumpster couple of the uniforms on the scene went to work on the woman to save her she had a major bleeder he got away in the crowd just disappeared somebody take care of the details calling the next of kin details lon was going to make the calls but he had phone problems or something there was a sergeant on the scene he did it all right sachs come on back with what youve found command disconnect he looked up and found the two girls staring at him he explained it looks like the man who attacked you didnt leave after all or he came back he killed the head librarian and mr barry a gasp from geneva settle she stopped moving simply froze thats right shit lakeesha whispered she closed her eyes and shivered a moment later genevas mouth tightened and she looked down she set the cocoa on a table no no im sorry rhyme said was he a friend of yours she shook her head not really he was just helping me with my paper geneva sat forward in her chair but it doesnt matter if he was a friend or not hes dead thats so terrible she whispered angrily why why did he do it he was a witness id guess he could identify the man who attacked you so hes dead because of me rhyme muttered some words to her no how could it be her fault she didnt plan on being attacked it was just bad luck for barry wrong time wrong place but the reassurance had no effect on the girl her face grew taut her eyes cold rhyme didnt have a clue what to do next it wasnt enough that he had to endure the presence of teenagers now he had to comfort them get their minds off this tragedy he wheeled closer to the girls and pushed his patience to its limit by making small talk chapter five an endless twenty minutes later sachs and sellitto arrived at rhymes accompanied by a young blond patrol officer named pulaski sellitto explained that hed requisitioned the kid to cart the evidence back to rhymes and help with the investigation clearly a rookie he had eager written on his smooth forehead hed obviously been briefed about the criminalists disability he was overly oblivious to the fact that the man was paralyzed rhyme hated these fake reactions he infinitely preferred lakeeshas brashness just you know damn the two detectives greeted the girls pulaski looked them over sympathetically and asked in a kidfriendly voice how they were doing rhyme noted a nicked wedding ring on his finger and deduced a high school marriage only having children of your own could produce this kind of look lakeesha answered messed up is what i be bugginsome asshole tryin to bust up my girlfriend whatta you think geneva said she was doing all right i understand youre staying with a relative sachs asked my uncle hes living at our place till my folks get back from london rhyme happened to look at lon sellitto something was wrong hed changed dramatically in the past two hours the boisterous mood had vanished his eyes were spooked and he was fidgety rhyme noticed too that his fingers repeatedly touched a particular spot on his cheek hed rubbed it red get dinged by some lead rhyme asked recalling that the detective had been right next to the librarian when the perp had shot him maybe sellitto had been hit by a bullet fragment or bit of stone if a slug had passed through barry and struck a building what then sellitto realized hed been rubbing his skin and dropped his hand he said in a soft voice so the girls couldnt hear i was pretty close to the vic got spattered by some blood thats all nothing but a moment later he absently started the rubbing again the gesture reminded rhyme of sachs who had the habit of scratching her scalp and worrying her nails the compulsion came and went linked somehow to her drive her ambition the indefinable churning inside most cops police officers hurt themselves in a hundred different ways the harm ranged from the minor inflictions of sachss to destroying marriages and childrens spirits with harsh words to closing your lips around the tangy barrel of your service pistol hed never seen it in lon sellitto though geneva asked sachs there was no mistake mistake about dr barry im sorry no hes dead the girl was motionless rhyme could feel her sorrow anger too her eyes were black dots of fury then she looked at her watch said to rhyme those tests i mentioned well lets just get some questions out of the way and then well see sachs with the evidence now set out on the examining table and chain of custody cards completed sachs pulled up a chair beside rhyme and interviewed the girls she asked geneva exactly what had happened the girl explained shed been looking up an article in an old magazine when somebody came into the library shed heard hesitant footsteps then a laugh the voice of a man ending a conversation and the snap of a closing cell phone the girl squinted hey you know maybe what you could do is check out all the mobile companies in town see who was on the phone then rhyme gave a laugh thats a good thought but at any given moment in manhattan therere about fifty thousand cell phone calls in progress besides i doubt he was really on the phone he was frontin how you know that lakeesha asked furtively slipping two sticks of gum into her mouth i dont know it i suspect it like the laughing he was probably doing it to make geneva drop her guard you tend not to notice people on cell phones and you rarely think of them as being a threat geneva was nodding yeah i was kinda freaked when he first came into the library but when i heard him on the phone well i thought its rude to be talking on a phone in a library but i wasnt scared anymore what happened then sachs asked she explained that shed heard a second click she thought it sounded like a gun and saw a man in a ski mask she then told how shed dismantled the mannequin and dressed it in her own clothes that phat lakeesha offered proudly my sista here she smart she sure is rhyme thought i hid in the stacks till he walked to the microfiche reader then i ran for the fire door you didnt see anything else about him sachs asked no what color was the mask dark i dont know exactly other clothes i didnt see anything else really not that i remember i was pretty freaked im sure you were sachs said when you were hiding in the stacks were you looking in his direction so youd know when to run geneva frowned for a moment well yeah thats right i was looking i forgot about that i watched through the bottom shelves so i could run when he got close to my chair so maybe you saw a little more of him then oh you know i did i think he had brown shoes yeah brown sort of a lighter shade not dark brown good and what about his pants dark im pretty sure but thats all i could see just the cuffs you smell anything nowait maybe i did you know something sweet like flowers and then he came up to the chair and i heard this crack and then another couple of sounds something breaking the microfiche reader sachs said he smashed it by then i was running as fast as i could to the fire door i went down the stairs and when i got to the street i found keesh and we were going to run but i was thinking maybe he was going to hurt somebody else so i turned around and she looked at pulaski we saw you sachs asked lakeesha did you see the attacker nothin i was just chillin and then gen come up runnin all fast and buggin an everthing you know what im sayin i didnt see nothin rhyme asked sellitto the doer killed barry because he was a witness whatd he see he said he didnt see anything he gave me the names of the museums white male employees in case it was one of them therere two but they checked out one was taking his daughter to school at the time the other was in the main office people around him so an opportunistic perp sachs mused saw her go inside and went after her a museum rhyme asked odd choice sellitto asked both girls did you see anyone following you today lakeesha said we come down on the c train durin rush hour eighth avenue linebe all crowded and nasty couldnt see nobody weird you geneva shook her head how bout recently anybody hassling you hitting on you neither of them could think of anybody whod seemed to be a threat embarrassed geneva said not exactly a lot of stalkers coming round after me theyd be looking for a little more booty you know blingier blingier girl mean flashy translated lakeesha who obviously typified both booty and bling she frowned and glanced at geneva why you gotta go there girl dont be talkin trash bout yoself sachs looked at rhyme who was frowning whatre you thinking somethings not right lets go over the evidence while genevas here there might be some things that she can help explain the girl shook her head that test she held up her watch this wont take long rhyme said geneva looked at her friend you can just make it to study period ima stay with you i cant be sittin for all them hours in class worryin bout you and everthing geneva gave a wry laugh no way girl she asked rhyme you dont need her do you he glanced at sachs who shook her head sellitto jotted down her address and phone number well call you if we have any more questions take a pass girl she said just kick it an stay home ill see you at school geneva said firmly youll be there then lifted an eyebrow word two loud snaps of gum a sigh word at the door the girl paused and turned back said to rhyme yo mister how long fo you get outa that chair no one said anything to fill the awkward moment awkward to everyone rhyme supposed but himself itll probably be a long time he said to her man that suck yeah rhyme said sometimes it does she headed into the hall toward the front door they heard damn watch it dude the outer door slammed mel cooper entered the room looking back at the spot where hed nearly been run down by a teenager who outweighed him by fifty pounds okay he said to no one im not going to ask he pulled off his green windbreaker and nodded a greeting to everyone the slim balding man had been working as a forensic scientist for an upstate new york police department some years ago when hed politely but insistently told rhyme then head of nypd forensics that one of his analyses was wrong rhyme had far more respect for people who pointed out mistakes than for sycophants provided of course they were correct which cooper had been rhyme had immediately started a campaign to get the man to new york city a challenge at which he ultimately succeeded cooper was a born scientist but even more important he was a born forensic scientist which is very different its often thought that forensic refers to crime scene work but in fact the word means any aspect of debating issues in courts of law to be a successful criminalist you have to translate raw facts into a form thatll be useful to the prosecutor its not enough for instance to simply determine the presence of nux vomica plant materials at a suspected crime scene many of which are used for such innocuous medical purposes as treating ear inflammations a true forensic scientist like mel cooper would know instantly that those same materials produce the deadly alkaloid poison strychnine cooper had the trappings of a computergame nerd he lived with his mother still wore madras shirts with chinos and had a woody allen physique but looks were deceiving coopers longtime girlfriend was a tall gorgeous blonde together they would sail in unison across ballroom floors in dance competitions in which they were often top champions recently theyd taken up skeet shooting and winemaking to which cooper was meticulously applying principles of chemistry and physics rhyme briefed him on the case and they turned to the evidence rhyme said lets look at the pack donning latex gloves cooper glanced at sachs who pointed out the paper bag containing the rape pack he opened it over a large piece of newsprint to catch bits of ambient trace and extracted the bag it was a thin plastic sack no store logo was printed on it only a large yellow smiley face the tech now opened the bag then paused he said i smell something a deep inhalation flowery what is that cooper carried the bag to rhyme and he smelled it there was something familiar about the fragrance but he couldnt decide what geneva yes is that what you smelled back in the library she sniffed yeah thats it sachs said jasmine i think its jasmine on the chart rhyme announced what chart cooper asked looking around in each of his cases rhyme made whiteboard charts of evidence found at crime scenes and profiles of the perps start one he ordered and we need to call him something somebody give me a name no one had any inspiration rhyme said no time to be creative october ninth today right tennine so hell be unsub oneohnine thom we need your elegant handwriting no need to butter up the aide said as he stepped into the room with another coffeepot unsub oneohnine evidence and profile charts hes a white male height geneva said i dont know everybodys tall to me six feet id guess you seem observant well go with that weight not too big or small she fell quiet for a moment troubled about dr barrys weight sellitto said make it one eighty age i dont know i couldnt see his face voice i didnt pay any attention average i guess rhyme continued and light brown shoes dark slacks dark ski mask a pack in a bag that smells of jasmine he smells of it too soap or lotion maybe pack thom asked what do you mean rape pack geneva said a glance at rhyme you dont need to sugarcoat anything for me if thats what you were doing fair enough rhyme nodded at her lets keep going he noticed sachss face turn dark as she watched cooper pick up the bag whats wrong the smiley face on a rape pack bag what kind of sick assholed do that he was perplexed by her anger you realize that its good news he used that dont you sachs good news it limits the number of stores we have to search for not as easy as a bag with an individuated logo on it but better than unprinted plastic i suppose she said grimacing but still wearing latex gloves mel cooper looked through the bag he took out the tarot card first it showed a man hanging upside down by his foot from a scaffold beams of light radiated from his head his face was oddly passive he didnt seem to be in pain above him was the roman numeral for twelve xii mean anything to you rhyme asked geneva she shook her head cooper mused some kind of ritual or cult thing sachs said got a thought she pulled out her cell phone placed a call rhyme deduced that the person shed spoken to would be arriving soon i called a specialist about the card good cooper examined the card for prints and found none nor was any helpful trace revealed what else was in the bag rhyme asked okay the tech replied weve got a brandnew roll of duct tape a box cutter trojan condoms nothing traceable andbingo cooper held up a little slip of paper a receipt rhyme wheeled closer and looked it over there was no store name the slip had been printed by an adding machine the ink was faded wont tell us very much pulaski said then seemed to think he shouldnt be talking what was he doing here rhyme wondered oh thats right helping sellitto sorry to differ rhyme said stridently tells us a lot he bought all the items in the pack at one store you can compare the receipt to the price tags well along with something else he bought for five ninetyfive that wasnt in the bag maybe the tarot deck so weve got a store that sells duct tape box cutters and condoms got to be a variety store or variety drugstore we know its not a chain because theres no logo on the bag or receipt and its lowbudget since it only has cash drawers not computerized registers not to mention the cheap prices and the sales tax tells us that the store is in he squinted as he compared the subtotal on the receipt with the amount of tax goddamnit who knows math whats the percentage cooper said ive got a calculator geneva glanced at the receipt eight point six two five howd you do that sachs asked i just kind of can she said rhyme repeated eight point six two five thats the combined new york state and city sales tax puts the store in one of the five boroughs a glance at pulaski so patrolman still think its not very revealing got it sir im decommissioned sir isnt necessary all right print everything and lets see what we can find me the rookie asked uncertainly no them cooper and sachs used a variety of techniques to raise prints on the evidence fluorescent powder ardrox spray and superglue fumes on slick surfaces iodine vapor and ninhydrin on porous some of which raised prints by themselves while others displayed the results under an alternative light source looking up at the team through his large orange goggles the tech reported prints on the receipt prints on the merchandise theyre all the same only the thing is theyre small too small to be from a sixfoottall man a petite woman or a teenage girl the clerks id say i see smudges too id guess the unsub wiped his own off while it was difficult to remove all the oils and residue left by human fingers prints could be obliterated easily by a brief rubbing run what youve got through iafis cooper lifted copies of the prints and scanned them ten minutes later the fbis integrated automated fingerprint identification system had verified that the prints did not belong to anyone on file in the major databases city state and federal cooper also sent them to some of the local databases that werent linked to the fbis system shoes rhyme announced sachs produced the electrostatic print the tread marks were worn so the shoes were old size eleven cooper announced there was a loose correlation between foot size and bone structure and height though it was tenuous as circumstantial evidence in court still the size suggested that geneva had probably been right in her assessment that the man was around six feet tall what about a brand cooper ran the image through the departments shoetread database and came up with a match bassbrand shoes walkers at least three years old they discontinued this model that year rhyme said the tread wear tells us he has a slightly turned out right foot but no noticeable limp and no serious bunions ingrown nails or other malades des pieds i didnt know you spoke french lincoln cooper said only to the extent it helped an investigation this particular phrase had come about when he was running the missingrightshoes case and had spoken on a number of occasions to a french cop whats the trace situation cooper was poring over the evidence collection bags containing the tiny particles that had adhered to sachss trace collector which was a sticky roller like the kind for removing lint and pet hair rollers had replaced dustbuster vacuum cleaners as the collector of choice for fiber hair and dry residue wearing the magnifiers again the tech used fine tweezers to pick up materials he prepared a slide and placed it under the microscope then adjusted the magnification and focus simultaneously the image popped up on several flatscreen computer monitors around the room rhyme turned his chair and examined the images closely he could see flecks that appeared to be bits of dust several fibers white puffy objects and what looked like tiny amber shells shed by insects exoskeletons when cooper moved the stage of the scope some small balls of spongy offwhite fibrous material were visible where did this come from sachs looked over the tag two sources the floor near the table where geneva was sitting and beside the dumpster where he was standing when he shot barry trace evidence in a public place was often useless because there were so many chances for strangers unconnected to the crime to shed material but similar trace being found in two separate locations where the perp had been suggested strongly that it had been left by him thank you lord rhyme muttered for thy wisdom in creating deeptread shoes sachs and thom glanced at each other wondering about my good mood rhyme asked continuing to stare at the screen was that the reason for the sidelong look i can be cheerful sometimes you know blue moon the aide muttered cliché alert lon you catch that one now back to the trace we know he shed it what is it and can it lead us to his den forensic scientists confront a pyramidshaped task in analyzing evidence the initial and usually easiest job is to identify a substance finding that a brown stain for instance is blood and whether its human or animal or that a piece of lead is a bullet fragment the second task is to classify that sample that is put it in a subcategory like determining that the blood is o positive that the bullet that shed the fragment was a learning that evidence falls into a particular class may have some value to police and prosecutors if the suspect can be linked to evidence in a similar class his shirt has a typeopositive bloodstain on it he owns a though that connection isnt conclusive the final task and the ultimate goal of all forensic scientists is to individuate the evidence unquestionably link this particular bit of evidence to a single location or human being the dna from the blood on the suspects shirt matches that of the victim the bullet has a unique mark that could be made only by his gun the team was now low on this forensic pyramid the strands for instance were fibers of some sort they knew but more than a thousand different fibers were made in the united states annually and over seven thousand different types of pigments were used to color them still the team could narrow down the field coopers analysis revealed that the fibers shed by the killer were plant based rather than animal or mineral and they were thick im betting its cotton rope rhyme suggested cooper nodded as he read through a database of vegetablebased fibers yep thats it generic though no manufacturer one fiber contained no pigments but the other had a staining agent of some kind it was brown and cooper thought the stain might be blood a test with the phenolphthalein presumptive blood test revealed that it was his sellitto wondered who knows cooper responded continuing to examine the sample but its definitely human with the compression and fractured ends id speculate the ropes a garrotte weve seen that before it could be this was the intended murder weapon his blunt object would be simply to subdue his victim rather than to kill her its hard messy work beating someone to death he also had the gun but that would be too loud to use if you wanted to keep the murder quiet in order to escape a garrotte made sense geneva sighed mr rhyme my test test at school oh sure just a minutei want to know what kind of bug that exoskeletons from rhyme continued officer sachs said to pulaski yes mdetective how bout you help us out here sure thing cooper printed out a color image of the bit of exoskeleton and handed it to the rookie sachs sat him down in front of one of the computers and typed in commands to get into the departments insect database the nypd was one of the few police departments in the world that had not only an extensive library of insect information but a forensic entomologist on staff after a brief pause the screen began to fill with thumbnail images of insect parts man therere a lot of them you know ive never actually done this before he squinted as the files flipped past sachs stifled a smile not exactly like csi is it she asked just scroll through slowly and look for something you think matches slow is the key word rhyme said more mistakes in forensic analysis occur because technicians rush than because of any other cause i didnt know that sachs said and now you do chapter six gc those white blobs there rhyme ordered what the hell are they mel cooper lifted several samples off the tape and ran them through the gas chromatographmass spectrometer the workhorse instrument in all forensic labs it separates unknown trace into its component parts and then identifies them the results would take fifteen minutes or so and while they waited for the analysis cooper pieced together the bullet the emergency room doctor had removed from the leg of the woman whom the killer had shot sachs had reported the gun had to be a revolver not an automatic since there were no brass cartridges ejected at the scene of the shooting outside the museum oh thesere nasty cooper said softly examining the fragments with a pair of tweezers the guns small a but theyre magnum rounds good rhyme said he was pleased because the powerful magnum version of the rimfire caliber bullet was rare ammunition and therefore would be easier to trace the fact that the gun was a revolver made it rarer still which meant they should be able to find the manufacturer easily sachs who was a competitive pistol shooter didnt even need to look it up north american arms is the only one i know of their black widow model maybe but id guess the minimaster its got a fourinch barrel thats more accurate and he grouped those shots real tight rhyme asked the tech who was poring over the examination board whatd you mean by nasty take a look rhyme sachs and sellitto moved forward cooper was pushing around bits of bloodstained metal with the tweezers looks like he made them himself explosive rounds no almost as bad maybe worse the outer shell of the bullets thin lead inside the slug was filled with these there were a half dozen tiny needles about threeeighths of an inch long upon impact the bullet would shatter and the pins would tumble in a v pattern throughout the body though the slugs were small theyd do far more damage than regular rounds they werent designed to stop an attacker their purpose was solely to destroy internal tissue and without the numbing effect of a largecaliber slugs impact these shells would result in agonizing wounds lon sellitto shook his head eyes fixed on the needles and scratched the invisible stain on his face probably thinking how close hed come to being hit with one of these slugs jesus he muttered his voice broke and he cleared his throat laughed to cover it up and walked away from the table curiously the lieutenants reaction was more troubled than the girls geneva didnt seem to pay much attention to the details of her attackers gruesome rounds she glanced again at her watch and slouched impatiently cooper scanned the largest pieces of the bullet and ran the information about the slugs through ibis the integrated ballistics identification system which nearly a thousand police departments around the country subscribe to as well as the fbis drugfire system these huge databases can match a slug fragments or brass casing to bullets or weapons on file a gun found on a suspect today for instance can quickly be matched to a bullet recovered from a victim five years ago the results on these slugs though came back negative the needles themselves appeared to have been broken off the end of sewing needles the sort you could buy anywhere untraceable never easy is it cooper muttered at rhymes direction he also searched for registered owners of minimasters and the smaller black widows in magnum and came back with nearly a thousand owners none of whom had criminal records stores arent required by law to keep records of who buys ammunition and therefore they never did for the time being the weapon was a dead end pulaski rhyme shouted whats with the bug the exoskeleton is that what you called it thats what you mean sir right right right what about it no matches yet what exactly is an exoskeleton rhyme didnt answer he glanced at the screen and saw that the young man was only a small way into the hemiptera order of insects he had a long way to go keep at it the gcms computer beeped it had completed its analysis of the white blobs on the screen was a peakandvalley chart below which was a block of text cooper leaned forward and said weve got curcumin demethoxycurcumin bisdemethoxycurcumin volatile oil amino acids lysine and tryptophan theronine and isoleucine chloride various other trace proteins and large proportion of starches oils triglycerides sodium polysaccharidesnever seen that combination the gcms was miraculous in isolating and identifying substances but not necessarily so great in telling you what they added up to rhyme was often able to deduce common substances like gasoline or explosives just from a list of their ingredients but these were new to him he cocked his head and began to categorize those substances in the list that as a scientist he knew would logically be found together and which would not the curcumin its compounds and the polysaccharides obviously fit together obviously was the wry response of amelia sachs who used to ditch science class in high school to go drag racing well call that substance one then the amino acids other proteins starches and triglycerides theyre often found together too well call them substance two the chloride poison right asked pulaski and sodium muttered rhyme are most likely salt a glance at the rookie dangerous only in the case of people with high blood pressure or if youre a garden slug the kid turned back to the insect database so with the amino acids and starches and oils im thinking substance two is a food salty food go online mel and find out what the hell curcumin is in cooper did youre right its a vegetable dye used in food products usually found in connection with those other items in substance one volatile oils too what sort of food products hundreds of them how bout some forinstances cooper began to read from a lengthy list but rhyme interrupted hold on is popcorn on the list lets seeyeah it is rhyme turned and called to pulaski you can stop stop its not an exoskeleton its a shell from a popcorn kernel salt and oil and popcorn shouldve figured that one out up front damnit it was a cheerful expletive nonetheless on the chart thom our boy likes junk food should i write that of course not he could hate popcorn maybe he works in a popcorn factory or movie theater just add popcorn rhyme looked at the chart now lets find out about that other trace the offwhite stuff cooper ran another gcms test the results indicated that it was sucrose and uric acid the acids concentrated the tech said the sugars pure no other foodstuffs and the crystalline structures unique ive never seen it milled like that rhyme was troubled by this news send it to the fbis bomb people bomb sellitto asked rhyme said havent been reading my book hmmm no the big detective shot back ive been busy catching bad guys touché but itd be helpful to at least take a look at the headings from time to time as in homemade explosive devices sugars often an ingredient mix it with sodium nitrate and youve got a smoke bomb with permanganate its a low explosive which can still do a lot of damage if you pack it into a pipe im not sure how the uric acid figures but the bureaus got the best database in the world theyll tell us the fbis lab is available to handle evidence analysis for state and local law enforcers at no charge provided that the requesting agency agrees to two things to accept the fbis results as final and to show them to the defendants lawyer because of the bureaus generosity and its talent the agents are inundated with requests for assistance they run more than analyses a year even new york s finest would stand in line like everyone else to get this bit of sugar analyzed but lincoln rhyme had an in fred dellray a special agent in the fbis manhattan office often worked with rhyme and sellitto and he carried a lot of weight in the bureau equally important was the fact that rhyme had helped the fbi set up its pert system the physical evidence response team sellitto called dellray who was presently on the task force checking out those reports of potential terrorist bombings in new york dellray got on the horn to fbi hq in washington dc and within minutes a technician had been recruited to help on the unsub case cooper sent him the results of the analyses and compressed digital images of the substance via secure email no more than ten minutes passed before the phone rang command answer rhyme snapped into his voice recognition control system detective rhyme please thiss rhyme im examiner phillips down on ninth street washingtons ninth street he meant fbi headquarters what do you have for us rhyme asked briskly and thanks for calling back so fast sachs said quickly she sometimes had to run interference for rhymes bluntness no worries maam well i was thinking it was pretty odd what you sent down so i sent it to materials analysis that did the trick weve got a ninetyseven percent certainty as to the substance how dangerous was the explosive rhyme wondered he said go ahead what is it cotton candy that wasnt a street name he knew but there were a number of newgeneration explosives that had detonation rates of thirty thousand feet per second ten times the speed of a bullet was this one of those he asked whatre its properties a pause it tastes good whats that its sweet it tastes good rhyme asked you mean its real cotton candy like youd find at a fair yeah whatd you think i meant never mind sighing the criminalist asked and the uric acid was from his shoe when he stepped in some dog pee on the sidewalk cant say where he stepped on it the examiner said displaying the precision the bureau was known for but the sample does test positive for canine urine he thanked the man and disconnected he turned to the team popcorn and cotton candy on his shoes at the same time rhyme mused whered that put him ball game the new york teams havent played at home lately im thinking maybe our unsub walked through a neighborhood where thered been a fair or carnival in the past day or so he asked geneva did you go to any fairs recently could he have seen you there me no i dont really go to fairs rhyme said to pulaski since youre off bug detail patrolman call whoever you need to and find out every permit thats been issued for a fair carnival festival religious feast whatever im on it the rookie said what else do we have rhyme asked flakes from the carriage of the microfiche reader where he hit it with the blunt object flakes bits of varnish id guess from whatever he used okay run them through maryland the fbi had a huge database of current and past paint samples located in one of its maryland facilities this was mostly used for matching paint evidence to cars but there were hundreds of samples of varnish as well after another call from dellray cooper sent the gcms composition analysis and other data on the lacquer flakes off to the bureau within a few minutes the phone rang and this fbi examiner reported that the varnish matched a product sold exclusively to manufacturers of martial arts equipment like nunchakus and security batons he added the discouraging news that the substance contained no manufacturers markers and was sold in large quantities meaning it was virtually untraceable okay weve got a rapist with a nunchaku funky bullets a bloody ropeman is a walking nightmare the doorbell rang and a moment later thom ushered in a woman in her twenties his arm around her shoulders look whos here the aide announced the slim woman had spiky purple hair and a pretty face her stretch pants and sweater revealed an athletic body actually a performers body rhyme knew kara rhyme said good to see you again i deduce youre the specialist sachs called hi the young woman hugged sachs greeted the others and closed her hands around rhymes sachs introduced her to geneva who looked her over with a reserved face kara it was a stage name she wouldnt reveal her real one was an illusionist and performance artist who had helped rhyme and sachs as a consultant in a recent murder case where a killer used his skills as a magician and sleightofhand artist to get close to victims murder them and get away she lived in greenwich village but had been visiting her mother in a care facility uptown when sachs had called she explained they spent a few moments catching up kara was putting together a onewoman show for the performance warehouse in soho and was dating an acrobat then rhyme said we need some expertise you bet the young woman said whatever i can do sachs explained about the case she frowned and whispered im sorry to geneva when she heard about the attempted rape the student just shrugged he had this with him cooper said holding up the hanged man tarot card from the rape pack we thought you could tell us something about it kara had explained to rhyme and sachs that the world of magic was divided into two camps those who were entertainers who made no claim to having supernatural skills and those who asserted they had occult powers kara had no patience for the latter she was solely a performer but because of her experience working in magic stores for rent and food money she knew something about fortunetelling she explained okay tarots an old method of divining that goes back to ancient egypt the tarot deck of cardsre divided into the minor arcana they correspond to the fiftytwocard playing deck and the major arcana zero through twentyone they sort of represent a journey through life the hanged mans the twelfth card in the major arcana she shook her head but something doesnt make sense whats that sellitto asked subtly rubbing his skin its not a bad card at all look at the picture he does look pretty peaceful sachs said considering hes hanging upside down the figure in the pictures based on the norse god odin he hung upside down for nine days on a search for inner knowledge you get this card in a reading it means youre about to start a quest for spiritual enlightenment she nodded at a computer you mind cooper waved her to it she typed a google search and a few seconds later found a website how do i print this out sachs helped her and a moment later a sheet rolled out of the laser printer cooper taped it up on the evidence board thats the meaning she said the hanged man does not refer to someone being punished its appearance in a reading indicates spiritual searching leading to a decision a transition a change of direction the card often foretells a surrendering to experience ending a struggle accepting what is when this card appears in your reading you must listen to your inner self even if that message seems to be contrary to logic kara said it has nothing to do with violence or death its about being spiritually suspended and waiting she shook her head its not the kind of thing a killer would leave if he knew anything at all about tarot cards if hed wanted to leave something destructive it wouldve been the tower or one of the cards from the sword suit in the minor arcana thosere bad news so he picked it only because it looked scary rhyme summarized and because he planned to garrotte or hang geneva thats what id guess thats helpful rhyme said sachs too thanked her i should get back have to rehearse kara shook genevas hand hope things work out okay for you thanks kara walked to the door she stopped and looked at geneva you like illusion and magic shows i dont get out too much the girl said pretty busy in school well im doing a show in three weeks if youre interested all the details are on the ticket the ticket i dont have a ticket yes you do kara said its in your purse oh and the flower with it consider it a good luck charm she left and they heard the door close whats she talking about geneva asked looking down at her purse which was closed sachs laughed open it up she unzipped the top and blinked in surprise sitting just inside was a ticket to one of karas performances next to it was a pressed violet how did she do that geneva whispered weve never quite been able to catch her rhyme said all we know is shes pretty damn good man ill say the student held up the dried purple flower the criminalists eyes slipped to the tarot card as cooper taped it to the evidence board next to its meaning so it seems like the sort of thing a killer would leave in an occult assault but he didnt have a clue what it was he picked it for effect so that means but his voice faded as he stared at the rest of the evidence chart jesus the others looked at him what cooper asked weve got it all wrong taking a break from rubbing his face sellitto asked whatta you mean look at the prints on what was in the rape pack he wiped his own off right yeah cooper confirmed but there are prints the criminalist offered and theyre probably the clerks since theyre the same thatre on the receipt right sellitto shrugged so so he wiped his prints before he got to the cash register while he was in the store silence in the room irritated that nobody caught on the criminalist continued because he wanted the clerks prints on everything sachs understood he meant to leave the rape pack behind so wed find it pulaski was nodding otherwise hed just have wiped everything after he got it home exactly rhyme said with a hint of triumph in his voice i think it was staged evidence to make us think it was a rape with some kind of occult overtones okay okay lets step back rhyme was amused at pulaskis uneasy glance at rhymes legs when the criminalist used the expression an attacker tracks down geneva in a public museum not the typical setting for sexual assault then he hits her well the mannequin hard enough to kill her if not knock her out for hours if thats the case then whats he need the box cutter and duct tape for and he leaves a tarot card he thinks is scary but is really just about spiritual searching no it wasnt an attempted rape at all whats he up to then sellitto asked thats what we damn well better find out rhyme thought for a moment then asked and you said that dr barry didnt see anything thats what he told me sellitto replied but the unsub still comes back and kills him rhyme frowned and mr oneohnine broke up the microfiche reader hes a pro but tantrumsre very unpro his vics getting away hes not going to waste time thumpin on things because hes having a bad morning rhyme asked the girl you said you were reading some old newspaper magazine she corrected on the microfiche reader right those rhyme nodded at a large plastic evidence bag containing a box of microfiche trays that sachs had brought back from the library two slots carriages one and three were empty geneva looked at the box she nodded yeah those were the ones that had the article i was reading the missing ones did you get the one that was in the reader sachs replied there wasnt one he mustve taken it with him and smashed the machine so we wouldnt notice that the tray was gone oh this is getting interesting what was he up to what the hell was his motive sellitto laughed i thought you didnt care about motive only evidence you need to draw the distinction lon between using motive to prove a case in court which is speculation at best and using motive to lead you to the evidence which conclusively convicts a perp a man kills his business partner with a gun that we trace to his garage loaded with bullets he bought per a receipt with his fingerprints on it in that case who cares if he killed the partner because he thinks a talking dog told him to or because the guy was sleeping with his wife the evidence makes the case but what if there are no bullets gun receipt or tire tracks then a perfectly valid question is why was the vic killed answering that can point us toward the evidence that will convict him sorry for the lecture he added with no apology in his voice good mood gone is it thom asked rhyme grumbled im missing something here and i dont like it geneva was frowning rhyme noticed and asked what well i was thinkingdr barry said that somebody else was interested in the same issue of that magazine that i was he wanted to read it but dr barry told him hed have to wait until i was through with it did he say who no rhyme considered this so lets speculate the librarian tells this somebody that youre interested in the magazine the unsub wants to steal it and he wants to kill you because youve read it or will read it the criminalist wasnt convinced this was the situation of course but one of the things that made him so successful was his willingness to consider bold sometimes farfetched theories and he took the one article you were reading right the girl nodded it was like he knew exactly what to look for what was it about nothing important just this ancestor of mine my teachers into all this roots stuff and we had to write about somebody in our past who was he this ancestor my greatgreatgreatwhatever a freed slave i went to the museum last week and found out there was an article about him in this issue of coloreds weekly illustrated they didnt have it in the library but mr barry said hed get the microfiche from storage it just came in what was the story about specifically rhyme persisted she hesitated then said impatiently charles singleton my ancestor was a slave in virginia his master had this change of heart and he freed all of his slaves and because charles and his wife had been with the family for so long and had taught their children to read and write their master gave them a farm in new york state charles was a soldier in the civil war he came back home afterwards and in eighteen sixtyeight he got accused of stealing some money from a black educational fund thats all the article in the magazine was about id just gotten to the part where he jumped into the river to escape from the police when that man showed up rhyme noted that she spoke well but held on to her words tightly as if they were squirming puppies trying to escape with educated parents on one side and homegirl friends like lakeesha on the other it was only natural that the girl suffered from some linguistic multiple personality so you dont know what happened to him sachs asked geneva shook her head i think we have to assume that the unsub had some interest in what you were researching who knew what the topic of your paper was your teacher i assume no i never told him specifically i dont think i told anybody but lakeesha she mightve mentioned it to somebody but i doubt it assignments dont take up a lot of her attention you know what im saying not even her own last week i went to this law office in harlem to see if they had any old records about crimes in the eighteen hundreds but i didnt tell the lawyer there very much of course dr barry wouldve known and he wouldve mentioned it to that other person who was interested in the magazine too rhyme pointed out now just for the sake of argument lets assume theres something in that article that the unsub doesnt want known maybe about your ancestor maybe something else entirely a glance at sachs anybody still at the scene a portable have em canvass the employees see if barry mentioned that somebody was interested in that old magazine have them go through his desk too rhyme had another thought and i want his phone records for the past month sellitto shook his head linc reallythiss sounding pretty thin dont you think were talking what the eighteen hundreds this isnt a cold case its a frozen one a pro who staged a scene nearly killed one person and did kill another right in front of a half dozen cops just to steal that article thats not thin lon thats got searchlights all over it the big cop shrugged and called the precinct to relay the order to the cop still on duty at the crime scene and then called warrants to have them issue a phone record subpoena on the museums and barrys personal phones rhyme looked over the slim girl and decided that he had no choice he had to deliver the tough news you know what all this might mean dont you a pause though he could see in sachss troubled glance at geneva that the policewoman at least knew exactly what it meant it was she who said to the girl lincolns saying that its likely that hes probably still after you thats wack geneva settle offered shaking her head after a pause rhyme replied solemnly im afraid its anything but sitting at the internet access station in a quickcopy shop in downtown manhattan thompson boyd was reading through the local tv station website which updated news every few minutes the headline of the article he read was museum official murdered witness in assault on student whistling almost silently he examined the accompanying picture which showed the library director hed just killed talking to a uniformed policeman on the street in front of the museum the caption read dr donald barry speaks with police shortly before he was shot to death because of her age geneva settle wasnt identified by name though she was described as a high school student living in harlem thompson was grateful for that information he hadnt known which borough of the city she lived in he hooked his phone to the usb port on the computer and transferred the picture hed taken of the girl this he then uploaded to an anonymous email account he logged off paid for his time in cash of course and strolled along lower broadway in the heart of the financial district he bought a coffee from a vendor drank half of it then slipped the microfiche plates hed stolen into the cup replaced the lid and dropped them into a trash basket he paused at a phone kiosk looked around and saw no one was paying him any attention he dialed a number there was no outgoing message from the voice mail service only a beep me problem with the settle situation i need you to find out where she goes to school or where she lives shes a high school student in harlem thats all i know ive sent a picture of her to your account oh one thing if you get a chance to take care of her yourself theres another fifty thousand in it for you give me a call when you get this message well talk about it thompson recited the number of the phone where he stood then hung up he stepped back crossed his arms and waited whistling softly hed gotten through only three bars of stevie wonders you are the sunshine of my life before the phone started to ring chapter seven the criminalist looked at sellitto wheres roland bell he delivered somebody into witness protection upstate but he should be back by now think we should give him a call yes rhyme said sellitto called the detectives mobile phone and from the conversation rhyme deduced that bell would leave police plaza immediately and head uptown rhyme noticed geneva s frown detective bell s just going to look out for you like a bodyguard until we get everything sorted outnow do you have any idea what charles was accused of stealing the article said gold or money or something missing gold ah thats interesting greed one of your better motives would your uncle know anything about it sachs asked her my uncle oh no hes my mothers brother charles was from my fathers side of the family and dad just knew a few things my greataunt gave me a few letters of charless but she didnt know anything more about him where are they those letters rhyme asked i have one with me she fished in her purse and pulled it out and the othersre at home my aunt thought she might have some more boxes of charless things but she wasnt sure where they were geneva fell silent as the brows in her dark round face furrowed and she said to sachs one thing if its helpful go ahead sachs said i remember from one of the letters charles talked about this secret he had secret sachs asked yeah he said it bothered him not to be able to reveal the truth but thered be a disaster a tragedy if he did something like that maybe it was the theft he was talking about rhyme said geneva stiffened i dont think he did it i think he was framed why rhyme asked a shrug read the letter the girl started to hand it to rhyme then caught herself and gave it to mel cooper unapologetic about the faux pas the tech placed it in an optical reader and a moment later the elegantly scripted words from the nineteenth century were scrolling across flatscreen monitors from the twentyfirst mrs violet singleton in care of mr mrs william dodd essex farm road harrisburg pennsylvania july my dearest violet news has surely reached you of the terrible events in new york of late i can now report that peace has returned but the cost was great the climate here has been incendiary with hundreds of thousands of less fortunate citizens still reeling from the economic panic of several years ago mr greeleys tribune reported that unconscionable stock speculation and imprudent lending had led to the bursting bubbles of the worlds financial markets in this atmosphere it took merely a small spark to ignite the recent rioting the order to draft men into the federal army which was acknowledged by many to be necessary in our fight against the rebels owing to the enemys surprising strength and resilience still the opposition to the draft was sturdier and more deadly than any had anticipated and we coloreds abolitionists and republicans became the target of their hate as much as the conscription provost and his men if not more so rioters largely irishmen swept through the city attacking any colored they might see sacking houses and places of work i had by happenstance been in the company of two teachers and the director of the colored childrens orphanage when a mob attacked the building and set it aflame why more than children were inside with gods help we were able to lead the little ones to safety at a nearby police station but the rioters would have killed us all if they had had their way fighting continued throughout the day that evening the lynchings began after one negro was hanged his body was set on fire and the rioters danced around it in drunken revels i was aghast i have now fled to our farm up north and will henceforth keep my attention fixed on my mission of educating children in our school working the orchard and furthering however i can the cause of freedom of our people my dearest wife in the aftermath of these terrible events life to me seems precarious and fleeting and if you are inclined to the journey it is my desire that you and our son now join me i am enclosing herewith tickets for you both and ten dollars for expenses i will meet your train in new jersey and we will take a boat up the river to our farm you can assist me in teaching and joshua can continue his studies and help us and james in the cider mill and shop should anyone ask your business and destination respond as do i say only that we are caretakers of the farm tending it for master trilling in his absence seeing the hatred in the eyes of the rioters has brought home to me the fact that nowhere is safe and even in our idyllic locale arson theft and pillaging might very likely ensue should it be learned that the owners of the farm are negroes i have come from a place where i was held in captivity and considered to be merely a threefifths man i had hoped that moving north would change this but alas that is not yet the case the tragic events of the past few days tell me that you and i and those of our kind are not yet treated as whole men and women and our battle to achieve wholeness in the eyes of others must continue with unflagging determination my warmest regards to your sister and william as well as their children of course tell joshua i am proud of his achievement in the subject of geography i live for the day now soon i pray when i will see you and our son once again yours in love charles geneva took the letter off the optical scanner she looked up and said the civil war draft riots of worst civil disturbance in us history he doesnt say anything about his secret rhyme pointed out thats in one of the letters i have at home i was showing you this so youd know he wasnt a thief rhyme frowned but the theft was what five years after he wrote that why do you think that means hes not guilty my point geneva said is that he doesnt sound like a thief does he not somebody whos going to steal from an education trust for former slaves rhyme said simply thats not proof i think it is the girl looked over the letter again smoothed it with her hand whats that threefifthsman thing sellitto asked rhyme recalled something from american history but unless information was relevant to his career as a criminalist he discarded it as useless clutter he shook his head geneva explained before the civil war slaves were counted as threefifths of a person for the purpose of representation in congress it wasnt an evil confederate conspiracy like youd think the north came up with that rule they didnt want slaves counted at all because that would give the south more representatives in congress and the electoral college the south wanted them counted as full people the threefifths rule was a compromise they were counted for representation thom pointed out but they still couldnt vote oh of course not geneva said just like women by the way sachs added the social history of america wasnt of any interest to rhyme at the moment id like to see the other letters and i want to find another copy of that magazine coloreds weekly illustrated what issue july twentythird geneva said but ive had a tough time finding it ill do my best mel cooper said and rhyme heard the railroad track clatter of his fingers on the keyboard geneva was looking at her battered swatch i really hey yall a mans voice called from the doorway wearing a brown tweed sports coat blue shirt and jeans detective roland bell walked into the lab a law enforcer in his native north carolina bell had moved to new york a few years ago for personal reasons he had a flop of brown hair gentle eyes and was so easygoing that his urban coworkers sometimes felt a stab of impatience working with him though rhyme suspected the reason he sometimes moved slowly wasnt southern heritage at all but his meticulous nature owing to the importance of his job within the nypd bells specialty was protecting witnesses and other potential victims his operation wasnt an official unit in the nypd but it still had a name swat this wasnt the traditional weapons and tactics acronym though it was short for saving the witnesss ass team roland this is geneva settle hey there miss he drawled and shook her hand i dont need a bodyguard she said firmly dont you worry i wont get in your way bell said you got my word of honor on that ill stay as outa sight as a tick in tall grass a glance at sellitto now whatre we up against here the heavyset detective ran through the details of the case and what they knew so far bell didnt frown or shake his head but rhyme could see his eyes go still which signaled his concern but when sellitto was done bell put on his downhome face again and asked geneva a number of questions about herself and her family to give him an idea of how to set up the protection detail she answered hesitatingly as if she begrudged the effort finally bell was finished and geneva said impatiently i really have to go could somebody drive me home ill get charless letters for you but then i have to go to school detective bellll take you home rhyme said then added with a laugh but about school i thought wed agreed youd take the day off take a makeup no she said firmly i didnt agree to that you said lets just get some questions out of the way and then well see not many people quoted lincoln rhymes words back at him he grumbled whatever i said i think youll have to stay home now that we know the perp may still be after you its just not safe mr rhyme i need to take those tests makeups at my school they sometimes dont get scheduled test books get lost you dont get credit geneva was angrily gripping an empty belt loop on her jeans she was so skinny he wondered if her parents were health freaks keeping her on a diet of organic granola and tofu it seemed that a lot of professors leaned in that direction ill call the school right now sachs said well tell them theres been an incident and i think i really want to go geneva said softly eyes looking steadily into rhymes now just stay at home for a day or two until we find out more or rhyme added with a laugh until we nail his ass it was supposed to be light to win her over by talking teenage but he regretted the words instantly he hadnt been real with her solely because she was young it was like the people who came to visit him and were overly loud and jokey because he was a quad they pissed him off just like she was pissed at him now she said id really appreciate a ride if you dont mind or ill take the train but i have to leave now if you want those letters irritated to have to be fighting this battle rhyme said with finality ill have to say no can i borrow your phone whys that he asked theres a man i want to call a man hes the lawyer i mentioned wesley goades he used to work for the biggest insurance company in the country and now he runs a legal clinic in harlem and you want to call him sellitto asked why because i want to ask him if you can keep me from going to school rhyme scoffed its for your own good thats sort of for me to decide isnt it your parents or your uncle theyre not the ones who have to graduate from eleventh grade next spring sachs chuckled rhyme shot her a dark look just for a day or two miss bell said geneva ignored him and continued mr goades got john david colson released from singsing after hed been in prison for ten years for a murder he didnt commit and hes sued new york i mean the state itself two or three times he won every trial and he just did a supreme court case about homeless rights won that one too did he rhyme asked wryly he usually wins in fact i dont think hes ever lost thiss crazy sellitto muttered absently brushing at a dot of blood on his jacket he muttered youre a kid wrong thing to say geneva glared at him and snapped youre not going to let me make a phone call dont prisoners get to do that even the big detective sighed he gestured toward the phone she walked to it looked in her address book and punched in a number wesley goades rhyme said geneva cocked her head as the call was connected she said to rhyme he went to harvard oh and he sued the army too gay rights i think she spoke into the phone mr goades pleasecould you tell him geneva settle called i was a witness to a crime and im being held by the police she gave the address of rhymes town house then added its against my will and rhyme glanced at sellitto who rolled his eyes and said all right hold on geneva said into the phone then turned to the big detective who towered over her i can go to school for the test thats all there are two of them all right both goddamn tests sellitto muttered to bell he said stay with her like a flatcoated retriever yall got that right into the phone geneva said tell mr goades never mind weve got it worked out she hung up rhyme said but first i want those letters deal she slung her book bag over her shoulder you sellitto barked to pulaski go with em yes sir after bell geneva and the rookie had left sachs looked at the door and laughed now thats one spitfire wesley goades rhyme smiled i think she was making him up probably called time and temperature he nodded toward the evidence board lets get going on all of this mel you take over streetfair detail and i want the facts and profile of what weve got so far sent to vicap and ncic i want all the libraries and schools in town polled to see if this guy who talked to barry also called them and asked about singleton or that coloreds weekly magazine oh and find out who makes smileyface bags tall order cooper called hey guess what lifes a tall order sometimes then send a sample of the blood on the rope to codis i thought you didnt think it was a sex crime codis was a database that contained the dna of known sex offenders the operative words are i think mel not i know to a fucking certainty so much for the mood thom said one other thing he wheeled closer and examined the pictures of the librarians body and the diagram of the shooting crime scene which sachs had drawn the woman was how far from the vic rhyme asked sellitto who the bystander id guess fifteen feet to the side who was hit first she was and the shots were grouped tight the ones that hit the librarian real tight inches apart he knows how to shoot rhyme muttered it wasnt a miss the woman he shot her on purpose what the criminalist asked the best pistol shot in the room sachs when youre rapidfiring whats the one shot thats bound to be the most accurate the first youre not fighting recoil rhyme said he wounded her intentionally aimed for a major blood vessel to draw off as many officers as he could and give him a chance to get away cooper muttered jesus tell bell and bo haumann and his people at emergency services let em know thats the kind of perp were dealing with one whos more than happy to target innocents ii the graffiti king chapter eight the big man walked down the harlem sidewalk thinking about the phone conversation hed had an hour ago itd made him happy made him nervous made him cautious but mostly he was thinking maybe at last things are looking up well he deserved a boost just something to help him get over jax hadnt had much luck lately sure hed been glad to get out of the system but the two months since his release from prison had been coal hard lonely and without a single lick of anything by way of righteous fortune falling into his lap but today was different the phone call about geneva settle could change his life forever he was walking along upper fifth avenue heading toward st ambrose park a cigarette in the corner of his mouth enjoying the cold fall air enjoying the sun enjoying the fact that people round here gave him a wide berth some of it was his unsmiling face some of it the prison tat the limp too though truth be told his wasnt any hardass playa limp wasnt a gimmerespect gangsta limp it was an ohfuckibeenshot limp but nobody here knew that jax wore what he always wore jeans and a tattered combat jacket and clunky leather work shoes nearly worn through in his pocket he carried a goodsize wad of benjamins mostly twenties as well as a hornhandled knife a pack of cigarettes and on a single chain a single key to his small apartment on th street its two rooms featured one bed one table two chairs a secondhand computer and grocerystore twoforone cookware it was only a notch better than his recent residence in the new york state department of corrections he paused and looked around there he was the skinny dude with dustybrown skin a man who couldve been thirtyfive or sixty he leaned against an unsteady chainlink fence around this park in the heart of harlem the sun flared off the wet lip of a malt or wine bottle halfhidden in the yellow grass behind him sup man jax asked lighting another cigarette as he strode up and stopped a blink from the skinny guy he looked at the pack jax offered he wasnt sure what this was about but he took a cigarette anyway he put it in his pocket jax continued you ralph who you friend of delisle marshall was on s block with him lisle the skinny guy relaxed some he looked away from the man who could break him in half and surveyed the world from his chainlink perch lisle out jax laughed lisle put four rounds into some sad motherfuckers head therell be a nigger in the white house fore lisle gets out they do parole dudes ralph said his indignation unsuccessfully masking the fact hed been caught testing jax so what lisle say sends his word told me to look you up hell speak for me speak for you speak for you okay tell me what his tat look like skinny little ralph with a skinny little goatee was recovering some of his bravado it was testing time again which one jax responded the rose or the blade and i understand hes got another one near his dick but i never got close enough to see it ralph nodded unsmiling what yo name jackson alonzo jackson but i go by jax the tag had a righteous reputation attached to it he wondered if ralph had heard about him but apparently not no raised eyebrows this pissed jax off you want to check me out with delisle go right ahead man only dont use my name over the phone you know what im saying just tell him the graffiti king came by to have a confab with you graffiti king ralph repeated clearly wondering what that was about did it mean jax spread motherfuckers blood around like spray paint okay maybe i check depending so you out im out what was you in fo ar and weapons then he added with a lowered voice they went after me for a twentyfive twentyfive attempt that got knocked down to assault a shorthand reference to the penal code provision for murder section an now you a free man that phat jax thought this was funny heres sadass ralph nervous and all when jax comes along with a cigarette and a sup man but then starts relaxing when he finds out that he did hard time for armed robbery illegal weapons possession and attempted murder spraying blood like paint harlem didnt you just fucking love it inside just before hed been released hed tapped delisle marshall for some help and the brother had told him to hook up with ralph lisle had explained why the little skel was a good man to know that man hang out everwhere like he be ownin the streets know everthing or can find it out now the bloodpainting graffiti king sucked hard on the cigarette and got right down to it need you to set me up man jax said in a soft voice yeah whatchu need which meant both whatchu need and whatm i going to make from it fair enough a glance around they were alone except for pigeons and two short finelooking dominican girls striding past despite the cold they wore skimpy tops and tight shorts on their round knockmedown bodies ay papi one called to jax with a smile and kept going the girls crossed the street and turned east into their turf fifth avenue had been the dividing line between black and spanish harlem el barrio for years once you were east of fifth that was the other side could still be down could still be phat but it wasnt the same harlem jax watched them disappear damn hed been in prison a long time word ralph said he adjusted how he was leaning and crossed his arms like some egyptian prince jax waited a minute and bent down whispered into the pharaohs ear i need a piece you fresh man ralph said after a moment yo ass get caught with a piece they violate you back in a minute and you still gotta do a annual in rikers fo the gun why you wanta take a chance like that jax asked patiently can you do it or not the scrawny dude adjusted the angle of his lean and looked up at jax i think we phat man but i aint sure i know where to find anything fo you a piece im saying then i aint sure i know who to give this to he pulled out a roll of benjamins peeled off some twenties held them out to ralph being real careful of course one black man slipping another some money on the streets of harlem could raise a cops eyebrow even if the guy was just tithing to a minister from the nearby baptist ascension pentecostal church but the only eyebrow going up was ralphs as he pocketed the bills and looked at the rest of the roll you got yourself some tall paper there word and youve got yourself some of it now and a chance for more happy day he put the wad away ralph grunted what kinda piece small something i can hide easy you know what im saying cost you five cost me two i could do it cold ralph asked as if jax would want a gun with a registration number still stamped on the frame whatta you think then fuck two said the little egyptian he was ballsier now you dont kill people who can get you something you need three jax offered i could do three and hemi jax debated he made a fist and tapped ralphs with it another look around now i need something else you got connections at the schools some what schools you talkin bout i aint know nothin bout queens or bk or the bronx only here in the hood jax scoffed to himself thinking hood shit hed grown up in harlem and never lived anywhere else on earth except for army barracks and prisons you could call the place a neighborhood if you had to but it wasnt the hood in la in newark they had hoods in parts of bk too but harlem was a different universe and jax was pissed at ralph for using the word though he supposed the man wasnt disrespecting the place he probably just watched a lot of bad tv jax said just here i can ask round he was sounding a little uneasy not surprising considering that an excon with a arrest was interested in both a gun and a high school jax slipped him another forty that seemed to ease the little mans conscience considerably okay tell me what i supposed to be lookin fo jax pulled a sheet of paper out of his combat jacket packet it was a story hed downloaded from the online edition of the new york daily news he handed the article labeled breaking news update to ralph jax tapped the paper with a thick finger i need to find the girl that theyre talking about ralph read the article under the headline museum official shot to death in midtown he looked up it dont say nothin bout her where she live bout her school nothin dont even say what the fuck her name be her names geneva settle as for everything else jax nodded at the little mans pocket where the money had disappeared thats what im paying you the benjamins for why you want to find her asked ralph staring at the article jax paused for a minute then leaned close to the mans dusty ear sometimes people ask questions look around and they find out more shit than they really ought to be knowing ralph started to ask something else but then mustve figured that even though jax mightve been talking about something the girl had done the graffiti king of blood could also mean that ralph himself was being too fucking nosy gimme a hour or two he gave jax his phone number the little pharaoh pushed off from the chain link retrieved his bottle of malt liquor from the grass and started down the street roland bell eased his unmarked crown vic through central harlem a mix of residential and commercial buldings the chains pathmark duane reade popeyes mcdonalds existed side by side with the momandpop outfits where you could cash checks pay your bills and buy humanhair wigs and extensions or african arts or liquor or furniture many of the older buildings were run down and more than a few were boarded up or sealed with metal shutters covered with graffiti off the busier streets ruined appliances awaited scavengers trash was banked against buildings and gutters and both weeds and impromptu gardens filled vacant lots graffitied billboards advertised acts at the apollo and some other big uptown venues while hundreds of handbills covered walls and plywood hawking the acts of littleknown mcs djs and comedians young men hung tight in clusters and some watched the squad car behind bells with a mix of caution and disdain and occasionally raw contempt but as bell geneva and pulaski continued west the ambiance changed the deserted buildings were being torn down or renovated posters in front of the job sites showed what sort of idyllic town houses would soon replace the old ones geneva s block not far from steep rocky morningside park and columbia university was beautiful and treelined with clean sidewalks the rows of old buildings were in good repair the cars may have sported clubs on the steering wheels but the vehicles the steel bars protected included lexuses and beemers geneva pointed out a spotless fourstory brownstone decorated with carved facades the ironwork glistening black in the latemorning sun thats my place bell pulled his car two doors past it doubleparked uhm detective ron pulaski said i think she meant the one back there i know he said one thing im partial to is not advertising where the people were looking after live the rookie nodded as if memorizing this fact so young bell thought so much to learn well be inside for a few minutes keep an eye out yes sir what for exactly the detective hardly had time to educate the man in the finer points of bodyguard detail his presence alone would be enough of a deterrent for this brief errand bad guys he said the squad car that had accompanied them here pulled to a stop where bell pointed in front of the crown vic the officer inside would speed back to rhymes with the letters he wanted another car arrived a moment later an unmarked chevy it contained two officers from bell s swat witness protection team who would remain in and around the town house after learning that the unsub would target bystanders simply as a diversion bell had ordered some reinforcements the team officers hed picked for this assignment were luis martinez a quiet solid detective and barbe lynch a sharp young plainclothes officer who was new to protection detail but gifted with an intuitive radar for sensing threats the carolinian now lifted his lean frame out of the car and looked around buttoning his sports coat to hide the two pistols he wore on his hips bell had been a good smalltown cop and he was a good bigcity investigator but was truly in his element when it came to protecting witnesses it was a talent like the way he could sniff out game in the fields where hed hunted growing up instinct what he sensed was more than the obvious like spotting flashes off telescopic sights or hearing the click of pistol receivers or noticing somebody checking out your witness in the reflection of a storefront window he could tell when a man was walking with a purpose when by all logic he had none or when an apparently innocent bad parking job had placed a car in the perfect position to let a killer escape without having to saw the wheel back and forth hed see a configuration of building and street and window and think now thats where a man would hide to do some harm but at the moment he noted no threat and ushered geneva settle out of the car and inside the town house motioning martinez and lynch to follow he introduced geneva to them then the two officers returned outside to check the surrounding area the girl unlocked the inside security door and they went in and climbed to the second floor accompanied by the uniformed officer uncle bill she called rapping on the door its me a heavyset man in his fifties with a dusting of birthmarks on his cheek opened the door he smiled and nodded at bell nice to meet you names william the detective identified himself and they shook hands honey you all right terrible what happen to you im fine only the police are going to hang around for a while theyre thinking that guy who attacked me might try again the mans round face wrinkled with concern damn then he gestured toward the tv you made the news girl they mention her by name bell asked frowning troubled at this news no causa her age and no pictures neither well thats something freedom of the press was all very well and good but there were times when roland bell wouldnt mind a certain amount of censorship when it came to revealing witnesses identities and addresses now yall wait in the hall i want to check out the inside yes sir bell stepped into the apartment and looked it over the front door was secured by two deadbolts and a steel police lock rod the front windows looked out on the town houses across the street he pulled the shades down the side windows opened onto an alley and the building across the way the facing wall though was solid brick and there were no windows that presented a vantage point for a sniper still he closed the windows and locked them then pulled the blinds shut the place was large there were two doors to the hallway one in the front at the living room and a second in the back off a laundry room he made sure the locks were secured and returned to the hallway okay he called geneva and her uncle returned its looking pretty good just keep the doors and windows locked and the blinds drawn yes sir the man said i be sure to do that ill get the letters geneva said she disappeared toward the bedrooms now that bell had examined the place for security he looked at the room as a living space it struck him as cold spotless white furniture leather and linen all covered with plastic protectors tons of books african and caribbean sculptures and paintings a china cabinet filled with what seemed like expensive dishes and wineglasses african masks very little that was sentimental personal hardly any pictures of family bell s own house was chockablock with snaps of kin especially his two boys as well as all their cousins back in north carolina also a few pictures of his late wife but out of deference to his new belle lucy kerr who was a sheriff down in the tarheel state there were none of his wife and bell together only of mother and sons lucy who was herself well represented on his walls had seen the pictures of the late mrs bell and her children and announced she respected him for keeping those up and one thing about lucy she meant what she said bell asked genevas uncle if hed seen anybody he hadnt recognized around the town house lately no sir not a soul when will her parents be back i couldnt say sir was geneva talked to em five minutes later the girl returned she handed bell an envelope containing two yellow crisp pieces of paper here they are she hesitated be careful with them i dont have copies oh you dont know mr rhyme miss he treats evidence like it was the holy grail ill be back after school geneva said to her uncle then to bell im ready to go listen up girl the man said i want you tbe polite the way i told you you say sir when you talking to the police she looked at her uncle and said evenly dont you remember what my father said that people have to earn the right to be called sir thats what i believe the uncle laughed thats my niece fo you got a mind of her own why we love her give yo uncle a hug girl embarrassed like bells sons when hed put his arm around them in public the girl stiffly tolerated the embrace in the hallway bell handed the uniformed officer the letters get these over to lincolns town house asap yes sir after hed left bell called martinez and lynch on his radio they reported that the street was clear he hurried the girl downstairs and into the crown vic pulaski trotted up and jumped in after them as he started the engine bell glanced at her oh say miss when you got a minute how bout you look in that knapsack of yours and pick me out a book you wont be needing today book like a schoolbook she found one social studies its kind of boring oh its not for reading its for pretending to be a substitute teacher she nodded fronting youre a teacher hey thats def i thought so too now you wanta slip that seat belt on itd be much appreciated you too rookie chapter nine unsub might or might not have been a sex offender but in any event his dna sequence wasnt in the codis file the negative result was typical of the absence of leads in the case rhyme reflected with frustration theyd received the rest of the bullet fragments recovered from dr barrys body by the medical examiner but they were even more badly shattered than the one removed from the woman bystander and were of no better use in an ibis or drugfire check than the earlier pieces theyd also heard from several people at the africanamerican museum dr barry hadnt mentioned to any employees that another patron was interested in the coloreds weekly illustrated nor had the museum phone records revealed anything all calls went into a main switchboard and were directed to extensions with no details kept the incoming and outgoing calls on his cell phone offered no leads either cooper told them what hed learned from the owner of trenton plastics one of the countrys largest makers of plastic shopping bags the tech related the history of the smileyface icon as told to him by the companys owner they think the face was originally printed on buttons by a subsidiary of state mutual insurance in the sixties to boost company morale and as a promotional gimmick in the seventies two brothers drew a face like it with the slogan be happy sort of an alternative to the peace symbol by then it was being printed on fifty million items every year by dozens of companies the point of this pop culture lecture rhyme murmured that even if its copyrighted which no one seems to know there are dozens of companies making smileyface bags and itd be impossible to trace dead end of the dozens of museums and libraries that cooper sachs and sellitto had queried two reported that a man had called in the past several weeks asking about an issue of coloreds weekly illustrated from july this was encouraging because it supported rhymes theory that the magazine might be the reason geneva was attacked but neither of the institutions had the issue and no one could remember the name of the caller if hed even given it to them nobody else seemed to have a copy of the magazine for them to look at the museum of africanamerican journalism in new haven reported that they had had a full set on microfiche but it had disappeared rhyme was scowling at this news when a computer chimed and cooper announced weve got a response from vicap he hit a button and sent the email to all the monitors in rhymes lab sellitto and sachs huddled around one rhyme looked at his own flatscreen it was a secure email from a detective in the crime scene lab in queens detective cooper per your request we ran the crime profile you provided through both vicap and hits and have two matches incident one homicide in amarillo texas case no texas rangers five years ago sixtysevenyearold charles t tucker a retired state worker was found dead behind a strip mall near his home he had been struck in the back of the head with a blunt object presumably to subdue him then lynched a cottonfiber rope with a slipknot was placed around his neck and thrown over a tree limb then pulled tight by the assailant scratch marks at the neck indicated victim was conscious for some minutes before death occurred elements of similarity with unsub case victim was subdued with a single blow to the back of the head suspect was wearing size walking shoes most likely bass brand uneven wear on right one suggesting outturned foot cottonfiber rope with bloodstains was murder weapon fibers similar to those found at present scene motive was staged the murder appeared to have been ritualistic candles were set on the ground at his feet and a pentacle was drawn in the dirt but investigation into the victims life and profiling of the offense led investigators to conclude that this evidence was planted to lead the police off no other motive was established no fingerprints were recovered suspect wore latex gloves status active whats the next case rhyme asked cooper scrolled down incident two homicide in cleveland ohio case f ohio state police three years ago a fortyfiveyearold businessman gregory tallis was found dead in his apartment shot to death elements of similarity with unsub case victim was subdued with blows to the back of the head with a blunt object shoe prints of suspect identical to bassbrand walking shoes with outwardpointing right foot cause of death was three gunshots to the heart small caliber probably or similar to present case no relevant fingerprints were recovered suspect wore latex gloves victims pants were removed and a bottle inserted into his rectum with apparent intent to suggest he was the victim of a homosexual rape the ohio state police profiler concluded that the scene was staged the victim was scheduled to testify in a forthcoming organized crime trial bank records indicate that the defendant withdrew fifty thousand in cash one week prior to the killing however the money could not be traced authorities presume that this was the fee paid to a hired killer to murder tallis status open but inactive due to misplaced evidence misplaced evidence rhyme thoughtjesus he looked over the screen staging evidence to set up a phoney motive and another fake ritualistic assault he nodded at the hanged man tarot card subduing with the club then strangulation or shooting latex gloves the bass shoes the right footsure it could be our boy and it looks like hes a hired gun if so weve probably got two perps the unsub and whoever hired him all right i want everything texas and ohio have on both those cases cooper made some calls he learned that the texas authorities would check the file and get back to them as soon as possible in ohio though a detective confirmed that the file was among those for dozens of cold cases misplaced in a move to a new facility two years ago theyd look for it but the man added dont hold your breath rhyme grimaced at this news and told cooper to urge them to track it down if at all possible a moment later coopers cell phone rang and he took the call hellogo ahead he took some notes thanked the caller then hung up that was traffic they finally tracked down outstanding permits for carnivals or fairs big enough to close streets in the past few days two in queens one neighborhood association and one greek fraternal order a columbus day festival in brooklyn and another one in little italy that was the big one mulberry street we should get some teams out to all four neighborhoods rhyme said canvass all the discount variety store and drugstores that use smileyface bags that sell condoms duct tape and box cutters and use a cheap cash register or adding machine give the teams a description of the unsub and see if any clerks can remember him rhyme was watching sellitto stare at a small dark dot on his suit coat sleeve another bloodstain from the shooting that morning he assumed the big detective didnt move since he was the senior cop here he was the one to call esu and patrol and arrange for the search teams it seemed that he hadnt heard the criminalist though rhyme glanced at sachs who nodded and called downtown to arrange for the officers to set up the teams when she hung up she noticed rhyme was staring at the evidence board frowning whats wrong he didnt answer right away mulling over what exactly was wrong then he realized fish out of water think we need some help here one of the most difficult problems criminalists face is not knowing their territory a crime scene analyst is only as good as his knowledge of the area suspects inhabit the geology sociology history pop culture employmenteverything lincoln rhyme was thinking how little he knew about the world that geneva settle lived in harlem oh hed read the stats of course the majority of the population were an equal mix of african black both longtime and recent immigrants and black and nonblack hispanic mostly puerto rican dominican salvadoran and mexican followed by white and some asian there was poverty and there were gangs and drugs and violence largely centered around the projects but much of the neighborhood was generally safe far better than many parts of brooklyn the bronx or newark harlem had more churches mosques community organizations and concernedparents groups than any other neighborhood in the city the place had been a mecca for black civil rights and for black and hispanic culture and art it was now the center of a new movement for fiscal equality there were dozens of economic redevelopment projects currently under way and investors of all races and nationalities were speeding to sink money into harlem taking particular advantage of the hot real estate market but these were new york times facts nypd facts they didnt help rhyme one bit in his understanding of why a professional killer wanted to murder a teenage girl from this neighborhood his search for unsub was severely hampered by this limitation he ordered his phone to make a call and the software obediently connected him to a number at the fbis office downtown dellray here fred its lincoln i need some help again my friendly fella down in the district help you out yep sure did maryland too glad to hear it hold on lemme shoo somebody on outa here rhyme had been to dellrays office several times the tall lanky black agents digs in the federal building were filled with books of literature and esoteric philosophy as well as coatracks of the various clothes hed wear while working undercover though he didnt do much fieldwork anymore ironically it was on those costume racks that youd find fbi brooks brothers suits and white shirts and striped ties dellrays regular dress was to put it kindly bizarre jogging outfits and sweats with sports jackets and he favored green blue and yellow for his suits at least

were faded and fragile mel cooper carefully mounted them between two thin sheets of acrylic after chemically treating the creases to make sure the paper didnt crack sellitto walked over to cooper whatta we got the tech focused the optical scanner on the first letter hit a button the image appeared on several of the computer monitors throughout the room my most darling violet i have but a moment to set down a few words to you in the heat and calm of this early sunday morning our regiment the st new york has come such a long way since we were unseasoned recruits assembling on harts island indeed we now are engaged in the momentous task of pursuing gen robert e lee himself whose army has been in retreat after its defeat at petersburg virginia on april he has now taken a stand with his thirtythousand troops in the heart of the confederacy and it has fallen to our regiment among others to hold the line to the west when he attempts to escape which surely he must for both

us wearing negro cottons some of them say nothing but regard us blankly others cheer mightily not long ago our commander rode up to us dismounted and told of the battle plan for the day he then spoke from memory words from mr frederick douglass words that i recall to be these once let the black man get upon his person the letters us an eagle on his buttons a musket on his shoulder and bullets in

charles april appomattox virginia sachs looked up phew thats a cliffhanger not really thom said what do you mean well we know they held the line how because april ninths the day the south surrendered not really concerned about history here rhyme said i want to know about this secret thats in this one cooper said scanning the second letter he mounted it on the scanner my dearest violet i miss you my dear and our young joshua too i am heartened by the news that your sister has weathered well the illness following the birth of your nephew and thankful to our lord jesus christ that you were present to see her through this difficult time however i think it best that you remain in harrisburg for the timebeing these are critical times and more perilous i feel than what transpired during the war of secession so much has happened in the month you have been away how my life has changed from simple farmer and school teacher to my present situation i am engaged in matters that are difficult and dangerous and dare i say vital for the sake of our people tonight my colleagues and i meet again at gallows heights which has taken on the aspects of a castle under siege the days seem endless the travel exhausting my life consists of arduous hours and coming and going under cover of darkness and avoiding too those who would do us harm for they are many and not just former rebels many in the north are hostile to our cause as well i receive frequent threats some veiled some explicit another nightmare awakened me early this morning i dont recall the images that plagued my sleep but after i awoke i could not return to my slumbers i lay awake till dawn thinking how difficult it is to bear this secret within me i so desire to share it with the world but i know i cannot i have no doubt the consequences of its revelation would be tragic forgive my somber tone i miss you and our son and i am terribly weary tomorrow may see a rebirth of hope i pray that such is the case yours in loving affection charles may well rhyme mused he talks about the secret but what is it must have something to do with those meetings in gallows heights sake of our people civil rights or politics he mentioned that in his first letter toowhat the hell is gallows heights his eyes went to the tarot card of the hanged man suspended from a gallows by his foot ill look it up cooper said and went online a moment later he said it was a neighborhood in nineteenthcentury manhattan upper west side centered around bloomingdale road and eightieth street bloomingdale became the boulevard and then broadway he glanced up with a raised eyebrow not far from here gallows with an apostrophe no apostrophe at least in the hits i found anything else about it cooper looked over the historical society website a couple things a map from he swung the monitor toward rhyme who looked it over noting that the neighborhood encompassed a large area there were some big estates owned by oldfamily new york magnates and financiers as well as hundreds of smaller apartments and homes hey look lincoln cooper said touching part of the map near central park thats your place where we are now it was a swamp back then interesting rhyme muttered sarcastically the only other reference is a times story last month about the rededication of a new archive at the sanford foundation thats the old mansion on eightyfirst rhyme recalled a big victorian building next to the sanford hotel a gothic spooky apartment that resembled the nearby dakota where john lennon had been killed cooper continued the head of the foundation william ashberry gave a speech at the ceremony he mentioned how much the upper west side has changed in the years since it was known as gallows heights but thats all nothing specific too many unconnected dots rhyme reflected it was then that coopers computer binged signaling an incoming email the tech read it and glanced at the team listen to this its about coloreds weekly illustrated the curator of booker t washington college down in philly just sent me this the library had the only complete collection of the magazine in the country and had rhyme snapped fucking had last week a fire destroyed the room where it was stored whatd the arson report say sachs asked wasnt considered arson it looks like a lightbulb broke ignited some papers nobody was hurt bullshit it wasnt arson somebody started it so does the curator have any other suggestions where we can find i was about to continue well continue the school has a policy of scanning everything in their archives and storing them in adobepdf files are we approaching good news mel or are you just flirting cooper punched more buttons he gestured toward the screen voilà july twentythird coloreds weekly illustrated you dont say well read to us mel first of all did mr singleton drown in the hudson or not cooper typed and a moment later shoved his glasses onto the bridge of his nose leaned forward and said here we go the headline is shame the account of a freedmans crime charles singleton a veteran of the war between the states betrays the cause of our people in a notorious incident continuing with the text he read on tuesday july fourteenth a warrant for the arrest of one charles singleton a freedman who was a veteran of the war of secession was issued by the new york criminal court on charges that he feloniously stole a large sum of gold and other monies from the national education trust for freedmens assistance on twentythird street in manhattan new york mr singleton eluded a dragnet by officers throughout the city and was thought to have escaped possibly to pennsylvania where his wifes sister and her family lived however early on the morning of thursday the sixteenth he was noticed by a police constable as he was making his way toward the hudson river docks the constable sounded the alarm and mr singleton took flight the police officer gave chase the pursuit was soon joined by dozens of other law enforcers and irish rag pickers and workers doing their civic duty to apprehend the felon and encouraged by the promise of five dollars in gold to stop the villain the attempted route of escape was through the warren of disreputable shanties close by the river at the twentythird street paint works mr singleton stumbled a mounted officer approached and it appeared he would be ensnared yet he regained his footing and rather than own up to his mischief as a courageous man would do continued his cowardly flight for a time he evaded his pursuers but his escape was merely temporary a negro tradesman on a porch saw the freedman and implored him to stop in the name of justice asserting that he had heard of mr singletons crime and recriminating him for bringing dishonor upon all colored people throughout the nation the citizen one walker loakes thereupon flung a brick at mr singleton with the intent of knocking him down however mr singleton avoided the missile and proclaiming his innocence continued to flee the freedman was strong of body from working an apple orchard and ran as fast as greased lightning but mr loakes informed the constabulary of the freedmans presence and at the piers near twentyeighth street near the tow boat office his path was confounded by another contingent of diligent police there he paused exhausted clinging to the swiftsure express company sign he was urged to surrender by the man who had led his pursuit for the past two days detective captain william p simms who leveled his pistol at the thief yet either seeking a desperate means of escape or convinced that his evil deeds had caught up with him and wishing to end his life mr singleton by most accounts hesitated for but a moment then leapt into the river calling out words that none could hear rhyme interrupted thats as far as geneva got before she was attacked forget the civil war sachs this is the cliffhanger keep going he disappeared from view under the waves and witnesses were sure he had perished three constables commandeered a skiff from a nearby dock and rowed along the piers to ascertain the negros fate they at last found him half conscious from the fall clutching a piece of driftwood to his breast and with a pathos that many suggested was calculated calling for his wife and son at least he survived sachs said geneva ll be glad about that he was tended to by a surgeon taken away and bound over for trial which was held on tuesday last in court it was proven that he stole the unimaginable sum of greenbacks and gold coin worth thirty thousand dollars thats what i was thinking rhyme said that the motive heres missing loot value today cooper minimized the window containing the article about charles singleton and did a web search jotting numbers on a pad he looked up from his calculations itd be worth close to eight hundred thousand rhyme grunted unimaginable all right keep going cooper continued a porter across the street from the freedmens trust saw mr singleton gain entry into the office by the back door and leave twenty minutes later carrying two large satchels when the manager of the trust arrived soon after summoned by the police it was discovered that the trusts exeter strongbow safe had been broken open with a hammer and crowbar identical to those owned by the defendant which were later located in proximity to the building further evidence was presented that mr singleton had ingratiated himself at a number of meetings in the gallows heights neighborhood of the city with such luminaries as the hons charles sumner thaddeus stevens and frederick douglass and his son lewis douglass on the pretense of assisting those noble men in the furtherance of the rights of our people before congress ah the meetings charles referred to in his letter they were about civil rights and those must be the colleagues he mentioned pretty heavy hitters sounds like what else his motive in assisting these famed personages according to the able prosecutor was not however to assist the cause of negroes but to gain knowledge of the trust and other repositories he might plunder was that the secret sachs wondered at his trial mr singleton remained silent regarding these charges except to make a general disclaimer and to say that he loved his wife and son captain simms was able to recover most of the illgotten gains it is speculated that the negro secreted the remaining several thousand in a hiding place and refused to divulge its whereabouts none of it was ever found excepting a hundred dollars in gold coin discovered on mr singletons person when he was apprehended there goes the buried treasure theory rhyme muttered too bad i liked it the accused was convicted expeditiously upon sentencing the judge exhorted the freedman to return the rest of the purloined funds whose location he nonetheless refused to disclose clinging still to his claim of innocence and asserting the coin found on his person had been placed in his belongings after his apprehesion accordingly the judge in his wisdom ordered that the felons possessions be confiscated and sold to make such restitution as could be had and the criminal himself was sentenced to five years imprisonment cooper looked up thats it why would somebody resort to murder just to keep the story under wraps sachs asked yep the big question rhyme gazed at the ceiling so what do we know about charles he was a teacher and a civil war veteran he owned and worked a farm upstate he was arrested and convicted for theft he had a secret that would have tragic consequences if it was known he went to hushhush meetings in gallows heights he was involved in the civil rights movement and hobnobbed with some of the big politicians and civil rights workers of the day rhyme wheeled close to the computer screen looking over the article he could see no connection between the events then and the unsub case sellittos phone rang he listened for a moment his eyebrow lifted okay thanks he disconnected and looked at rhyme bingo whats bingo rhyme asked sellitto said a canvass team in little italy a half block from where they had the columbus day fair just found a discount store on mulberry street the clerk remembered a middleaged white guy who bought everything in the unsubs rape pack a few days ago she remembered him because of the hat he wore a hat no he bought a hat a stocking cap only why she remembered him was because when he tried it on he pulled it down over his face she saw him in a security mirror she thought he was going to rob her but then he took it off and put it in the basket with everything else and just paid and left the missing item on the receipt probably trying it on to make sure it would work as a mask its probably also what he rubbed his own prints off with does she know his name no but she can describe him pretty good sachs said well do a composite and hit the streets grabbing her purse she was at the door before she realized the big detective wasnt with her she stopped looked back lon you coming sellitto didnt seem to hear she repeated the question and the detective blinked he lowered his hand from his reddened

movement threatened for this work troubled by his secret chapter ten in the s the new negro movement later called the harlem renaissance erupted in new york city it involved an astonishing group of thinkers artists musicians and mostly writers who approached their art by looking at black life not from the viewpoint of white america but from their own perspective this groundbreaking movement included men and women like the intellectuals marcus garvey and w e b dubois writers like zora neale hurston claude mckay and countee cullen painters like william h johnson and john t biggers and of course the musicians who provided the timeless sound track to it all people like duke ellington josephine baker w c handy eubie blake in such a pantheon of brilliance it was hard for any single artists voice to stand out but if anyones did it would perhaps be that of poet and novelist langston hughes whose voice and message were typified by his simple words what happens to a dream deferreddoes it dry up like a raisin in the sunor does it explode many memorials to hughes exist throughout the country but certainly one of the biggest and most dynamic and probably the one hed have been most proud of was an old redbrick fourstory building in harlem located near lennox terrace on th street like all city schools langston hughes high had its problems it was continually overcrowded and underfunded and struggled desperately to get and retain good teachers and to keep students in class as well it suffered from low graduation rates violence in the halls drugs gangs teen pregnancy and truancy still the school had produced graduates whod gone on to become lawyers successful businessmen and women doctors scientists writers dancers and musicians politicians professors it had winning varsity teams dozens of scholastic societies and arts clubs but for geneva settle langston hughes high was more than these stats it was the hub of her salvation an island of comfort as she saw the dirty brick walls come into view now the fear and anxiety that had swarmed around her since the terrible incident at the museum that morning diminished considerably detective bell parked his car and after hed looked around for threats they climbed out he nodded toward a street corner and said to that young officer mr pulaski you wait out here yes sir geneva added to the detective you can wait here too you want he chuckled ill just come hang out with you for a bit you dont mind well okay i can see you do mind but i think ill come along anyway he buttoned his jacket to hide his guns nobodyll pay me any mind he held up the social studies book not answering geneva grimaced and they proceeded to the school at the metal detector the girl showed her id and detective bell subtly flashed his wallet and was let around the side of the device it was just before fifth period which started at and the halls were crowded kids milling around heading for the cafeteria or out to the school yard or onto the street for fast food there was joking dissing flirting making out a fight or two chaos reigned its my lunch period she called over the din ill go to the cafeteria and study its this way three of her friends came up fast ramona challette janet they fell into step beside her they were smart girls like her pleasant never caused any trouble on scholarship tracks yet or maybe because of this they werent particularly tight none of them really just hung out theyd go home after class practice suzuki violin or piano volunteer for literacy groups or work on the spelling bee or westinghouse science competitions and of course study academics meant solitude part of geneva actually envied the schools other cliques like the gangsta girls the blingstas the jockgirls and the angela davis activist sistas but now these three were fluttering around her like best homegirls huddling close peppering her with questions did he touch you you see his dick was he hard dyou see the guy got capped how close were you theyd all heard from kids who came in late or kids cutting class and watching tv even though the stories hadnt mentioned geneva by name everybody knew she was at the center of the incident thanks probably to keesh marella a track star and fellow junior walked by saying what up girlfriend you down yeah im cool the tall classmate squinted at detective bell and asked her whys a cop carrying yo book gen ask him the policeman laughed uneasily fronting youre a teacher hey thats def keesha scott clustered with her sister and some of her blingsta homegirls gave geneva a theatrical doubletake girl you wack bitch she shouted somebody give you a pass you take a pass coulda kicked back watched the soaps grinned nodded at the lunchroom catch you later some of the students werent as kind halfway to the lunchroom she heard a boys voice yo yo it the fox news bitch with the cracker over there she still alive thought somebody clip that ho fuck that debbie be too skinny to hit with anything but a breakdown raucous laughter erupted detective bell whirled around but the young men whod called out those words disappeared in a sea of sweats and sports jerseys baggy jeans and cargo pants and bare heads hats being forbidden in the halls of langston hughes its okay geneva said her jaw set looking down some of them they dont like it when you take school seriously you know raising the curve shed been student of the month a number of times and had a perfect attendance award for both of her prior years here she was regularly on the principals honor roll with her percent average and had been inducted into the national honor society at the formal ceremony last spring doesnt matter even the vicious insult of blondie or debbie a black girl aspiring to be white didnt get to her since to some extent it was true at the lunchroom door a large attractive black woman in a purple dress with a board of education id around her neck came up to mr bell she identified herself as mrs barton a counselor shed heard about the incident and wanted to know if geneva was all right and if she wanted to talk with somebody in her department about it oh man a counselor the girl thought her spirits dipping dont need this shit now no she said im fine you sure we could do a session this afternoon really im down its cool i should call your parents theyre away youre not alone are you the woman frowned im staying with my uncle and were looking out for her the detective said geneva noticed the woman didnt even ask to see his id it was so obvious he was a cop whenll they be back your folks theyre on their way they were overseas you didnt really need to come to school today ive got two tests i dont want to miss them the woman gave a faint laugh and said to mr bell i never took school as seriously as this probably should have a glance at the girl are you sure you dont want to go home i spent a lot of time studying for those tests she muttered i really want to take them all right but after that i think you should go home and stay there for a few days well get your assignments to you mrs barton stormed off to break up a pushing match between two boys when she was gone the officer asked you have a problem with her its just counselorstheyre always in your business you know he looked like no he didnt know but why should he this wasnt his world they started up the hall toward the cafeteria as they entered the noisy place she nodded toward the short alcove leading to the girls restroom is it okay if i go in there sure just hold on a minute he motioned to a woman teacher and whispered something to her explaining the situation geneva assumed the woman nodded and stepped inside the bathroom came out a moment later its empty mr bell stationed himself outside the door ill make sure only students get in geneva stepped inside thankful for the moment or two of peace to be away from the staring eyes away from the edginess of knowing that somebody wanted to hurt her earlier shed been angry earlier shed been defiant but now the reality was starting to lap at her heart and left her scared and confused she came out of the stall and washed her hands and face another girl had come in and was putting on her makeup a senior geneva believed tall finelooking with her eyebrows artistically plucked and bangs hotcombed to perfection the girl gave her the up and down not because of the news story though she was taking inventory you saw it all the time here every minute of the day checking out the competition what was a girl wearing how many piercings real gold or plate too much glitter were her braids phat or coming loose was she draped or wearing a simple hoop or two are those real extensions or fake was she covering up being pregnant geneva who spent her money on books not clothes and makeup always came in low in the ratings not that what god had created helped much she had to take a deep breath to fill her bra which she usually didnt even bother to wear she was that eggyolktitty bitch to the delano project girls and shed been called him or he dozens of times in the last year it hurt the worst when somebodyd really mistake her for a boy not when they were dissing then there was her hair dense and wiry as steel wool she didnt have the time to train locs or tie rows braids and extensions took forever and even though keesh would do them for free they actually made her look younger like she was a little kid dressed up by her moms there she go there she go the skinny little boygirl get her down the senior next to her at the washbasins turned back to the mirror she was pretty and broad her sexy bra straps and thong line evident hair in a long straightened sweep her smooth cheeks faintly maroon her shoes were red as candy apples she was everything that geneva settle was not it was then that the door swung open and geneva s heart froze in walked jonette monroe another senior not much taller than geneva though broader bustier with solid shoulders and cut muscles tats on both arms a long mochashaded face and eyes that were ice cold they now squinted in recognition at geneva who looked away immediately jonette was trouble a gangsta girl rumors were she was dealing could get you anything you wanted meth crack smack and if you didnt come up with the benjamins shed whale on you herself or on your best friend or even your moms till you stood up to the debt twice already this year shed been dragged off by the cops even kicked one in the balls geneva now kept her eyes down thinking detective belld have no way of knowing how dangerous jonette was when he let her inside her hands and face still wet geneva started for the door yo yo girl jonette said to her looking her up and down with a cold glance yeah you martha stewart don you be goin nowhere i shutup she glanced at the other girl the one with the purple cheeks an you get the fuck out the senior had fifty pounds and three inches of height on jonette but the girl stopped preening and slowly gathered up her makeup she tried to save a bit of dignity saying dont go layin no attitude on me girl jonette didnt say a word she took one step forward the girl snatched up her purse and fled through the doorway a lip liner fell to the floor jonette picked it up and slipped the tube into her pocket geneva started to leave again but jonette held her hand up and motioned her to the back of the restroom when geneva stood frozen jonette grabbed her by the arm and shoved open the doors of the stalls to make sure they were alone whatta you want geneva whispered both defiant and terrified jonette snapped shut yo mouth shit she thought furious mr rhyme was right that terrible man from the library was still after her hed somehow found out her school and hired jonette to finish the job why the hell had she come to school today scream geneva told herself and she did or started to jonette could see it coming and in a flash was behind her clamping her hand over geneva s mouth stifling the sound quiet her other hand gripped the girl around the waist and pulled her into the far corner of the room geneva grabbed her hand and arm and tugged but she was no match for jonette she stared at the girls bleedingcross tat on her forearm and whimpered please jonette rummaged for something in her purse or pocket what geneva wondered in a panic there was a flash of metal a knife or gun whatd they have metal detectors for if it was so goddamn easy to get a weapon into the school geneva squealed twisting violently then the gang girls hand swung forward no no and geneva found herself looking at a silver police department badge you gonna be quiet girl jonette asked exasperated i quiet a nod jonette said i dont want anybody outside to hear anything now you down geneva nodded again and jonette released her youre a cop yeah geneva scrabbled away and pressed against the wall breathing deeply as jonette walked to the door opened it a crack she whispered something and detective bell stepped inside and locked the door so you two met he said sort of geneva said she really is a cop the detective explained all the schools have undercover officers theyre usually women pretending to be juniors or seniors or whatd you say fronting why didnt you just tell me geneva snapped jonette glanced at the stalls i didnt know we were alone sorry to be wack but i couldnt say anything thatd blow my cover the policewoman looked geneva over shook her head shame this had to happen to you youre one of the good ones i never spent any worry on you a cop geneva whispered in disbelief jonette laughed in a high girlish voice im the man yep youre so down geneva said i never guessed mr bell said you remember when they busted those seniors who smuggled some guns into the school a few weeks ago geneva nodded a pipe bomb too or something it was going to be another columbine right here the man said in his lazy drawl jonettes the one heard about it and stopped the whole thing had to keep my cover so i couldnt take em down myself she said as if she regretted not being able to bust up the kids personally now as long as youre going to be in school which i think is pretty wack but thats a different story long as youre here ill keep an eye on you you see anything makes you uneasy give me a sign gang sign jonette laughed youd be a claimer in any gang gen nothing personal you go throwing me a flag i think everybodyd know something was up better you just scratch your ear hows that sure then ill come over and mess you up some give you some shit get you out of wherever you are you cool with that i wont hurt you maybe just push you round a little sure goodlisten thanks for doing this and i wont say anything about you i knew that fore i told you jonette said then she looked at the officer you wanta do it now you bet then the pleasant softspoken policeman got a dark look on his face and shouted what the hellre you doing in here screeching get yo motherfuckin hands off me asshole jonette had slipped into character again the detective took her by the arm and shoved her out the door she stumbled into the wall fuck you ima sue yo fucking ass for abuse or some shit the girl rubbed her arm you cant touch me that a crime motherfucker she stormed off down the hall after a pause detective bell and geneva stepped into the cafeteria proper good actress geneva whispered one of the best the policeman said she kind of blew your cover he handed her back the social studies book grinned wasnt exactly working geneva sat down at a table in the corner and pulled a language arts book out of her knapsack detective bell asked arent you eating no did your uncle give you your lunch money im not really hungry forgot didnt he all respect hes not a man whos ever been a father i can tell ill rustle you up something no really truth is im hungrier than a farmer at sundown and i havent had any high school turkey tetrazzini in years gonna get me some of that no trouble to get a second plate you like milk she debated sure ill pay you back well put it on the city he stepped into the line geneva had just turned back to her textbook when she saw a boy look her way and wave she glanced behind her to see whom he was gesturing at there was no one else she gave a faint gasp realizing that he was indicating her kevin cheaney was pushing away from the table where he and his homies sat and started loping toward her oh my god was he really coming this waykevin a will smith lookalike perfect lips perfecter body the boy who could make a basketball defy gravity could move like he was a breakdancer competing in a bboy summit show kevin was a coal institution at all the jams in line detective bell stiffened and started forward but geneva shook her head that everything was fine which it was better than fine totally def kevin was destined for connecticut or duke on scholarship maybe an athletic one hed been captain of the team that won last years psal basketball championship but he could make it on grades too he didnt have the same love of books and school that geneva did maybe but he was still in the top percent of the class they knew each other casually they shared math class this semester and would also find themselves together in the hall or in the school yard from time to time coincidentally geneva told herself but okay fact was that she usually gravitated to where he was standing or sitting most of the down kids ignored or dissed her kevin though actually said hi from time to time hed ask her a question about a math or history assignment or just pause and talk for a few minutes he wasnt asking her out of course thatd never happen but he treated her like a human being hed even walked her home from langston hughes one day last spring a beautiful clear day she could still picture as if she had a dvd of it april normally kevin would hang with the svelte model wannabees or the brash girls the blingstas he even flirted with lakeesha some which infuriated geneva who endured the raging jealousy with a gritty carefree smile so what was he about now yo girl you down he asked frowning and dropping into a battered chrome chair next to her stretching out his long legs yeah she swallowed tonguetied her mind was blank he said i heard bout what happened man that was some mad shit somebody trying to yoke and choke you i was fretting yeah word it was just weird long as you okay thats cool then she felt a wave of heat wash over her face kevin was actually saying this to her why dont you just roll on back at home he

today way you did all rolled together they aint worth half of you you got spine girl breathless from the compliment geneva just looked down and shrugged so now i see what you really about you and me girl we gotta hang more but youre never round just you know school an shit watch it she warned herself you dont have to talk his talk kevin joked naw girl that aint it i know whats what you dealin crank over in bk i nearly an aint she refused to let it escape she gave him a selfconscious smile looked down at the scuffed floor i dont deal in brooklyn only queens they got more benjamins you know lame lame lame girl oh you are pathetic her palms bled sweat but kevin laughed hard then he shook his head naw i know why i got confused musta been yo moms selling crank in bk this seemed like an insult but it was actually an invitation kevin was asking her to play the dozens thats how the old folks referred to it now you called it snapping trading snaps insults part of a long tradition of black poetry and storytelling contests snapping was verbal combat trading barbs serious snappersd perform onstage though most snapping took place in living rooms and school yards and pizza parlors and bars and clubs and on front steps and was about as sad as what kevin had just offered as his initial volley like yo mama so stupid she asks for price checks at the dollar store yo sister so ugly she couldnt get laid if she was a brick but today here the point had nothing to do with being witty because playing the dozens was traditionally men against men or women against women when a male offered to play with a female it meant only one thing flirt geneva thinking how weird is this it took getting attacked to make people respect her her father always said that the best can come out of the worst well go ahead girl play back the game was ridiculously juvenile silly but she knew how to snap she and keesh and keeshs sisterd go on for an hour straight yo mama so fat her blood type is ragu yo chevy so old they stole the club and left the car but her heart beating fiercely geneva now simply grinned and sweated silently she tried desperately to think of something to say but this was kevin cheaney himself even if she could work up the courage to fire off a snap about his mother her mind was frozen she looked at her watch then down at her language arts book sweet jesus you wack girl she raged at herself say something but not a single syllable trickled from her mouth she knew kevin was about to give her that look she knew so well that iaintgottimetwasteonwackbitches look and walk off but no it seemed he thought that she just wasnt in the mood to play probably still freaked from the mornings events and that was all right with him he just said im serious gen youre about moren just djs and braids and bling what it is youre smart nice to talk with somebody smart my boys he nodded toward his posses table theyre not exactly rocket scientists you know what im saying a flash in her mind go for it girl yeah she said some of emre so dumb if they spoke their minds theyd be speechless def girl straight up laughing he tapped his fist to hers and an electric jolt shot through her body she struggled not to grin it was way bad form to smile at your own snap then through the exhilaration of the moment she was thinking how right he was how rarely it happens just talking with somebody smart somebody who could listen somebody who cared what you had to say kevin lifted an eyebrow at detective bell who was paying for the food and said i know that dude fronting hes a teacher is five she whispered man does sorta have cop written on his forehead thats word kevin said laughing i know hes stepping up for you and all and thats cool but i just wanta say ima watch yo back too and my boys we see anything wack well let him know she was touched by this but then troubled what if kevin or one of his friends got hurt by that terrible man from the library she was still sick with sorrow that dr barry had been killed because of her that the woman on the sidewalk had been wounded she had a horrible premonition kevin laid out in the williams funeral home parlor like so many other harlem boys shot down on the street you dont have to do that she said unsmiling i know i dont he said i want to nobodys gonna hurt you thats word okay ima hang with my boys now catch you later fore math class heart thudding she stammered sure he tapped her fist again and walked off watching him she felt feverish hands shaking at the exchange please she thought dont let anything happen to him miss she looked up blinked detective bell was setting down a tray the food smelled so fine she was even hungrier than shed thought she stared at the steaming plate you know him the policeman asked yeah hes down were in class together known him for years you look a little addled miss welli dont know maybe i am yeah but it doesnt have anything to do with what happened at the museum right he asked with a smile she looked away feeling heat across her face now the detective said setting the steaming plate in front of her chow down nothing like turkey tetrazzini to soothe a troubled soul you know i might just ask em for the recipe chapter eleven thesed do just fine thompson boyd looked down at his purchases in the basket then started for the checkout counter he just loved hardware stores he wondered why that might be maybe because his father used to take him every saturday to an ace hardware outside of amarillo to stock up on what the man needed for his workshop in the shed outside their trailer or maybe it was because in most hardware stores like here all the tools were clean and organized the paint and glues and tapes were all ordered logically and easy to find everything arranged by the book thompson liked the smell too sort of a pungent fertilizeroilsolvent smell that was impossible to describe but one that everyone whod ever been in an old hardware store would recognize instantly the killer was pretty handy this was something hed picked up from his dad who even though he spent all day with tools working on oil pipelines derricks and the bobbing dinosaurhead pumps would still spend lots of time patiently teaching his son how to work with and respect tools how to measure how to draw plans thompson spent hours learning how to fix what was broken and how to turn wood and metal and plastic into things that hadnt existed together theyd work on the truck or the trailer fix the fence make furniture build a present for his mom or aunt a rolling pin or cigarette box or butcher block table big or small his father taught you put the same amount of skill into what youre doing son ones not better or harder than the other its only a question of where you put the decimal point his father was a good teacher and he was proud of what his son built when hart boyd died he had with him a shoeshine kit the boy had made and a wooden key chain in the shape of an indian head with the woodburned letters dad on it it was fortunate as it turned out that thompson learned these skills because thats what the business of death is all about mechanics and chemistry no different from carpentry or painting or car repair where you put the decimal point standing at the checkout stand he paid cash of course and thanked the clerk he took the shopping bag in his gloved hands he started out the door paused and looked at a small electric lawn mower green and yellow it was perfectly clean polished an emerald jewel of a device it had a curious appeal to him why he wondered well since hed been thinking of his father it occurred to him that the machine reminded him of times hed mow the tiny yard behind his parents trailer sunday morning then go inside to watch the game with his dad while his mother baked he remembered the sweet smell of the leaded gas exhaust remembered the gunshotsounding crack when the blade hit a stone and flung it into the air the numbness in his hands from the vibration of the grips numb the way youd feel as you lay dying from a sidewinder snakebite he assumed he realized that the clerk was speaking to him what thompson asked make you a good deal the clerk said nodding at the mower no thanks stepping outside he wondered why hed spaced out what had so appealed to him about the mower why he wanted it so much then he had the troubling idea that it wasnt the family memory at all maybe it was because the machine was really a small guillotine a very efficient way to kill maybe that was it didnt like that thought but there it was numb whistling faintly a song from his youth thompson started up the street carrying the shopping bag in one hand and in the other his briefcase containing his gun and billy club and a few other tools of the trade he continued up the street into little italy where the crews were cleaning up after the street fair yesterday he grew cautious observing several police cars two officers were talking to a korean fruit stand owner and his wife he wondered what that was about then he continued on to a pay phone he checked his voice mail once more but there were no messages yet about genevas whereabouts that wasnt a concern his contact knew harlem pretty good and itd only be a matter of time until thompson found out where the girl went to school and where she lived besides he could use the free time he had another job one that hed been planning for even longer than geneva settles death and one that was just as important as that job more important really and funny now that he thought about it this one also involved children yeah jax said into his cell phone ralph sup dog jax wondered if the skinny little pharaoh was leaning against something at the moment you get the word from our friend meaning the character reference delisle marshall yeah and the graffiti kings cool jax asked yeah good so where are we on all this okay i found what you want man its dont say anything cell phones were the devils own invention when it came to incriminating evidence he gave the man an intersection on th street ten minutes jax disconnected and started up the street as two ladies in their long overcoats wearing elaborate church hats and clutching wellworn bibles detoured out of his way he ignored their uneasy looks smoking walking steady with his gunshotnotgangsta limp jax inhaled the air high on being home harlemlooking around him at stores restaurants and street vendors you could buy anything here west african woven cloth kente and malinke and egyptian ankhs bolga baskets masks and banners and framed pictures of silhouetted men and women on african national congress black green and yellow posters too malcolm x martin luther king jr tina tupac beyoncé chris rock shaq and dozens of pictures of jam master jay the brilliant and generous vinylspinning rapper with rundmc gunned down by some asshole in his queens recording studio a few years back jax was hit left and right by memories he glanced at another corner well lookit that now a fast food place it had been the site of jaxs first crime committed when he was fifteen the crime that had launched him on the path to becoming righteously notorious because what he racked wasnt liquor or cigarettes or guns or cash but a case of phat krylon from a hardware store which he went on to use up over the next twentyfour hours compounding the larceny with trespass and criminal property damage by spraypainting the graffitied bubble letters jax throughout manhattan and the bronx over the next few years jax bombed that tag of his on thousands of surfaces overpasses bridges viaducts walls billboards stores city buses private buses office buildings he tagged rockefeller center right beside that gold statue before getting tackled by two massive security bulls who laid into him hard with mace and nightsticks if young alonzo jackson found himself with five minutes of privacy and a flat surface jax appeared struggling to get through high school the son of divorced parents bored to death with normal jobs steady in trouble he found comfort as a writer graffiti guerrillas were writers not artists what keith haring the soho galleries and claimer ad agencies told everybody he ran with some local blood posses for a time but he changed his mind one day when he was hanging with his set on th and the treysevens drove by and pop pop pop jimmy stone standing right next to him went down with two holes in the temple dead fore he hit the ground all on account of a small bag of rock or on account of no reason at all fuck that jax went out on his own less money but a hell of a lot safer despite spraying his tag on places like the verrazano bridge and a moving a train car which was one phat story that even brothers in prison had heard of alonzo jackson unofficially but permanently renamed jax dove into his craft he started out simply bombing his tag throughout the city but he learned early that if thats all you do even if you lay it in every borough of the city youre nothing but a lame toy and graffiti kings wouldnt give you the time of day so skipping school working in fast food restaurants during the day to pay for paint or racking what he could steal jax moved on to throwups tags written fast but a lot bigger than bombing he became a master of the toptobottom doing the entire vertical height of a subway car the a train supposedly the longest route through town was his personal favorite thousands of visitors would travel from kennedy airport into the city on a train that didnt say welcome to the big apple it offered the mysterious message jax by the time jax was twentyone hed done two total endtoends covering the entire side of a subway car with his graffiti and had come close to doing a whole train every graffiti kings dream he did his share of pieces too jax had tried to describe what a graffiti masterpiece was but all he could come up with was that a piece was something more something breathtaking a work that a cluckhead crack addict sitting in a gutter and a wall street trader on new jersey transit could both look at and think man that is so fucking cool those were the days jax reflected he was a graffiti king in the middle of the most powerful black cultural movement since the harlem renaissance hiphop sure the renaissance mustve been def but to jax it was a smart persons thing it came from the head hiphop burst from the soul and from the heart it wasnt born in colleges and writers lofts it came right from the fucking streets from the angry and striving and despairing kids who had impossibly hard lives and broken homes who walked on sidewalks littered with cookie vials discarded by the crackheads and dotted with brown dried blood it was the raw shout from people who had to shout to be heard hiphops four legs delivered everything music in djing poetry in mc rapping dance in the bboys breakdancing and art in jaxs own contribution graffiti in fact here on th street he paused and looked at the place where the woolworths fiveanddime had stood the store hadnt survived the chaos after the famous blackout of but what had sprouted in its place was a righteous miracle the numberone hiphop club in the nation harlem world three floors of every kind of music you could imagine radical addictive electrifying bboys spinning like tops writhing like stormy waves djs spinning vinyl for the packed dance floors and mcs making love to their microphones and filling the room with their raw dontfuckwithme poems pounding in time to the rhythm of a real heart harlem world was where the throwdowns started the battles of the rappers jax had been lucky enough to see what was considered the most famous of all time the cold crush brothers and the fantastic five harlem world was long gone of course also gone scrubbed or worn away or painted over were the thousands of jaxs tags and pieces along with those by the other graffiti legends of the early hiphop era julio and kool and taki the kings of graffiti oh there were those lamenting the demise of hiphop which had become bet multimillionaire rappers in chrome humvees bad boys ii big business suburban white kids ipods and mp downloads and satellite radio it waswell case in point jax was watching a doubledecker tour bus ease to the curb nearby on the side was the sign raphiphop tours see the real harlem the passengers were a mix of black and white and asian tourists he heard snatches of the drivers rehearsed spiel and the promise that theyd soon be stopping for lunch at an authentic soul food restaurant but jax didnt agree with the claimers bitching that the old days were gone the heart of uptown remained pure nothing could ever touch it take the cotton club he reflected that s institution of jazz and swing and stride piano everybody thought it was the real harlem right how many people knew that it was for whiteonly audiences even the famed harlem resident w c handy one of the greatest american composers of all time was turned away at the door while his own music was playing inside well guess what the cotton club was fucking gone harlem wasnt and it never would be the renaissance was done and hiphop had changed but percolating right now in the streets around him was some brandnew movement jax wondered what exactly this one would be and if hed even be around to see it if he didnt handle this thing with geneva settle right hed be dead or back in prison within twentyfour hours enjoy your soul food he thought to the tourists as the bus pulled away from the curb continuing up the street for a few blocks jax finally found ralph who was sure enough leaning against a boardedup building dog jax said sup jax kept on walking where we goin ralph asked speeding up to keep pace beside the large man nice day for a walk it cold out walkingll warm you up they kept going for a time jax ignoring whatever the fuck ralph was whining about he stopped at papaya king and bought four dogs and two fruit drinks without asking ralph if he was hungry or a vegetarian or puked when he drank mango juice he paid and walked out onto the street again handing the skinny man his lunch dont eat it here come on jax looked up and down the street nobody was following he started off again moving fast ralph followed we walkin cause you don trust me yeah so why you aint trust me all of a sudden cause you had time to dime me out since i saw you last what exactly is the mystery here nice day fo a walk was ralphs answer he snuck a bite of hot dog they continued for a half block to a street that seemed deserted and the pair turned south jax stopped ralph did too and leaned against a wroughtiron fence in front of a brownstone jax ate his hot dogs and sipped the mango juice ralph wolfed down his own lunch eating drinking just two workers on their meal break from a construction job or window washing nothing suspicious about this that place shit they make good dogs ralph said jax finished the food wiped his hands on his jacket and patted down ralphs tshirt and jeans no wires lets get to it whatd you find the settle girl okay she goin to langston hughes you know it the high school sure i know it she there now i dont know you ask where not when only i hear something else from my boys in the hood the hood they be saying somebody got her back stayin on her steady who jax asked cops wondering why he even bothered of course itd be them seem to be jax finished his fruit juice and the other thing ralph frowned that i asked for oh the pharaoh looked around then pulled a paper bag from his pocket and slipped it into jaxs hand he could feel the gun was an automatic and that it was small good like he asked loose bullets clicked in the bottom of the sack so ralph said cautiously so jax pulled some benjamins from his pocket and handed them to ralph and then leaned close to the man he smelled malt and onion and mango now listen up our businesss done with if i hear you told anybody bout this or even mention my name i will find you and cap your fuckedup ass you can ask delisle and he will tell you i am one coalbad person to cross you know what im saying yes sir ralph whispered to his mango juice now get the fuck outa here no go that way and dont look back then jax was moving in the opposite direction back to th street losing himself in the crowds of shoppers head down moving fast despite the limp but not so fast as to attract attention up the street another tour bus squealed to a stop in front of the site of the longdead harlem world and some anemic rap dribbled from a speaker inside the gaudy vehicle but at the moment the bloodpainting king of graffiti wasnt reflecting on harlem hiphop or his criminal past he had his gun he knew where the girl was the only thing he was thinking about now was how long it would take him to get to langston hughes high chapter twelve the petite asian woman eyed sachs cautiously the uneasiness was no wonder the detective supposed considering that she was surrounded by a half dozen officers who were twice her size and that another dozen waited on the sidewalk outside her store good morning sachs said this man were looking for its very important we find him he mayve committed some serious crimes she was speaking a bit more slowly than she supposed was politically correct which was it turned out a tidy faux pas i understand that the woman said in perfect english with a french accent no less i told those other officers everything i could think of i was pretty scared with him trying the stocking cap on you understand pulling it down like it was a mask scary im sure it was sachs said picking up her verbal pace a bit say you mind if we take your fingerprints this was to verify that they were her prints on the receipt and merchandise found at the museum library scene the woman agreed and a portable analyzer verified that they were hers sachs then asked youre sure you dont have any idea who he is or where he lives none hes only been in here once or twice maybe more but hes the sort of person you never seem to notice average didnt smile didnt frown didnt say anything totally average not a bad look for a killer sachs reflected what about your other employees i asked them all none of them remember him sachs opened the suitcase replaced the fingerprint analyzer and pulled out a toshiba computer in a minute shed booted it up and loaded the electronic facial identification technique software this was a computerized version of the old identikit used to recreate images of suspects faces the manual system used preprinted cards of human features and hair which officers combined and showed to witnesses to create a likeness of a suspect efit used software to do the same producing a nearly photographic image within five minutes sachs had a composite picture of a jowly cleanshaven white man with trim light brown hair in his forties he looked like any one of a million middleaged businessmen or contractors or store clerks youd find in the metro area average do you remember what he wore theres a companion program to efit which will dress the suspects image in various outfits like mounting clothes on paper dolls but the woman couldnt recall anything other than a dark raincoat she added oh one thing i think he had a southern accent sachs nodded and jotted this into her notebook she then hooked up a small laser printer and soon had two dozen fivebyseveninch copies of unsub s image with a short description of his height weight and the fact he might be wearing a raincoat and had an accent she added the warning that he targeted innocents these she handed to bo haumann the grizzled crewcut former drill instructor who was now head of the emergency services unit which was new york s tactical group he in turn distributed the pictures to his officers and the uniformed patrolmen who were here with the team haumann divided the law enforcers up mixing patrol with esu which had heavier firepower and ordered them to start canvassing the neighborhood the dozen officers dispersed nypd the constabulary of the city of cool put their tactical teams not in armystyle armored personnel carriers but in offtheshelf squad cars and vans and carted their equipment around in an esu bus a nondescript blueandwhite truck one of these was now parked near the store as a staging vehicle sachs and sellitto pulled on body armor with shock plates over the heart and headed into little italy the neighborhood had changed dramatically in the past fifteen years once a huge enclave of workingclass italian immigrants it had shrunk to nearly nothing owing to the spread of chinatown from the south and young professionals from the north and west on mulberry street the two detectives now passed an emblem of this change the building that was the former ravenite social club home of the gambino crime family which longgone john gotti had headed the club had been seized by the government resulting in the inevitable nickname club fed and was now just another commercial building looking for a tenant the two detectives picked a block and began their canvass flashing their shields and the picture of the unsub to street vendors and clerks in stores teenagers cutting classes and sipping starbucks coffee retirees on benches or front stairs theyd occasionally hear reports from the other officers nothingnegative on grand kcopy thatnegative on hester kwere trying east sellitto and sachs continued along their own route having no more luck than anyone else a loud bang behind them sachs gasped not at the noise which she recognized immediately as a truck backfire but at sellittos reaction hed jumped aside actually taking cover behind a phone kiosk his hand on the grip of his revolver he blinked and swallowed gave a shallow laugh fucking trucks he muttered yeah sachs said he wiped his face and they continued on sitting in his safe house smelling garlic from one of the nearby restaurants in little italy thompson boyd was huddled over a book reading the instructions it offered and then examining what hed bought at the hardware store an hour ago he marked certain pages with yellow postit tabs and jotted notes in the margins the procedures he was studying were a bit tricky but he knew hed work through them there wasnt anything you couldnt do if you took your time his father taught him that hard tasks or easy its only a question of where you put the decimal point he pushed back from the desk which along with one chair one lamp and one cot was the only piece of furniture in the place a small tv set a cooler a garbage can he also kept a few supplies here things he used in his work thompson pulled the latex glove away from his right wrist and blew into it cooling his skin then he did the same with his left you always assumed a safe house would get tossed at some point so you took precautions thered be no evidence to convict you whether it was wearing gloves or using a booby trap his eyes were acting up today he squinted put drops in and the stinging receded he closed his lids whistling softly that haunting song from the movie cold mountain soldiers shooting soldiers that big explosion bayonets images from the film cascaded through his mind wssst that song disappeared along with the images and up popped a classical tune bolero where the tunes came from he generally couldnt tell it was like in his head there was a cd changer that somebody else had programmed but with bolero he knew the source his father had the piece on an album the big crewcut man had played it over and over on the greenplastic sears turntable in his workshop listen to this part son it changes key waitwaitthere you hear that the boy believed he had thompson now opened his eyes and returned to the book five minutes later wsssstbolero went away and another melody started easing out through his pursed lips time after time that song cyndi lauper made famous in the eighties thompson boyd had always liked music and from an early age wanted to play an instrument his mother took him to guitar and flute lessons for several years after her accident his father drove the boy himself even if that made him late to work but there were problems with thompsons advancement his fingers were too big and stubby for fret boards and flute keys and piano and he had no voice at all whether it was church choir or willie or waylon or asleep at the wheel nope he couldnt get more than a croak out of the old voice box so after a year or two he turned away from the music and filled his time with what boys normally did in places like amarillo texas spending time with his family nailing and planing and sanding in his fathers work shed playing touch then tackle football hunting dating shy girls going for walks in the desert and he tucked his love of music wherever failed hopes go which usually isnt very far beneath the surface sooner or later they crawl out again in his case this happened to be in prison a few years ago a guard on the maximum security block came up and asked thompson what the fuck was that how do you mean asked the everplacid average joe that song you were whistling i was whistling fuck yes you didnt know he said to the guard just something i was doing wasnt thinking damn sounded good the guard wandered off leaving thompson to laugh to himself how bout that he had an instrument all along one hed been born with one he carried around with him thompson went to the prison library and looked into this he learned that people would call him an orawhistler which was different from a tinwhistle player say like in irish bands orawhistlers are rare most people have very limited whistling range and could make good livings as professional musicians in concerts advertising tv and movies everybody knew the bridge on the river kwai theme of course you couldnt even think about it without whistling the first few notes at least in your head there were even orawhistling competitions the most famous being the international grand championship which featured dozens of performers many of them appeared regularly with orchestras around the world and had their own cabaret acts wssst another tune came into his head thompson boyd exhaled the notes softly getting a soft trill he noticed hed moved his out of reach that wasnt doing things by the book he pulled the pistol closer then returned to the instruction booklet again sticking more postit notes onto pages glancing into the shopping bag to make sure he had everything he needed he thought that he had the technique down but as always when he approached something new he was going to learn everything cold before executing the job nothing rhyme sachs said into the microphone dangling near her ample lips that his prior good mood had vanished like steam was evident when he snapped nothing nobodys seen him where are you weve covered basically all of little italy lon and ire at the south end canal street hell rhyme muttered we could sachs stopped speaking whats that what rhyme asked hold on a minute to sellitto she said come on displaying her badge she forced her way through four lanes of thick attitudinal traffic she looked around then started south on elizabeth street a dark canyon of tenements retail shops and warehouses she stopped again smell that rhyme asked caustically smell im asking lon yeah the big detective said what is that something you know sweet sachs pointed to a wholesale herbal products soap and incense company two doors south of canal on elizabeth street a strong flowery scent wafted from the open doors it was jasmine the aroma that theyd detected on the rape pack and that geneva herself had smelled at the museum we might have a lead rhyme ill call you back yeah yeah the slim chinese man in the herbal wholesaler said gazing at the efit composite picture of unsub i see him some upstair he not there a lot what he do is he up there now dont know dont know think i saw him today what he do which apartment the man shrugged the herbal import company took up the first floor but at the end of the dim entryway past a security door were steep stairs leading up into darkness sellitto pulled out his radio and called in on the operations frequency weve got him whos this haumann snapped oh sorry its sellitto were two buildings south of canal on elizabeth weve got a positive id on the tenant might be in the building now esu command all units you copy k affirmative responses filled the airwaves sachs identified herself and transmitted make it a silent rollup and stay off elizabeth he can see the street from the window in the front roger fiveeighteightfive whats the address im calling in for a noknock warrant k sachs gave him the street number out less than fifteen minutes later the teams were on site and s and s officers were checking out the front and rear of the building with binoculars and infrared and sonic sensors the lead search and surveillance officer said therere four floors in the building import warehouse is on the ground we can see into the second and the fourth floors theyre occupied asian families elderly couple on the second and the tops got a woman and four or five kids haumann said and the third floor windows are curtained but the infrared scans positive for heat could be a tv or heater but could be human and were getting some sounds music and the creaking of floors sounds like sachs looked at the building directory the plate above the intercom button for the third floor was empty an officer arrived and gave haumann a piece of paper it was the search warrant signed by a state court judge and had just been faxed to the esu command post truck haumann looked it over made sure the address was correct a wrong noknock could subject them to liability and jeopardize the case against the unsub but the paper was in order haumann said two entry teams four people each front stairwell and back fire escape a battering ram at the front he pulled eight officers from the group and divided them into two groups one of them a team was to go through the front b was on the fire escape he told the second group you take out the window on the three count and hit him with a flashbang twosecond delay roger on zero take out the front door he said to the head of the a team then he assigned other officers to guard the innocents doors and to be backup now deploy move move move the troopers mostly men two women moved out as haumann ordered the b team went around to the back of the building while sachs and haumann joined the a team along with an officer manning the battering ram under normal circumstances a crime scene officer wouldnt be allowed on an entry team but haumann had seen sachs under fire and knew she could pull her own and more important the esu officers themselves welcomed her theyd never admit it at least not to her but they considered sachs one of them and were glad to have her it didnt hurt of course that she was one of the top pistol shots on the force as for sachs herself well she just plain liked doing kickins sellitto volunteered to remain downstairs and keep an eye on the street her knees aching from arthritis sachs climbed with the other officers to the third floor she stepped close to the door and listened she nodded to haumann i can hear something she whispered haumann said into his radio team b report were in position sachs heard in her earpiece cant see inside but were ready to go the commander looked at the team around them the huge officer with the battering ram a weighted tube about three feet long nodded another cop crouched beside him and closed his fingers around the doorknob to see if it was locked into his mike haumann whispered fivefourthree silence this was the moment when they shouldve heard the sound of breaking glass and then the explosion of the stun grenade nothing and something was wrong here too the officer gripping the knob was shivering fiercely moaning jesus sachs thought staring at him the guy was having a fit or something a tactical entry officer with epilepsy why the hell hadnt that shown up in his medical whats wrong haumann whispered to him the man didnt reply the quaking grew worse his eyes were wide and only the whites showed b team report the commander called into his radio whats going on k command the windows boarded up the b team leader transmitted plywood we cant get a grenade in status of alpha k the officer at the door had slumped now his hand frozen on the knob still shivering haumann whispered in a harsh voice were wasting time get him out of the way and take the door out now another officer grabbed the seizing one the second one began to shake too the other officers stepped back one muttered whats going it was then that the first officers hair caught fire he wired the door haumann was pointing to a metal plate on the floor you saw these often in old buildings they were used as cheap patches on hardwood floors this one though had been used by unsub to make an electric booby trap high voltage was coursing through both men fire was sprouting from the first officers head his eyebrows the backs of his hands then his collar the other cop was unconscious now but still quivering horribly jesus an officer whispered in spanish haumann tossed his h k machine gun to a nearby officer took the battering ram and swung it hard at the wrist of the officer gripping the knob bones probably shattered but the ram knocked his fingers loose the circuit broken the two men collapsed sachs beat out the flames which were filling the hallway with the revolting smell of burnt hair and flesh two of the backup officers began cpr on their unconscious colleagues while an ateam cop grabbed the handles of the battering ram and swung it into the door which burst open the team raced inside guns up sachs followed it took only five seconds to learn that the apartment was empty chapter thirteen bo haumann called into his radio b team b team were inside no sign of the suspect get downstairs sweep the alley but remember he waited around at the last scene he goes for innocents and he goes for cops a desk lamp burned and when sachs touched the seat of the chair she found it was warm a small closedcircuit tv sat on the desk the fuzzy screen showing the hallway in front of the door hed had a security camera hidden somewhere outside and seen them coming the killer had gotten away only moments ago but where the officers looked around for an escape route the window by the fire escape was covered with plywood the other was uncovered but it was thirty feet above the alley he was here how the helld he get away the answer came a moment later found this an officer called hed been looking under the bed he pulled the cot away from the wall revealing a hole just big enough for a person to crawl through it looked like the unsub had cut through the plaster and removed the brick wall between this building and the one next door when he saw them on the tv monitor hed simply kicked out the plaster on the other side of the wall and slipped into the adjoining building haumann sent more officers to check the roof and nearby streets others to find and cover the entrances into the building next door somebody into the hole the esu commander ordered ill go sir a short officer said but with his bulky armor even he couldnt fit through the gap ill do it sachs said by far the slimmest of the officers present but i need this room cleared to save the evidence roger that well get you inside then pull back haumann ordered the bed moved aside sachs knelt down and shone her flashlight through the hole on the other side of which was a catwalk in a warehouse or factory to reach it she had a fourfoot crawl through the tight space shit muttered amelia sachs the woman whod drive miles per hour and trade shots face to face with cornered perps but came close to paralysis at the hint of claustrophobia headfirst or feet she sighed headfirst would be spookier but safer at least shed have a few seconds to find the umsubs firing position before he could draw a target she looked into the tight dark space a deep breath pistol in hand she started forward what the hells the matter with me lon sellitto thought standing in front of the warehouse beside the herbal goods importer the building whose front door he was supposed to be guarding he stared at this doorway and at the windows looking for the escaped unsub praying the perp would show up so he could nail him praying that he wouldnt what the hells the matter in his years on the force sellitto had been in a dozen firefights taken weapons off crankedup psychos even wrestled a suicide off the roof of the flatiron building with nothing but six inches of ornate trim separating him from heaven hed gotten shook sometimes sure but hed always bounced right back nothingd ever affected him like barrys death this morning being in the line of fire had spooked him no denying that but this was something else something to do with being so close to a person at that one momentthe moment of death he couldnt get the librarians voice out of his head his last words as a living person i didnt really see couldnt forget the sound of the three bullets striking his chest either taptaptap they were soft barely audible faint slaps hed never heard a noise like that lon sellitto now shivered and felt nauseous and the mans brown eyesthey were looking right into sellittos when the slugs hit in a fraction of an instant there was surprise then pain thennothing it was the oddest thing sellitto had ever seen not like drifting off to sleep not distracted the only way to describe it one moment there was something complicated and real behind the eyes and then an instant later even before he crumpled to the sidewalk there was nothing the detective had remained frozen staring at the limp doll lying in front of him despite the fact that he knew he should be trying to run down the shooter the medics had actually jostled him aside to get to barry sellitto had been unable to move taptaptap then when it came time to call barrys next of kin sellitto had balked again hed made plenty of those difficult calls over the years none of them easy of course but today he simply couldnt face it hed made up some bullshit excuse about his phone and let someone else do the duty he was afraid his voice would crack he was afraid hed cry which hed never done in his decades of service now he heard the radio report on the futile pursuit of the perp hearing tap tap tap fuck i just want to go home he wanted to be with rachel have a beer with her on their porch in brooklyn well too early for beer a coffee or maybe it wasnt too early for a beer or a scotch he wanted to be sitting there watching the grass and trees talking or not saying anything just to be with her suddenly the detectives thoughts shifted to his teenage son who lived with sellittos ex he hadnt called the boy for three or four days had to do that he shit sellitto realized that he was standing in the middle of elizabeth street with his back to the building he was supposed to be guarding lost in thought jesus christ whatre you doing the shooters loose around here somewhere and youre fucking daydreaming he could be waiting in that alley there or the other one just like he was that morning crouching sellitto turned back examining the dark windows smudged or shaded the perp could be behind any one of them sighting down on him right now with that fucking little gun of his tap tapthe needles from the bullets tearing flesh to shreds as they fanned out sellitto shivered and stepped back taking refuge between two parked delivery trucks out of sight of the windows peering around the side of one van he watched the black windows he watched the door but those werent what he saw no he was seeing the brown eyes of the librarian in front of him a few feet away i didnt tap tap life becoming no life those eyes he wiped his shooting hand on his suit trousers telling himself that he was sweating only because of the body armor what was with the fucking weather it was too hot for october who the hell wouldnt sweat i cant see him k sachs whispered into her microphone say again was haumanns staticky reply no sign of him k the warehouse into which unsub had fled was essentially one big open space divided by mesh catwalks on the floor were pallets of olive oil bottles and tomato sauce cans sealed in shrinkwrap the catwalk she stood on was about thirty feet up around the perimeter level with the unsubs apartment in the building next door it was a working warehouse though probably used only sporadically there were no signs that employees had been here recently the lights were out but enough illumination filtered through greasy skylights to give her a view of the place the floors were swept clean and she could find no footprints to reveal which way unsub had gone in addition to the front door and back loadingdock door there were two others on the groundfloor level to the side one labeled restroom the other unmarked moving slowly swinging her glock ahead of her her flashlight beam seeking a target amelia sachs soon cleared the catwalks and the open area of the warehouse she reported this to haumann esu officers then kicked in the loadingdock door of the warehouse and entered spreading out relieved for the reinforcements she used hand signals to point to the two side doors the cops converged on them haumann radioed weve been canvassing but nobodys seen him outside he might still be inside k sachs quietly acknowledged the transmission she walked down the stairs to the main floor joining up with the other officers she pointed to the bathroom on three she whispered they nodded one pointed to himself but she shook her head meaning she was going in on point sachs was furious that the perp had gotten away that he had a rape pack in a smileyface bag that hed shot an innocent simply for diversion she wanted this guy nailed and she wanted to make sure she had a piece of him she was in the armored vest of course but she couldnt help thinking about what would happen if one of those needle bullets hit her face or arm or throat she held up a single finger one go in fast go in low with two pounds of pressure on the twoandahalfpound trigger you sure about this girl an image of lincoln rhyme came to mind two then a memory of her patrolman father imparting his philosophy of life from his deathbed remember amie when you move they cant getcha so move three she nodded an officer kicked the door open nobody was going near any metal doorknobs and sachs lunged forward dropping into a painful crouch and spraying the flashlight beam around the small windowless bathroom empty she backed out and turned to the other door the same routine here on three another powerful kick the door cracked inward guns and flashlights up sachs thought brother never easy is it she was looking down a long stairway that descended into pitchblack darkness she noted that there were no backs on the stairs which meant that the unsub could stand behind them and shoot into their ankles calves or backs as they descended dark she whispered the men shut out their flashlights mounted to the barrels of their machine guns sachs went first knees aching twice she nearly tumbled down the uneven loose steps four esu officers followed her corner formation she whispered knowing she wasnt technically in charge but unable to stop herself at this point the troops didnt question her touching one anothers shoulders to orient themselves they formed a rough square each facing outward and guarding a quadrant of the basement lights the beams of the powerful halogens suddenly filled the small space as the guns sought targets she saw no threat heard no sounds except one fucking loud heartbeat she thought but thats mine the basement contained a furnace pipes oil tanks about a thousand empty beer bottles piles of trash a half dozen edgy rats two officers probed the stinking garbage bags but the perp was clearly not here she radioed haumann what theyd found no one else had seen a sign of the unsub all the officers were going to rendezvous at the command post truck to continue the canvass of the neighborhood while sachs searched the scenes for evidence with everybody keeping in mind that as at the museum earlier the killer might still be nearby watch your back sighing she replaced her weapon and turned toward the stairs then paused if she took the same flight of steps back up to the main floor a nightmare on her arthritic knees shed still have to walk down another flight to street level an easier alternative was to take the much shorter stairway directly to the sidewalk sometimes she reflected turning toward it you just have to pamper yourself lon sellitto had become obsessed with one particular window hed heard the transmission that the warehouse was clear but he wondered if esu had actually gotten into all the nooks and crannies after all everybodyd missed the unsub that morning at the museum hed easily gotten within pistol range tap tap tap that one window far right second floorit seemed to sellitto that it had quivered once or twice maybe just the wind but maybe the motion was from somebody trying to open it or aiming through it tap he shivered and stepped back hey he called to an esu officer whod just come out of the herbal importers take a look you see anything in that window where that one sellitto leaned out of cover just a bit and pointed to the black glass square naw but the places cleared didnt you hear sellitto leaned out from cover a bit farther hearing tap tap tap seeing brown eyes going lifeless he squinted and shivering looked the window over carefully then in his periphery he suddenly saw motion to his left and heard the squeal of a door opening a flash of light as the cold sun reflected off something metallic its him god sellitto whispered he went for his gun crouching and spinning toward the glint but instead of following procedures when speeddrawing a weapon and keeping his index finger outside the trigger guard he yanked the colt from his holster in a panic which is why the gun discharged an instant later sending the slug directly toward the spot where amelia sachs was emerging from the basement door to the warehouse chapter fourteen standing at the corner of canal and sixth a dozen blocks from his safe house thompson boyd waited for the light to change he caught his breath and wiped his damp face he wasnt shaken he wasnt freaked out the breathlessness and sweat were from the sprint to safety but he was curious how theyd found him he was always so careful with his contacts and the phones he used and always checking to see if he was being followed that he guessed it had to be through physical evidence made sense because he was pretty sure that the woman in white walking through the museum library scene like a sidewinder snake had been in the hallway outside the apartment on elizabeth street what had he left behind at the museum something in the rape bag some bits of trace from his shoes or clothes they were the best investigators hed ever encountered hed have to keep that in mind gazing at the traffic he reflected on the escape when hed seen the officers coming up the stairs hed quickly placed the book and the purchases from the hardware store into the shopping bag grabbed his attaché case and gun then clicked on the switch that turned the doorknob live hed kicked through the wall and escaped into the warehouse next door climbed to its roof and then hurried south to the end of the block climbing down a fire escape hed turned west and started sprinting taking the course hed charted out and practiced dozens of times now at canal and sixth he was lost in a crowd waiting for the light to change hearing the sirens of the police cars joining in the search for him his face was emotionless his hands didnt shake he wasnt angry he wasnt panicked this was the way he had to be hed seen it over and over again dozens of professional killers hed known had been caught because they panicked lost their cool in front of the police and broke down under routine questioning that or they got rattled during the job leaving evidence or living witnesses emotion love anger fear makes you sloppy you had to be cool distant numb thompson gripped his pistol hidden in his raincoat pocket as he watched several squad cars speed up sixth avenue the vehicles skidded around the corner and turned east on canal they were pulling out all the stops looking for him not surprising thompson knew new yorks finest would frown on a perp electrocuting one of their own though in thompsons opinion it was the cops own fault for being careless then a faint tone of concern sounded in his brain as he watched another squad car skid to a stop three blocks away officers got out and began interviewing people on the street then another rolled to a stop only two hundred feet from where he now stood and they were moving this way his car was parked near hudson about five minutes away he had to get to it now but still the stoplight remained red more sirens filled the air this was becoming a problem thompson looked at the crowd around him most of them peering east intent on the police cars and the officers he needed some distraction some cover to get across the street just somethingdidnt have to be flamboyant just enough to deflect peoples attention for a time a fire in a trash bin a car alarm the sound of breaking glassany other ideas glancing south to his left thompson noticed a large commuter bus headed up sixth avenue it was approaching the intersection where the cluster of pedestrians stood set fire to the trash bin or this thompson boyd decided he eased closer to the curb behind an asian girl slim in her twenties all it took was an easy push in her lower back to send her into the buss path twisting in panic gasping she slid off the curb she fell thompson cried in a drawlfree shout get her her wail was cut off as the right sideview mirror of the bus struck her shoulder and head and flung her body tumbling along the sidewalk blood spattered the window and those standing nearby the brakes screamed so did several of the women in the crowd the bus skidded to a stop in the middle of canal blocking traffic where it would have to remain until the accident investigation a fire in a trash basket a breaking bottle a car alarm they mightve worked but hed decided that killing the girl was more efficient traffic was instantly frozen including two approaching police cars on sixth avenue he crossed the street slowly leaving the gathering crowd of horrified passersby who were crying or shouting or just staring in shock at the limp bloody body crumpled against a chainlink fence her unseeing eyes stared blankly skyward apparently nobody thought the tragedy was anything more than a terrible accident people running toward her people calling on mobile phoneschaos thompson now calmly crossed the street weaving through the stopped traffic hed already forgotten the asian girl and was considering more important matters hed lost one safe house but at least hed escaped with his weapons the things hed bought at the hardware store and his instruction book there were no clues at the apartment to lead to him or the man whod hired him not even the woman in white could find any connection no this wasnt a serious problem he paused at a pay phone called voice mail and received some good news geneva settle he learned was attending langston hughes high school in harlem she was also he found out being guarded by police which was no surprise of course thompson would find out more details soon presumably where she lived or even with some luck the fact that an opportunity had presented itself and the girl had already been shot to death the job finished thompson boyd then continued on to his car a threeyearold buick in a boring shade of blue a medium car an average car for average joe he pulled into traffic and circled far around the bus accident congestion he made his way toward the fiftyninth street bridge his thoughts occupied about what hed learned in the book hed been studying for the past hour the one bristling with postit tabs thinking about how hed put his new skills to use i donti dont know what to say miserable lon sellitto was looking up at the captain whod come directly here from police plaza as soon as the brass learned of the shooting incident sellitto sat on the curb hair askew belly over his belt pink flesh showing between the buttons his scuffed shoes pointed outward everything about him was rumpled at the moment what happened the large balding africanamerican captain had taken possession of sellittos revolver and was holding it at his side unloaded the cylinder open following nypd procedures after an officer has discharged a weapon sellitto looked into the tall mans eyes and said i fumbled my piece the captain nodded slowly and turned to amelia sachs youre okay she shrugged it was nothing slug hit nowhere near me sellitto could see that the captain knew she was being cool about the incident making light of it her protecting him made the big detective even more miserable you were in the line of fire though the captain said it wasnt any you were in the line of fire yes sir sachs said the caliber slug had missed her by three feet sellitto knew it she knew it nowhere near me the captain looked over the warehouse this hadnt happened the perp would stillve gotten away yep bo haumann said you sure it had nothing to do with his escape its going to come up the esu commander nodded its looking now like the unsub got onto the roof of the warehouse and headed north or south probably south the shot he nodded toward sellittos revolver was after wed secured the adjacent buildings sellitto again thought whats happening to me tap tap tap the captain asked whyd you draw your weapon i wasnt expecting anybody to come through the basement door didnt you hear any transmissions about the building being cleared a hesitation i missed that the last time lon sellitto had lied to brass had been to protect a rookie whod failed to follow procedure when trying to save a kidnap victim which hed managed to do that had been a good lie this was a coveryourownass lie and it hurt like a broken bone to utter it the captain looked around the scene several esu cops milled about none of them was looking at sellitto they seemed embarrassed for him the brass finally said no injury no serious property damage ill do a report but a shooting review boards optional i wont recommend it the relief flooded through sellitto an srb for an accidental discharge was a short step away from an internal affairs investigation as far as what it did to your reputation even if you were cleared grime stuck to you for a long long time sometimes forever want some time off the captain asked no sir sellitto said firmly the worst thing in the world for him for any cop was downtime after a thing like this hed brood hed eat himself drunk on junk food hed be in a shitty mood to everybody around him and hed get even more spooked than he was now he still recalled with shame how hed jumped like a schoolgirl at the truck backfire earlier i dont know the captain had the power to order a mandatory leave of absence he wanted to ask sachss opinion but that would be out of line she was a new junior detective still the captains hesitation in deciding was meant to give her the chance to pipe up to say maybe hey lon yeah itd be a good idea or its okay well manage without you instead she said nothing which they all knew was a vote in his favor the captain asked i understand some wit got killed right in front of you today right that have anything to do with this fuck yes fuck no couldnt say another long debate but say what you will about brass they dont rise through the ranks in the nypd without knowing all about life on the street and what it does to cops all right ill keep you active but go see a counselor his face burned a shrink but he said sure ill make an appointment right away good and keep me in the loop on how it goes yes sir thanks the captain returned his weapon and walked back to the cp with bo haumann sellitto and sachs headed for the crime scene unit rapid response vehicle which had just arrived amelia forget it lon it happened its over with friendly fire happens all the time statistically cops had a much higher chance of being shot by their own or fellow cops bullets than by a perps the heavyset detective shook his head i just he didnt know where to go from there silence for a long moment as they walked to the bus finally sachs said one thing lon wordll go around you know how that is but nobody civilianll hear not from me not being hooked into the wire the network of police scuttlebutt lincoln rhyme would only learn about the incident from one of them i wasnt going to ask that i know she said just telling you how im going to handle it she started unloading crime scene equipment thanks he said in a thick voice and realized that the fingers of his left hand had returned to the stigmata of blood on his cheek tap tap tap its a lean one rhyme go ahead he said through the headset in her white tyvek suit she was walking the grid in the small apartment a safe house they knew because of its sparseness most pro killers had a place like this they kept weapons and supplies there and used it as a staging spot for nearby hits and a hideyhole if a gig went bad whats inside he asked a cot bare desk and chair lamp a tv hooked up to a security camera mounted in the hall outside its a videotect system but hes removed the serial number stickers so we dont know when and where it was bought i found wires and some relays for the electric charge he rigged on the door the electrostatics match the bass walking shoes ive dusted everywhere and cant find a single print wearing gloves inside his hideyhole whats up with that rhyme speculated aside from the fact hes goddamn smart probably he wasnt guarding the place very carefully and knew itd get tossed at some point id just love to get a print hes definitely on file someplace maybe a lot of places i found the rest of the tarot card deck but therere no store labels on it and the only card missing is number twelve the one he left at the scene okay im going to keep searching she continued walking the grid carefully even though the apartment was small and you could see most of it simply by standing in the center and turning threesixty sachs found one piece of hidden evidence as she passed the cot she noticed a small sliver of white protruding from under the pillow she lifted it out opened the folded sheet carefully got something here rhyme a map of the street the africanamerican museums on therere a lot details of the alleys and entrances and exits for all the buildings around it loading zones parking spaces hydrants manholes pay phones mans a perfectionist not many killers would go to this much trouble for a hired clip stains on it too and some crumbs brownish sachs sniffed garlic crumbs look like food she slipped the map into a plastic envelope and continued the search ive got some more fibers like the other ones cotton rope id guess a bit of dust and dirt thats it though wish i could see the place his voice trailed to silence rhyme im picturing it he whispered another pause then whats on the surface of the desk theres nothing i told i dont mean whats sitting on it i mean is it stained with ink doodles knife marks coffee cup rings he added acerbically when perps are rude enough not to leave their electric bill lying around we take what we can get yep the good mood was officially deceased she examined the wooden top its stained yes scratched and scarred its wood yes take some samples use a knife and scrape the surface sachs found a scalpel in the examination kit just like the ones used in surgery it was sterilized and sealed in paper and plastic she carefully scraped the surface and placed the results in small plastic bags as she glanced down she noticed a flash of light from the edge of the table she looked rhyme found some drops clear liquid before you sample them hit one with some mirage go with exspray two this guy likes deadly toys way too much mirage technologies makes a convenient explosives detection system exspray no would detect group b explosives which include the highly unstable clear liquid nitroglycerine even a drop of which could blow off a hand sachs tested the sample had the substance been explosive its color would have turned pink there was no change she hit the same sample with spray no just to be sure this would show the presence of any nitrates the key element in most explosives not just nitroglycerine negative rhyme she collected a second dot of the liquid and transferred the sample to a glass tube then sealed it think thats about it rhyme bring it all back sachs we need to get a jump on this guy if he can get away from an esu team that easily it means he can get close to geneva just as fast chapter fifteen shed aced it cold twentyfour multiple choices all correct geneva settle knew and shed written a sevenpage answer to an essay question that called for only four phat she was chatting with detective bell about how shed done and he was nodding which told her he wasnt listening just checking out the halls but at least he kept a smile on his face and so she pretended he was and it was wack she felt good rambling like this just telling him about the curveball the teacherd thrown them in the essay the way lynette tompkins had whispered jesus save me when she realized shed studied for the wrong subject nobody else except keeshd be interested in listening to her go on and on like this now she had the math test to tackle she didnt enjoy calc much but she knew the material shed studied she had the equations nailed cold girlfriend lakeesha fell into step beside her damn you still here her eyes were wide you nearly got your own ass killed this morning and you dont stress it none that some mad shit girl gum you sound like youre cracking a whip keesh kept right on snapping which geneva knew she would you got a a already why you need to take them tests if i dont take those tests it wont be an a the big girl glanced at detective bell with a frown you ask me you oughta be out looking for that prick done attack my girlfriend here weve got plenty of people doing that how many and where they be keesh geneva whispered but mr bell gave a faint smile plenty of em snap snap geneva asked her friend so howd the wc test go the world aint civilized the world fucked up but you didnt skip told you id go was def girl i was all on it pretty sure i got myself an c least that maybe even an b funny they came to an intersection of hallways and lakeesha turned to the left later girl call me in the pm you got it geneva laughed to herself as she watched her friend steam through the halls keesh seemed like any other fine hookedup offtherack homegirl with her flashy skintight outfits scary nails taut braids cheap bling dancing like a freak to ll cool j twista and beyoncé ready to jump into fights even going right in the face of gangsta girls she sometimes carried a box cutter or a flick knife she was an occasional dj who called herself def mistress k when she spun vinyl at school dances and at clubs too where the bouncers chose to let her pass for twentyone but the girl wasnt quite as ghetto as she fronted shed wear the image the way shed put on her crazy nails and threedollar extensions the clues were obvious to gen if you listened closely you could tell that standard english was her first language she was like those black standup comics who sound like homies in their act but they get the patter wrong the girl might say i be at sammys last night but somebody really talking ebonics the new politically correct phrase was africanamerican vernacular english wouldnt say that theyd say i was at sammys be was only used for ongoing or future activity like i be working at blockbuster every weekend or i be going to houston with my aunt next month or keesh would say i the first one to sign up but that wasnt aave where you never dropped the verb to be in the first person only the second or third he the first one to sign up was right but to the casual listener the girl sounded bred in the hood other things too a lot of project girls bragged about perping merch from stores but keeshd never lifted so much as a bottle of fingernail polish or pack of braids she didnt even buy street jewelry from anybody who mightve fiended it from a tourist and the big girl was fast to whip out her cell phone and suspicious kids hanging around apartment lobbies during hunting season the times of the month when the welfare adc or social security checks started hitting the mailboxes keesh paid her way she had two jobs doing extensions and braids on her own and working the counter in a restaurant four days a week the place was in manhattan but miles south of harlem to make sure she wouldnt run into people from the neighborhood which would blow her cover as the djing blingdiva of th street she spent carefully and socked away her earnings to help her family there was yet one other aspect of keesh that set her apart from many girls in harlem she and geneva were both in what was sometimes called the sistahood of none meaning no sex well fooling around was okay but as one of genevas friends said aint no boy putting his ugly in me and thats word the girls had kept the virgin pact she and geneva had made in middle school this made them a rarity a huge percentage of the girls at langston hughes had been sleeping with boys for a couple of years teenage girls in harlem fell into two categories and the difference was defined by one image a baby carriage there were those who pushed buggies through the streets and those who didnt and it didnt matter if you read ntozake shange or sylvia plath or were illiterate didnt matter if you wore orange tank tops and storebought braids or white blouses and pleated skirtsif you ended up on the baby carriage side then your life was headed in a way different direction from that of girls in the other category a baby wasnt automatically the end of school and a profession but it often was and even if not a carriage girl could look forward to a heartbreakingly tough time of it geneva settles inflexible goal was to flee harlem at the very first opportunity with stops in boston or new haven for a degree or two and then on to england france or italy even the slightest risk that something like a baby might derail her plan was unacceptable lakeesha was lukewarm about higher education but she too had her ambitions she was going to some fouryear college and as a coalsavvy businesswoman take harlem by storm the girl was going to be the frederick douglass or malcolm x of uptown business it was these common views that made sistas of these otherwise opposite girls and like most deep friendships the connection ultimately defied definition keesh put it best once by waving her braceletencrusted hand tipped in polkadotted nails and offering in a proper use of aaves thirdpersonsingular nonagreement rule whaever girlfriend it work dont it and yeah it did geneva and detective bell now arrived at math class he stationed himself outside the door ill be here after the test wait inside ill have the car brought round front the girl nodded then turned to go inside she hesitated glanced back i wanted to say something detective whats that i know im not too agreeable sometimes pigheaded people say well mostly they say im a pain in the ass but thanks for what youre doing just my job miss sides half the witnesses and folk i protect arent worth the concrete they walk on im happy to be looking after somebody decent now go for another twentyfour multiple choice in a row she blinked you were listening i thought you werent paying attention i was listening yesm and looking out for you though ill fess up doing two things at onces pretty much my limit dont go expecting more than that okay now ill be here when you get out and i am going to pay you back for lunch i told you thats on the mayor only you paid for it yourself you didnt get a receipt well now lookit that you notice stuff too inside the classroom she saw kevin cheaney standing in the back talking to a few of his crew he lifted his head acknowledging her with a big smile and strode over to her nearly every girl in class whether pretty or plain followed his stroll surprise then shock flashed in their eyes when they saw where he was headed hey she thought to them triumphantly wrap your minds round that im in heaven geneva settle looked down face hot with pumping blood yo girl he said walking up close she smelled his aftershave wondered what it was maybe shed find out his birthday and buy him some hi she said voice trembling she cleared her throat hi okay shed had her moment of glory in front of the class which would last forever but now once again all she could think of was keeping him at a distance making sure he didnt get hurt because of her shed tell him how dangerous it was to be around her forget snapping forget yo momma jokes get serious tell him what you really feel that youre worried about him but before she could say anything he gestured her to the back of the classroom come on over here got something for you for me she thought a deep breath and she walked after him to the corner of the room here got you a present he slipped something into her hand black plastic what was it a cell phone pager you werent allowed to have them in school still genevas heart pounded hard wondering about the purpose of the gift was it to call him if she was in danger or could it be so that he could get in touch with her whenever he wanted to thiss phat she said looking it over she realized that it wasnt a phone or beeper but one of those organizer things like a palm pilot got games internet email all wireless wack how those things work thanks onlywell it looks expensive kevin i dont know about this oh its cool girl youll earn it she looked up at him earn it listen up nothing to it my boys and me tried it out its already hooked up to mine he tapped his shirt pocket what you do is first

see it then push that space button and then type in the answer you down with that the answer then listen up thiss important you gotta push this button to send it to me that little button with the antenna on it you dont push it it dont send second question push two then the answer i dont understand he laughed wondering why she wasnt getting it whatchu think we got a deal girl ill cover your back on the street you cover mine in class the realization hit her like a slap her eyes looked up bored into his you mean cheat he frowned dont go talking that shit out loud looking around youre kidding thiss a joke joke no girl you gonna help me not a question an order she felt she was about to choke or be sick her breathing came fast im not going to do it she held the organizer out he didnt take it whats yo problem lotta girls help me alicia geneva whispered angrily nodding and recalling a girl whod been in math class with them until recently alicia goodwin a smart girl a whiz in math shed left school when her family had moved to jersey she and kevin had been tight so thats what this was all about when hed lost his partner kevind gone looking for a new one and picked geneva a better student than her predecessor but not nearly as goodlooking geneva wondered how far down on the list shed fallen anger and pain raged in her like fire in a boiler this was even worse than what had happened at the museum this morning at least the man in the mask hadnt pretended to be her friend judas geneva raged you got a stable of girls feeding you the answerswhatd your gpa be if it werent for them im not stupid girl he whispered angrily just i dont need to learn this shit ill be playing ball and getting tall paper for endorsements the rest of my life better for everybody for me to practice sted of study for everybody she gave a sour laugh so thats where your grades come from you steal them like youd fiend somebody in times square for a gold chain yo girl i telling you watch yo

even go down on you i know what im about in that department go to hell she shouted heads turned listen up he growled gripping her arm hard pain surged you got the booty of a tenyearold and you go round like some blondie from long island thinking youre bettern everybody a peasyhaired bitch like you cant be too choosy when it comes to a man you know what im saying where you gonna find somebody good as me geneva gasped at the insult youre disgusting okay girl fine you frigid thats cool i pay you to help me how much you want a cnote two i got tall paper come on name yo price i gotta pass this test then study she snapped and flung the organizer at him he caught it in one hand and yanked her close to him with the other kevin a mans voice called sternly fuck the boy whispered in disgust closing his eyes momentarily letting go of her arm mr abrams the math teacher walked up and took the organizer away he looked at it whats this he wanted me to help him cheat geneva said the bitchs wack its hers and she come on were going to the office he said to kevin the boy stared at her with cold eyes she glared right back the teacher asked you all right geneva she was rubbing her arm where hed gripped her she lowered her hand and nodded just want to go to the bathroom for a few minutes go ahead he said to the class all staring all quiet well have a study period for ten minutes before the test the teacher escorted kevin out the back door of the classroom which filled suddenly with rapidfire gossip as if somebody had clicked off the mute button on a tv geneva waited a few seconds then followed looking up the corridor she saw detective bell standing with his arms crossed near the front door he didnt see her she stepped into the hallway and plunged into the crowd of students heading for their classes geneva settle didnt make for the girls room however she came to the end of the hallway and pushed through the door into the deserted school yard thinking nobody on earths going to see me cry there not a hundred feet from him jaxs heart gave a fast thud when he saw geneva settle standing by herself in the school yard the graffiti king was in the mouth of an alley across the street where hed been for the past hour waiting for a glimpse of her but this was even better than he hoped she was alone jax looked over the block there was an unmarked police car with a cop inside in front of the school but it was some ways from the girl and the cop wasnt looking at the school yard he wouldnt be able to see her from where he was even if he turned around this might be easier than hed thought so quit standing around he told himself get your ass moving he pulled a black dorag out of his pocket slicked down his fro with it easing forward pausing beside a battered panel truck the excon scanned the playground which reminded him a lot of the yard at prison minus of course the razor wire and gun towers he decided he could cross the street here and use the cover of a food emporium tractortrailer that was parked along the sidewalk its engine idling he could get to within maybe twentyfive feet of her without being seen by geneva or the cop thatd be plenty close enough as long as the girl continued to look down he could slip through the chain link unnoticed shed be spooked after everything thatd happened to her and if she got a glimpse of him approaching shed probably turn and run shouting for help go slow be careful but move now you may not get a chance like this again jax started for the girl picking his steps carefully to keep his limping leg from shuffling leaves and giving him away chapter sixteen was that the way it always worked did boys always want something from you in kevins case he wanted her mind well wouldnt she have been just as upset if shed been built like lakeesha and hed hit on her for booty or boobs no she thought angrily that was different that was normal the counselors at school talked a lot about rape about saying no about what to do if a boy got too pushy what to do after if it happened but they never said a word about what to do if somebody wanted to rape your mind shit shit shit her teeth ground together and she wiped the tears flung them away on her fingertips forget him hes a lame asshole the calc test thats all thats important d over dx times x to the nth equals motion to her left geneva looked in that direction and squinting against the sun saw a figure across the street in the shadows of a tenement a man with a black dorag on his head and wearing a dark green jacket hed been walking toward the school yard but then disappeared behind a big truck nearby her first panicked thought the man from the library had come for her but no this guy was black relaxing she glanced at her swatch get back inside only despairing she thought about the looks shed get kevins boys whod give her the bad eye the bling girls whod stare and laugh get her down get the bitch down forget about them who gives a shit what they think the test is all that matters d over dx times x to the nth equals nx to the nth minus one as she started back for the side door she wondered if kevin would be suspended or maybe expelled she hoped so d over dx times it was then that she heard the scrape of footsteps from the street geneva stopped and turned she couldnt see anyone clearly because of the glare of the bright sun was it the black man in the green jacket coming toward her the sound of footsteps paused she turned away started toward the school pushing aside every thought but the power rule of calculus equals nx to the nth minus one which is when she heard footsteps again moving fast now somebody was charging forward headed straight for her she couldnt see who is it she held her hand up to block the fierce sunlight and heard detective bells voice call geneva dont move the man was sprinting forward with someone else officer pulaski at his side miss what happened whyd you come outside i was three police cars squealed up nearby detective bell looked up toward the large truck squinting into the sun pulaski thats him go go go they were looking at the receding form of the man shed seen a minute ago the one in the green jacket he was jogging away quickly with a slight limp down an alley im on it the officer sprinted after him he squeezed through the gate and disappeared into the alley in pursuit of the man then a half dozen police officers appeared in the school yard they fanned out and surrounded geneva and the detectives whats going on she asked hurrying her toward the cars detective bell explained that theyd just heard from an fbi agent somebody named dellray who worked with mr rhyme one of his informants had learned that a man in harlem had been asking about geneva that morning trying to find which school she went to and where she lived he was africanamerican and wearing a dark green army jacket hed been arrested on a murder charge a few years ago and was now armed because the attacker in the museum that morning was white and might not know harlem very well mr rhyme concluded hed decided to use an accomplice who knew the neighborhood after mr bell learned this the detective had gone into the classroom to get her and found out that shed slipped out the back door but jonette monroe the undercover cop had been keeping an eye on her and followed her shed then alerted the police to where geneva was now the detective said they had to get her back to mr rhymes immediately but the test i no tests no school until we catch this guy bell said firmly now come on miss furious at kevins betrayal furious that shed been dragged into the middle of this mess she crossed her arms i have to take that test geneva you dont know what kind of muley i can be i aim to keep you alive and if that means picking you up and carrying you to my car rest assured i will do just that his dark eyes which had seemed so easygoing were now hard as rocks all right she muttered they continued toward the cars the detective looking around them checking the shadows she noticed his hand was near his side close to his gun the blondhaired officer trotted up to them a moment later lost him he gasped catching his breath sorry bell sighed any description black six feet solid build limp black dorag no beard or mustache late thirties early forties did you see anything else geneva she shook her head sullenly bell said okay lets get out of here she climbed into the back of the detectives ford with the blond officer beside her mr bell started for the drivers side the counselor theyd met earlier mrs barton hurried up a frown on her face detective whats wrong we have to get geneva out of here might be that one of the people wants to hurt her was close by still could be for all we know the heavy woman looked around frowning here we arent sure a possibility all im saying just better to play it safe the detective added were thinking he was here about five minutes ago africanamerican goodsized fella wearing a green army jacket and dorag cleanshaven limping he was on the far side of the school yard by that big truck there could you could ask students and teachers if they know him or saw anything else of course he asked her too to see if any school security tapes might have picked him up they exchanged phone numbers then the detective dropped into the drivers seat started the engine buckle up everybody we arent exactly going to be moseyin on out of here just as geneva clicked her seat belt on the policeman hit the gas and the car skidded away from the curb and started a rollercoaster ride through the ragged streets of harlem as langston hughes high school her last fortress of sanity and comfort disappeared from view as amelia sachs and lon sellitto organized the evidence shed collected at the safe house on elizabeth street rhyme was thinking about unsub s accomplice the man whod just gotten real damn close to geneva at her school there was a possibility that the unsub had been using this man solely for surveillance except that with the excons violent background and the fact he was armed he too was probably prepared to kill her himself rhyme had hoped that the man had shed some evidence near the school yard but no a crime scene team had looked over the area carefully and found nothing and a canvass team had located no witnesses on the street whod seen him or how he got away maybe hi lincoln a male voice said startled rhyme looked up and saw a man standing nearby in his midforties with broad shoulders a closecropped cap of silver hair bangs in the front he wore an expensive dark gray suit doctor didnt hear the bell thom was outside he let me in robert sherman the doctor supervising rhymes physical therapy ran a clinic that specialized in working with spinal cord injury patients it was he whod developed rhymes regimen of therapy the bicycle and the locomotor treadmill as well as aquatherapy and the traditional rangeofmotion exercises that thom performed on rhyme the doctor and sachs exchanged greetings then he glanced at the lab noting the bustle of activity from a therapeutic point of view he was pleased that rhyme had a job being engaged in an activity hed often said vastly improved ones will and drive to improve though he caustically urged rhyme to avoid situations where he could be say burned to death which had nearly happened in a recent case the doctor was talented and amiable and damn smart but rhyme had no time for him at the moment now that he knew two armed perps were after geneva he greeted the medico in a distracted mood my receptionist said you canceled the appointment today i wondered if you were okay a concern that could easily have been addressed via telephone the criminalist reflected but that way the doctor couldnt have put the same pressure on rhyme to take the tests as he could in person and sherman had indeed been pressuring him he wanted to know that the exercise plan was paying off not only for the patients sake but also so that the doctor himself could incorporate the information into his ongoing studies no everythings fine rhyme said a case just fell into our laps he gestured toward the evidence board sherman eyed it thom stuck his head in the doorway doctor you want some coffee soda oh we dont want to take up the doctors precious time rhyme said quickly now that he knows that theres nothing wrong im sure hell want to a case sherman asked still looking over the board after a moment rhyme said in a brittle voice a tough one very bad man out there one we were in the process of trying to catch when you stopped by rhyme wasnt inclined to give an inch and didnt apologize for his rude behavior but doctors or therapists who deal with sci patients know that they come with some bonuses anger bad attitudes and searing tongues sherman was completely unaffected by rhymes behavior the doctor continued to study rhyme as he responded no nothing for me thom thank you i cant stay long you sure a nod toward rhyme dont mind him im fine yes but even though he didnt want a refreshing beverage even though he couldnt stay long nonetheless here he was not making any immediate move to depart in fact he was pulling up a fucking chair and sitting down sachs glanced toward rhyme he gave her a blank look and turned back to the doctor who scooted his chair closer then he leaned forward and whispered lincoln youve been resisting the tests for months now its been a whirlwind four cases weve been working on and now five timeconsuming as you can imagineand fascinating by the way unique issues hoping the doctor would ask him for some details which would at least deflect the course of the conversation but the man didnt of course sci doctors never went for the bait theyd seen it all sherman said let me say one thing and how the hell can i stop you thought the criminalist youve worked harder on our exercises than any other patient of mine i know youre resisting the test because youre afraid it wontve had any effect am i right not really doctor im just busy as if he hadnt heard sherman said i know youre going to find considerable improvement in your overall condition and functional status doctortalk could be as prickly as coptalk rhyme reflected he replied i hope so but if not believe me it doesnt matter ive got the muscle mass improvement the bone density improvement lungs and heart are better thats all im after not motor movement sherman eyed him up and down you really feel that way absolutely looking around he lowered his voice as he said these exercises wont let me walk no that wont happen so why would i want some tiny improvement in my left little toe thats pointless ill do the exercises keep myself in the best shape i can and in five or ten years when you folks come up with a miracle graft or clone or something ill be ready to start walking again the doctor smiled and clapped his hand on rhymes leg a gesture he did not feel sherman nodded im so glad to hear you say that lincoln the biggest problem i have is patients giving up because they find that all the exercise and hard work doesnt really change their lives very much they want big wins and cures they dont realize that this kind of war is won with small victories i think ive already won the doctor rose id still like those scans done we need the data as soon as hey lon are you listening incoming cliché as soon as the deck is cleared sellitto who had no clue what rhyme was talking about or didnt care gave him a hollow look all right sherman said and walked to the door and good luck with the case well hope for the best rhyme said cheerily the man of small victories left the town house and rhyme immediately turned back to the evidence boards sachs took a call and listened for a moment hung up that was bo haumann those guys on the entry team the ones who took the electricity the first ones got some bad burns but hell live the other ones been released thank god sellitto said seeming hugely relieved man what that mustve been like all that juice going through you he closed his eyes momentarily the burns and the smell jesus his hair was fucking burnt off ill send him something no ill take him a present myself maybe flowers think hed like some flowers this reaction like his earlier behavior wasnt typical of sellitto cops got hurt and cops got killed and everybody on the force accepted that reality in his or her own way there were plenty of officers whod say thank god hes alive and bless themselves and trot to the closest church to pray their thanks but sellittos way was to nod and get on with the job not to act like this no clue rhyme said flowers mel cooper called out lincoln ive got captain ned seely on the line the tech had been talking to the texas rangers about the killing in amarillo that vicap had reported was similar to the incident at the museum speaker it he did and rhyme asked hello captain yes sir came the response a drawl mr rhyme thats right got your associates request for information on the charlie tucker case i pulled what he had but it wasnt much you think its the same fellow causing a stir up your way the mos similar to an incident we had here this morning his shoes were the same brand so was the tread wear and he left some fake evidence to lead us off the same way he left those candles and occult markings at tuckers killing oh and our perps got a southern accent there was also a similar killing in ohio a few years later that one was a contract hit so yallre thinkin somebody hired this fella to kill tucker maybe who was he tucker ordinary fellow just retired from the department of justice thats our corrections outfit down here was happily married a grandfather never in any trouble went to church regular rhyme frowned whatd he do for prisons guard in our maximum security facility in amarillohmmm you thinkin maybe a prisoner hired somebody to get even for something that happened inside prisoner abuse or some such could be rhyme said did tucker ever get written up nothing in the file here about it you might wanta check with the prison rhyme got the name of the warden of the facility where tucker had worked and then said thanks captain nothing to it yall have a good day a few minutes later rhyme was on the line with warden j t beauchamp of the northern texas maximum security correction facility in amarillo rhyme identified himself and said he was working with the nypd now warden j t if you please sir all right j t rhyme explained the situation to him charlie tucker sure the guard who was killed lynching or whatever i wasnt here then tucker retired just before i moved from houston ill pull his file put you on hold a moment later the warden returned ive got it right here nope no formal complaints against him cepting from one prisoner he said charlie was ridin him pretty hard when charlie didnt stop they got into a little scuffle bout it that could be our man rhyme pointed out cepting the prisoner was executed a week later and charlie didnt get hisself killed for another year but maybe tucker hassled another prisoner who hired somebody to even the score possible only hiring a pro for that little sophisticated for our lot down here rhyme tended to agree well maybe the perp was a prisoner himself he went after tucker as soon as he got out then set up the murder to look like some ritual killing could you ask some of your guards or other employees wed be looking for a white male forties medium build light brown hair probably doing time for a violent felony and probably released or escaped no escapes not from here the warden added okay then released not long before tucker was killed thats about all we know oh and he has a knowledge of guns ands a good shot that wont help thiss texas a chuckle rhyme continued we have a computer composite of his face well email a copy to you could you have somebody compare it to the pictures of releasees around that time yes sir ill have my gal do it shes got a pretty good eye but may take a while weve had ourselves a lotta inmates go through here he gave them his email address and they hung up just as the call was disconnected geneva bell and pulaski arrived bell explained about the accomplices escape at the school he added a few details about him though and told them that somebody was going to canvass the students and teachers and dig up a security tape if there was one i didnt get to take my last test geneva said angrily as if this were rhymes fault this girl could definitely get on your nerves still he said patiently i have some news you might be interested in your ancestor survived his swim in the hudson he did her face brightened and she eagerly read the printout of the magazine article then she frowned they make him sound pretty bad like hed planned it all along he wasnt that way i know it she looked up and we still dont know what happened to him if he was ever released were still searching for information i hope we can find out more the techs computer chimed and he looked it over maybe something here email from a professor at amherst who runs an africanamerican history website shes one of the people i emailed about charles singleton read it its from frederick douglasss diary who was he again pulaski asked sorry i probably should know got a street named after him and all geneva said former slave the abolitionist and civil rights leader of the nineteenth century writer lecturer the rookie was blushing like i say shouldve known cooper leaned forward and read from the screen may third another evening at gallows heights ah rhyme interrupted our mysterious neighborhood the word gallows again reminded him of the hanged man tarot card the placid figure swinging by his leg from a scaffold he glanced at the card then turned his attention back to cooper discussing our vital endeavor the fourteenth amendment several members of the colored community in new york and myself met with inter alia the honorable governor fenton and members of the joint committee on reconstruction including senators harris grimes and fessenden and congressmen stevens and washburne and the democrat andrew t rogers who proved far less partisan than we had feared governor fenton began with a moving invocation whereupon we began to present to the members of the committee our opinions on the various draft versions of the amendment which we did at length mr charles singleton was particularly articulate in his view that the amendment should incorporate a requirement of universal suffrage for all citizens negroes and caucasians women as well as men which the members of the committee took under advisement lengthy debates lasted well into the night geneva leaned over his shoulder and read particularly articulate she whispered out loud and he wanted voting for women heres another entry cooper said june twentyfifth i am troubled by the slow progress the fourteenth amendment was presented to the states for ratification one year ago and with expediency twentytwo blessed the measure with their approval only six more are required but we are meeting with stubborn resistance willard fish charles singleton and elijah walker are traveling throughout those states as yet uncommitted and doing what they can to implore legislators therein to vote in favor of the amendment but at every turn they are faced with ignorance in perceiving the wisdom of this law and personal disdain and threats and anger to have sacrificed so much and yet not achieve our goal is our prevailing in the war to be hollow merely a pyrrhic victory i pray the cause of our people does not wither in this our most important effort cooper looked up from the screen thats it geneva said so charles was working with douglass and the others on the fourteenth amendment they were friends sounds like or were they rhyme wondered was the newspaper article right had he worked his way into the circle to learn what he could about the freedmens trust and rob it although for lincoln rhyme truth was the only goal in any forensic investigation he harbored a rare sentimental hope that charles singleton had not committed the crime he stared at the evidence board seeing far more question marks than answers geneva can you call your aunt see if shes found any more letters or anything else about charles the girl called the woman with whom aunt lilly was living there was no answer but she left a message for one of them to call back at rhymes she then placed another call her eyes brightened mom are you home thank god rhyme thought her parents were back at last but a frown crossed the girls face a moment later nowhat happenedwhen a delay of some sort rhyme deduced geneva gave her mother an update reassured them she was safe and being looked out for by the police she handed the phone to bell who spoke to her mother at some length about the situation he then gave the phone back and geneva said goodbye to her and to her father she reluctantly hung up bell said theyre stuck in london the flight was canceled and they couldnt get anything else today theyre on the earliest plane out tomorrow it goes to boston and theyll catch the next flight here geneva shrugged but rhyme could see the disappointment in her eyes she said i better get back home i have some projects for school bell checked with his swat officers and genevas uncle everything seemed safe he reported youll stay out of school tomorrow a hesitation she grimaced would there be another battle then someone spoke it was pulaski the rookie the fact is geneva its not just you anymore if that guy today the one in the combat jacket had gotten close and started shooting there mightve been other students hurt or killed he might try again when youre in a crowd outside of school or on the street rhyme could see in her face that his words afffected her maybe she was reflecting about dr barrys death so hes dead because of me sure she said in a soft voice ill stay home bell nodded at her thanks and cast a grateful glance toward the rookie the detective and pulaski ushered the girl out the door and the others returned to the evidence from the unsubs safe house rhyme was upset to see there wasnt much the diagram of the street in front of the africanamerican museum which sachs had found hidden in the mans bed yielded no prints the paper was offtheshelf generic the sort sold at staples and office depot the ink was cheap and untraceable the sketch contained far more details of the alleys and buildings across the street than of the museum itself this map was for the mans escape route rhyme assumed but sachs had already searched those locations carefully and detectives had canvassed potential witnesses in the jewelry exchange and other buildings shown on the plan there were more fibers from the rope his garrotte they speculated cooper ran a portion of the map through the gcms and the only trace found in the paper was pure carbon charcoal from a street fair vendor he wondered maybe rhyme said or maybe he burned evidence put it on the chart maybe well find a connection later the other trace evidence on the map stains and crumbs were more food yogurt and ground chickpeas garlic and corn oil falafel thom a gourmet cook offered middle eastern and often served with yogurt refreshing by the way and extremely common rhyme said sourly we can narrow down the sources to about two thousand in manhattan alone wouldnt you think what the hell else do we have on the way back here sachs and sellitto had stopped at the real estate company managing the elizabeth street building and had gotten information on the lessee of the apartment the woman running the office had said the tenant had paid three months rent in cash plus another two months security deposit which hed told her to keep the cash unfortunately had been spent there was none left to fingerprint hed given his name as billy todd hammil on the lease former address florida the composite picture that sachs had done bore a resemblance to the man whod signed the lease though hed worn a baseball cap and glasses the woman confirmed that he had a southern accent a search of identification databases revealed hits for billy todd hammils throughout the country in the past five years of the ones who were white and between thirtyfive and fifty none was in the new york area the ones in florida were all elderly or in their twenties four billy todds had criminal records and of these three were still in prison and one had died six years ago he picked the name out of a hat rhyme muttered he looked over the computergenerated image who are you unsub he wondered and where are you mel email the picture to j t to our good ole boy warden down in amarillo a nod toward the picture im still leaning toward the theory our boys an inmate who had a runin with that guard who was lynched got it cooper said after hed done so he took the sample of liquid that sachs had found in the safe house carefully opened it up and prepared it for the gas chromatographmass spectrometer a short time later the results popped up on the screen thiss a new one to me polyvinyl alcohol povidone benzalkonium chloride dextrose potassium chloride water sodium bicarbonate sodium chloride more salt rhyme chimed in but it aint popcorn this time and sodium citrate and sodium phosphate few other things fucking greek to me sellitto shrugged and wandered into the hall turning toward the bathroom cooper nodded at the list of ingredients any clue what it is rhyme shook his head our database nothing send it down to washington will do the tech sent the information off to the fbis lab and then turned to the final item of evidence that sachs had found wood scrapings of the stains on top of the desk cooper prepared a sample for the chromatograph as they waited for the results rhyme scanned the evidence chart he was looking over the entries when he saw some fast motion from the corner of his eye startled he turned toward it but no one was in that portion of the lab what had he seen then he saw movement again and realized what he was looking at a reflection in the glass front of a cabinet it was lon sellitto alone in the hallway apparently believing no one could see him the fast motion had been the big detectives practicing a fast draw of his pistol rhyme couldnt see the mans face clearly but his expression appeared distressed what was this about the criminalist caught sachss eye and nodded toward the doorway she edged closer to the door and looked out watching the detective draw his weapon several more times then shake his head grimacing sachs shrugged after three or four minutes of the exercise the detective put his gun away stepped into the bathroom and without closing the door flushed the toilet and stepped out again a second later he returned to the lab jesus linc whenre you going to put in a classy john in this place didnt yellow and black go out in the seventies you know i just dont hold a lot of meetings in the toilet the big man laughed but too loudly the sound like the banter that inspired it rang false but whatever was troubling the man instantly ceased to occupy rhymes mind when the results of the gcms analysis flashed onto the computer screen the scrapings from the unsubs desktop at the safe house rhyme frowned the analysis had reported that the substance that had stained the wood was pure sulfuric acid news that rhyme found particularly discouraging for one thing from an evidentiary point of view it was readily available and therefore virtually impossible to trace to a single source but more upsetting was the fact that it was perhaps the most powerful and dangerous acid you could buy as a weapon even a tiny quantity could within seconds kill or permanently disfigure elizabeth street safe house scene used electrical booby trap

threatened for this work troubled by his secret chapter seventeen walking down a street in queens carrying his shopping bag and briefcase thompson boyd paused suddenly he pretended to look at a newspaper in a vending machine and cocking his head in concern at the state of world affairs glanced behind him nobody following nobody paying any attention to average joe he didnt really think there was a chance of a tail but thompson always minimized risks you could never be careless when your profession was death and he was particularly vigilant after the close call on elizabeth street with the woman in white theyll kill you in a kiss he now doubled back to the corner saw no one ducking into buildings or turning away fast satisfied thompson continued in the direction hed been heading originally he glanced at his watch it was the agreedupon time he walked to a phone kiosk and placed a call to a pay phone in downtown manhattan after one ring he heard hello its me thompson and the caller went through a little song and dance security stuff like spies to make certain each knew for sure who was on the other end of the line thompson was minimizing his drawl just like his client was altering his voice too wouldnt fool a voiceprint analyzer of course still you did what you could the man would already know the first attempt had failed since the local news had broken the story his client asked how bad is it we have a problem the killer tilted his head back and put murine into his eyes blinking as the pain dissipated thompson replied in a voice as numb as his soul oh well now you gotta understand bout what were doing here its like everything else in life nothing ever goes smooth one hundred percent nothing runs just the way wed like the girl outsmarted me a high school girl the girls got street smarts simple as that good reflexes she lives in a jungle thompson felt a brief pang that hed made this comment thinking the man might believe it referred to the fact she was black a racist thing though he only meant she lived in a tough part of town and had to be savvy thompson boyd was the least prejudiced person on earth his parents had taught him that thompson himself had known people of all races and backgrounds and hed responded to them solely on the basis of their behavior and attitudes not what color they were hed worked for whites blacks arabs asians latinos and hed killed people of those same races he could see no difference between them the people whod hired him all avoided his eyes and acted edgy and cautious the people whod died by his hand had gone to their rewards with varying degrees of dignity and fear which had nothing to do with color or nationality he continued wasnt what you wanted it wasnt what i wanted bet your bottom dollar but what happened was a reasonable possibility shes got good people watching her now we know well just rerig and keep going we cant get emotional about it next time well get her ive brought in somebody knows harlem pretty good weve already found out where she goes to school were working on where she lives trust me weve got everything covered ill check for messages later the man said and hung up abruptly theyd spoken for no more than three minutes thompson boyds limit by the book thompson hung up there was no need to wipe prints he was wearing leather gloves he continued down the street the block was a pleasant strip of bungalows on the east side of the street and apartments on the west an old neighborhood there were a few children nearby just getting home from school inside the houses here thompson could see the flicker of soap operas and afternoon talk shows as the women ironed and cooked whatever life was like in the rest of the city a lot of this neighborhood had never dug out of the s it reminded him of the trailer park and the bungalow of his childhood a nice life a comforting life his life before prison before he grew numb as a missing arm or a snakebit leg a block ahead of him thompson saw a young blonde girl dressed in a school uniform approach a beige bungalow his heart sped up a bit just a beat or two watching her climb the few concrete stairs take a key from her book bag open the door and walk inside he continued on to this same house which was as neat as the others perhaps slightly more so and featured a hitchingpost jockey with black features painted politically correct tan and a series of small ceramic deer grazing on the tiny yellowing lawn he walked past the bungalow slowly looking into the windows and then continued up the block a gust of wind blew the shopping bag in an arc and the cans clanked dully against each other hey careful there he told himself and steadied the bag at the end of the block he turned and looked back a man jogging a woman trying to parallel park a boy dribbling a basketball on a leafcovered driveway no one paid him any attention thompson boyd started back toward the house inside her queens bungalow jeanne starke told her daughter no book bags in the hall brit put em in the den mom the tenyearold girl sighed managing to get at least two syllables out of the word she tossed her yellow hair hung her uniform jacket on the hook and picked up the heavy knapsack groaning in exasperation homework her pretty midthirties mother asked she had a mass of curly brunette hair today tied back with a rosy red scrunchy dont have

curtain saw the form of a man slow as he approached the house this made her uneasy her boyfriend whose company made computer components for government contractors had stirred up some paranoia inside her always be on the lookout for strangers hed say you notice anybody slowing down as they drive past the house anybody who seems unusually interested in the childrentell me about it right away once not long ago theyd been in the park up the street with the girls who were playing on the swings when a car slowed up and the driver wearing sunglasses glanced at the children her boyfriend had gotten all freaked and made them go back to the house hed explained spies what no not like cia spies industrial spies from our competitors my company made over six billion dollars last year and im responsible for a good chunk of that people would love to find out what i know about the market companies really do that jeanne had asked you never really know about people had been his response and jeanne starke who had a rod imbedded in her arm where itd been shattered by a whisky bottle a few years ago had thought you never did true she now wiped her hands on her apron walked to the curtain and looked out the man was gone okay stop spooking yourself its but waitshe saw motion on the front steps and believed she saw a corner of a bag a shopping bag sitting on the porch the man was here what was going on should she call her boyfriend should she call the police but they were at least ten minutes away theres somebody outside mommy britney called jeanne stepped forward fast brit you stay in your room ill see but the girl was opening the front door no jeanne called and heard thanks honey thompson boyd said in a friendly drawl as he stepped inside the house toting the shopping bag shed seen you gave me a fright jeanne said she hugged him and he kissed her couldnt find my keys youre home early he grimaced problems with the negotiations this morning they were postponed till tomorrow thought id come home and do some work here jeannes other daughter lucy eight ran into the hallway tommy can we watch judge judy not today aw please whats in the bag thats the work i have to do and i need your help he set the bag down on the floor in the hallway looked at the girls solemnly and said you ready im ready lucy said brit the older girl said nothing but that was because it wouldnt be cool to agree with her sister she was definitely ready to help too after we postponed my meeting i went out and bought these ive been reading up on it all morning thompson reached into the shopping bag and pulled out cans of paint sponges rollers and brushes then he held up a book bristling with yellow postit tabs home decor made easy volume decorating your childs room tommy britney

first lucy took the book from him no me well all look together thompson said let me hang up my coat and put my briefcase away he headed into his office in the front of the house and returning to the kitchen jeanne starke thought that despite his incessant travel the paranoia about his job the fact that his heart didnt join into either his joy or his sadness the fact that he wasnt much of a lover well she knew she could do a lot worse in the boyfriend department escaping down the alley from the police at the langston hughes school yard jax had piled into a cab and told the driver to head south fast ten bucks extra you roll through that light then five minutes later hed told the man to circle back dropping him off not far from the school hed been lucky getting away the police were obviously going to do whatever was necessary to keep people from getting close to the girl he was uneasy it was almost like theyd known about him had that asshole claimer ralph dimed him after all well jaxd have to be smarter which is what he was trying to do right now just like in prison never make your move until youd checked everything out and he knew where to look for help city men always gravitated together whether they were young or old black or hispanic or white lived in east new york or bay ridge or astoria in harlem theyd gather in churches bars rap and jazz clubs and coffee shops living rooms on park benches and doorsteps theyd be on front stairs and fire escapes in the summer around burning trash drums in the winter barbershops too just like the movie from a few years ago jaxs real first name alonzo in fact had come from alonzo henderson the former georgia slave who became a millionaire by creating a popular chain of barbershops a man whose drive and talent jaxs father had hoped would rub off on the boy vainly as it turned out but the most popular place for men to congregate in harlem was on basketball courts theyd go there to play ball sure but theyd also go just to bullshit to solve the worlds problems to speak of women fine and women mean to argue sports to dis and to boast in a modern freewheeling version of signifying and toasting the traditional art of telling the tales of mythical characters in black culture like the criminal stackolee or the stoker on the titanic who survived the ice disaster by swimming to safety jax now found the closest park to langston hughes with basketball courts despite the chill autumn air and low sun they were plenty crowded he eased up to the nearest one and took off his combat jacket which the cops had probably tipped to turned it inside out and slung it over his arm he leaned against the chain link smoking and looking like a big version of pharaoh ralph he pulled off the dorag and brushed his fro up with his fingers just as well he changed his look he saw a squad car drive past slow along the street across from the playground jax stayed right where he was nothing draws cops faster than walking away hed been stopped dozens of times for the criminal offense of wwb walking while black at the court in front of him a handful of high school boys moved magically over the scuffed gray asphalt of a half court while another dozen watched jax saw the dusty brown ball smack into the ground then heard the delayed crack he watched hands grapple watched bodies collide watched the ball sailing toward the board the squad car vanished and jax pushed away from the fence and approached the boys standing on the edge of the court the excon looked them over not a posse no glocktoting gangstas just a bunch of boys some with tats some without some draped with chain some with a single cross some with bad intentions some with good preening for the girls lording over the little kids talking smoking being young watching them jax slipped into melancholy hed always wanted a big family but like so many other things that dream hadnt worked out hed lost one child to the foster system and another to his girlfriends fateful visit to the clinic on th street one january years ago to jaxs delight shed announced she was pregnant in march shed had some pains and theyd gone to a free clinic which was their only health care option theyd spent hours in the filthy overcrowded waiting room by the time shed finally gotten to see a doctor shed miscarried jax had grabbed the man and come close to beating him bloody not my fault said the tiny indian cowering beside a gurney they cut our budget the city did im saying jax was plunged into rage and depression he had to get even with somebody to make sure this didnt happen again to her or to anyone else it was no consolation when the doctor explained that at least theyd saved his girlfriends life which probably wouldntve happened if other planned budget cutbacks for healthcare to the poor had gone through how could a fucking government do that to people wasnt the whole point of city hall and the state capital to be there for the welfare of citizens how could they let a little baby die neither the doctor nor the police who led him out of the hospital that night in handcuffs had been inclined to answer those questions the sorrow and blistering anger at that memory made him all the more determined to get over with what he was about now grimfaced jax looked over the boys on the courts and nodded to the one that hed pegged as a leader of some kind wearing baggy shorts hightop sneakers and a sports jersey his hair was a gumby thin on one side rounded high on the other the boy looked him over sup grandpa some guffaws from the others grandpa in the old harlem well maybe the old everywhere being an adult carried respect now it got you dissed a playa wouldve taken the piece out of his sock and make this little claimer hop to but jax had been seasoned by his years on the street and years inside prison and knew that wasnt the way to go not here he laughed it off then whispered tall paper you want some i wanta give you some if youre interested asshole jax tapped his pocket where his wad of benjamins resided curled up fat i aint selling nothing and i aint buying what you think come on lets stroll the kid nodded and they walked away from the court as they did jax felt the boy looking him over noticing the mans limp yeah it was an igotshot limp but it couldve been a playagangsta limp just as easy and then he looked at jaxs eyes cold as dirt and then the muscles and the prison tat maybe thinking jaxs age wouldve made him headhigh og who you fucked with at your peril original gangstas had aks and uzis and hummers and a dozen badasses in their posses ogs were the ones used twelveyearolds to cap witnesses and rival dealers cause courts couldnt send them into the system forever like they did when you were seventeen or eighteen an og would bust you up bad for calling him grandpa the kid started to look uneasy yo yo whatchu want exactly man where we goin just over there dont want to talk in front of the whole world jax stopped behind some bushes the boys eyes darted around jax laughed im not going to fuck you up boy chill the kid laughed too but nervous im down man i need to find somebodys crib somebody going to langston hughes you go there yeah most of us he nodded toward the courts im looking for the girl was on the news this morning her geneva saw some dude get capped or something the straighta bitch i dont know she get straight as yeah she smart wheres she live he fell silent cautious debating was he going to get fucked up for asking what he wanted to he decided he wasnt you were talking bout paper jax slipped him some bills i myself don know the bitch man but i can hook you up with a brother who does nigger of mine name of kevin want me to give him a call yeah a tiny cell phone emerged from the boys shorts yo dog its willy the half courtsyeah listen dude here with some benjamins looking fo yo bitch geneva the settle bitchhey chill man sa joke you know what im sayingright now this dude he jax snatched the phone from willys hand and said two hundred you give up her address a hesitation cash kevin asked no jax snapped american fuckin express yeah cash ima come by the courts you got those cnotes on you yeah theyre sitting right next to my colt youre interested and when i say colt i dont mean malt in a forty im down man just askin i dont go round fielding folk ill be hanging with my crew jax said grinning at the uneasy willy he disconnected the phone and tossed it to the kid then he walked back to the fence and leaned against it and watched the game ten minutes later kevin arrived unlike willy he was a real playa tall handsome poised looked like some actor jax couldnt place to show off for the old dude show he wasnt too eager to earn any cnotes and to impress a few of the bling girls of course kevin took his time paused tapped fists hugged a boy or two tossed out yo yo my man a few times and then stepped onto the court commandeered the ball and did a couple of impressive dunks man could play hoops no question finally kevin loped up to jax and looked him over because that was what you did when an outsider walked into a pack whether it was on half courts or in a bar or even in alonzo hendersons victorianera barbershops jax guessed kevin tried to figure out where jax was carrying the piece how much paper he really had on him what he was about jax asked just lemme know how long youre going keep giving me the badeye okay cause its gettin boring kevin didnt smile wheres the benjamins jax slipped kevin the money wheres the girl come on ill show you just the address you afraid of me just the address eyes not wavering kevin grinned dont know the number man i know the building i walked her home last spring i gotta point it out jax nodded they started west and south surprising jax he thought the girl would live in one of the tougher neighborhoods farther north toward the harlem river or east the streets here werent elegant but they were clean and many of the buildings had been renovated it seemed there was also a lot of new construction underway jax frowned looking around at the nice streets you sure were talking geneva settle thats the bitch you ask about thats the crib im showing you yo man you wanta buy some weed some rock no sure i got some good shit a damn shame you going deaf and all at your young age kevin shrugged they came to a block near morningside park on top of the rocky incline was the columbia university campus a place he had frequently bombed with jax years ago they started to turn the corner but both of them stopped fast yo check it out kevin whispered there was a crown vic clearly an unmarked police car doubleparked in front of an old building thats her crib the cars in front of naw herss two buildings closer that one there he pointed it was old but in perfect shape flowers in the window boxes everything clean nice curtains paint looked new kevin asked you going to fuck up the bitch he looked jax up and down what im about is my business your business your business sure it is kevin said in a soft voice onlythe reason im asking is cause if she was to get fucked up which i have no problem with im saying but if something was to happen to her yo check it out id know it was you and somebody might come round and wanna talk to me bout it so im thinking with all that tall paper you carrying around in your pocket there maybe i had a little more of it i might forget i even seen you on th other hand its possible i could remember a lot bout you and that you was interested in the little bitch jax had seen quite a bit of life been a graffiti king been a soldier in desert storm known gangstas in prison and outside been shot atif there was a rule in this crazy world it was that however stupid you thought people were they were always happy to be stupider in a fraction of a second jax grabbed the boys collar with his left hand and swung his fist up hard into the boys gut three times four five fuck was all the boy got out the way you fought in prison never give em a single second to recover again again again jax let go and the kid rolled into the alley groaning in pain with the deliberate slow movement of a baseball player picking out a bat jax bent down and pulled the gun from his sock as terrified kevin watched helplessly the excon worked the slide of the automatic to chamber a round then wrapped his dorag around the barrel a number of times this was jax had learned from delisle marshall on s block one of the best and cheapest ways to muffle the sound of a gunshot chapter eighteen that evening pm thompson boyd had just finished painting a cartoon bear on the wall of lucys room he stepped back and glanced at his work hed done what the book had told him to do and sure enough it looked pretty much like a bear it was the first picture in his life hed ever painted outside of school which is why hed worked so hard studying the book in his safe house earlier today the girls seemed to love it he thought he himself should be pleased with the picture but he wasnt sure he stared at it for a long time waiting to feel proud he didnt oh well he stepped into the hallway glanced at his cell phone got a message he said absently he dialed hey its thompson how you doing saw you called jeanne glanced at him then returned to drying the dishes no kidding thompson chuckled for a man who didnt laugh he thought he sounded real of course hed done the same thing that morning in the library laughing to put the settle girl at ease and that hadnt worked so well he reminded himself not to overact man thats a bummer he said into the dead phone sure wont take too long will it got that negotiation again tomorrow yeah the one we postponedgimme ten and ill see you there he folded the phone closed and said to jeanne verns over at joeys hes got a flat vernon harber had once existed but no longer did thompson had killed him some years ago but because hed known vern before he died thompson had turned him into a fictional neighborhood buddy he saw occasionally a sidekick like the dead real vern the live fictional one drove a supra and had a girlfriend named renee and told plenty of funny stories about life on the docks and at the pork store and in his neighborhood thompson knew a lot more about vern and he kept the details in mind when you lie he knew lie big ballsy and specific he drove his supra over a beer bottle is he all right jeanne asked he was just parking the putz cant get the lug nuts off by himself alive and dead vern harber was a couch potato thompson took the paintbrush and cardboard bucket to the laundry room and set them in the basin ran water to soak the brush he slipped on his jacket jeanne asked oh could you get some twopercent on the way home quart thats fine and some rollups lucy called what flavor grape all right brit cherry the girl said her memory nudged her please she added grape and cherry and milk pointing at each of the females according to her order thompson stepped outside and started walking in a convoluted path up and down the streets of queens glancing back occasionally to make sure he wasnt being followed breathing cold air into his lungs exhaling it hotter and in the form of soft musical notes the celine dion song from titanic the killer had kept an eye on jeanne when hed told her he was going out hed noted that her concern for vern seemed real and that she wasnt the least suspicious despite the fact he was going to see a man shed never met but this was typical tonight he was helping a friend sometimes he said he wanted to place an otb bet or he was going to see the boys at joeys for a fast one he rotated his lies the lean curlyhaired brunette never asked much about where he went or about the phoney computer salesman job he claimed he had which required him to be away from home frequently never asked details about why his business was so secret he had to keep his home office door locked she was smart and clever two very different things and most any other smart and clever woman would have insisted on being included more in his life but not jeanne starke hed met her at a lunch counter here in astoria a few years ago after hed gone to ground following the murder of a newark drug dealer hed been hired to kill sitting next to jeanne at the greek diner hed asked her for the ketchup and then apologized noting that she had a broken arm and couldnt reach it he asked if she was all right what had happened shed deflected the question though tears filled her eyes theyd continued to talk soon they were dating the truth about the arm finally came out and one weekend thompson paid a visit to her exhusband later jeanne told him that a miracle had happened her ex had left town and wasnt even calling the girls anymore which hed done once a week drunk to rage at them about their mother a month later thompson moved in with her and the children it was a good arrangement for jeanne and her daughters it seemed here was a man who didnt scream or take a belt to anyone paid the rent and showed up when he said he would why they felt he was the greatest catch on earth prison had taught thompson a great deal about setting low bars a good arrangement for them and good for a professional killer too someone in his line of work who has a wife or girlfriend and children is far less suspicious than a single person but there was another reason he was with her more important than simple logistics and convenience thompson boyd was waiting something had been missing from his life for a long time and he was awaiting its return he believed that someone like jeanne starke a woman without excessive demands and with low expectations could help him find it and what was this missing thing simple thompson boyd was waiting for the numbness to go away and for the feeling in his soul to return the way your foot comes back to life after its fallen asleep thompson had many recollections of his childhood in texas images of his parents and his aunt sandra cousins friends from school watching texas a m games on the tube sitting around the sears electric organ thompson pushing the button for the chords while his aunt or father played the melody as best they could with their pudgy fingers they ran in the family line singing onward christian soldiers and tie a yellow ribbon and the theme from the green berets playing hearts learning how to use tools with his father in the perfectly neat work shed walking beside the big man in the desert marveling at the sunsets the lava beds coyotes the sidewinders which moved like music but could still sting you to death in a flash he recalled his mothers life of church packing sandwiches sunbathing sweeping texas dust out the trailer door and sitting in aluminum chairs with her girlfriends he recalled his fathers life of church collecting lp records spending saturdays with his boy and weekdays wildcatting on the derricks he recalled those wonderful friday evenings going to the goldenlight café on route for harleyburgers and fries texas swing music pumping through the speakers thompson boyd wasnt numb then even during that hard time after a june twister took their doublewide and his mothers right arm and nearly her life even when his father lost his job in the layoffs that swept the panhandle like an okie dust storm thompson wasnt numb and he sure wasnt numb when he watched his mother gasp and stifle tears on the streets of amarillo after some kid called her onearm and thompson had followed and made sure the boy never made fun of anybody again but then came the prison years and somewhere in those lysolstinking halls numbness crawled over feeling and put it to sleep so deep asleep that he didnt even feel a blip when he got the word that a driver snoozing at the cab of a peterbilt killed his parents and aunt simultaneously the only thing that survived being the shoeshine kit the boy had made his father for the mans fortieth birthday so deep asleep that when after he left prison and tracked down the guard charlie tucker thompson boyd felt nothing as he watched the man die slowly face purple from the noose struggling desperately to grip the rope and hoist himself up to stop the strangulation which you just cant do no matter how strong you are numb as hed watched the pendulum of the guards corpse twisting slowly to stillness numb as hed set the candles on the ground at tuckers feet to make the murder look like some psycho satanic thing and glanced up into the mans glazed eyes numb but thompson believed he could repair himself just like he fixed the bathroom door and the loose stair railing at the bungalow they were both tasks the only difference being where you put the decimal point jeanne and the girls would bring the feelings back all he had to do was go through the motions do what other people did normal people people who werent numb paint the childrens rooms watch judge judy with them go on picnics in the park bring them what theyd asked for grape cherry milk grape cherry milk try an occasional cuss word fuck fuck shitbecause thats what people said when they were angry and angry people felt things this was also why he whistled he believed music could transport him back to those earlier days before prison people who liked music werent numb people who whistled felt things they had families theyd turn the heads of strangers with a good trill they were people you could stop on the street corner and talk to people you could offer a french fry to right off your harleyburger plate with giddy music pounding in the next room aint them musicians something son how bout that do it by the book and the numbness would go away the feeling would return was it working he wondered the regimen hed set up for himself to get the feeling back in his soul the whistling reciting the things he felt he should recite grape and cherry cussing laughing maybe a little he believed he remembered watching the woman in white that morning back and forth back and forth he could honestly say that hed enjoyed watching her at work a small pleasure but it was a feeling nonetheless pretty good wait pretty fucking good he whispered there a cuss word maybe he should try the sex thing again usually once a month in the morning he could manage but truth was he just didnt want to if the moods not there even viagra wont do you much good he now debated yes thats what hed do give it a couple of days and try with jeanne the thought made him uneasy but maybe hed give it a shot thatd be a good test yeah hed try it and see if he was getting better grape cherry milk thompson now stopped at a pay phone in front of a greek deli he dialed the voicemail box number again and punched in the code he listened to a new message which told him that thered nearly been a chance to kill geneva settle at the school but too many police had been guarding her the message continued giving her address on th street and reporting that at least one unmarked police car and a squad car were parked nearby changing positions occasionally the number of officers guarding her seemed to vary from one to three thompson memorized the address and erased the message then continued on his complicated walk to a sixstory apartment building that was considerably more dilapidated than jeannes bungalow he went around to the back and opened the door he climbed the stairs to the apartment that was his main safe house he stepped inside locked the door then disarmed the system hed set up to stop intruders this place was a little nicer than the one on elizabeth street it was covered in blond paneling carefully tacked up and featured brown shag carpet that smelled just like what brown shag would smell there were a half dozen pieces of furniture the place reminded thompson of the rec room he and his father had built weekends in the amarillo bungalow which had replaced the tornadoshredded trailer from a large utility cabinet he carefully removed several jars and carried them to the desk whistling the theme from pocohantas the girls had just loved that movie he opened the toolbox put on thick rubber gloves and a face mask and goggles and assembled the device that tomorrow would kill geneva settle and anyone near her wssst the tune became something else no longer disney bob dylans forever young when he finished the device he examined it carefully and was satisfied he put everything away and then walked into the bathroom stripped off the gloves and washed his hands three times the whistling faded as he began mentally reciting the mantra for today grape cherry and milkgrape cherry and milk he never stopped getting ready for the day when the numbness would go away how you doing there miss okay detective mr bell stood in the doorway of her room and looked over her bed which was covered with schoolbooks and papers my i must say you do work hard geneva shrugged im going home to my boys now you have sons that i do two of em maybe youll meet them someday if youd like sure she said thinking thatll never happen are they at home with your wife theyre at their grandfolks right now i was married but she passed on these words flicked genevas heart she could see pure pain behind them in the way oddly enough that his expression didnt change as he spoke them it was like he practiced saying this to people and not crying im sorry oh that was some years ago she nodded wheres officer pulaski hes gone home hes got a daughter and his wifes expecting boy or girl geneva asked i honestly couldnt tell you hell be back tomorrow early we can ask him then your uncles in the next room and miss lynchll be staying here tonight barbe yesm shes nice she was telling me about some of the dogs she owns and about some of the new tv shows geneva nodded down at her books i dont have much time for tv detective bell laughed my boys could use a bit of your influence miss i will sure as rain get yall together now you shout out for barbe any reason you want he hesitated even you have a bad dream i know its tough sometimes your parents not home i do fine being alone she said i dont doubt it still holler if you need to thats what were here for he walked to the window peeked out through the curtains made sure the window was locked and let the drapes fall back night miss dont you worry well catch ourselves this fellow only a matter of time theres nobody better than mr rhyme and the people hes got working with him night glad he was leaving maybe he meant well but geneva hated to be treated like a child as much as she hated to be reminded of this terrible situation she cleared her books off the bed and stacked them neatly by the door so that if she had to leave fast she could find them in the dark and take them with her she did this every night she now reached into her purse and found the dried violet that that illusionist woman kara had given her she looked at it for a long moment then put it carefully into the book that was on the top of the stack and closed the cover a fast trip to the bathroom where she cleaned the pearlcolored basin after washing up and brushing her teeth she laughed to herself thinking of the unholy mess that was keeshs john in the hallway barbe lynch said good night to her back in the bedroom geneva locked the door then hesitated and feeling foolish propped the desk chair under the knob she undressed and pulled on shorts and a faded tshirt and got back into bed she shut the light out and lay on her back anxious and frenzied for twenty minutes thinking of her mother then her father then keesh kevin cheaneys image made an entrance she shoved it angrily away then her thoughts ended up on her ancestor charles singleton running running running the leap into the hudson thinking of his secret what was so important that hed risk everything to keep it hidden thinking of the love he had for his wife his son but the terrible man from the library that morning kept barging into her mind oh she talked big in front of the police but of course she was scared the ski mask the thonk as the club hit the mannequin the slap of his feet after her and now the other one too the black man at the school yard with the gun those memories killed sleep quickly she opened her eyes and lay awake restless thinking of another sleepless night years ago sevenyearold geneva had crawled out of bed and wandered into the living room of their apartment there shed turned on the tv and watched some stupid sitcom for ten minutes before her father stepped into the living room whatre you doing there watching that hed blinked at the light i cant sleep read a book better for you i dont feel like reading all right i will hed walked to the shelves youll like this one one of the best books ever as he sat in his armchair which creaked and hissed under his weight she glanced at the limp paperback but couldnt see the cover you comfy he asked yeah she was lying on the couch close your eyes im not sleepy close your eyes so youll picture what im reading okay whats hush okay hed started the book to kill a mockingbird for the next week his reading it out loud to her at bedtime became a ritual geneva settle decided it was one of the best books ever and even at that age shed read or heard a lot of books she loved the main characters the calm strong widower father the brother and sister genevad always wanted a sibling and the story itself about courage in the face of hatred and stupidity was spellbinding the memory of the harper lee book stayed with her and funny when she went back and reread it at age eleven she got a lot more of it then at fourteen she understood even more shed read it again last year and wrote a paper on it for english she got an aplus to kill a mockingbird was one of the books on the stack that sat beside the bedroom door at the moment the incaseoffiregrabthis pile it was a book that she tended to cart around in her book bag even if she wasnt reading it this was the book that shed slipped karas goodluckcharm violet into tonight though she picked another one from the stack charles dickens oliver twist she lay back rested the book on her chest and opened it to her flattened straw bookmark shed never turn down the pages in any book even a paperback she began to read at first the creaks of the town house spooked her and the image of the man in the mask came back but soon she lost herself in the story and not long after that an hour or so geneva settles eyes grew heavy and she was finally lulled to sleep not by a mothers goodnight kiss or a fathers deep voice reciting a prayer but by the litany of a strangers beautiful words chapter nineteen time for bed what rhyme asked looking up from his computer screen bed thom repeated he was a bit wary sometimes it was a battle to get rhyme to stop working but the criminalist said yep bed he was in fact exhausted discouraged too he was reading an email from warden j t beauchamp in amarillo reporting that nobody in the prison recognized the computer composite of unsub the criminalist dictated a brief thankyou and logged off then he said to thom just one call then ill go willingly ill straighten up some the aide said meet you upstairs amelia sachs had gone back to her place to spend the night and to see her mother who lived near her and had been sick lately some cardiac problems sachs spent the night with rhyme more often than not but shed kept her apartment in brooklyn where she had other family members and friends jennifer robinson the patrolwoman whod delivered the teenagers to rhymes that morning lived right up the street besides sachs like rhyme needed solitude from time to time and this arrangement suited them both rhyme called and talked briefly to her mother wished her well sachs came on the line and he told her about the latest developments few though they were you okay sachs asked him you sound preoccupied tired ah she didnt believe him get some sleep you too sleep well love you rhyme love you after he disconnected he rolled toward the evidence chart he wasnt however gazing at thoms precise entries about the case he was looking at the printout of the tarot card taped to a board the twelfth card the hanged man he reread the block about the meaning of the card he studied the mans placid inverted face then he turned and wheeled to the small elevator that connected the laboratory on the first floor to the bedroom on the second instructed the elevator to ascend and then wheeled out he reflected on the tarot card just like kara their illusionist friend rhyme didnt believe in spiritualism or the psychic they were both in their own ways scientists but he couldnt help but be struck by the fact that a card showing a scaffold just happened to be a piece of evidence in a case in which the word gallows figured prominently the word hanged too was a curious coincidence criminalists must know about all methods of death of course and rhyme understood exactly how hanging worked it snapped the neck high just below the base of the skull the actual cause of death in executionstyle hangings was suffocation though not from squeezing the throat shut but from cutting off the neuron messages to the lungs this is what had nearly happened to rhyme at the subway crime scene accident some years ago gallowsheights the hanged man the meaning of the tarot card though was the most significant aspect of the happenstance its appearance in a reading indicates spiritual searching leading to a decision a transition a change of direction the card often foretells a surrendering to experience ending a struggle accepting what is when this card appears in your reading you must listen to your inner self even if that message seems to be contrary to logic he was amused because hed been doing plenty of seeking lately before the unsub case and the appearance of the fortunetelling card lincoln rhyme needed to make a decision a change of direction now he didnt remain in the bedroom but instead drove to the room that was the epicenter of this churning debate his therapy room where hed spent hundreds of hours hard at work on dr shermans exercise regimen parking the wheelchair in the doorway he studied the rehab equipment in the dim room the ergometer bike the treadmill then he glanced down at his right hand strapped at the wrist to the padded arm of his red storm arrow wheelchair decision go on he told himself try it now move your hand breathing hard eyes riveted to his right hand no his shoulders slumped to the extent they could and he looked into the room thinking of all the grueling exercise sure the effort had improved his bone density and muscle mass and circulation reducing infections and the chance of a neurovascular episode but the real question surrounding the exercise could be summed up in a twoword euphemism from the medical specialists functional benefit rhymes translation was less foggy feeling and moving the very aspects of his recovery hed dismissed when speaking to sherman earlier today to put it frankly hed lied to the doctor in his heart not confessed to anyone was the burning need to know one thing had those tortured hours of exercise let him regain sensation and given him the ability to move muscles that had not moved in years could he now turn the knob on a bausch lomb microscope to bring a fiber or hair into focus could he feel amelia sachss palm against his as for the sensation perhaps there had been some slight improvement but a quadriplegic with a c level of injury floats in a sea of phantom pain and phony sensation all ginned up by the brain to taunt and confuse you feel flies crawling on skin where no flies have landed you feel no sensation whatsoever as you look down and realize that a spill of scalding coffee is burning off layers of your flesh rhyme believed though that he had a bit of improved sensation ah but about the big payoff movement this was the jewel in the crown of spinalcordinjury recovery he looked down at his hand once again his right hand which he hadnt been able to move since the accident this question could be answered simply and definitively no phantompain issues no ithinkmaybeifeelsomething responses it could be answered right now yes or no he didnt need mri scans or a dynamic resistance gauge or whatever contraption the doctors had in their little black bags right now he could simply send tiny impulses shooting to the muscle along the highway of neurons and then see what happened would the messengers arrive and make the finger curl which would be the equivalent of a worldrecord long jump or would they crash to a stop on a dead strand of nerve rhyme believed he was a brave man both physically and morally in the days before the accident there was nothing he wouldnt do for the job protecting a crime scene once he and another officer had held off a crazed mob of forty people trying to loot the store where a shooting had taken place when the cops could easily have dodged to safety another time hed run a scene fifty feet from a barricaded perp taking potshots at him in order to find evidence that might lead them to the location of a kidnapped girl then there was the time hed put his entire career on the line by arresting a senior police officer who was contaminating a scene simply to grandstand for the press but now his courage failed him his eyes boring into the right hand staring yes no if he tried to move his finger and wasnt able to if he couldnt even claim one of dr shermans small victories in this exhausting battle hed been fighting he believed that it would be the end for him the dark thoughts would return like a tide rolling higher and higher on the shore and finally hed call up a doctor once more oh but not sherman a very different doctor the man from the lethe society a euthanasia group a few years ago when hed tried to end his life he hadnt been as independent as he was now thered been fewer computers no voiceactivated ecu systems and phones ironically now that his lifestyle was better he was also more selfsufficient at killing himself the doctor could help him rig some contraption to the ecu and leave pills or a weapon nearby of course he had people in his life now not like a few years ago his suicide would be devastating to sachs yes but death had always been an aspect of their love with cop blood in her veins she was often first through the door in a suspect takedown even though she didnt need to be shed been decorated for her courage in firefights and she drove like hot lightning some would even say she herself had a suicidal streak within her in rhymes case when theyd met on a hard hard case a crucible of violence and death some years ago hed been very close to killing himself sachs understood this about him thom too accepted it rhyme had told the aide at the first interview i might not be around too much longer be sure to cash your paycheck as soon as you get it still he hated the thought of what his death would do to them and the other people he knew not to mention the fact that crimes would go unsolved victims would die if he wasnt on earth to practice the craft that was the essential part of his soul this was why hed been putting off the test if hed had no improvement it could be enough to push him over the edge yes the card often foretells a surrendering to experience ending a struggle accepting what is or no when this card appears in your reading you must listen to your inner self and it was at this moment that lincoln rhyme made his decision he would give up hed stop the exercises would stop considering the spinal cord operation after all if you dont have hope then hope cant be destroyed hed made a good life for himself his existence wasnt perfect but it was tolerable lincoln rhyme would accept his course and hed be content to be what charles singleton had rejected a partial man a threefifths man content more or less using his left ring finger rhyme turned his wheelchair around and drove back toward the bedroom just in time to meet thom at the doorway you ready for bed the aide asked as a matter of fact rhyme said cheerfully i am iii gallows heights wednesday october chapter twenty at am thompson boyd retrieved his car from the alley garage near the bungalow in astoria where hed parked it yesterday after escaping from the elizabeth street safe house he pulled the blue buick into congested traffic headed for the queensborough bridge and once in manhattan made his way uptown recalling the address from the message on the voice mail he drove into western harlem and parked two blocks away from the settles town house he was armed with his north american arms pistol and his club and carting the shopping bag which contained no decorating books today inside was the device hed made last night and he treated it very gingerly as he moved slowly down the sidewalk he looked up and down the street casually several times seeing people presumably headed for work an equal mix of blacks and whites many in business suits on their way to work and students heading to columbia bikes backpacks beards but he saw nothing threatening thompson boyd paused by the curb and studied the building the girl lived in there was a crown vic parked several doors away from the apartment smart of them not to flag it around the corner was a second unmarked car near a hydrant thompson thought he saw some motion on the apartment roof sniper he wondered maybe not but somebody was definitely there undoubtedly a cop they were taking this case real serious average joe turned around and walked back to his average car climbed in and started the engine hed have to be patient it was too risky for an attempt here hed have to wait for the right opportunity harry chapins cats in the cradle started to play on the radio he shut it off but continued to whistle the tune to himself never missing a single note never a fraction of a tone off pitch her greataunt had found something in genevas apartment roland bell got a call from lincoln rhyme who reported that genevas fathers aunt lilly hall had found some boxes of old letters and souvenirs and artifacts in the storage space of the building where she was staying she didnt know if there was anything helpful her eyes were hopeless but the cartons were chockablock with papers did geneva and the police want to look through them rhyme had wanted to have everything picked up but the aunt said no shed only give it to her greatniece in person she didnt trust anyone else police included bell had asked rhyme whod answered police especially amelia sachs had then broken into the conversation to offer what bell realized was the real explanation i think she wants to see her niece ah yesm got it not surprisingly geneva was more than eager to go roland bell truly preferred guarding nervous people people who didnt want to set foot on the concrete of new york city sidewalks who liked to curl up with computer games and long books put them in an interior room no windows no visitors no roof access and order out chinese or pizza every day but geneva settle was unlike anybody hed ever guarded mr goades please i was a witness to a crime and im being held by the police its against my will and the detective arranged for two cars for security thered be bell geneva and pulaski in his crown vic luis martinez and barbe lynch would be in their chevy a uniformed officer in another blueandwhite would remain parked near the settles apartment while they were gone as he waited for the second squad car to show up bell asked if thered been any more word from her parents she said that they were at heathrow now awaiting the next flight bell a father of two boys had some opinions about parents who left their daughter in the care of an uncle while they traipsed off to europe this uncle in particular no lunch money for the girl that was a tough row even though bell was a single father with a demanding job he still made his boys breakfast in the morning packed them lunch and made supper most nights however lame and starchy the meals might be atkins was not a word to be found in the roland bell encyclopedia of cuisine but his job was to keep geneva settle alive not comment on parents who werent much skilled at childrearing he now put aside thoughts of personal matters and stepped outside hand near his beretta scanning the facades and windows and rooftops of nearby buildings and cars looking for anything out of the ordinary the relief squad car pulled up outside and parked while martinez and lynch climbed into the chevrolet around the corner from geneva s apartment into his handitalkie bell said clear bring her out pulaski appeared hustling geneva into the crown victoria he jumped in beside her and bell took the drivers seat in tandem the two cars sped across town and eventually arrived at an old tenement east of fifth avenue in el barrio the majority of this area was puerto rican and dominican but other latin nationalities lived here too those from haiti bolivia ecuador jamaica central america both black and nonblack there were also pockets of new immigrants legal and otherwise from senegal liberia and the central african nations most of the hate crimes here werent white versus hispanic or black they were americanborn versus immigrant of whatever race or nationality the way of the world bell reflected sadly the detective now parked where geneva indicated and he waited until the other officers climbed out of the squad car behind them and checked out the street a thumbsup from luis martinez and together they hustled geneva inside the building was shabby the lobby smelling of beer and sour meat geneva seemed embarrassed about the condition of the place as at the school she again suggested the detective wait outside but it was halfhearted as if she expected his response probly better i go with you on the second floor she knocked and an elderly voice asked who there geneva im here to see auntie lilly two chains rattled and two deadbolts were undone the door opened a slight woman in a faded dress looked at bell cautiously morning mrs watkins the girl said hi honey shes in the living room another uncertain glance at the detective thiss a friend of mine he yo friend thats right geneva told her the womans face suggested that she didnt approve of the girl spending time in the company of a man three times her age even if he was a policeman roland bell maam he showed his id lilly said there was something about the police she said uneasily bell continued to smile and said nothing more the woman repeated well shes in the living room genevas greataunt a frail elderly woman in a pink dress was staring at the television through large thick glasses she looked over at the girl and her face broke into a smile geneva darling how are you and whos this roland bell maam pleased to meet you im lilly hall youre the one interested in charles thats right i wish i knew more i told geneva everything i know bout him got hisself that farm then got arrested that was all i heard didnt even know if he went to jail or not looks like he did auntie we dont know what happened after that thats what we want to find out on the stained floral wallpaper behind her were three photographs martin luther king jr john f kennedy and the famous picture of jackie kennedy in mourning with young john john and caroline beside her theres the boxes right there the woman nodded toward three large cartons of papers and dusty books and wooden and plastic objects they sat in front of a coffee table whose leg had been broken and ducttaped together geneva stooped and looked through the largest box lilly watched her after a moment the woman said i feel him sometime you bell asked ou kin charles i feel him like the other haints haint bell knew the word from north carolina an old black term for ghost he restless im feeling the greataunt said i dont know about that her grandniece said with a smile no bell thought geneva hardly seemed like the sort whod believe in ghosts or anything supernatural the detective though wasnt so sure he said well maybe what were doing herell bring him some rest you know the woman said pushing her thick glasses higher on her nose you that interested in charles there some other relations of ous round the country you member yo fathers cousin in madison and his wife ruby i could call him an ask or gennalouise in memphis or i would only i dont have no phone of my own a glance at the old princess model sitting on a tv table near the kitchen her grim expression evidence of past disputes with the woman she was staying with the greataunt added and phone cards they be so expensive we could call auntie oh i wouldnt mind talking to some of em been a while miss having family around bell dug into his jeans pocket maam since this is something geneva and ire working on together let me get you a phone card no this was from geneva ill do it you dont ive got it she said firmly and bell put the money away she gave the woman a twenty the greataunt looked reverently at the bill said ima get me that card and call today geneva said if you find out anything call us again at that number you called before whys the police all interested in charles man musta died a hundred years ago at least geneva caught bells eye and shook her head the woman hadnt heard that geneva was in danger and the niece wanted to keep it that way through her cokebottle lenses the woman didnt catch the look geneva said theyre helping me prove he didnt commit that crime he was accused of are they now after all them years bell wasnt sure the woman exactly believed her niece the detectives own aunt about this womans age was sharp as a needle nothing got by her but lilly said be right nice of yall bella lets make these folk some coffee and cocoa for geneva i remember thats what she likes as roland bell looked out carefully through a space between the drawn curtains geneva started through the box once again on this harlem street two boys tried to outdo each other at skateboarding down the tall banister of a brownstone flaunting the laws both of gravity and of truancy a black woman stood on a porch watering some spectacular red geraniums that the recent frost hadnt killed a squirrel buried or dug up something in the largest plot of dirt nearby a fivebyfourfoot rectangle dusted with yellow grass in the middle of which rested the carcass of a washing machine and on east rd street near the iglesia adventista church with the soaring approach to the triborough bridge in the background three police officers looked diligently out over a shabby brownstone and the surrounding streets two a man and a woman were in plain clothes the cop in the alley was in uniform he marched up and down the alley like a recruit on guard duty these observations were made by thompson boyd whod followed geneva settle and her guards here and was now standing in a boardedup building across the street and several doors west he peered through the cracks in a defaced billboard advertising home equity loans curious that theyd brought the girl out into the open not by the book but that was their problem thompson considered the logistics he assumed this was a short trip a hitandrun so to speak with the crown victoria and the other car doubleparked and no attempt made to hide them he decided to move fast to take advantage of the situation hurrying out of the ruined building via the back door thompson now circled the block pausing only long enough to buy a pack of cigarettes in a bodega easing into the alley behind the tenement where geneva now was thompson peered out he carefully set the shopping bag on the asphalt and moved forward a few more feet hiding behind a pile of garbage bags he watched the blond officer on his patrol in the alley the killer began counting the young mans footsteps one two at thirteen the officer reached the back of the building and turned around he was covering a lot of ground in his guard detail he mustve been told to watch the entire alleyway both front and back and to keep an eye on the windows in the opposite building too at twelve he reached the front sidewalk and turned started back one two three it took twelve steps again to get to the rear of the building he glanced around then paced his way to the front stepping thirteen times the next trip was eleven steps then twelve not clockwork but close enough thompson boyd would have at least eleven steps to slip unseen to the rear of the building while the boys back was turned hed then have another eleven until he appeared at the rear again he pulled the ski mask over his head the officer now turned and headed toward the street once more in an instant thompson was out of cover and sprinting to the back of the apartment building countingthree four five six quiet on his bass walking shoes thompson kept his eyes on the boys back the cop didnt look around the killer reached the wall on eight pressed against it catching his breath he turned toward the alleyway where the uniformed cop would soon be appearing eleven the cop would have just reached the street and be turning and starting back one two three thompson boyd slowing his breathing six seven thompson boyd gripping the club in both hands nine ten eleven feet scraped on the gritty cobblestones thompson stepped quickly out of the alley swinging the club like a baseball bat fast as a sidewinder striking he noted the pure shock on the boys face he heard the whistling of the stick and the cops gasp which stopped at the same moment the club struck his forehead the boy dropped to his knees a gurgling sound coming from his throat the killer then clocked the man on the crown of the head the officer fell face forward to the filthy ground thompson dragged the quivering young man still partly conscious around the back of the building where they couldnt be seen from the street at the sound of the gunshot roland bell leapt to the window of the apartment looked out carefully he unbuttoned his jacket and grabbed his radio he ignored aunt lillys wideeyed friend who said lord whats going on the greataunt herself stared silently at the huge gun on the detectives hip bell the detective said into the microphone whatve we got luis martinez replied breathlessly gunshot came from the back of the building boss pulaski was there barbes gone to check pulaski bell called into his radio respond nothing pulaski whats this about lilly demanded terrified lord bell held up a finger into his radio positions report im still on the front porch martinez responded nothing from barbe move to the middle of the groundfloor corridor keep your eye on the back door thats the way id come in i was him but cover both entrances roger bell turned to geneva and the two elderly women were leaving now but now miss ill carry you if i have to but thatll put us more at risk barbe lynch finally transmitted pulaskis down she called in a officer needs assistance and requested medics back entrance intact he asked lynch answered doors closed and locked thats all i can tell you stay in position cover the back alley im taking her out lets go he said to the girl the defiance faded but she said im not leaving them nodding toward the women you tell me right now whats this about her greataunt said eyeing bell angrily its a police matter somebody might be trying to hurt geneva i want you to leave is there a friends apartment here you can stay in for a spell but gonna have to insist here ladies is there tell me quick they glanced at each other with frightened eyes and nodded annmaries i guess the aunt said up the hall bell walked to the doorway and looked out the empty corridor yawned at him okay now go the older women moved quickly down the hall bell saw them knock on a door it opened and there were some hushed voices then the face of an elderly black woman looked out the women vanished inside the door closed and the sound of chains and locks followed the detective and the girl hurried down the stairs with bell pausing at every landing to make sure the lower level was cleared his large black automatic in hand geneva said nothing her jaw was set fury had blossomed inside her once again they paused in the lobby the detective directed geneva into the shadows behind him he shouted luis this levels clear boss for now at least the cop called in a harsh whisper from halfway up the dim corridor that led to the back door barbes calm voice said pulaskis still alive i found him holding his gun he got off one round that was the shot we heard no sign he hit anything whats he say hes unconscious so maybe the guys rabbited bell thought or maybe he planned something else was it safer to wait here for backup that was the logical answer the real issue though was it the right answer to the question of what unsub had in mind bell made a decision luis im taking her out of here now need your help with you boss thompson boyd was once again in the burntout building across the street from the tenement geneva settle and the cops had gone into so far his plan was working after beaning the cop hed ejected a shell from the mans glock this hed rubberbanded to a lit cigarette a fuse in effect and set the homemade firecracker in the alley hed placed the gun in the unconscious cops hand hed stripped off the mask slipped through another alley east of the building into the street when the cigarette burned down and detonated the bullet and the two plainclothes cops disappeared hed run to the crown victoria he had a slim jim to pop the door but hadnt needed it the car had been unlocked from the shopping bag he took several of the items hed prepared last night then assembled and hid them under the drivers seat and carefully closed the car door the improvised device was quite simple a low wide jar of sulfuric acid in which rested a short glass candleholder and sitting on top of that was a foil ball containing several tablespoons of finely ground cyanide powder any motion of the car would roll the ball into the acid which would melt the foil and dissolve the poison the lethal gas would spread upward and overcome the occupants before they had time to open a door or window theyd be dead or brain dead soon after he peeked out through the crack between the billboard and what was left of the buildings front wall on the porch was the brownhaired detective who seemed to be in charge of the guard detail beside him was the male plainclothes cop and between them the girl the trio paused on the porch as the detective scanned the street the rooftops cars alleys a gun was in his right hand keys in his other they were going to make a run for the deadly car perfect thompson boyd turned and left the building quickly he had to put some distance between himself and this place other cops were already on their way sirens were growing louder as he slipped out of the back of the building he heard the detectives car start the squeal of tires followed breathe deep he thought to the occupants of the car he thought this for two reasons first of course he wanted this hard job over with but he also sent the message to them for another reason dying by cyanide can be extremely unpleasant wishing them a speedy painless death was what a person with feeling would think a person who was no longer numb grape cherry milk breathe deep sensing the wild rattle of the engine it shook her hands and legs and back amelia sachs sped toward spanish harlem she was doing sixty before she shifted into third gear shed been at rhymes when they got the report pulaski was down and the killer had managed to get some sort of device into roland bells car shed run downstairs fired up her red camaro and hurried toward the scene of the attack in east harlem roaring through green lights slowing to thirty or so at the reds check left check right downshift punch it ten minutes later she skidded onto east rd street going against traffic missing a delivery truck by inches ahead of her she could see the flashing lights of the ambulances and three squad cars from the local house also a dozen uniforms and a handful of esu troops working their way along the sidewalks they moved cautiously as if they were soldiers under fire watch your backs she brought the chevy to a tiresmoking stop and jumped out glancing at the nearby alleyways and vacant windows for any sign of the killer and his needle gun jogging into the alley flashing her shield she could see medics working on pulaski he was on his back and theyd cleared an airway at least he was alive but there was a lot of blood and his face was hugely swollen shed hoped hed be able to tell them something but he was unconscious it looked like the kid had been surprised by his attacker whod lain in wait as hed walked down the alley the rookie had been too close to the side of the building there wouldve been no warning when the man attacked you always walked down the center of sidewalks and alleys so nobody could jump out and surprise you you didnt know she wondered if hed live to learn this lesson hows he doing the medic didnt look up no guess were lucky hes still with us then to his partner okay lets move him out now as they got pulaski onto a backboard and hustled him toward the ambulance sachs cleared everybody away from the scene to preserve whatever evidence might be there then she returned to the mouth of the alley and dressed in the white tyvek suit just as she zipped it up a sergeant from the local house walked up to her youre sachs right she nodded any sign of the perp nothing you going to run the scenes yep you want to see detective bells car sure she started forward wait the man said he handed her a face mask that bad he pulled his own on through the thick rubber she heard his troubled voice say follow me chapter twentyone with esu backing them up two bomb squad unit cops from the sixth precinct were crouched in the backseat of roland bells crown victoria they werent wearing bomb suits but were in full biohazard outfits wearing the thinner white suit amelia sachs stood back ten yards whatve you got sachs rhyme called into the microphone she jumped then turned the volume down the line from her radio was plugged into the gas mask i havent gotten close yet theyre still removing the device its cyanide and acid probably the sulfuric we found traces of on the desk he said slowly the team removed the glassandfoil device they sealed up the pieces in special hazardous materials containers another transmission from one of the bomb squad officers detective sachs weve rendered it safe you can run the car you want but keep the mask on inside theres no gas but the acid fumes could be dangerous right thanks she started forward rhymes voice crackled again hold on a minute he came back on theyre safe sachs theyre at the precinct good the they were the intended victims of the poison left in the crown victoria roland bell and geneva settle theyd come very close to dying but as theyd prepared to rush out of the greataunts apartment to the car bell had realized that something about the crime scene of pulaskis assault seemed odd barbe lynch had found the rookie holding his weapon but this unsub was too smart to leave a gun in the hand of a downed cop even if he was unconscious no hed at least pitch it away if he didnt want to take it with him bell had concluded that somehow the unsub himself had fired the shot and left the gun behind to make them think that the rookie had fired the purpose to draw the officers away from the front of the apartment and why the answer was obvious so that theyd leave the cars unguarded the crown vic had been unlocked which meant the unsub might have slipped an explosive device inside so hed taken the keys to the locked chevy that martinez and lynch had driven here and used that vehicle to speed geneva out of danger warning everyone to stay clear of the unmarked ford until the bomb squad had a chance to go over it using fiberoptic cameras they searched under and inside the crown vic and found the device under the drivers seat sachs now ran the scenes the car the approach to it and the alley where pulaski had been attacked she didnt find much other than prints of bass walking shoes which confirmed the attacker had been unsub and another device a homemade one a bullet from pulaskis service automatic had been rubberbanded to a lit cigarette the unsub had left it burning in the alley and snuck around toward the front of the building when it went off the gunshot had drawn the officers to the back giving him a chance to plant the device in bells car damn thats slick she thought with dark admiration there was no sign that his partner the black man in the combat jacket had been or still was nearby donning the mask again she carefully examined the glass parts of the poison device itself but they yielded no prints or other clues which surprised nobody maybe the cyanide or acid would tell them something discouraged she reported her results to rhyme he asked and what did you search well the car and the alleyway around pulaski and then the entrance and exit routes into and out of the alley the street where he approached the crown vic both directions silence for a moment as rhyme considered this she felt uneasy was she missing something whatre you thinking rhyme you searched by the book sachs those were the right places but did you take in the totality of the scene chapter two of your book good at least somebodys read it but did you do what i say although time was always of the essence when searching a crime scene one of the practices rhyme insisted on was taking a few moments to get a sense of the entire scene in light of the particular crime the example he cited in his forensic science textbook was an actual murder in greenwich village the primary crime scene was where the strangled victim was found his apartment the secondary was the fire escape by which the killer had gotten away it was the third scene though an unlikely one at which rhyme had found the matches bearing the killers fingerprints a gay bar three blocks away no one wouldve thought to search the bar except that rhyme found some gay porno tapes in the victims apartment a canvass of the nearest gay bar turned up a bartender who identified the victim and recalled him sharing a drink with a man earlier that night the lab raised latents from the book of matches resting on the bar near where the two men had sat the prints led them to the murderer lets keep thinking sachs he sets up this plan improvised but elaborate to distract our people and get the device into a car that meant he had to know where all the players were what they were doing and how he could make enough time to set the device which tells us what sachs was already scanning the street he was watching yes indeed sachs good and where might he have been doing that from across the streetd have the best visibility but therere dozens of buildings he couldve been in i have no idea which one true but harlems a neighborhood right i understand what im saying not exactly families sachs families live there extended families living together not yuppie singles a home invasion wouldnt go unnoticed neither would somebody skulking about in lobbies or alleys good word isnt that skulking says it all your point rhyme his good mood had returned but she was irritated that he was more interested in the puzzle of the case than he was about say pulaskis chances for recovery or that roland bell and geneva settle had nearly been killed not an apartment not a rooftop rolands people always look there therell be someplace else he was watching from sachs where do you think it might be scanning the street againtheres a billboard on an abandoned building its full of graffiti and handbills real busy you know hard to spot anybody looking out from behind it im going to see checking carefully for signs that the unsub was nearby and finding none she crossed the street and walked to the back of the old building a burntout store it seemed climbing through the back window she saw that the floor was dusty the perfect surface for footprints and sure enough she spotted unsub s bass walker shoes right away still she slipped rubber bands around the booties of the tyvek overalls a trick rhyme invented to make certain that an officer exploring the crime scene didnt confuse his or her own prints with those of the suspect the detective started into the room her glock in hand following the unsubs prints to the front she paused from time to time listening for noises sachs heard a skitter or two but no stranger to the sound track of seamier new york she knew immediately that the intruder was a rat in the front she looked out through a gap in the plywood panels of the billboard where hed stood and noticed that yes it provided a perfect view of the street she collected some basic forensic equipment then returned and hit the walls with ultraviolet spray sachs turned the alternative light source wand on them but the only marks she found were latex glove prints she told rhyme what shed found and then said ill collect trace from where he stood but i dont see very much hes just not leaving anything too professional rhyme said sighing every time we outsmart him hes already outsmarted us well bring in what youve got sachs well look it over as they waited for sachs to return rhyme and sellitto made a decision while they believed that unsub had fled the area around the apartment they still arranged to have geneva s greataunt lilly hall and her friend moved to a hotel room for the time being as for pulaski he was in intensive care still unconscious from the beating the doctors couldnt say whether hed live or not in rhymes lab sellitto slammed his phone shut angrily after getting this news he was a fucking rookie i had no business recruiting him for bells team i shouldve gone myself a curious thing to say lon rhyme said youve got rank you graduated from guard detail when twenty years ago but the big cop wouldnt be consoled put him in over his head stupid of me goddamn once again the hand rubbed at the hotspot on his cheek the detective was edgy and looked particularly rumpled today he usually wore pretty much what he wore now light shirt and dark suit rhyme wondered though if these were the same clothes hed had on yesterday it seemed so yes there was a dot of blood from the library shooting on the jacket sleeve as if he were wearing the clothing as penance the doorbell rang thom returned a moment later with a tall lanky man pale skin bad posture unruly beard and brown curly hair he was dressed in a tan corduroy jacket and brown slacks birkenstocks his eyes scanned the laboratory then glanced at rhyme and looked him over unsmiling he asked is geneva settle here whore you sellitto asked im wesley goades ah the legal terminator who was not fictional rhyme was somewhat surprised to find sellitto checked his id and nodded the mans long fingers continually adjusted thick wirerimmed glasses or tugged absently at his long beard and he never looked anyone in the eye for more than a half second the constant ocular jitters reminded rhyme of genevas friend the gumsnapping lakeesha scott he offered a card to thom who showed it to rhyme goades was director of the central harlem legal services corporation and was affiliated with the american civil liberties union the fine print at the bottom said that he was licensed to practice law in new york state the federal district courts in new york and washington dc and before the us supreme court maybe his days representing capitalist insurance companies had turned him to the other side in response to the querying glances from rhyme and sellitto he said ive been out of town i got the message that geneva called my office yesterday something about her being a witness i just wanted to check on her shes fine rhyme said thereve been some attempts on her life but we have a fulltime guard on her shes being held here against her will not held no the criminalist said firmly shes staying in her home with her parents an uncle whats this all about the unsmiling lawyer asked his eyes flitting from face to face taking in the evidence boards the equipment the wires rhyme was as always reluctant to discuss an active case with a stranger but the lawyer might have some helpful information we think somebodys worried about what geneva s been researching for a project for school about an ancestor of hers did she ever mention anything to you oh something about a former slave thats it thats how i met her she walked into my office last week and asked if i knew where she could get records of old crimes in the city back in the eighteen hundreds i let her look through a few of the old books i have but its almost impossible to find trial court records going back that far i couldnt help her the skinny man raised an eyebrow she wanted to pay me for my time most of my clients dont even do that with another look around the town house goades seemed satisfied that the situation was what it seemed to be are you close to catching this guy we have some leads rhyme said noncommittally well tell her i came by would you and if theres anything she needs anytime have her call me he nodded at his card and then left mel cooper chuckled a hundred bucks hes represented a spotted owl at one point or another in his career no takers on that one rhyme muttered and whatd we do to deserve all these distractions back to work lets move twenty minutes later bell and geneva arrived with a box of documents and other material from her greataunts apartment which a patrolman had delivered to them at the precinct house rhyme told her that wesley goades had come by to check on me right i told you he was good if i ever sue anybody im going to hire him lawyer of mass destruction amelia sachs walked inside with the evidence from the scene nodding a greeting to geneva and the others lets see what weve got rhyme said eagerly the cigarette that unsub had used as a fuse for the distracting gunshot was a merit brand common and untraceable the cigarette had been lit but not smoked or at least they could detect no teeth marks or saliva on the filter this meant he was not a habitual smoker most likely no fingerprints on the cigarette of course nor was there anything distinctive about the rubber band hed affixed the cigarette to the bullet with they found no manufacturers markers in the cyanide the acid could be purchased in many locations the contraption that would mix the acid and poison in bell s car was made of household objects a glass jar foil and a glass candleholder nothing had any markings or indications that could be traced to a particular location in the abandoned building where the killer had done his surveillance sachs had found additional traces of the mysterious liquid shed recovered from the elizabeth street safe house and whose fbi analysis rhyme was still impatiently awaiting in addition shed recovered a few tiny flakes of orange paint the shade of roadside signs or construction or demolition site warnings sachs was sure these were from the unsub because shed located flakes in two different locations right next to his footprints and nowhere else in the abandoned store rhyme speculated that the unsub might have masqueraded as a highway construction or utility worker or maybe this was his real job meanwhile sachs and geneva had been searching through the box of family memorabilia from her aunts house it contained dozens of old books and magazines papers scraps notes recipes souvenirs and postcards and it turned out a yellowed letter filled with charles singletons distinctive handwriting the lettering on this page was however far less elegant than in his other correspondence understandable given the circumstances sachs read it out loud july fifteenth the day after the theft at the freedmens trust rhyme noted go on violet what madness this is as near as i have been able to discern these events are a plan to discredit me to shame me in the eyes of my colleagues and of the honorable soldiers in the war for freedom today i learned where i might find justice and this evening i went to potters field armed with my navy colt but my efforts ended in disaster and the one hope for salvation now lies forever hidden beneath clay and soil i will spend the night in hiding from the constables who now search everywhere for me and in the morning i will steal to new jersey you and our son must flee too i fear they will try to visit their vengeance upon you as well tomorrow at noontime meet me at the john stevens pier in new jersey together we will repair to pennsylvania if your sister and her husband will agree to harbor us there is a man who lives in the building above the stable where i am now hiding who seems not unsympathetic to my plight he has assured me he will get you this message sachs looked up somethings crossed out here i cant make it out then he goes on it is dark now i am hungry and tired as tested as job and yet the source of my tears the stains you see on this paper my darling are not from pain but from regret for the misery i have visited upon us all because of my d ed secret had i shouted the truth from the top of city hall perhaps these sorrowful events would not have transpired now it is too late for the truth please forgive my selfishness and the destruction wrought by my deceit sachs looked up he signs it only charles the next morning rhyme recalled came the pursuit and arrest described in the magazine geneva had been reading when she was attacked his one hope hidden beneath clay and soil rhyme looked over the letter again sachs holding it up for him nothing specific about the secretand what happened in potters field thats the paupers graveyard isnt it cooper went online and browsed for a few moments he reported that the city cemetery for indigents was located on harts island near the bronx the island had been a military base and the graveyard had just opened on it shortly before charles went there on his mysterious mission armed with his colt pistol military rhyme asked frowning something had clicked in his memory show me the other letters cooper produced them look charless division was mustered there wonder if thats the connection anything else about the graveyard cooper read no there were only two or three hits rhyme scanned the white board what the hell was charles up to gallows heights potters field frederick douglass civil rights leaders congressmen politicians the fourteenth amendmentwhat ties them all together after a lengthy silence the criminalist said lets call in an expert whos more expert that you lincoln i dont mean forensic science mel rhyme said im speaking of history there are a few subjects im not proficient in chapter twentytwo professor richard taub mathers was lean and tall with skin dark as mahogany sharp eyes and an intellect that suggested several postgraduate degrees were tucked into his résumé he sported a throwback short afro hairstyle and a selfeffacing manner he was dressed well professorially tweed jacket and bow tie missing only the de rigueur suede elbow patches he nodded to rhyme with a brief doubletake at the wheelchair and shook hands with the rest of those present rhyme occasionally lectured at local colleges on forensic science mostly at john jay and fordham he rarely appeared at such lofty venues as columbia but a professor he knew at george washington down in dc had put him in touch with mathers who was it seemed an institution unto himself in morningside heights he was a professor in the law school teaching criminal constitutional and civil rights law as well as various esoteric graduate courses and lectured in africanamerican studies in the undergrad program mathers listened attentively as rhyme related what they knew about charles singleton and the civil rights movement his secret how it was possible that hed been framed for robbery then he told the professor what had happened to geneva over the past two days the professor blinked in shock at this news tried to kill you he whispered geneva said nothing holding his eye she gave a faint nod rhyme said to sachs show him what we have so far the letters mathers unbuttoned his jacket and pulled on thin stylish glasses he read charles singletons correspondence carefully unhurried he nodded once or twice gave one faint smile when he was finished he looked over them again fascinating man a freedman farmer served in the thirtyfirst us colored troops and was at appomattox he read the letters yet again as rhyme stifled the urge to tell him to hurry finally the man removed his glasses polished the lenses carefully with a tissue and mused so he was involved in the enactment of the fourteenth amendment the professor gave another smile he was clearly intrigued well this could be interesting this could be something struggling to remain patient rhyme asked yes and what would that be exactly the interesting something im speaking of the controversy of course had he been able to rhyme mightve grabbed the mans lapels and shouted for him to speed up but he offered a casual frown and whats the controversy a bit of history he asked rhyme sighed sachs gave him a dark look and the criminalist said go right ahead the united states constitutions the document that set up the american government the presidency congress and the supreme court it still controls how we operate and supersedes every other law and regulation in the land now in this country weve always wanted a balance a government strong enough to protect us from foreign powers and to regulate our lives but not so strong it becomes oppressive when the nations founders read over the constitution after it was signed they were worried that it was too powerful that it could lead to a repressive central government so they revised it they passed ten amendments the bill of rights the first eight are really the crucial ones they list basic rights that protect citizens against abuse from the federal government for instance the fbi cant arrest you without probable cause congress cant take your house away from you to build an interstate highway without compensation you get a fair trial with an impartial jury you cant be subject to cruel and unusual punishments and so on but did you note the key word rhyme thought he was actually testing them but mathers continued before anyone could speak federal were ruled by two different governments in america the federal government in washington and the government of the state we live in the bill of rights only limits what the federal government can do to us congress and federal agencies like the fbi or the dea the bill of rights gives us virtually no protection against human and civil rights violations by state governments and state laws are the ones that affect our lives much more directly than the federal government most criminal police matters public works real estate cars domestic relations wills civil lawsuits are all state issues got that so far the constitution and bill of rights protect us from washington only not from abuse by new york or oklahoma rhyme nodded the man eased his lanky frame onto a lab stool glancing uncertainly at a petri dish containing green mold and continued lets go back to the eighteen sixties the proslavery south lost the civil war so we enact the thirteenth amendment which prohibits slavery the country was reunified involuntary servitude was outlawedfreedom and harmony would reign right a cynical laugh wrong banning slavery wasnt enough there was even more bad feeling toward blacks than before the war even in the north because so many young men had died on behalf of freeing them state legislatures enacted hundreds of laws discriminating against blacks they were barred from voting from holding office owning property using public facilities testifying in court life for most of them was nearly as bad as under slavery but these were state laws remember the bill of rights couldnt stop them so congress decided the citizens needed protection from the state governments they proposed the fourteenth amendment to remedy that mathers glanced at a computer you mind if i go online no not at all rhyme told him the professor typed in an alta vista search and a moment later had downloaded some text he cut and pasted a passage into a separate window which everyone in the room could see on the flatscreen monitors around the room no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws this is part of section one of the fourteenth he explained it drastically limits what states can do to their citizens another part which i didnt print out gave states incentives to give blacks well black men the right to vote so were clear so far asked the educator were with you sachs said now the way an amendment to the constitution works is that it has to be approved by congress in washington and then by threefourths of the states themselves congress approved the fourteenth in the spring of and it went to the states for ratification two years later it was finally ratified by the required number of states he shook his head but ever since then thereve been rumors that it was never properly enacted and ratified thats the controversy i was referring to a lot of people think its invalid rhyme frowned really what do they say is wrong with the enactment there were a number of arguments several states withdrew approval after theyd voted to ratify but congress ignored the withdrawals some people say it wasnt properly presented or approved in washington there were also claims of vote fraud in the state legislatures bribery and even threats threats sachs nodded at the letters like charles said mathers explained political life was different then that was an era when j p morgan got together a private army to shoot it out with troops hired by his competitors jay gould and jim fisk in a railroad takeover and the police and the government just sat back and watched it happen and you must understand too that people were utterly passionate about the fourteenth amendment our country had nearly been destroyed a half million people died about as many as weve lost in all other wars combined without the fourteenth amendment congress couldve ended up controlled by the south and we might see the country split up again maybe even a second civil war he waved his hand at the material in front of him your mr singleton was apparently one of the men who went out to the states to lobby in favor of the amendment what if he found proof that the amendment was invalid that certainly could be the sort of secret that would torment him so maybe rhyme speculated a proamendment group set up the fake theft to discredit him so if he did tell what he knew nobodyd believe him not the great leaders back then of course not frederick douglass or stevens or sumner but yes there were certainly plenty of politicians whod want the amendment passed and theyd do anything to make sure that happened the professor turned toward geneva and that would explain why this young ladys in danger why rhyme asked hed followed the history just fine but the broader implications were a bit elusive it was thom who said all you have to do is open a newspaper and what does that mean rhyme snapped mathers replied he means that every day therere stories about how the fourteenth amendment affects our lives you may not hear it mentioned specifically but its still one of the most powerful weapons in our human rights arsenal the language is very vague what does due process mean or equal protection privileges and immunities the vagueness was intentional of course so congress and the supreme court could create new protections to meet the circumstances of every generation out of those few words have come hundreds of laws about everything imaginable much more than just racial discrimination its been used to invalidate discriminatory tax laws to protect homeless people and underage laborers to guarantee basic medical services for the poor its the basis for gay rights and for thousands of prisoners rights cases every year maybe the most controversial was using the amendment to protect the right to abortions without it states could decide that abortion doctors are capital murderers and now after september eleventh in our homeland security frame of mind its the fourteenth amendment that stops the states from rounding up innocent muslims and keeping them detained for as long as the police want his face was a mask of ill ease if its invalid because of something your charles singleton learned it could be the end of liberty as we know it but sachs said lets say he did find that out and it was invalid the amendment could simply be reratified couldnt it this time the professors laugh was clearly cynical wouldnt happen the one thing that all scholars agree on is that the fourteenth was approved at the only window of time in our history when it could have been passed no if the supreme court invalidated the amendment oh we might reenact a few of the laws but the main weapon for civil rights and civil liberties would be gone forever if thats the motive rhyme asked whod be behind the attack on geneva who should we be looking for mathers shook his head oh the lists endless tens of thousands of people want to make sure the amendment stays in force theyd be politically liberal or radical a member of a minority group racially or in sexual orientation or in favor of social programs medical services to the poor abortion rights gay rights prisoners rights workers rights we think of extremists being the religious right mothers who have their children lie down in abortion clinic driveways or people who bomb federal buildings but they dont have a monopoly on killing for their principles most european terrorism has been carried out by leftwing radicals he shook his head i couldnt even begin to guess who was behind it we need to narrow it down somehow sachs said rhyme nodded slowly thinking the main focus of their case had to be catching unsub and hoping hed tell them whod hired him or finding evidence that would lead to that person but he instinctively sensed this was an important lead too if there were no answers in the present as to who was behind the attempts on geneva settles life theyd have to look to the past whoever it is obviously knows something more about what happened in than we do if we can find that out about what charles learned what he was up to his secret about the robbery it might point us somewhere i want more information on that time period in new york gallows heights potters field everything we can find he frowned as a memory returned he said to cooper when you looked up gallows heights the first time you found an article about that place near here the sanford foundation right you still have it mel cooper saved everything he called up the times article on his computer the text popped up on his screen got it here rhyme read the article and learned that the sanford foundation had an extensive archive on upper west side history call up the director of the place william ashberry tell him we need to go through his library will do cooper lifted a phone he had a brief conversation then hung up and reported theyre happy to help ashberryll hook us up with a curator in the archives somebodys got to go check it out rhyme said looking at sachs with a raised eyebrow somebody i drew the short straw without drawing who else did she have in mind pulaski was in the hospital bell and his team were guarding geneva cooper was a lab man sellitto was too senior to do grunt work like that rhyme chided there are no small crime scenes there are only small crime scene investigators funny she said sourly she pulled on her jacket grabbed her purse one thing rhyme said serious now she lifted an eyebrow we know hell target us police he meant keep that orange paint in mind watch out for construction or highway workers well with him watch out for anybody got it she said then took the address of the foundation and left after shed gone professor mathers looked though the letters and other documents once more then handed them back to cooper he glanced at geneva when i was your age they didnt even have africanamerican studies in high school whats the program like nowadays do you take two semesters geneva frowned aas im not taking it then whats your term paper for language arts ah so youre taking black studies next year a hesitation im not taking it at all really geneva obviously sensed some criticism in his question its passfail all you have to do is show up i dont want that kind of grade on my record it cant hurt whats the point she asked bluntly weve heard it all over and over amistad slavers john brown the jim crow laws brown versus the board of education martin luther king jr malcolm x she fell silent with the detachment of a professional teacher mather asked just whining about the past geneva finally nodded i guess thats how i see it yeah i mean this is the twentyfirst century time to move on all those battles are over with the professor smiled then he glanced at rhyme well good luck let me know if i can help some more well do that the lean man walked to the door he paused and turned oh geneva yes just think about one thing from somebody whos lived a few years longer than you i sometimes wonder if the battles really arent over with at all he nodded toward the evidence chart and charless letters maybe its just harder to recognize the enemy chapter twentythree guess what rhyme there are small crime scenes i know it because im looking at one amelia sachs stood on west eightysecond street just off broadway in front of the impressive hiram sanford mansion a large dark victorian structure this was the home of the sanford foundation appropriately around her were trappings of historical new york in addition to the mansion which was more than a hundred years old there was an art museum that dated to and a row of beautiful landmark town houses and she didnt need unsubs wearing orangepaintstained overalls to feel spooked right next door to the foundation was the ornate and eerie sanford hotel rumor was that rosemarys baby was originally going to have been filmed in the sanford a dozen gargoyles looked down at sachs from its cornices as if they were mocking her present assignment inside she was directed to the man mel cooper had just spoken with william ashberry the director of the foundation and a senior executive at sanford bank and trust which owned the nonprofit organization the trim middleaged man greeted her with a look of bemused excitement weve never had a policeman here excuse me policewoman i meant to say well never had either here actually he seemed disappointed when she gave a vague explanation that she merely needed some general background on the history of the neighborhood and didnt need to use the foundation for a stakeout or undercover operation ashberry was more than happy to let her prowl through the archives and library though he couldnt help her personally his expertise was finance real estate and tax law not history im really a banker he confessed as if sachs couldnt tell this from his outfit of dark suit white shirt and striped tie and the incomprehensible business documents and spreadsheets sitting in precise stacks on his desk fifteen minutes later she was in the care of a curator a young tweedy man who led her down dark corridors into the subbasement archives she showed him the composite of unsub thinking maybe the killer had come here too looking for the article about charles singleton but the curator didnt recognize his picture and didnt recall anybody asking about any issues of coloreds weekly illustrated recently he pointed out the stacks and a short time later she was sitting edgy and frazzled on a hard chair in a cubicle small as a coffin surrounded by dozens of books and magazines printouts maps and drawings she approached this search the same way rhyme had taught her to run a crime scene looking over the whole first then organizing a logical plan then executing the search sachs first separated the material into four stacks general information west side history and gallows heights civil rights in the mids and potters field she started on the graveyard first she read every page confirmed charles singletons reference to his regiments being mustered at harts island she learned how the graveyard came into being and how busy it had been especially during the cholera and influenza epidemics of the mid and latenineteenth century when cheap pine coffins would litter the island stacked high awaiting burial fascinating details but not helpful she turned to the civil rights material she read a mindnumbing amount of information including references to the fourteenth amendment controversy but nothing that touched on the issues professor mathers had suggested to them as a motive for setting up charles singleton she read in an new york times article that frederick douglass and other prominent civil rights leaders of the time had appeared at a church in gallows heights douglass had told the reporter afterward that he had come to the neighborhood to meet with several men in the fight for the amendments passage but this they already knew from charless letters she found no mention of charles singleton but did come across a reference to a lengthy article in the new york sun about the former slaves and freedmen who were assisting douglass that particular issue though was not in the archives page after page on and onhesitating sometimes worrying that shed missed those vital few sentences that could shed light on the case more than once she went back and reread a paragraph or two that shed looked at without really reading stretching fidgeting digging at her fingernails scratching her scalp then plowing into the documents once more the material shed read piled up on the table but the pad of paper in front of her held not a single notation turning to new york history sachs learned more about gallows heights it was one of a halfdozen early settlements on the upper west side of new york separate villages really like manhattanville and vandewater heights now morningside gallows heights extended west from presentday broadway to the hudson river and from about seventysecond street north to eightysixth the name dated from colonial times when the dutch built a gallows atop a hill in the center of the settlement when the british purchased the land their hangmen executed dozens of witches criminals and rebellious slaves and colonists on the spot until the various sites of justice and punishment in new york city were consolidated downtown in city planners divided all of manhattan into the blocks that are used today though for the next fifty years in gallows heights and much of the rest of the city those grids could be found only on paper in the early s the land there was a tangle of country lanes empty fields forests squatters sheds factories and dry docks on the hudson river and a few elegant sprawling estates by the midnineteenth century gallows heights had developed a multiple personality reflected in the map that mel cooper had found earlier the big estates existed side by side with workingclass apartments and smaller homes shantytowns infested with gangs were moving in from the south on the tide of city sprawl and just as crooked as street thieves though on a larger and slicker scale william boss tweed ran much of the corrupt tammany hall democratic political machine from the bars and dining rooms in gallows heights tweed was obsessed with profiting from the development of the neighborhood in a typical scheme the man pocketed in fees for the sale to the city of a tiny lot worth less than the area was now a prime upper west side neighborhood and among the nicest and most affluent in the city of course apartments were going for thousands of dollars a month and as an irritated amelia sachs now reflected from her small crime scene dungeon the presentday gallows heights was home to some of the best delis and bagel bakeries in the city she hadnt eaten today the dense history reeled past her but nothing bore on the case damnit she ought to be analyzing crime scene material or better yet working the streets around the unsubs safe house trying to find some connections to where he lived what his name was what the hell was rhyme thinking of finally she came to the last book in the stack five hundred pages she estimated she was getting a good eye by this point it turned out to be the index didnt reveal anything important for the search sachs skimmed the pages but finally could take it no longer tossing the book aside she stood rubbed her eyes and stretched her claustrophobia was kicking in thanks to the suffocating ambiance of the archives located two flights underground the foundation may have been renovated last month but this place was still the original basement of the sanford mansion she supposed it had low ceilings and dozens of stone columns and walls making the space even more confining that was bad enough but the worst was the sitting amelia sachs hated to sit still when you move they cant getcha no small crime scenes rhyme brother she started to leave but at the door she paused looking back over the material thinking a few sentences in one of these musty books or yellowing newspapers could make the difference between life and death for geneva settle and the other innocents that unsub might one day kill rhymes voice came back to her when youre walking the grid at the scene you search it once and then again and when youre finished you search it once more and when youre done with that you search it again and she glanced at the last book the one that had defeated her sachs sighed sat back down pulled the pager toward her and read through it properly and then flipped through the photographs in the middle which it turned out was a good idea she froze staring at a photograph of west eightieth street taken in she gave a laugh read the caption and the text on the opposite page then pulled her cell phone off her belt and hit speeddial button i found potters field rhyme we know where it is he snapped into the microphone near his mouth an island in the theres another one a second cemetery not a cemetery it was a tavern in gallows heights a tavern well this was interesting he thought im looking at the photo or daguerreotype whatever it is a bar named potters field it was on west eightieth street so theyd been wrong rhyme reflected charles singletons fateful meeting may not have been on harts island at all and it gets better the place burned down suspected arson perpetrators and motive unknown am i right in supposing that it was the same day charles singleton went there to what did he say to find justice yep july fifteenth forever hidden beneath clay and soil anything else about him or the tavern not yet keep digging you bet rhyme they disconnected the call sachs had been on the speakerphone geneva had heard she asked angrily you think charles burned that place down not necessarily but one of the major reasons for arson is to destroy evidence maybe thats what charles was up to covering up something about the robbery geneva said look at his letterhes saying that the theft was set up to discredit him dont you think hes innocent by now the girls voice was low and firm her eyes bored into rhymes the criminalist returned her gaze i do yes she nodded gave a faint smile at this acknowledgement then she looked at her battered swatch i should get home bell was concerned that the unsub had learned where geneva lived hed arranged a safe house for her but it wouldnt be available until tonight for the time being he and the protection team would simply have to remain particularly vigilant geneva gathered up charless letters well have to keep those for the time being rhyme said keep them like for evidence just until we get to the bottom of whats going on geneva was looking at them hesitantly there seemed to be a longing in her eye well keep them in a safe place okay she handed them to mel cooper he looked at her troubled expression would you like copies of his letters she seemed embarrassed yeah i would justtheyre you know from family that makes em kind of important no problem at all he made copies on the xerox machine and handed them to her she folded them carefully and they disappeared into her purse bell took a call listened for a moment and said great get it over here as soon as you can much appreciated he gave rhymes address then hung up the school they found the security tape of the school yard when the unsubs partner was there yesterday theyre sending it over oh my god rhyme said sourly you mean theres a real lead in the case and its not a hundred years old bell switched to the scrambled frequency and radioed luis martinez about their plans he then radioed barbe lynch the officer guarding the street in front of genevas house she reported the street was clear and shed be awaiting them finally the north carolinian hit the speakerphone button on rhymes phone and called the girls uncle to make sure he was home lo the man answered bell identified himself shes okay the uncle asked shes fine were headed back now everything all right there yes sir sure is have you heard from her parents her folk yeah my brother call me from th airport had some delay or nother but theyll be leaving soon rhyme used to fly to london frequently to consult with scotland yard and other european police departments travel overseas had been no more complicated than flying to chicago or california not so anymore welcome to the post world of international travel he thought he was angry that it was taking so long for her mom and dad to get home geneva was probably the most mature child hed ever met but she was a child nonetheless and should be with her parents then bells radio crackled and luis martinezs staticky voice reported im outside boss the cars in front door open bell hung up the phone and turned to geneva ready when you are miss here you be said jon earle wilson to thompson boyd who was sitting in a restaurant in downtown manhattan on broad street the skinny white guy with a mullet haircut and wearing beige jeans none too clean handed the shopping bag to boyd who glanced inside wilson sat down in the booth across from him boyd continued to study the bag inside was a large ups box a smaller bag sat beside it from dunkin donuts though the contents most definitely were not pastries wilson used the chain shops bags because they were slightly waxed and protected against moisture are we eating wilson asked he saw a salad go past he was hungry but although he often met boyd in coffee shops or restaurants theyd never actually broken bread together wilsons favorite meal was pizza and soda which hed have by himself in his oneroom apartment chockablock with tools and wires and computer chips though he sort of felt for all the work he did for boyd the man could stand him to a fucking sandwich or something but the killer said ive got to leave in a minute or two a plate of lamb shish kebab sat half eaten in front of the killer wilson wondered if he was going to offer it to him boyd didnt he just smiled at the waitress when she came to collect it boyd smiling that was new wilsond never seen it before though he had to admit it was a pretty fucking weird smile wilson asked heavy huh glancing toward the bag he had a proud look in his eyes is think youll like it he was proud of what hed made and a little pissed that boyd didnt respond wilson then asked so hows it going its going everythings cool little setback thats why he nodded toward the bag and said nothing else boyd gave a faint whistle trying to match the notes of ethnic music coming out of the speaker above them the music was bizarro sitars or something from india or pakistan or who knew where but boyd hit the notes pretty good killing people and whistling the two things this man knew how to do the counter girl dropped a plate of dishes into the busboy pan with a huge crash as the diners turned to look wilson felt something tap his leg under the booth he touched the envelope slipped it into his bellbottoms pocket it seemed surprisingly thin to be holding but wilson knew it was all there one thing about boyd he paid what he owed and he paid on time a moment passed so they werent eating together they were sitting and boyd was drinking tea and wilson was being hungry even though boyd had to leave in a minute or two what was this about then he got the answer boyd glanced out the window and saw a battered unmarked white van slow and turn into the alley that led to the back of the restaurant wilson got a glimpse of the driver a small man with light brown skin and a beard boyds eyes watched it closely when it disappeared into the alley he rose hefting the shopping bag he left money on the table for his bill and nodded to wilson then he started toward the door he stopped turned back did i thank you wilson blinked did you did i thank you a nod down to the bag well no thompson boyd smiling and thanking people must be a fucking full moon i appreciate it the killer said your hard work i mean really the words came out as if he were a bad actor then this was odd too he winked a goodbye to the counter girl and walked out the door onto the bustling streets of the financial district circling through the alley to the back of the restaurant with the heavy bag at his side chapter twentyfour on th street roland bell eased his new crown victoria up in front of geneva s building barbe lynch nodded from her guard station the chevy malibu which bell had returned to them he hustled geneva inside and hurried up the stairs to the apartment where her uncle gave her a big hug and shook bell s hand again thanking him for looking out for the girl he said he was going to pick up a few things at the grocery store and stepped outside geneva went on to her room bell glanced in and saw her sitting on the bed she opened her book bag and rummaged through it anything i can do for you miss you hungry im pretty tired she said i think ill just do my homework now maybe take a nap now thats a fine idea after all youve been through hows officer pulaski she asked i talked to his commander earlier hes still unconscious they dont know how hell be wish i could tell you different but there it is im going to go stop by and check in on him later she found a book and handed it to bell could you give him this the detective took it i will you bet dont know that even if he wakes up hell be in any shape to read it i oughta say well hope for the best if he does wake up maybe somebody could read it to him might help sometimes it does just hearing a story oh and tell him or his family theres a good luck charm inside thats right kind of you bell closed her door and walked to the living room to call his boys and tell them that hed be home in a little while he then checked with the other guards on his swat team who reported that all was secure he settled down in the living room hoping that genevas uncle was doing some serious grocery shopping that poor niece of his surely needed some meat on her bones on his route to geneva settles apartment alonzo jax jackson slowly made his way down one of the narrow passages separating the brownstones in western harlem he wasnt however at this particular moment jax the limpin excon the bloodspraying graffiti king of harlem past he was some unnamed wack homeless dude in dusty jeans and a gray sweatshirt pushing a perped grocery cart which held five dollars worth of newspapers all wadded up and a bunch of empties hed racked from a recycling bin he doubted that up close anybody would buy the role he was a little too clean for your typical homeless guy but there were only a few people he needed to fool like the cops staying steady on geneva settle out of one alleyway across the street into another he was about three blocks from the back door of the apartment building that poorass kevin cheaney had pointed out nice place damn feeling shitty again thinking of his own plans for family gone bad sir i must talk to you i am sorry the babywe could not save him was a him im sorry sir we did what we could i promise you but it was a him he pushed those thoughts away fighting a bum wheel on the cart which kept veering to the left talking to himself a bit jax moved slowly but with determination thinking man funny if i got nailed for jacking a shopping cart but then he decided no it wouldnt be so funny at all itd be just like a cop to decide to roust him for something little like that and find the gun then run the id and hed get his ass violated back to buffalo or someplace even worse clatter clatter the littered passageway was hell on the broken wheel of the cart he struggled to keep it straight but he had to stick to this dark canyon to approach a nice town house from the sidewalk in this fancy part of harlem would flag him as suspicious in the alley though pushing a cart wasnt that wack rich people throw their empties out moren the poor and as for the garbage it was a better quality round here naturally a homeless duded rather scrounge in west harlem than in central how much farther jax the homeless dude looked up and squinted two blocks to the girls apartment almost there almost done he felt an itch in lincoln rhymes case this could be literal he had sensation on his neck shoulders and head and in fact this was a nondisabled sensate condition he could do without for a quadriplegic not being able to scratch an itch was the most fucking frustrating thing in the world but this was a figurative itch he was feeling something wasnt right what was it thom asked him a question he didnt pay attention lincoln im thinking cant you see no that happens on the inside the aide retorted well be quiet what was the problem more scans of the evidence charts the profile the old letters and clippings the curious expression on the inverted face of the hanged manbut somehow the itch didnt seem to have anything to do with the evidence in which case he supposed he should just ignore it get back to rhyme cocked his head almost grabbed the thought it jiggled away it was some anomaly words someone had said recently that didnt quite mesh then oh goddamn it he snapped the uncle what mel cooper asked jesus genevas uncle what about him geneva said he was her mothers brother and when we just talked to him he said that hed talked to his brother well he probably meant brotherinlaw if you mean brotherinlaw thats what you say command dial bell the phone rang and the detective answered on the first note of the cell phone tone that meant the call was from lincoln rhymes town house bell here roland youre at geneva s right your cell doesnt have a speaker does it no go ahead the detective instinctively pulled his jacket aside and unsnapped the thong holding the larger of his two pistols his voice was as steady as his hand though his heart ratcheted up a few beats per second wheres geneva her room uncle dont know he just went to the store listen he flubbed the story about how hes related to her he said hes her fathers brother she said hes her mothers hell hes a ringer get to geneva and stay with her until we figure it out im sending another

the detective whispered in a combat shooting crouch he pushed the door open and lifting his weapon stepped inside the room was empty geneva settle was gone chapter twentyfive central i have a ten twentynine possible abduction in his calm drawl bell repeated the ominous message and gave his location then vic is a black female age sixteen fivetwo one hundred pounds suspect is a black male stocky early to mid forties short hair roger units en route k bell clipped his radio to his belt and sent martinez and lynch to search the apartment building itself while he hurried downstairs the street in front of the building had been under surveillance by lynch while martinez had been on the roof but theyd been expecting unsub or his accomplice to be heading toward the building not going away from it martinez thought hed seen a girl and a man who could have been the uncle walking away from the apartment about three minutes ago he hadnt paid attention scanning the street bell saw no one but a few businesspeople he jogged down the service alley beside the building he noticed a homeless man pushing a grocery cart but he was two blocks away bell d talk to him in a minute and find out if hed seen the girl now he opted for the other possible witnesses some young girls playing doubledutch jump rope hi the rope went slack as they looked up at the detective hey there im a police officer im looking for this teenage girl shes black thin got short hair shed be with an older man the sirens from the responding officers cars filled the air growing closer you got a badge one girl asked bell tamped down his anxiety kept smiling and flashed his shield wow yeah we saw em one tiny pretty girl offered they went up that street there turned right no left you werent looking was too you gotta gun mister bell jogged to the street theyd pointed to a block away to his right he saw a car pulling away from the curb he grabbed his radio units responding to that ten two nine anybody close to one one seven

there k yeah weve got a visual well light him up roger seven seven two bell saw the squad car its lights flashing speed toward the maroon sedan which skidded to a stop his heart beating fast bell started toward them as a patrolman climbed from the squad car stepped to the sedans window and bent down his hand on the butt of his pistol please let it be her the officer waved the car on damn bell said to himself angrily as he jogged up to the officer detective wasnt them no sir a black female in her thirties shes alone bell ordered the rmp to cruise up and down the nearby streets to the south and radioed the others to cover the opposite directions he turned and picked another street at random plunged down it his cell phone rang bell here lincoln rhyme asked what was happening nobodys spotted her but i dont get it lincoln wouldnt geneva know her own uncle oh i can think of a few scenarios where the unsub could get a substitute in or maybe hes working with the unsub i dont know but somethings definitely wrong think about how he speaks hardly sounds like the brother of a professor hes got some street in him thats true i want to check with my team ill call you back bell hung up then radioed his partners luis barbe report in whatd yall find the woman said that the people shed canvassed on th hadnt seen either the girl or the uncle martinez reported that they werent in any of the common areas of the building and thered been no sign of intruders or forced entry he asked bell wherere you block east of the building heading east i got rmps sweeping the streets one of yall get over here with me the other keep the apartment covered k out bell jogged across a street and looked to his left he saw the homeless man again pausing glancing toward him then bending down and scratching his ankle bell started in his direction to ask if hed seen anything but then he heard the sound of a car door slamming shut where had it come from the sound reverberated off the walls and he couldnt tell an engine began grinding in front of himhe started forward no to the right he sprinted up the street just then he saw a battered gray dodge pull away from the curb it started forward but skidded to a stop as a patrol car cruised slowly into the intersection the driver of the dodge put the car into reverse and rolled backward over the curb into a vacant lot out of sight of the rmp bell believed he saw two people inside he squinted yes it was geneva and the man whod claimed to be her uncle the car bucked slightly as he put it in gear bell grabbed his radio and called the rmps ordering them to blockade both intersections but the patrolman at the wheel of the closest squad car turned into the street rather than just barricading it geneva s uncle saw him he slipped his car into reverse flooring the accelerator and skidding in a circle around the vacant lot and into the alley behind a row of buildings bell lost sight of the dodge he didnt know which way it had turned sprinting toward where hed last seen the car the detective ordered the squad cars to circle the block he ran into the alley and looked to his right just in time to see the rear fender of the car disappearing he raced for it pulling his beretta from his holster he sprinted at full speed and turned the corner bell froze tires squealing the old dodge was racing in reverse right toward him escaping from the squad car that was blocking the mans escape route bell stood his ground he lifted the beretta he saw the uncles panicked eyes genevas horrified expression her mouth open in a scream but he couldnt fire the squad car was directly behind the dodge even if he hit the kidnapper the jacketed rounds could go right through their target and the car and hit the officers bell jumped aside but the cobblestones were slick with garbage and he went down hard on his side grunting he lay directly in the path of the dodge the detective tried to pull himself to safety but with the car going so fast he wasnt going to make it butbut what was happening the uncle was hitting the brakes the car skidded to a stop five feet from bell the doors flew open and both geneva and her uncle were out running to him the man shouting you all right you all right detective bell geneva said frowning bending down and helping him up wincing in pain bell trained the big gun on the uncle and said dont move a damn muscle the man blinked and frowned lie down and your arms stretch em out detective bell geneva began just a minute miss the uncle did as he was told bell cuffed him as the uniforms from the rmp trotted through the alley frisk him yes sir the uncle said look you dont know what you doin sir quiet bell said to him and took geneva aside put her in a recessed doorway so shed be out of the line of fire from anyone on rooftops nearby roland barbe lynch hurried down the alley bell leaned against the brick wall catching his breath he glanced to the left seeing the homeless guy hed noticed earlier squint uneasily at the police and turn around then head in the opposite direction bell ignored him you didnt need to do that geneva said to the detective nodding at the cuffed man but hes not your uncle the detective said calming slowly is he no what was he doing with you just now she looked down a sorrowful expression on her face geneva bell said sternly thiss serious tell me whats going on i asked him to take me someplace where she lowered her head to work she said i couldnt afford to miss my shift she opened her jacket revealing a mcdonalds uniform the cheery name tag read hi my names gen chapter twentysix whats the story lincoln rhyme asked he was concerned but despite the fright at her disappearance there was no accusation in his voice geneva was sitting in a chair near his wheelchair on the ground floor of the town house sachs stood beside her arms crossed shed just arrived with a large stack of material shed brought from the sanford foundation archives where shed made the potters field discovery it sat on the table near rhyme ignored now that this new drama had intruded the girl looked defiantly into his eyes i hired him to play my uncle and your parents i dont have any you dont have any she repeated through clenched teeth go on sachs said kindly she didnt speak for a moment finally when i was ten my father left us my moms and me he moved to chicago with this woman and got married had himself a whole new family i was torn up oh it hurt but deep down i didnt really blame him much our life was a mess my moms she was hooked on crack just couldnt get off it theyd have these bad fights well she fought mostly he tried to straighten her out and shed get mad at him to pay for what she needed shed perp stuff from stores geneva held rhymes eyes as she added and shed go to girlfriends places and theyd have some men over you know what for dad knew all about it i guess he put up with it for as long as he could then moved on she took a deep breath and continued then moms got sick she was hiv positive but didnt take any medicine she died of an infection i lived with her sister in the bronx for a while but then she moved back to alabama and left me at auntie lillys apartment but she didnt have any money either and kept getting evicted moving in with friends just like now she couldnt afford to have me with her anyway so i talked to the superintendent of the building where my moms had worked some cleaning he said i could stay in the basement if i paid him i have a cot down there an old dresser a microwave a bookshelf i put his apartment down as my address for mail bell said you didnt seem real at home in that place whose was it this retired couple they live here half the year and go to south carolina for the fall and winter willy has an extra key she added ill pay them back for the electric bill and replace the beer and things that willy took you dont have to worry about that yes i do she said firmly whod i talk to before if it wasnt your mother bell asked sorry geneva said sighing that was lakeesha i asked her to front she was my moms shes kind of an actress she had me fooled the detective grinned at being taken in so completely and your own language rhyme asked you sure sound like a professors daughter she slipped into street talk dont be talkin like no homegirl you sayin a grim laugh ive worked on my standard english ever since i was seven or eight her face grew sad the only good thing about my father he always had me into books he used to read to me some too we can find him and no geneva said in a harsh voice i dont want anything to do with him anyway hes got his own kids now he doesnt want anything to do with me and nobody found out you were homeless sachs asked why would they i never applied for welfare or food stamps so no social workers came to see me i never even signed up for free meals at school cause itd blow my cover i forged my parents names on the school papers when i needed their signatures and i have a voicemail box at a service that was keesh again she recorded the outgoing message pretending to be my mother and the school never suspected sometimes they asked why i never had anybody at parentteacher conferences but nobody thought anything about it because i have straight as no welfare good grades no problems with the policenobody notices you if theres nothing wrong she laughed you know the ralph ellison book invisible man no not that science fiction movie its about being black in america being invisible well im the invisible girl it made sense now the shabby clothes and cheap watch not at all what jetsetting parents would buy for their girl the public school not a private one her friend the homegirl keesh not the sort whod be close to the daughter of a college professor rhyme nodded we never saw you actually call your parents in england but you did call the super yesterday after what happened at the museum right had him pretend to be your uncle he said hed agree if i paid him extra yeah he wanted me to stay in his place but that wouldnt be a good idea you know what im saying so i told him to use twob with the reynolds being away i had him take their name off the mailbox never thought that man seemed much like kin bell said and geneva responded with a scoffing laugh when your parents never showed up what were you going to say i didnt know her voice broke and for an instant she looked hopelessly young and lost then she recovered ive had to improvise the whole thing when i went to get charless letters yesterday she glanced at bell who nodded i snuck out the back door and went down to the basement thats where they were you have any family here sachs asked other than your aunt i dont have no the flash of true horror in the girls eyes was the first that rhyme had seen and its source was not a hired killer but the near slip into hated nonstandard grammar she shook her head i dont have anybody why dont you go to social services sellitto asked thats what theyre there for bell added you moren anybodyre entitled to it the girl frowned and her dark eyes turned darker i dont take anything for free a shake of the head besides a social workerd come to check things out and see my situation id get sent down to my aunts in bama she lives in a town outside of selma three hundred people in it you know what kind of education id get there or i stay here and end up in foster in brooklyn living in one room with four gangbanger girls boxes playing hiphop and bet on twentyfour hours a day dragged to church she shivered and shook her head thats why the job rhyme glanced at the uniform thats why the job somebody hooked me up with this guy makes fake drivers licenses according to it im eighteen a laugh i dont look it i know but i applied to a place where the managers an old white guy he didnt have a clue how old i was from looking at me been at the same place ever since never missed a single shift until today a sigh my bossll find out hell have to fire me shit and i just lost my other job last week you had two jobs the girl nodded scrubbing graffiti theres all this renovation going on in harlem you see it everywhere now some big insurance or real estate companies fix up old buildings and rent em for a lot of money the crews hired some kids to clean the walls it was great money but i got fired because you were underage sachs asked no because i saw these workers three big white guys who worked for some real estate company they were hassling this old couple whod lived in the building forever i told em to stop or id call the police she shrugged they fired me i did call the police but they werent interested so much for doing good deeds and thats why you didnt want that mrs barton the counselor to help bell said she finds out im homeless and bang my asss in foster she shuddered i was so close i couldve done it a year and a half and id be gone id be in harvard or vassar then that guy shows up at the museum yesterday and ruins everything geneva rose and walked to the chart that had the details about charles singleton on it she gazed at it thats why i was writing about him i had to find out he was innocent i wanted him to be nice and be a good husband and father the letters were so wonderful he could write so pretty all his words even his handwriting was beautiful she added breathlessly and he was a hero in the civil war and taught children and saved the orphans from the draft rioters suddenly i had a relative who was good after all who was smart who knew famous people i wanted him to be somebody i could admire not like my father or mother luis martinez stuck his head in the doorway he checks out right name and address no priors no warrants hed run the name of the phony uncle rhyme and bell werent trusting anybody at this point you must be lonely sachs said a pause my daddy took me to church some fore he ran off i remember this gospel song it used to be our favorite its called aint got time to die thats what my lifes like i aint got time to be lonely but rhyme knew geneva well by now she was fronting he said so youve got a secret just like your ancestor who knows yours keesh the super his wife thats all she fixed rhyme with a defiant look youre going to turn me in arent you you cant live alone sachs said i have for two years she snapped i have my books school i dont need anything else but no if you tell itll ruin everything she added please the word was muted as if saying it came very hard to her silence for a moment sachs and sellitto looked at rhyme the one person in the room who didnt have to answer to city brass and regulations he said no need to make any decisions right away weve got our hands full catching the unsub but im thinking you ought to stay here not a safe house he glanced at thom i think we can find room for you upstairs cant we you bet we can id rather the girl started rhyme said with a smile i think well insist this time but my job i cant afford to lose it ill take care of it rhyme got the number from her and called the girls boss at mcdonalds and explained in general terms about the attack and said that geneva wouldnt be coming in for a few days the manager sounded truly concerned and told him that geneva was their most conscientious employee she could take as much time off as she needed and could be sure that her job would be waiting for her when she returned shes the best employee weve got the man said over the speakerphone a teenager whos more responsible than somebody twice that age you dont see that very often rhyme and geneva shared a smile and he disconnected the call it was then that the doorbell rang bell and sachs immediately grew vigilant their hands slipping toward their weapons sellitto rhyme noted still looked spooked and though he glanced down at his weapon he didnt reach for it his fingers remained on his cheek rubbing gently as if the gesture could conjure up a genie to calm his troubled heart thom appeared in the doorway he said to bell theres a mrs barton here from the school shes brought a copy of some security video the girl shook her head in dismay no she whispered send her in rhyme said a large africanamerican woman walked in wearing a purple dress bell introduced her she nodded to everyone and like most of the counselors rhyme himself had met had no reaction to his disabled condition she said hello geneva the girl nodded her face was a still mask rhyme could tell she was thinking about the threat this woman represented to her rural alabama or a foster home barton continued howre you doing okay fine thank you the girl said with a deference that wasnt typical of her thiss got to be tough on you the woman said ive been better geneva now tried a laugh it sounded flat she glanced at the woman once and then looked away barton said i spoke to maybe a dozen or so people about that man near the school yard yesterday only two or three remember seeing anybody they couldnt describe him except he was of color wore a green combat jacket and old work shoes thats new rhyme said the shoes thom wrote this on the board and heres the tape from our security department she handed a vhs cassette to cooper who played it rhyme wheeled close to the screen and felt his neck straining with the tension as he studied the images it wasnt much help the camera was aimed mostly at the school yard not the surrounding sidewalks and streets in the periphery it was possible to see some vague images of passersby but nothing distinctive without much hope that theyd pick up anything rhyme ordered cooper to send the cassette off to the lab in queens to see if it could be digitally enhanced the tech filled out the chainofcustody card and packed it up called for a pickup bell thanked the woman for her help anything we can do she paused and looked the girl over but i really do need to talk to your parents geneva my parents she nodded slowly i have to say ive been talking to some of the students and teachers and to be honest most of them say your folks havent been very involved in your classes in fact i havent found anybody whos actually met them my gradesre fine oh i know that were real happy with your academic work geneva but schools about children and parents working together id really like to talk to them whats their cell number the girl froze a dense silence which lincoln rhyme finally broke ill tell you the truth geneva looked down her fists were clenched rhyme said to barton i just got off the phone with her father everyone else in the room turned and stared at him are they back home no and they wont be for a while no i asked them not to come you did why the woman frowned its my decision i did it to keep geneva safe as roland bell here will tell you a glance at the carolina detective who nodded a fairly credible gesture considering he had no clue what was going on when we set up protection details sometimes we have to separate the people were guarding from their families i didnt know that otherwise rhyme continued vamping the attacker could use their relatives to draw them into public barton nodded makes sense whats it called roland rhyme glanced at the detective again and filled in the answer himself isolation of dependents right iod bell said nodding what we call it very important technique well im glad to know that the counselor said but your unclell be looking out for you right sellitto said no we think its probably best if geneva stays here were running an iod with her uncle too bell said the fabrication sounded particularly slick coming from a law enforcer with a southern drawl want to keep him out of sight barton bought it all rhyme could see the counselor said to geneva well when this is over please have them call me seems like youre handling it pretty well but psychologically it has to be taking a toll well all sit down together and work through some of the issues she added with a smile theres nothing broke that cant be fixed a sentence that was probably emblazoned on a desk plaque or coffee mug in her office okay geneva said cautiously well see after the woman was gone geneva turned to rhyme i dont know what to say it means so much to me what you did mostly he muttered uneasy with the gratitude it was for our convenience i cant very well go calling up child welfare and tracking you down in foster homes every time we have a question about the case geneva laughed front all you want she said thanks anyway then she huddled with bell and told him what books clothes and other items she needed from the basement on th street the detective said hed also get back from the phony uncle whatever shed paid him for the scam he wont give it back she said you dont know him bell smiled and said amiably oh hell give it back this from the man with two guns geneva called lakeesha and told her girlfriend that shed be staying at rhymes then hanging up she followed thom upstairs to the guest room sellitto asked what if the counselor finds out linc finds out what well how bout that you lied about geneva s parents and made up some department procedures what the hell was it the dui iod bell reminded and whats she going to do rhyme growled make me stay after school he gave an abrupt nod at the evidence board now can we get back to work there is a killer out there and hes got a partner and somebody hired them recall that id like to figure out who the hell they are sometime this decade sachs walked to the table and began organizing the folders and copies of materials that william ashberry had let her borrow from the foundation library the small crime scene she said thiss mostly about gallows heights maps drawings articles some things on potters field she handed the documents to cooper one by one he taped up several drawings and maps of gallows heights which rhyme stared at intently as sachs told them what shed learned about the neighborhood she then walked to the drawing and touched a twostory commercial building potters field was right about here west eightieth street she skimmed some of the documents seems like it was pretty disreputable a lot of crooks hung out there people like jim fisk and boss tweed and politicians connected to the tammany hall machine see how valuable small crime scenes can be sachs youre a wealth of helpful information she gave him a minor scowl then picked up a photocopy thiss an article about the fire it says that the night potters field burned down witnesses heard an explosion in the basement and then almost immediately the place was engulfed arson was suspected but nobody was ever arrested no fatalities what did charles go there for rhyme mused aloud what did he mean by justice and whats forever hidden beneath clay and soil was it a clue a bit of evidence a scrap of document that could answer the question of who wanted to murder geneva settle sellitto shook his head too bad it was a hundred and forty years ago whatever its gone now well never know rhyme looked at sachs she caught his eye she smiled chapter twentyseven oh youre lucky in one way explained david yu a spikyhaired young engineer who worked for the city we could use some amelia sachs said luck i mean they were standing on west eightieth street about a half block east of riverside park looking up at a threestory brownstone a crime scene bus waited nearby as did another friend of sachss a policewoman named gail davis from the k unit and her dog vegas most police dogs were german shepherds malinois and for bomb detail labrador retrievers vegas though was a briard a french breed with a long history of military service these dogs are known for having keen noses and an uncanny ability to sense threats to livestock and humans rhyme and sachs had thought that running a yearold crime scene might benefit from some oldfashioned search methods in addition to the hightech systems that would be employed the engineer yu nodded at the building that had been constructed on the site where potters field tavern had burned the date on the cornerstone read to build a tenement like this back then they wouldnt have excavated and laid a slab theyd dig a perimeter foundation pour concrete and set the walls that was the loadbearing part the basement floor would have been dirt but building codes changed they wouldve put a concrete floor in sometime early in this century again though it wouldnt be structural itd be for health and safety so the contractors wouldntve excavated for that either so the lucky part is that whatever was under there in the eighteen sixties might still be there sachs said forever hidden right and the unlucky part is that its under concrete pretty much a foot deep maybe less sachs walked around the building which was grimy and plain though she knew the apartments in it would rent for or so a month there was a service entrance in the back that led below ground to the basement she was returning to the front of the structure when the phone rang detective sachs lon sellitto was on the other end hed found the name of the buildings owner a businessman who lived several blocks way the man was on his way to the place to let them inside rhyme came on the phone a moment later and she told him what yu had said good luck bad luck he said the scowl clear well ive ordered an s and s team there with spr and ultrasound just then the owner of the building arrived a short balding man in a suit and white shirt open at the collar sachs disconnected the cell call with rhyme and explained briefly to the man that they needed to examine the basement he looked her up and down suspiciously then opened the basement door and stood back crossing his arms near vegas the police dog didnt seem to like him very much a chevy blazer pulled up and three members of the nypd search and surveillance unit climbed out s and s officers were a mixed breed of cop engineer and scientist whose job was to back up the tactical forces by locating perps and victims at scenes with telescopes night vision imagers infrared microphones and other equipment they nodded to the crime scene techs and then unloaded battered black suitcases very much like the ones that held sachss own crime scene equipment the owner watched them with a frown the s and s officers walked down into the dank chill basement smelling of mold and fuel oil followed by sachs and the owner they hooked up probes that resembled vacuum cleaner heads to their computerized equipment the whole area one asked sachs yup thats not going to hurt anything is it the owner asked no sir a tech replied they got to work the men decided to use spr first surface penetrating radar sent out radio waves and returned information on objects it struck just like traditional radar on board a ship or airplane the only difference was that spr could go through objects like dirt and rubble it was as fast as the speed of light and unlike ultrasound didnt have to be in contact with the surface to get a reading for an hour they scanned the floor clicking computer buttons making notations while sachs stood to the side trying not to tap her foot or fidget impatiently figuring that it wouldnt be good for the instruments readings after theyd swept the floor with the radar the team consulted the units computer screen and then based on what they learned walked around the floor again touching the ultrasound sensor to the concrete in a half dozen areas theyd targeted as important when they were finished they called sachs and yu over to the computer flipped through some images the dark gray screen was unreadable to her it was filled with blotches and streaks many of which had small boxes of indecipherable numbers and letters beside them one of the techs said most of these are what youd expect under a building this age boulders a bed of gravel pockets of decayed wood thats a portion of a sewer here pointing to part of the screen theres an easement for a storm drain that feeds into the main drain going to the hudson yu said that must be it the owner leaned over his shoulder you mind sir sachs grumbled the man grudgingly stepped back the tech nodded but here he tapped a spot next to the back wall we got a ping but no hit a when something comes back that the computers seen before it suggests what it might be but this was negative sachs saw only a less dark area on the dark screen so we ran the ultrasound and got this his partner typed in a command and a different screen appeared one much lighter and with a clearer image on it a rough ring inside of which was a round opaque object that seemed to have a strand of something coming off it filling the ring in the space below the smaller object was what appeared to be a pile of sticks or boards maybe sachs speculated a strongbox that had broken apart over the years one officer said the outer rings about twentyfour inches across the inner ones threedimensional a sphere its eight nine inches in diameter is it close to the surface the slabs about seven inches deep and this things about six to eight feet below that where exactly the man looked from the computer screen to the floor and back again he walked over to a spot right beside the wall in the back of the basement near the door that led outside he drew a chalk mark the object was right against the wall whoever had built the wall had missed it by only inches im guessing it was a well or a cistern maybe a chimney what would it take to get through the concrete sachs asked yu my permission said the owner which you aint getting youre not breaking up my floor sir sachs said patiently this is police business whatever that thing is its mine ownership isnt the issue it may be relevant to a police investigation well youll have to get a court order im a lawyer youre not breaking up my floor its really important we find out what that is important the man asked why it has to do with a criminal case from a few years ago few years the man said picking up on the weakness of her case immediately how few he was probably a really good lawyer you lie to people like this and it comes back to get you she said a hundred and forty give or take he laughed this isnt an investigation this is the discovery channel no jackhammer uhuh a little cooperation here sir get a court order i dont have to cooperate until im forced to then its not really cooperation is it sachs snapped back she called rhyme whats going on he asked she briefed him about what theyd found an old strongbox in a well or cistern inside a burneddown building hiding places dont get much better than that rhyme asked for s and s to send him the images via wireless email they did so ive got the picture here sachs he said after a moment no clue what it is she told him about the unconcerned citizen and ill fight it the lawyer said hearing the conversation ill appear before the magistrate myself i know em all we re on a firstname basis she heard rhyme discussing the matter with sellitto when he came back on the line he wasnt happy lons going to try to get a warrant but itll take time and hes not even sure the judged issue paper in a case like this cant i just clock this guy she muttered and hung up she turned to the owner well repair your floor perfectly i have tenants theyll complain and ill have to deal with it you wont youll be long gone sachs waved her hand in disgust actually thinking about placing him under arrest for well for something and then digging through the damn floor anyway how long would a warrant take probably forever she imagined considering that judges needed a compelling interest in order to allow police to invade someones home her phone rang again and she answered sachs rhyme asked is that engineer fellow there david yeah hes right next to me i have a question what ask him who owns the alleys the answer in this particular instance though not all was the city the lawyer owned only the footprint of the building itself and what was inside rhyme said have the engineers get some equipment next to the exterior wall and dig down then tunnel under his wall would that work out of hearing of the owner she posed the question to yu who said yeah we could do that no risk of structural damage if you keep the hole narrow narrow thought the claustrophobic policewoman just what i needshe hung up and then said to the engineer okay i want a sachs frowned what are those things called with the big scoop on them her knowledge of vehicles whose top speed was ten miles an hour was severely limited backhoe sounds right how soon can you get one here a half hour she gave him a pained look ten minutes ill see what i can do twenty minutes later with a loud reverse warning beep a city backhoe rolled up to the side of the building there was no way to hide their strategy anymore the owner stepped forward waving his hands youre going underneath from outside you cant do that either i own this property from the heavens to the center of the earth thats what the law says well sir said slim young civil servant yu theres a public utility easement under the building which we have a right to access as im sure you know but the fucking easements on the other side of the property i dont think so its on that screen right there he pointed to a computer just as the screen went dark ooops said one of the s and s officers whod just shut it off damn things always breaking down the owner scowled at him then said to yu there is no easement where youre going to dig yu shrugged well you know when somebody disputes the location of an easement the burdens on him to get a court order stopping us you might want to give some of your magistrate friends a call and you know what sir you better do it pretty fast cause were going in now but go ahead he shouted is that true sachs whispered to him about the easements dont know but he seemed to buy it thanks the backhoe went to work it didnt take long ten minutes later guided by the s and s team the backhoe had dug out a fourfootwide tenfootdeep foxhole the foundation of the building ended about six feet below the surface and beneath that was a wall of dark soil and gray clay sachs would have to climb to the bottom of the excavation and dig horizontally only about eighteen inches until she found the cistern or well she donned the tyvek suit and a hard hat with a light on the top she called rhyme back on her radio not sure how cell phone reception would be in the pit im ready she told him k officer gail davis walked over with vegas straining on the leash pawing at the edge of the hole somethings down there the policewoman said as if im not spooked enough sachs thought looking at the dogs alert face whats that noise sachs gails here her dogs got a problem with the site anything specific sachs asked davis nope could be sensing anything vegas then growled and pawed sachss leg davis had told sachs that another skill of briards was battlefield triage theyd been used by corpsmen to determine which of the wounded could be saved and which could not she wondered if vegas was marking her for the latter ahead of time keep close sachs said to davis with an uneasy laugh in case i need digging out yu volunteered to go down into the pit he said he liked tunnels and caves a fact that astonished amelia sachs but she said no this was after all a crime scene even if it was years old and the sphere and strongbox whatever they might be were evidence to be collected and preserved according to cs procedure the city workers lowered a ladder into the shaft which sachs looked down into sighing you okay yu asked fine she said cheerfully and started into the hole thinking the claustrophobia in the sanford foundations archives was nothing compared to this at the bottom she took the shovel and pickax yu had given her and began the excavation sweating from the effort shivering from the waves of panic she dug and dug picturing with every scoop the foxhole collapsing and trapping her pulling out rocks dislodging the dense earth forever hidden beneath clay and soil whats in view sachs rhyme asked through the radio dirt sand worms a few tin cans rocks she progressed about one foot under the building then two her spade gave a tink and stopped cold she scraped away soil and found herself facing a rounded brick wall very old the mortar clumsily smeared between the bricks got something here the side of the cistern dirt from the edges of the foxhole skittered to the floor it scared her more than if a rat had traipsed across her thigh a fast image came to mind being held immobile while dirt flooded around her crushing her chest then filling her nose and mouth drowning on dirt okay girl relax sachs took several deep breaths scraped away more soil another gallon or so of it spilled out on her knees should we shore this up you think she called to yu what rhyme asked im taking to the engineer yu called i think itll probably hold the soils damp enough to be cohesive probably the engineer continued if you want we can but itll take a few hours to build the frame never mind she called to him into the speaker she asked lincoln there was a pause she felt a jolt realizing shed used his first name neither of them was superstitious but there was one rule they stuck to it was bad luck to use their first names on the job the hesitation told her that he too was aware shed broken the rule finally he said go ahead gravel and dry dirt again trickled down the side of the foxhole and sprayed her neck and shoulders it hit the tyvek suit which amplified the sound she jumped back thinking the walls were coming down a gasp sachs you all right she looked around no the walls were holding fine she continued to scrape away dirt from the rounded brick cistern with the pickax she chipped away mortar she asked rhyme any more thoughts about whats inside the question was meant mostly for the comfort of hearing his voice a sphere with a tail no idea a fierce bash with the ax one brick came out then two earth poured out from inside the well and covered her knees damn i hate this more bricks more sand and pebbles and dirt she stopped cleared the heavy pile off her kneeling legs and turned back to her task how you doing rhyme asked hanging in there she said softly and removed several more bricks a dozen of them lay around her she turned her head shining the light on what was behind the bricks a wall of black dirt ash bits of charcoal and scraps of wood she started to dig into the dense dry earth that was inside the cistern nothing cohesive about this goddamn dirt she thought watching the loose brown rivulets stream downward glistening in the beam from her hardhat light sachs rhyme shouted stop she gasped whats i just looked over the story of the arson again it said there was an explosion in the basement of the tavern grenades back then were spheres with fuses charles mustve taken two with him thats the sphere in the well youre right next to the one that didnt go off the bomb could be as unstable as nitroglycerine thats what the dog was sensing the explosives get out of there fast she gripped the side of the well to pull herself to her feet but the brick she was holding suddenly gave way and she fell onto her back as an avalanche of dry earth from inside the well poured out into the foxhole stones and gravel and dirt flowed around her pinning her bent cramping legs and spreading fast toward her chest and face she screamed trying desperately to climb to her feet but she couldnt the flood had reached her arms sa she heard rhymes voice as the headset cord was ripped from the radio more dirt cascaded over her body helplessly frozen under the crushing weight that rose like flooding water then sachs screamed once more as the sphere carried by the current of dirt dropped from the gaping hole in the brick wall and rolled against her immobilized body jax was out of his area hed left harlem behind both the place and the state of mind left behind the empty lots filled with malt liquor bottles left behind the storefront tabernacles the faded weatherbattered posters for red devil lye which black men had used to conk their hair straight in the malcolm x era left behind the teenage rapper wannabees and bucket percussion ensembles in marcus garvey park the stands selling toys and sandals and bling and kentecloth wall hangings left behind all the new redevelopment construction left behind the tour buses he was now in one of the few places where hed never bombed a jax never painted a throwup the elegant part of central park west staring at the building where geneva settle now was after the incident in the alley near her house on th street with geneva and the guy in the gray car jax had jumped in another cab and followed the police cars here he didnt know what to make of this place the two police cars out front and from the stairs to the sidewalk a ramp like they make for people in wheelchairs limping slowly through the park scoping the building out what was the girl doing inside he tried to get a look but the blinds were drawn another car a crown vic the kind the police drive a lot pulled up and two cops got out carrying a cheap suitcase taped together and boxes of books probably geneva s he guessed she was moving in protecting her even steadier he thought discouraged he stepped into the bushes to get a better view when the door opened but just then another squad car drove past slow it seemed that a cop inside was scanning the park as well as the sidewalk jax memorized the number of the building then turned away and disappeared into the park he headed north walking back toward harlem feeling the gun in his sock feeling the tug of his parole officer two hundred miles to the north who might be thinking about a surprise visit to his buffalo apartment at this very moment jax remembered a question that ralph the leaning egyptian prince had asked him was what he was doing worth all the risk he considered this now as he returned home and he thought had it been worth the risk twenty years ago perching on the sixinch iron ledge of the overpass on the grand central parkway to tag jax thirty feet above traffic streaming by at sixty miles an hour had it been worth the risk six years ago chambering a gauge shell in the breakdown and shoving the muzzle into the face of the armoredtruck driver just to get that or enough to help him get over get his life back on track and he knew that fuck ralphs wasnt a question that made any sense because it suggested there was a choice then and now right or wrong didnt matter alonzo jax jackson was going right ahead if this worked out hed get back his righteous life in harlem his home the place that for good and bad had made him what he was and the place that he himself had helped form with his thousands of cans of spray paint he was simply doing what he had to do careful in his safe house in queens thompson boyd was wearing a gas mask respirator and thick gloves he was slowly mixing acid and water then checking the concentration careful this was the tricky part certainly the potassium cyanide powder sitting nearby was dangerous enough to kill thirty or forty people but in its dried form it was relatively stable just like the bomb hed planted in the police car the white powder needed to be mixed with sulfuric acid to produce the deadly gas the infamous zyklonb used by the nazis in their extermination showers but the big if is the sulfuric acid too weak a concentration will produce the gas slowly which could give the victims a chance to detect the odor and escape but too strong an acid over percent concentration will cause the cyanide to explode before its dissolved dissipating much of the desired deadly effect thompson needed the concentration to be as close to percent as possible for a simple reason the place he was going to plant the device that old central park west town house where geneva settle was staying would hardly be airtight after learning that this was where the girl was hiding thompson had conducted his own surveillance of the town house and had noted the unsealed windows and an antiquated heating and airconditioning system it would be a challenge to turn the large structure into a death chamber you gotta understand bout what were doing here its like everything else in life nothing ever goes one hundred percent nothing runs just the way it ought yesterday hed told his employer that the next attempt on geneva s life would be successful but now he wasnt too sure about that the police were far too good well just rerig and keep going we cant get emotional about it well he wasnt emotional or concerned but he needed to take drastic measures on several fronts if the poison gas in the town house now killed geneva fine but that wasnt his main goal he had to take out at least some of the people inside the investigators searching for him and his employer kill them put them in a coma cause brain damage it didnt matter the important thing was to debilitate them thompson checked the concentration once again and altered it slightly making up for how the air would alter the ph balance his hands were a bit unsteady so he stepped away for a moment to calm himself wssst the song hed been whistling became stairway to heaven thompson leaned back and thought about how to get the gas bomb into the town house a few ideas occurred to him including one or two he was pretty sure would work quite well he again tested the concentration of the acid whistling absently through the mouthpiece of the respirator the analyzer reported that the strength was percent perfect wssst the new tune that popped into his head was the ode to joy from beethovens ninth symphony amelia sachs had been neither crushed to death by clay and soil nor blown up by unstable nineteenthcentury ordnance she was now standing showered and in clean clothes in rhymes lab looking over what had tumbled from the dry cistern into her lap an hour earlier it wasnt an old bomb but there was little doubt now that itd been left in the well by charles singleton on the night of july rhymes chair was parked in front of the examination table beside sachs as they peered into the cardboard evidence collection box cooper was with them pulling on latex gloves well have to tell geneva rhyme said do we sachs said reluctantly i dont want to tell me what sachs turned quickly rhyme backed away from the table and reluctantly rolled the storm arrow in a circle thinking damnit shouldve been more careful geneva settle stood in the doorway you found out something about charles in the basement of that tavern didnt you you found out that he really did steal the money was that his secret after all a glance at sachs then rhyme said no geneva no we found something else a nod toward the box here take a look the girl walked closer she stopped blinking staring down at the brown human skull it was this that theyd seen on the ultrasound image and that had rolled out into sachss lap with the help of vegas gail daviss briard the detective had recovered the remaining bones these bones what sachs had thought were the slats from a strongbox were those of a man rhyme had determined the body had apparently been stuffed vertically into the cistern in the basement of potters field tavern just before charles had ignited the fire the ultrasound imaging had picked up the top of the skull and a rib beneath it which gave the appearance of a fuse for a bomb the bones were in a second box on the worktable were pretty sure its a man that charles killed no and then he burned down the tavern to cover up the crime you couldnt know that geneva snapped we dont no but its a reasonable deduction rhyme explained his letter said he was going to potters field armed with his navy colt revolver that was a pistol from the civil war it didnt work like guns nowadays where you load a bullet into the back of the cylinder you had to load each chamber from the front with a ball and gunpowder she nodded her eyes were on the brown and black bones the eyeless skull we found some information on guns like his in our database its acaliber but most civil war soldiers learned to usecaliber balls in them theyre a little bigger and fit more tightly that makes the gun more accurate sachs picked up a small plastic bag this was in the skull cavity inside was a little sphere of lead its acaliber ball that was fired out of acaliber gun but that doesnt prove anything she was staring at the hole in the forehead of the skull no rhyme said kindly it suggests but it suggests very strongly that charles killed him who was he geneva asked we dont have any idea if he had any id on him it burned up or disintegrated along with his clothes we found the bullet a small gun that he probably had with him some gold coins and a ring with the wordwhat was the word mel winskinskie he held up a plastic bag with the gold signet ring inside above the inscription was an etched profile of an american indian cooper had quickly found that the word meant doorman or gatekeeper in the language of the delaware indians this might be the dead mans name though his cranial bone structure suggested he wasnt nativeamerican more likely rhyme felt it was a fraternal school or lodge slogan of some sort and cooper had queried some anthropologists and history professors via email to see if theyd heard of the word charles wouldnt do it his descendant said softly he wouldnt murder anyone the bullet was fired into the forehead rhyme said not from behind and the derringer the gun that sachs found in the cistern probably belonged to the victim that suggests the shooting couldve been in selfdefense though the fact remained that charles had voluntarily gone to the tavern armed with a gun he would have anticipated some sort of violence i should never have started this in the first place geneva muttered stupid i dont even like the past its pointless i hate it she turned and ran into the hallway then up the stairs sachs followed she returned a few minutes later shes reading she said she wants to be alone i think shell be all right her voice didnt sound very certain though rhyme looked over the information on the oldest scene hed ever run years the whole point of the search was to learn something that might lead them to whoever had hired unsub but all it had done was nearly get sachs killed and disappoint geneva with the news that her ancestor had killed a man he looked at the copy of the hanged man tarot card staring at him placidly from the evidence board mocking rhymes frustration cooper said hey have something here he was looking at his computer screen winskinskie rhyme asked no listen an answer to our mystery substance the one that amelia found in the unsubs elizabeth street safe house and near genevas aunts the liquid damn well about time what the hell is it toxin rhyme asked our bad boys got dry eyes cooper said what its murine eyedrops thats right the compositions exactly the same okay add that to the chart rhyme ordered thom might just be temporary because hed been working with acid in which case wont help us but it might be chronic thatd be good criminalists loved perps with physical maladies rhyme had a whole section in his book on tracing people through prescription or overthecounter drugs disposed hypodermic needles prescription eyeglasses unique shoetread wear from orthopedic problems and so on it was then that sachss phone rang she listened for a moment okay ill be there in fifteen minutes the policewoman disconnected glanced at rhyme well thiss interesting chapter twentyeight when amelia sachs walked into the critical care unit at columbiapresbyterian hospital she saw two pulaskis one was in bed swathed in bandages and hooked up to creepy clear plastic tubes his eyes were dull his mouth slack the other sat at his bedside awkward in the uncomfortable plastic chair just as blond just as freshfaced in the same crisp blue nypd uniform ron pulaski had been wearing when sachs had recruited him in front of the africanamerican museum yesterday and told him to act concerned about a pile of garbage how many sugars she blinked at the mirror image im tony rons brother which you probably guessed hi detective ron

words it took for timetook more time on me so he didnt getdidnt get a good chance to go after geneva sachs smiled youre kind of a glassishalffull sorta guy she didnt tell him that hed been beaten nearly to death simply so unsub could use a bullet from his weapon for a distraction sorta am thank sheneva geneva for me for the book he couldnt really move his head but his eyes slipped to the side

poor man looked exhausted his breathing was labored his eyes much more unfocused than when shed arrived she rose ill let him get some rest she asked you heard of terry dobyns no ishh hewho ishh a grimace crossed the injured officers face who is he department psychologist she glanced at ron with a smile thisll take the starch out of you for a while you should talk to him about it hes the man he rules ron said dont need to patrolman she said sternly he lifted an eyebrow winced its an order yes maam i meanmaam anthony said ill make sure he does youll thankgeneva for me i like that book i will sachs slung her bag over her shoulder and started for the door she just stepped through it when she stopped abruptly turned back ron wusthat she returned to his bedside sat down again ron you said the unsub was near you for a few minutes yuh well if you couldnt see him with the blood in your eyes how did you know he was there the young officer frowned ohyeah theres shomething i forgot to tell you our boys got a habit rhyme amelia sachs was back in the laboratory whats that he whistles for taxis music pulaski heard him after hed been hit the first time and was lying on the ground the unsub took his weapon and im guessing spent a few minutes to hook the bullet to the cigarette while he was doing that he was whistling real softly ron said but hes sure it was whistling no pros going to whistle on the job rhyme said you wouldnt think but i heard it too at the safe house on elizabeth street i thought it was the radio or something he was good hows the rookie doing sellitto asked he hadnt rubbed his invisible bloodstain recently but he was still edgy they say hell be okay a month of therapy or so i told him to see terry dobyns ron was pretty out of it but his brother was there hell look after him hes a uniform too identical twin rhyme wasnt surprised being on the force often ran in the family cop could be the name of a human gene but sellitto shook his head at the news of a sibling he seemed all the more upset as if it was his fault that an entire family had been affected by the attack there was no time though to deal with the detectives demons rhyme said all right weve got some new information lets put it to use how cooper asked the murder of charlie tuckers still the closest lead we have to mr oneohnine so obviously the criminalist added we call texas remember the

secret was what caused all this heartache lo hey there j t thiss lincoln rhyme in new york speaking to someone who went by initials and lived in the lone star state not to mention his drawl made you tend to drop words like hey and listen here into your speech oh yes sir how you doing say i read up on you after we talked last time didnt know you were famous ah just a former civil servant rhyme said with a modesty that rang like dull tin nothing more or less than that any better luck with the picture we sent you sorry detective rhyme fact is he looks like half the white guys who graduated from here sides were like most correctional outfits got ourselves a big turnover arent hardly any employees still here from the time when charlie tucker was killed weve got a little more information about him this might help narrow down the list you got a minute shoot he may have an eye problem he uses murine regularly that could be recent but maybe he did it when he was a prisoner there and then we think he mayve had the habit of whistling whistling like at a woman or some such no whistling a tune songs oh okay hold on five impossibly long minutes later he came back on the line sorry nobody could remember anything about anybody whistling or having bad eyes not particular but well keep looking rhyme thanked him and disconnected he stared at the evidence chart in frustration in the early s one of the greatest criminalists who ever lived edmond locard of france came up with what he called the exchange principle which holds that at every crime scene there is some exchange of evidence however minute between the criminal and the scene or the victim finding that evidence was the goal of the forensic detective locards principle however didnt go on to guarantee that simply establishing that connection would lead you to the perps door he sighed well hed known it would be a long shot whatd they have a vague computer drawing a possible eye condition a possible habit a grudge against a prison guard what else should the rhyme frowned he was staring at the twelfth card in the tarot deck the hanged man does not refer to someone being punished maybe not but it still depicted a man dangling from a scaffold something clicked in his mind he glanced at the evidence chart again noting the baton the electricity hookup on elizabeth street the poison gas the cluster of bullets in the heart the lynching of charlie tucker the rope fibers with traces of blood oh hell he spat out lincoln whats the matter cooper glanced over at his boss concerned rhyme shouted command redial the computer responded on the screen i did not understand what you said what would you like me to do redial the number i did not understand what you said fuck it mel sachssomebody hit redial cooper did and a few minutes later the criminalist was speaking once again to the warden in amarillo j t its lincoln again yes sir forget inmates i want to know about guards guards somebody who used to be on your staff with eye problems who whistled and he mightve worked on death row before or around the time tucker was killed we all werent thinkin bout employees and again most of our staff wasnt here five six years ago but hold on here lemme ask around the image of the hanged man had put the thought into rhymes head he then considered the weapons and the techniques that unsub had employed they were methods of execution cyanide gas electricity hanging shooting a group of bullets into the heart like a firing squad and his weapon to subdue his victims was a baton like a prison guard would carry a moment later he heard hey there detective rhyme go ahead j t sure nough somebody said that rings a bell i called one of our retired guards at home worked execution detail name of pepper hes agreed to come into the office and talk to you lives nearby should be here in just a few minutes well call you right back another glance at the tarot card a change of direction ten insufferably long minutes later the phone rang fast introductions were made retired texas department of justice officer halbert pepper spoke in a drawl that made j t beauchamps accent sound like the queens english thinkin i might be able to help yall out some tell me rhyme said till bout five years ago we had us a executions control officer fit the bill of who yall were describin to j t had hisself eye trouble and he whistled up a storm i was just bout to retire round then but i worked with him some who was he fella name of thompson boyd iv dead man walking chapter twentynine through the speakerphone pepper was explaining boyd grew up round these parts father was a wildcatter oil field hand yes sir mother stayed at home no other kids normal childhood sounded like pretty nice to hear tell always talkin bout his family loved em did a lot for his mother who lost a arm or leg or whatnot in a twister always looking out for her like one time i heard this kid on the street made fun of her and boyd followed him and threatened to slip a sidewinder into the boys bed some night if he didnt apologize anyway after high school and a yearr two of college he went to work at his daddys company for a spell till they had a string of layoffs he got fired his daddy too times was bad and he just couldnt get work round here and so he moved outa the state dont know where got hisself a job at some prison started as a block guard then there was some problem their executions officer went sick i think and there was nobody to do the job so boyd done it the burn went so good the what sorry the electrocution went so good they give him the job he stayed for a while but kept on movin from state to state cause he was in demand became an expert at executions he knew chairs electric chairs like our ol sparky down here yes sir the famous one and he knew gas too was a expert at riggin the chamber could also tie a hangmans noose and not many people in the us re licensed for that line of work lemme tell you the eco job opened up here and he jumped at it wed switched to lethal injections like most other places and he became a whiz at them too even read up on em so he could answer the protesters theres some people claim the chemicalsre painful i myself think thats the whale people and democrats who dont bother to know the facts its hogwash i mean we had these about boyd asked impatient lincoln rhyme yes sir sorry so hes back here and things go fine for a spell nobody really paid him much mind he was just kinda invisible average joe was his nickname but somethin happened over time somethin changed after a time he started to go strange how so the more executions he ran the crazier he got kind of blanker and blanker that make sense like he wasnt quite all there give you a forinstance told you he and his folks was real tight got along great what happens but they get themselves killed in this car accident his aunt too and boyd he didnt blink hell he didnt even go to the funeral you wouldve thought he was in shock but it wasnt that way he just didnt seem to care he went to his normal shift and when everbody heard they asked what he was doin there it was two days till the next execution he coulda took time off but he didnt want to he said hed go out to their graves later dont know if he ever did see it was like he kept gettin closer and closer to the prisoners too close a lot of folk thought you dont do that aint healthy he stopped hangin out with other guards and spent his time with the condemned he called em my people word is that he one time even sat down in our old electric chair itself which is in this sort of museum just to see what it was like fell asleep imagine that somebody asked boyd about it howd it feel bein in a electric chair he said it didnt feel like nothin it just felt kinda numb he said that a lot toward the end he felt numb you said his parents were killed did he move into their house think he did is it still there the texans were on a speakerphone too and j t beauchamp called out ill find that out sir he posed a question to somebody should see in a minute or two mr rhyme and could you find out about relatives in the area yes sir sachs asked you recall he whistled a lot officer pepper yesm and he was right good at it sometimes hed give the condemned a song or two to send em off what about his eyes that too pepper said thompson had hisself bad eyes the story is he was runnin a electrocution wasnt here and somethin went bad happened sometimes when youd use the chair a fire started the man being executed sachs asked wincing thats right maam caught hisself on fire he mighta been dead already or unconscious nobody knows he was still movin round but they always do that so thompson runs in with a riot gun gonna shoot the poor fella put him out of his misery now thats not part of protocol ill tell you its murder to kill the condemned before they die under the writ of execution but boyd was gonna do it anyway couldnt let one of his people die like that but the fire spread insulation on the wire or some plastic or somethin caught and the fumes knocked boyd out he was blinded for a day or two the inmate sachs asked thompson didnt hafta shoot him the juice did the trick and he left five years ago rhyme asked bout that pepper drawled quit think he went up to some place some prison in the midwest never heard nothin bout him after that midwest maybe ohio where the other murder that fit the profile took place call somebody at ohio corrections rhyme whispered to cooper who nodded and grabbed another phone what about charlie tucker the guard who was killed boyd left around the time of the murder yes sir thats right there bad blood between them pepper said charlie worked under thompson for a year fore he retired only charlie was what wed call a bible thumper a hardshell baptist hed lay chapter and verse on pretty thick to the condemned sometimes tell em they was goin to hell and so on thompson didnt hold with that so maybe boyd killed him to pay him back for making prisoners lives miserable my people couldve been what about the picture we sent was that boyd j t just showed it to me pepper said and yeah it could be him though he was bigger fatter i mean back then and he had a shaved head and goatee lotta us did that tryin to look as mean as the prisoners sides the warden said we were looking for inmates not guards which was my mistake rhyme thought angrily well damn the voice of the warden again whats that j t my gal went to pull boyds personnel file and its missing sure is so he stole his record to cover up any connection to charlie tuckers murder sellitto said id reckon j t beauchamp said rhyme shook his head and he was worried about fingerprints because hed been printed as a state employee not a criminal hold on the warden drawled a woman was speaking to him he came back on the speakerphone we just heard from a fella at county records boyd sold the family house five years ago didnt buy anything else in the state at least not under his name mustve just took the cash and disappeared and nobody knows about any other relations of his whats his full name rhyme asked pepper said think his middle initial was g but i dont know what it stood for then he added one thing ill say for him thompson boyd knew what he was doin he knew the ep backward and forward ep the execution protocol its a big book we have givin all the details of how to execute somebody he made everbody who worked the detail memorize it and made em walk around recitin to themselves i have to do it by the book i have to do it by the book thompson always said you cant never cut corners when it comes to death mel cooper hung up the phone ohio rhyme asked the tech nodded keegan falls maximum security boyd only worked there for about a year the warden remembers him because of the eye problem and he did whistle he said boyd was a problem from the beginning got into fights with guards about the treatment of prisoners and spent a lot of time socializing with inmates which was against the rules the warden thinks he was making contacts to use later to get jobs as a hitman like hooking up with the man who hired him to kill that witness there could be and that employment file stolen missing yep nobody knows where he lived or anything else about him fell off the radar average joe well hes not texass or ohios problem anymore hes ours do the full search right cooper ran the standard search deeds department of motor vehicles hotels traffic tickets taxeseverything in fifteen minutes all the results were in there were several listings of thompson g boyd and one of t g boyd but their ages and descriptions werent close to the suspects the tech also tried variant spellings of those names and had the same results akas rhyme asked most professional perps particularly contract killers used alsoknownas names the ones they picked were usually like passwords for computers and atms they were some variation on a name that meant something to the perp when you found out what they were you could kick yourself for the simplicity of the choice but guessing them was usually impossible still they tried they transposed the given and surnames thompson was of course more common as a last name cooper even tried an anagram generator to rearrange the letters in thompson boyd but came up with no hits in the databases nothing rhyme thought inflamed with frustration we know his name we know what he looks like we know hes in town but we cant goddamn find him sachs squinted at the chart cocked her head she said billy todd hammil who rhyme demanded the name he used to rent the safe house on elizabeth street what about it she flipped through a number of sheets of paper she looked up died six years ago does it say where nope but im betting texas sachs called the prison once more and asked about hammil a moment later she hung up the phone and nodded thats it killed a clerk in a convenience store twelve years ago boyd supervised his execution seems like hes got this weird connection with the people he killed his mo comes from the days when he was an executioner why not his identities too rhyme didnt know or care about weird connections but whatever boyds motive there was some logic to sachss suggestion he barked get the list of everybody hes executed and match it to dmv here try texas first then well move on to other states j t beauchamp sent them a list of seventynine prisoners thompson boyd had put to death as an execution officer in texas that many sachs asked frowning though sachs would never hesitate to shoot to kill when it came to saving lives rhyme knew she had some doubts about the death penalty because it was often meted out after trials involving circumstantial or faulty and sometimes even intentionally altered evidence rhyme thought of the other implication of the number of executions that somewhere along the line of nearly eighty executions thompson boyd had lost any distinction between life and death what happens but they get themselves killed in this car accidentand boyd he didnt blink hell he didnt even go to the funeral cooper matched the names of the male prisoners executed to government records nothing shit rhyme snapped well have to find out the other states he worked and who he executed there itll take forever then a thought came to him hold on women what sachs asked try the women hes executed variations on their names cooper took this the smaller list and ran the names and all possible spellings through the dmv computer okay may have something here the tech said excitedly eight years ago a woman named randi rae silling a prostitute was executed in amarillo for robbing and killing two of her johns new york dmvs got one too same last name but its a male randy with a y and middle name ray right age and right description address in queens astoria got a blue buick century three years old rhyme ordered have somebody in plain clothes take the composite picture around to some neighbors cooper called the deputy inspector the head of the local precinct the this house covered astoria a largely greek neighborhood he explained about the case and then emailed him the picture of boyd the dep inspector said hed send some streetclothes officers out to subtly canvass tenants in randy sillings apartment for a tense half hour with no word from the canvass team in queens cooper sachs and sellitto contacted public records offices in texas ohio and new york looking for any information they could find about boyd or hammil or silling nothing finally they received a call back from the inspector at the captain the man asked many senior officers still referred to rhyme by his old title go ahead weve had two people confirm that your man lives at the dmv address the man said what are you thinking of in terms of prioritizing our approaches sir brass rhyme sighed he dispensed with any caustic responses to the bureaucrattalk and settled for a slightly bemused lets go nail his ass chapter thirty a dozen emergency services unit tactical officers were moving into position behind thompson boyds sixstory apartment building on fourteenth street in astoria queens sachs sellitto and bo haumann were standing at the hastily set up command post behind an unmarked esu van were here rhyme sachs whispered into the stalk mike but is he there the criminalist asked impatiently weve got s and s in position hold on somebodys reporting a search and surveillance unit officer came up to them get a look inside asked haumann negative sir hes masked the front windows the s and s man in team one explained hed gotten as close to the apartments front windows as he dared the second team was around back the officer now added i could hear sounds voices water running children it sounded like kids hell haumann muttered mightve been tv or radio i just cant tell haumann nodded cp to s and s two report s and s two little crack beside the shade not much though nobody in the back bedroom i can see but its a narrow angle lights on in the front hear voices i think music k see kids toys anything negative but ive only got a tendegree view of the bedroom thats all i can see k movement negative k roger infrared infrared detectors can locate the position of animals humans or other sources of heat inside a building a third s and s technician was playing a monitor over the apartment im getting heat indications but theyre too weak to pinpoint the source k sounds k creaks and moans could be the structure settling utilities hvac or could be him walking around or shifting in a chair assume hes there but i cant tell you where hes really got the place blacked out k okay s and s keep monitoring out sachs said into her mike rhyme you get any of that and how could i get it came his irritated voice they think theres activity in his apartment last thing we need is a firefight he muttered a tactical confrontation was one of the most effective ways to destroy trace and other clues at a crime scene weve got to secure as much evidence as we can it could be our only chance to find out who hired him and who his partner is haumann looked over the apartment once again he didnt seem pleased and sachs who was half tactical officer at heart could understand why it would be a difficult takedown requiring many officers the unsub had two front three back and six side windows boyd could easily leap through any one of them and try to escape there was also a building next door only four feet away an easy jump from the roof if he made his way to the top he could also have cover from behind the facade on the crown of the building and could target anyone below across the street facing the killers apartment were other houses if it came to a fight a stray bullet could easily injure or kill a bystander boyd could also intentionally pepper those buildings with gunfire hoping to inflict random injuries sachs was recalling his practice of targeting innocents solely for diversion there was no reason to think hed handle this situation any differently theyd have to clear all these residences before the assault haumann radioed we just got somebody into the hallway therere no cameras like boyd had on elizabeth street he wont know were coming the tactical cop added darkly though unless hes got some other way of telling which he very well may knowing this prick sachs heard a hiss of breath next to her and turned decked out in body armor and absently touching the grip of his service pistol snug in its holster lon sellitto was examining the apartment he too looked troubled but sachs knew immediately that it wasnt the difficulty of a residential takedown that was bothering him she could see how torn he was as a senior investigating detective there was no reason for him to be on an entry team in fact given his paunchy physique and rudimentary weapons skills there was every reason for him not to do a kickin but logic had nothing to do with the real reason for his being here seeing his hand rise once more compulsively to his cheek and worry the phantom bloodstain and knowing that he was reliving the accidental discharge of his weapon yesterday and dr barrys being shot to death right in front of him sachs understood this was lon sellittos knuckle time the expression had come from her father whod done plenty of courageous things on the force but had probably been the bravest during his last fight against the cancer that ended his life though hardly defeated him his girl was a cop by then and hed taken to giving her advice about the job once hed told her that sometimes shed find herself in situations where there was nothing to do but stand up to a risk or challenge all by yourself i call it knuckle time amie something youve got to muscle your way through the fight might be against a perp it might be against a partner it might even be against the whole nypd sometimes hed said the hardest battle was within your own soul sellitto knew what to do he had to be the first man through the door but after the incident at the museum yesterday he was paralyzed with fear at the thought knuckle timewould he stand up or not haumann now divided his entry officers into three teams and sent several others to the street corners to halt traffic and another one into the shadows beside the buildings front door to intercept anybody who happened to be entering the building and to be prepared to take down boyd himself if he happened to wander outside on an errand unsuspecting one officer climbed up to the roof several more esu cops secured the apartments next door to boyds in case he tried to escape the way hed done on elizabeth street haumann then glanced at sachs youre going in with us yup she replied somebody from crime scenes got to secure the place we still dont know who hired this sob and weve got to find out which team you want to be on with whoevers going through the front door she said thatd be jenkinss yes sir she then explained about the residences across the street and reminded them that boyd might target the civilians living there in an attempt to escape haumann nodded i need somebody to clear those places at least get people away from the front windows and keep em off the streets nobody wanted this job of course if esu cops had been cowboys haumann was asking for somebody to volunteer to be cook the silence was broken by a voice hell ill take it it was lon sellitto perfect for an old guy like me sachs glanced at him the detective had just flunked his knuckle time his nerve had broken he gave a carefree grin maybe the saddest smile sachs had ever seen in her life into his mike the esu head said all teams deploy to holding perimeter and s and s let me know the minute theres a change in the premises k roger out sachs said into her microphone were going in rhyme ill let you know what happens got it he said tersely nothing more was said between them rhyme didnt like her going into combat but he knew how driven she was how any threat to an innocent infuriated her how it was important for her to make sure people like thompson boyd didnt get away this was part of her nature and hed never suggested she stand down at times like this didnt mean he was going to be cheerful about it though but then thoughts of lincoln rhyme faded as they started into position sachs and sellitto were walking up the alley she to join the entry team he to continue on to the residences across the street and get the people there under cover the lieutenants phony grin was gone the mans face looked puffy and was dotted with sweat despite the cool temperature he wiped it scratched the invisible bloodstain and noticed her looking at him fucking body armor hot hate it sachs said they continued steadily down the alley until they got close to the back of boyds apartment where the troops were deploying suddenly she grabbed sellittos arm and pulled him back somebodys watching but as they stepped close to the building sachs tripped over a trash bag and went down hard on her leg she gasped wincing and cradling her knee you okay fine she said climbing to her feet with a grimace she called into her radio in a breathless voice five eight eight five i saw movement in a secondfloor window rear of the building s and s can you confirm no hostiles thats one of our people youre seeing k roger out sachs started forward limping amelia youre hurt nothing tell bo its not a problem the fact that she suffered from arthritis was well known to the inner circle rhyme mel cooper and sellitto but that was about it she went to great lengths to hide her malady worried that the brass would sideline her on a medical if they found out she reached into her slacks pocket and pulled out a packet of painkillers ripped it open with her teeth and swallowed the pills dry over the radio they heard bo haumanns voice all teams form up k sachs moved forward to the main entry team the limp was worse sellitto pulled her aside you cant go in its not like im going to run him to ground lon im just going to secure the scene the detective turned toward the cp truck hoping hed find someone to ask about the situation but haumann and the others had already deployed its better its fine she limped forward one of the officers on team a called in a whisper to sachs detective you ready yeah no shes not sellitto turned to the officer shes getting the civvies out of the way im going in with you guys you yeah me there a fucking problem no sir lon she whispered im fine the big detective responded i know enough about crime scenes to secure the place rhymes been busting my chops for years to get it right im not going to be sprinting yeah maybe not but could you drop into a combat pose if he lights you up with that fucking gun of his yes i could she answered firmly well i dont think so so quit arguing and get the civvies safe he cinched his body armor tighter and drew his revolver she hesitated thats an order detective she looked at him darkly but as independent as sachs was some would use the word renegade the portables daughter knew her place in the ranks of the new york city police department she said all rightbut here take this she drew her fifteenround glock and handed it to him along with an extra clip she took his sixshot revolver he looked down at the large black automatic it was a gun with a trigger pull as delicate as a moths wing if he handled this weapon wrong like hed done on elizabeth street yesterday he could easily kill himself or somebody on the entry team rubbing his cheek once more sellitto glanced at the apartment and hurried to join the others crossing the street to clear the apartments and houses sachs glanced back and watched them go she turned and continued on to the apartments and houses across the street the limp was gone in fact she was fine the only pain she felt was disappointment that she wasnt on point with the entry team but shed had to fake the fall and injury for lon sellittos sake she couldnt think of any way to save him except by forcing him to take on the job shed assessed the risk of his going in on a team and decided that there was minimal threat to him or to anybody else thered be plenty of backup everybody was in armor and they were catching their perp by surprise sellitto also seemed to have some measure of control over his fear she recalled the deliberation with which hed held and examined the glock how his quick eyes had looked over the perps building but in any event there really was no choice sellitto was a great cop but if he stayed skittish hed cease to be any kind of cop at all and his life would be over with those splinters of selfdoubt had a way of infecting your entire soul sachs knew she battled them constantly herself if he didnt go back into combat now hed give up she picked up her pace after all she did have an important job here clearing the residences across the street and she had to move fast the entry team was going inside at any minute sachs started ringing doorbells and getting people out of front rooms and making sure they stayed inside for the time being behind locked doors she radioed bo haumann on the secure tactical frequency and told him that the immediate houses were clear shed keep going with those that were farther away up and down the street okay were going in the man said tersely and disconnected sachs continued along the street she found her fingernail digging into her thumb reflecting on the irony sellitto fidgeted going into a fight amelia sachs was edgy when she had to stay out of harms way chapter thirtyone lon sellitto followed the four officers up the dim stairs to the secondfloor landing of the apartment breathing hard from the climb he paused caught his breath the tactical cops huddled waiting for word from haumann that the electricity to the apartment had been cut they didnt want any more electrocutions while they waited the big detective had a talk with himself are you ready for this think about it nows the time to decide leave or stay tap tap tap it all swirled around in his mind the blood spattering him obscenely the needles from the bullet ripping apart flesh the brown eyes that were filled with life one second and then glazed with death a moment later the icy rush of absolute panic when that basement door on elizabeth street opened and his gun went off with a huge kicking explosion amelia sachs cringing reaching for her weapon as the bullet dug chunks of stone out of the wall just a few feet from her the bullet from my own goddamn gun what was happening he wondered was his nerve gone he laughed grimly to himself comparing the kind of nerve he was thinking of to lincoln rhymes whose physical nerve the one in his spine was literally destroyed well rhyme fucking well dealt with what happened to him why cant i it was a question that had to be answered because if he stepped up now and he caved or flubbed the takedown again people might die probably would given the stonecold perp they were after if he stayed back took himself off the detail his career would be over but at least he wouldntve jeopardized anyone else can you do it he asked himself the leader of the team said detective were going in in about thirty seconds well batter the door spread out and clear the apartment you can come in and secure the crime scene after that all right with you leave or stay the lieutenant asked himself you can just walk downstairs thatll be it give up your shield hire on as a security consultant with some corporation double your salary never get shot at again tap tap tap never see eyes wincing and going lifeless inches from yours tap is that okay the leader repeated sellitto glanced at the cop no he whispered no the esu officer frowned the detective said take the door out with the ram then ill go in first but sellitto muttered you heard detective sachs this perp isnt working alone we need anything we can find thatll lead us to the prick who hired him ill know what to look for and i can save the scene if he tries to fuck it up let me call in the esu man said doubtfully officer the detective said calmly thats the way it is im senior here the team leader looked at his second in command they shrugged its yourdecision sellitto supposed the third word of that sentence was originally going to be funeral as soon as they pull the juice we go in the esu officer said he put on his gas mask the team pulled on theirs sellitto too he gripped sachss glock kept his finger outside the trigger guard and stepped to the side of the door in his earpiece he heard were cutting the electricity in threetwoone the leader tapped the shoulder of the officer with the battering ram the big man swung it hard and the door crashed open flying on adrenaline forgetting everything but the perp and the evidence sellitto charged inside the tactical officers behind covering him kicking doors open and searching the rooms the second team came in from the kitchen no immediate sign of boyd on a small tv a sitcom played the source of the voices and most likely the source of heat and noise that s and s had found most likely but maybe not glancing left and right as he entered the small living room seeing no one sellitto headed straight for boyds desk piled high with evidence sheets of paper ammunition several envelopes bits of plastic wire a digital timer jars of liquid and of white powder a transistor radio rope using a tissue sellitto carefully checked a metal cabinet near the desk for traps he found none and opened it noting more jars and boxes two more guns several stacks of new bills nearly the detective estimated rooms clear one of the esu officers called then another from a different room finally a voice team leader a to cp weve cleared the scene k sellitto laughed out loud hed done it confronted whatever the fuck it was thatd been torturing him but dont get too cocky he told himself pocketing sachss glock you came along on this sleigh ride for a reason remember you got work to do so secure the fucking evidence as he looked over the place though he realized something was nagging what looking over the kitchen the hallway the desk what was odd something was wrong then it occurred to him transistor radio did they even make those anymore well if they did you hardly ever saw em with all the fancier players available for cheap boom boxes cd players mps shit its a booby trap an explosive device and its sitting right next to a big jar of clear liquid with a glass stopper in the top which sellitto knew from science class was what you used to store acid in christ how long did he have before it detonated a minute two sellitto lunged forward and grabbed the radio stepped to the bathroom setting it in the sink one of the tactical officers asked whats weve got an ied clear the apartment the detective shouted ripping off his gas mask get the fuck out the officer cried sellitto ignored him when people make improvised explosive devices they never worry about obscuring fingerprints or other clues because once the devices blow up most evidence is destroyed they knew boyds identity of course but there could be some trace or other prints on the device that might lead to the person hiring him or his accomplice call the bomb squad somebody transmitted shut up im busy there was an onoff switch on the radio but he didnt trust that to deactivate the explosive charge cringing the detective worked the black plastic back off the radio how long how long whats a reasonable time for boyd to get into his apartment and disarm the trap as he popped the back off and bent down sellitto found himself staring at a half stick of dynamite not a plastic explosive but plenty powerful enough to blow off his hand and blind him there was no display its only in the movies that bombs have easytoread digital timers that count down to zero real bombs are detonated by tiny microprocessor timing chips without displays sellitto held the dynamite itself in place with a fingernail to keep from obliterating any prints he started to work the blasting cap out of the explosive wondering how sophisticated the unsub had been serious bomb makers use secondary detonators to take out people like sellitto who were fucking around with their handiwork he pulled the blasting cap out of the dynamite no secondary detonators or any the explosion a huge ringing bang echoed through the bathroom reverberating off the tile what was that bo haumann called somebody shooting we have gunshots all units report explosion in the bathroom of the subjects unit somebody called medics to the scene ems to the scene negative negative everybody take it easy sellitto was running his burned fingers under cold water i just need a bandaid that you lieutenant yeah it was the blasting cap went off boyd had a booby trap rigged to take out the evidence i saved most of it he pressed his hand into his armpit and squeezed fuck that stings how big a device haumann asked sellitto glanced at the desk in the other room big enough to blow the shit out of what looks like a gallon jar of sulfuric acid id guess and i see some jars of powder probably cyanide it wouldve taken out most of the evidence and anybody who was nearby several of the esu officers glanced with gratitude toward sellitto one said man thiss one perp i wanna take down personally haumann ever the voice of a detached cop asked matteroffactly status of unsub no sign heat on the infrared was a fridge tv and sunlight on furniture looks like one cop transmitted sellitto looked over the room and then radioed got an idea bo go ahead lets fix the door fast leave me and a couple other guys inside clear everybody else off the streets he might be back soon well get him then roger lon i like it lets get moving who knows carpentry ill do it sellitto said one of my hobbies just get me some tools and what kind of fucking entry team is this doesnt anybody have a goddamn bandaid down the street from boyds apartment amelia sachs was listening to the transmitted exchanges about the kickin it seemed that her plan for sellitto mightve worked even better than shed hoped she wasnt exactly sure what had happened but it was clear that hed done something ballsy and she heard some newfound confidence in his voice she acknowledged the message about the plan to pull everybody off the street and wait for boyd to return then she added that she was going to warn the last residents across the street from the safe house and after that shed join the others on the stakeout she knocked on the front door and told the woman who answered to stay away from the front of the house until she heard it was safe to come out there was a police action going on across the street the womans eyes were wide is it dangerous sachs gave her the standard line were just being cautious nothing to be alarmed about and so on noncommittal reassuring half of being a cop is public relations sometimes its most of being a cop sachs added that shed seen some childrens toys in the womans yard were they home now it was then that sachs saw a man emerge from an alleyway up the street he was walking slowly in the direction of the apartment head down wearing a hat and a long overcoat she couldnt see his face the woman was saying in a concerned voice its just my boyfriend and me here now the children are at school they usually walk home but should we go pick them up maam that man there across the street she stepped forward and glanced him do you know him sure he lives in that building right there whats his name larry tang oh hes chinese i guess or japanese or something sachs relaxed hes not involved in anything is he the woman asked no hes not about your children it probably would be best to oh jesus looking past the woman amelia sachs stared into a bedroom of the bungalow which was in the process of being renovated on the wall were some painted cartoon characters one was from winniethepooh the character tigger the orange shade of the paint was identical to the samples shed found near geneva s aunts place in harlem bright orange then she glanced at the floor in the entry hall on a square of newspapers was an old pair of shoes light brown she could just see the label inside they were bass about size amelia sachs understood suddenly that the boyfriend that the woman had referred to was thompson boyd and the apartment across the street wasnt his residence but was another of his safe houses the reason it was empty at the moment of course was that he was somewhere in this very house chapter thirtytwo amelia sachs thinking get the woman outside her eyes arent guilty shes not part of it thinking of course boyds armed thinking and i just traded my glock for a fucking sixshooter get her out of here fast sachss hand was easing toward her waistband where sellittos tiny pistol rested oh one more thing maam she said calmly i saw a van up the street i wonder if you could tell me whose it is what was that noise sachs wondered something from within the house metallic but not like a weapon a faint clatter a van yeah you cant see it from here its behind that tree sachs stepped back gesturing her forward could you step outside and take a look please itd be a big help the woman though stayed where she was in the entryway glancing to her right toward where the sound had come from honey she frowned whats wrong the clattering sachs understood suddenly had been venetian blinds boyd had heard the exchange with his girlfriend and had looked out the window hed seen an esu officer or squad car near his safe house its really important sachs tried if you could just but the woman froze her eyes wide no tom whatre you maam come over here sachs shouted drawing the smith wesson now youre in danger whatre you doing with that tom she backed away from boyd but remained in the corridor a rabbit in headlights no get down sachs said in a ragged whisper dropping into a crouch and moving forward into the house boyd listen to me sachs shouted if youve got a weapon drop it throw it out where i can see it then get on the floor i mean now therere dozens of officers outside silence except for the womans sobbing sachs executed a fast feint looking low around the corner to the left she caught a glimpse of the man his face calm a large black pistol in his hand not the north american magnum but an automatic which would have stoppingpower bullets and a clip capacity of fifteen rounds or so she ducked back to cover boydd been expecting her to present higher and the two slugs he fired missed her though only by inches blowing plaster and wood splinters into the air the brunette was screaming with every breath scrabbling away looking from sachs back to where boyd was no no no sachs called throw your weapon down tom please whats going on sachs called to her get down miss a long moment of complete silence what was boyd up to it was as if he was debating what to do next then he fired a single round the detective flinched the bullet was wide though it completely missed the wall where sachs stood but it turned out boyd hadnt been aiming at her at all and the slug did indeed hit its target the brunette was dropping to her knees her hands on her thigh which gushed blood tom she whispered whyoh tom she rolled onto her back and lay clutching her leg gasping in pain just like at the museum boyd had shot someone to distract the police to give him a chance to get away but this time it was his girlfriend sachs heard the crack of glass as boyd broke through a window to escape the woman kept whispering words sachs couldnt hear she radioed haumann about the womans condition and location and he immediately sent medics and backup then she thought but itll take a few minutes for ems to get here i have to save her a tourniquet would slow the bleeding i can save her life but then no hes not getting away she looked around the corner low fast and saw boyd drop out of the hall window into the side yard sachs hesitated looking back at the woman shed passed out and her hand had fallen away from the terrible wound on her leg already blood pooled under her torso christ she started toward her then stopped no you know what you have to do amelia sachs ran to the side window she looked out fast again in case he was waiting for her but no boyd expected that shed save the woman sachs saw him sprinting away from the apartment down the cobblestoned alley without a glance back she looked down a sixfoot drop to the ground her story about the pain from the fall shed told to sellitto twenty minutes ago was fake the chronic pain wasnt oh brother she scooted up onto the sill clear of the broken glass and swung her legs out then pushed off trying to ease the shock of the landing sachs kept her knees bent but it was a long drop and as she landed her left leg collapsed and she tumbled onto gravel and grass crying out at the pain breathing hard she struggled to her feet and started off after boyd now with an honest limp slowing her up god gets you for lying she thought shoving her way through a row of anemic bushes sachs broke from the yard into an alley that ran behind the houses and apartments she looked right and left no sign of him then a hundred feet ahead of her she saw a large wooden door swing open this was typical of older parts of new york unheated standalone garages lining alleys behind row and town houses it made sense that boyd would keep his car garaged the search and surveillance team hadnt found it anywhere on the surrounding blocks jogging forward as best she could sachs reported his location to the command post copy five eight eight five were on our way k moving unsteadily over the cobblestones she flipped open the cylinder of sellittos smittie and grimaced to see that he was among the more cautious gun owners the cylinder beneath the hammer was empty five shots versus boyds automatic with three times that many and possibly a spare clip or two in his pocket running to the mouth of the alley she could hear an engine start and a second later the blue buick backed out the rear toward her the alley was too narrow to make the turn in one motion so boyd had to stop drive forward then back up again this gave sachs the chance to sprint to within sixty or seventy feet of the garage boyd finished the maneuver and with the garage door as a shield between him and sachs accelerated away fast sachs dropped hard to the cobblestones and saw that the only target she had was under a narrow gap at the bottom of the garage door the rear tires prone sachs sighted on the right one its a rule in urbancombat shooting never to fire unless you know your backdrop that is where the bullet will end up if you miss your shot or if it penetrates your target and continues on as boyds car peeled away from her sachs considered this protocol for a fraction of a second then thinking of geneva settle came up with a rule of her own this fuckers not getting away the best she could do to control the shot was to aim low so that the bullet would ricochet upward and lodge in the car itself if she missed cocking the gun to single action so the trigger pull was more sensitive she aimed and squeezed off two rounds one slightly higher than the other the slugs zipped under the garage door and at least one punctured the right rear tire as the car lurched to the right and collided hard with the brick wall of the alley sachs rose and sprinted toward the wreck wincing from the pain at the garage door she paused and looked around it it turned out that both right tires were flattened shed hit the front one as well boyd tried to drive away from the wall but the front wheel was bent and frozen against the chassis he climbed out swinging the gun back and forth searching for the shooter boyd drop the weapon his response was to fire five or six shots toward the door sachs responded with one shot which struck the car body inches from him then she rolled to her right and rose fast noting that boyd was fleeing from her into the street beyond she could see the backdrop this time a brick wall across the far street and squeezed off another round but just as the gun fired boyd turned aside as if hed been expecting this the slug sailed past him also inches away he returned fire a barrage of shots and she dropped hard to the slimy cobblestones again her radio shattering he disappeared around the corner to the left one shot left shouldve used only one on the tire she thought angrily as she rose and hurried after him as best she could on the painful leg a pause at the corner where the alley met the sidewalk a fast glance to the left she saw his solid form sprinting away from her she grabbed the motorola and pressed transmit nope it was gone shit call on the cell too much to explain too little time to relay a message somebody in one of the buildings had tove called in about the shots she continued after boyd breath rasping feet slapping on the ground at the far intersection the end of the block a blueandwhite rolled to a stop the officers didnt climb out they hadnt heard the shots and didnt know the killer and sachs were here boyd looked up and saw them he stopped fast and leapt over a small fence then ducked underneath the stairway of an apartment building leading to the first floor she heard kicking as he tried to break into the basement apartment sachs waved toward the officers but they were looking up and down the cross street and didnt see her it was then that a young couple stepped out the front door of the apartment directly across from boyd closing the door behind them the young man zipped up his vest against the chill day and the woman took his arm they started down the stairs the kicking stopped oh nosachs realized what was about to happen she couldnt see boyd but she knew what he was going to do he was sighting on the couple now he was going to shoot one or both steal their keys and escape into the apartment hoping again that the police would divide their forces to look after the wounded get down sachs shouted nearly a hundred feet away the couple didnt hear boyd would be drawing a target on them now waiting for them to get closer get down sachs rose and limped toward them the couple noticed her but couldnt make out what she was saying they paused frowning get down she repeated the man cupped his hand behind his ear shaking his head sachs stopped took a deep breath and fired her last bullet into a metal garbage can about twenty feet from the couple the woman screamed and they turned scrabbling up the stairs into their apartment the door slammed at least shed managed to beside sachs a block of limestone exploded pelting her with hot lead and bits of stone a half second later she heard the loud pop of boyds gun another shot and another driving sachs back bullets striking feet from her she stumbled through the yard tripping over a foothigh wire edging fence and some plaster lawn ornaments bambis and elves one slug grazed her vest knocking the breath from her lungs she went down hard in a planting bed more slugs slammed home nearby boyd then turned toward the officers leaping out of their cruiser he peppered the squad car with several rounds flattening the tires and driving the officers to cover behind the car the uniforms were staying put but at least theyd have called the assault in and other troops would be on the way which meant of course that there was only one way for boyd to go toward her she hunkered down for cover behind some bushes boyd had stopped firing but she could hear his footsteps getting closer he was twenty feet away she guessed then ten she was sure that at any minute shed see his face followed by the muzzle of his weapon then shed die thud thud rising on an elbow she could see the killer close kicking at another basementapartment door which was slowly starting to give way his face was eerily calm like that of the hanged man in the tarot card hed intended to leave beside geneva settles body he mustve believed hed hit sachs because he ignored where shed fallen and was concentrating on breaking through the doorway the only escape route left he looked behind him once or twice toward the far end of the block where the uniformed officers were making their way toward him though slowly since hed turn and fire at them occasionally he too would have to be out of ammo pretty soon she figured he probably boyd ejected the clip from his pistol and slipped a new one in reloaded okay well she could stay where she was safe and hope that other officers would get here before he escaped but sachs thought of the brunette lying bloody in the bungalow maybe dead by now she thought of the electrocuted officer the librarian killed yesterday she thought of the young rookie pulaski his face battered and bloody and mostly she thought of poor young geneva settle whod be at risk every minute boyd was free and walking the streets clutching the empty gun she came to a decision thompson boyd delivered another powerful kick into the basement door it was starting to give way hed get inside hed dont move boyd drop the weapon blinking his stinging eyes in surprise thompson turned his head he lowered his foot which was poised for another kick well now whats this keeping his gun low he turned his head slowly and looked toward her yes like hed thought it was the woman from the crime scene at the museum library yesterday morning walking back and forth back and forth like the sidewinder red hair white jumpsuit the one hed enjoyed watching admiring her there was a lot to admire he reflected and a good shot too he was surprised that she was alive he thought for sure hed hit her in the last barrage boyd i will shoot drop your gun lie down on the sidewalk he thought a few more kicks at this door should break it in then into the alley behind the place or maybe the people who lived here had a car he could take the keys and shoot whoever was inside wound them draw off more of the police escape but of course there was one question that had to be answered first did she have any ammunition left you hearing me boyd so its you squinted his stinging eyes hadnt used any murine lately thought it might be she frowned she didnt know what he meant maybe she was wondering if hed seen her before wondering how he knew her boyd was careful not to move he had to figure this out shoot her or not but if he made the slightest motion toward her and she did have rounds left shed fire he knew that without a doubt nothing squeamish about this woman theyll kill you in a kiss he debated her gun was a sixround smith wesson special shed fired five times thompson boyd always counted shots he knew he himself had eight left in his present clip and one more fourteenround clip in his pocket had she reloaded if not did she have one more round left there are police officers who keep an empty chamber under the hammer on revolvers on the rare chance that accidentally dropping it will cause the gun to fire but she didnt seem to be that sort of person she knew weapons too well shed never drop one accidentally besides if she was doing tactical work shed want every round possible no she wasnt an emptycylinder kind of cop boyd im not telling you again on the other hand he was thinking this gun wasnt hers yesterday at the museum shed worn an automatic on her hip a glock she still had a glock holster on her belt now was the smittie a backup piece in the old days when all cops had sixshooters they sometimes carried another gun in an ankle holster but these days with automatics holding at least a dozen rounds and two extra clips on the belt they usually didnt bother with a second weapon no he bet that shed either lost her automatic or loaned it to somebody and had borrowed this one which meant she probably didnt have rounds to reload next question did the person she borrowed the smittie from keep an empty chamber under the hammer that hed have no way of knowing of course so the question came down to what kind of person she was boyd thought back to the museum seeing her searching like a rattlesnake thinking of her in the hallway outside the elizabeth street safe house going through the door after him thinking of her coming after him now leaving jeanne to die from the bullet wound in her thigh he decided she was bluffing if she had a round left shed have shot him youre out of ammo he announced he turned toward her and raised his pistol she grimaced and the gun slumped hed been right should he kill her no just shoot to wound but where was the best place painful and lifethreatening screaming and copious blood both attract a lot of attention she was favoring one leg hed shoot the painful one the knee when she was down hed park another round in her shoulder and get away so you win she said what is it now im a hostage he hadnt thought of this he hesitated did it make sense would it be helpful usually hostages were more trouble than they were worth no better to shoot her he began to pull the trigger as she pitched her gun to the sidewalk in defeat he glanced at it thinking somethings wrong herewhat was it shed been holding the revolver in her left hand but the holster was on her right hip thompsons eyes returned to her and gasped as he saw the flashing knife cartwheeling toward his face shed flung it with her right hand when hed glanced at her gun for a second the switchblade didnt stick into him or even cut it was the handle that collided with his cheek but shed tossed it directly at his poor eyes thompson ducked away instinctively lifting his arm to protect them before he could step back and draw a target the woman was on him swinging a stone shed picked up from the garden he felt a stunning blow on his temple gasped at the pain he pulled the trigger once and the gun fired but the shot missed and before he could fire again the rock slammed into his right hand the gun dropped to the ground he howled and cradled his wounded fingers thinking shed go for the gun he tried to bodyblock her but she wasnt interested in the pistol she had all the weapon she needed the rock crashed into his face once more no no he tried to hit her but she was big and strong and another blow from the rock sent him to his knees then his side twisting away from the blows stop stop he cried but in response he felt another blow of the rock against his cheek he heard a howl of rage coming from her throat theyll kill you what was she doing he wondered in shock shed won why was she doing this breaking the rules how could she this wasnt by the book in a kiss in fact when the uniformed officers sprinted up a moment later only one of them grabbed thompson boyd and cuffed him the other got his arm around the policewoman and struggled to wrestle the bloody stone from her grip through the pain the ringing in his ears thompson heard the cop saying over and over its okay its okay you got him detective its cool you can relax hes not going anywhere hes not going anywhere hes not going anywhere chapter thirtythree please please amelia sachs was hurrying back to boyds bungalow as fast as she was able ignoring the congratulations from fellow officers and trying to ignore the pain in her leg sweating breathless she trotted up to the first ems medic she saw and asked the woman in that house there he nodded to the house right the brunette who lives there oh her ive got bad news im afraid sachs inhaled a deep breath felt the horror like ice on her flesh shed captured boyd but the woman she could have saved was dead she dug a fingernail into her thumbs cuticle and felt pain felt blood thinking i did exactly what boyd did i sacrificed an innocent life for the sake of the job the medic continued she was shot i know sachs whispered staring down at the ground oh man this would be hard to live with you dont have to worry worry shell be okay sachs frowned you said you had bad news well like getting shots pretty bad news christ i knew she was shot i was there when it happened oh i thought you meant she died naw was a bleeder but we got it in time shell be all right shes at st lukes er stable condition okay thanks ive got bad news sachs wandered off limping and found sellitto and haumann in front of the safe house you collared him with an empty weapon haumann asked incredulous actually i collared him with a rock the head of esu nodded lifting an eyebrow his sweetest praise boyd saying anything she asked understood his rights then clammed up she and sellitto swapped weapons he reloaded she checked her glock and reholstered it sachs asked whats the story on the premises haumann ran a hand over his bristly crew cut and said looks like the bungalow he was living in was rented in his girlfriends name jeanne starke theyre her kids two daughters not boyds weve got child welfare involved that place he nodded toward the apartment was a safe house full of tools of the trade you know sachs said i better run the scene we kept it secure haumann said well he did a nod toward sellitto the esu head said i gotta debrief the brass youll be around after the scene theyll want a statement sachs nodded and together she and the heavy detective walked toward the safe house a silence thick as sand rested between them finally sellitto glanced at her leg and said limps back back yeah when you were clearing the houses across the street i looked out the window seemed like you were walking fine sometimes it just fixes itself sellitto shrugged funny how stuff like that happens funny he knew what shed done for him he was telling her so then he added okay we got the shooter but thats only half the job we need the prick that hired him and his partner who we gotta assume just took over boyds assignment get on the grid detective sellitto said this in a voice as gruff as any that rhyme could muster this was the best thanks he couldve given her just knowing that he was back often the most important piece of evidence is the last one you find any good cs searcherll assess the scene and immediately target the fragile items that are subject to evaporation contamination by rain dissipation by wind and so on leaving the obvious like the literal smoking gun to be collected later if the scenes secure lincoln rhyme often said the good stuff aint going anywhere in both boyds residence and the safe house across the street sachs had collected latent prints rolled up the trace collected fluid samples from the toilet for dna analysis scraped floor and furniture surfaces cut portions of the carpet for fiber samples and photographed and videoed the entire sites only then did she turn her attention to the larger and more obvious things she arranged to have the acid and cyanide transported to the departments hazardousevidence holding center in the bronx and processed the improvised explosive device contained in the transistor radio she examined and logged in weapons and ammunition the cash coils of rope tools dozens of other items that might prove helpful finally sachs picked up a small white envelope that was sitting on a shelf near the front door of the safe house inside was a single sheet of paper she read it then she gave a fast laugh she read the letter again and called rhyme thinking to herself brother were we wrong so rhyme said to cooper as both men stared at the computer screen im betting a hundred bucks youre going to find more pure carbon just like what was on the map hidden under his pillow on elizabeth street you want to put some money on it any takers too late said the tech as the analyzer beeped and the traceelements analysis from the paper popped up in front of them not that i wouldve bet anyway he shoved his glasses higher on his nose and said and yep carbon one hundred percent carbon which could be found in charcoal or ash or a number of other substances but which could also be diamond dust whats the business worlds latest abomination of the english language the criminalist asked his mood lighthearted once again we were oneeighty on this one oh they hadnt been off base about boyds being the perp or the fact hed been hired to kill geneva no it was the motive theyd blown completely everything theyd speculated about the early civil rights movement about the presentday implications of charles singletons setup in the freedmens trust robbery about the fourteenth amendment conspiracytheyd been totally wrong geneva settle had been targeted to die simply because shed seen something she shouldnt have a jewelry robbery being planned the letter amelia had found in his safe house contained diagrams of various buildings in midtown including the africanamerican museum the note read a black girl fifth floor in this window october about she saw my delivery van when he was parked in a alley behind the jewelry echange saw enough to guess the plans of mine kill her the library window near the microfiche reader where geneva was attacked was circled on the diagram in addition to the misspelling the language of the note was unusual which to a criminalist was good its far easier to trace the unusual than the common rhyme had cooper send a copy to parker kincaid a former fbi document examiner outside of dc currently in private practice like rhyme kincaid was sometimes recruited by his old employer and other law enforcement agencies to consult in cases involving documents and handwriting kincaids reply email said hed get back to them as soon as he could as she looked over the letter amelia sachs shook her head angrily she recounted the incident of the armed man she and pulaski had seen outside the museum yesterday the one who turned out to be a security guard whod told them about the valuable contents of the exchange the multimilliondollar shipments from amsterdam and jerusalem every day shouldve mentioned that she said shaking her head but who could have guessed that thompson boyd had been hired to kill geneva because shed looked out the window at the wrong time but why steal the microfiche sellitto asked to lead us off of course which it did pretty damn well rhyme sighed here we were running around thinking of constitutional law conspiracies boyd probably had no clue what geneva was reading he turned to the girl who sat nearby cradling a cup of hot chocolate someone whoever wrote that note saw you from the street he or boyd contacted the librarian to find out who you were and when youd be back so boyd could be there waiting for you dr barry was killed because he could connect you to them now think back to a week ago you looked out the window at eightthirty and saw a van and somebody in the alley do you remember what you saw the girl squinted and looked down i dont know i looked out the window a bunch when i get tired of reading i walk around some you know i cant remember anything specific for ten minutes sachs talked with geneva trying to coax her recollections into coming up with an image but to recall a specific person and a delivery van on the busy streets of midtown from a glance a week ago was too much for the girls memory rhyme called the director of the american jewelry exchange and told him what theyd learned asked if he had any idea who might be trying a heist the man replied fuck no clue it happens more than youd think though we found traces of pure carbon in some of the evidence diamond dust were thinking oh thatd mean theyd checked the alley near the loading dock probably nobody from outside gets near the cutting rooms but hey you polish product you get dust it ends up in the vacuum cleaner bags and on everything we throw out the man chuckled not much troubled by the news of the impending burglary i tell you though whoevers going after uss got some balls we got the best fucking security in the city everybody thinks its like on tv we have guys come in to buy their girlfriends rings and they look around and ask wheres those invisible beams that you wear goggles to see you know well the answer is they dont make any fucking invisiblebeam machines cause if you can walk around the beams when youre wearing special goggles then the bad guys are going to buy special fucking goggles and walk around them right real alarms arent like that if a fly farts in our vault the alarm goes off and fact is the systems so tight a fly cant even get inside i should have known lincoln rhyme snapped after they hung up look at the chart look at what we found in the first safe house he nodded toward the reference to the map that had been found on elizabeth street it showed only a basic outline of the library where geneva was attacked the jewelry exchange across the street was drawn in much greater detail as were the nearby alleys doors and loading docks entrance and exit routes to and from the exchange not the museum two detectives from downtown had interrogated boyd to find out the identity of the person behind the heist the one whod hired him but he was stonewalling sellitto then checked nypd larceny for suspicious activity reports in the diamond district but there were no particular leads that seemed relevant fred dellray took time off from investigating the rumors of the potential terrorist bombings to look through the fbis files about any federal investigations involving jewelry thefts since larceny isnt a federal crime there werent many cases but several of them mostly involving money laundering in the new york area were active and he promised hed bring the reports over right away they now turned to the evidence from boyds safe house and residence in hopes of finding the mastermind of the theft they examined the guns the chemicals the tools and the rest of the items but there was nothing that they hadnt found before more bits of orange paint acid stains and crumbs of falafel and smears of yogurt boyds favorite meal it seemed they ran the serial numbers on the money and came up with nothing from treasury and none of the bills yielded any fingerprints to withdraw this much money from an account was risky for the man who hired boyd because any such large transactions have to be reported under money laundering rules but a fast check of recent large cash withdrawals from area banks came up with no leads this was curious rhyme reflected though he concluded that the perp had probably withdrawn small amounts of the cash over time for boyds fee the unsub was one of the few people on earth it seemed who didnt own a cell phone or if he did his was an anonymous prepaid unit there were no billing records and hed managed to dispose of it before he was caught a look at jeanne starkes home phone bill yielded nothing suspicious except a halfdozen calls to payphones in manhattan queens or brooklyn but there was no regular pattern to the locations sellittos heroics had however yielded some good evidence fingerprints on the dynamite and the guts of the explosive transistor radio the fbis iafis and local print databases resulted in a name jon earle wilson hed done time in ohio and new jersey for an assortment of crimes including arson bombmaking and insurance fraud but hed fallen off the radar of the local authorities cooper reported lka was brooklyn but that was a vacant lot i dont want the last known address i want the presently known get the feds on it too will do the doorbell rang everybody was on edge with the main perp and accomplice still unaccounted for and they looked at the doorway cautiously sellitto had answered the bell and he stepped into the lab with an africanamerican boy midteens tall wearing calflength shorts and a knicks jersey he was carrying a heavy shopping bag he blinked in surprise at the sight of lincoln rhyme and then at everything else in the room yo yo geneva what happenin she looked at him with a frown yo im rudy he laughed you aint remember me geneva nodded yeah i think so youre ronelles brother the girl said to rhyme a girl in my class howd you know i was here word up ronee hear it from somebody keesh probably i told her geneva said to rhyme the boy looked around the lab again then back to geneva yo what it is some of the girls got some shit together for you you know you aint be in school and all so they thought you might want something to read i say damn give the girl a gameboy but they said no she like books so they got it up for you with these really word aint no homework or nothing like that shit you can read for the fun of it who ronelle some other girls dont know here weigh a ton well thanks she took the bag girls tell me say everthing gonna be cool geneva gave a sour laugh and thanked him again told him to say hello to the other kids in her class the boy left geneva glanced down into the bag she lifted out a book by laura ingalls wilder geneva gave another laugh dont know what theyre thinking of i read this must be seven years ago she dropped it back in the bag anyway it was nice of them and useful thom said pointedly not much here for you to read im afraid a sour glance at rhyme i keep working on him music he listens to music a lot now even threatens to write some tunes himself but reading fiction we havent gotten that far yet geneva gave him an amused smile and she took the heavy bag and walked toward the hallway as rhyme said thank you for airing laundry thom in any case now geneva can read to her hearts content which im sure shed rather do than listening to your tedious editorializing and as for my leisure time i guess i dont have much of it you know trying to catch killers and all his eyes returned to the evidence charts thompson boyds residence and primary safe house more falafel and yogurt orange paint trace as before cash fee for job in new bills untraceable

results were disastrous the truth is now hidden in potters field his secret was what caused all this heartache chapter thirtyfour minus the shopping cart jax was playing homeless again he wasnt being schizo at the moment like before the graffiti king was fronting he was your typical firedass former vet feeling sorry for himself begging for change a shabby mets cap upturned on the gumstained sidewalk and filled with god bless you thirtyseven cents cheap pricks no longer in his olivedrab army jacket or the gray sweatshirt but wearing a dusty black tshirt under a torn beige sports coat picked out of the garbage the way a real homeless person would do jax was sitting on the bench across from the town house on central park west nursing a can wrapped up in a stained brownpaper bag ought to be malt liquor he thought sourly wished it was but it was only arizona iced tea he sat back like he was thinking about what kind of job hed like to try for though also enjoying the cool fall day and sipped more of the sweet peach drink he lit a cigarette and blew smoke toward the stunningly clear sky he was watching the kid from langston hughes walk up the one whod just left that town house on central park west where hed delivered the bag to geneva settle still no sign of anyone checking out the street from inside but that didnt mean there wasnt anybody there besides two police cars sat out front one squad car and one unmarked right by that wheelchair ramp so jax had waited here a block away for the boy to make the delivery the skinny kid came up and plopped down on the bench next to the notreallyhomeless graffiti king of blood yo yo man why do you kids say yo all the time jax asked irritated and why the fuck do you say it twice everbody say it wus yo problem man you gave her the bag what up with that dude aint got legs who dude in there aint got no legs or maybe he got legs but they aint work jax didnt know what he was talking about he would ratherve had a smarter kid deliver the package to the town house but this was the only one hed found around the langston hughes school yard who had any connection at all with geneva settle his sister sort of knew her he repeated you give her the bag i give it to her yeah whatd she say i dont know some shit thanks i dont know she believed you she look like she aint know who i be at first then she was cool yeah when i mention my sister he gave the kid some bills phatyo you got anything else fo me to do im down man i get outa here the kid shrugged and started away jax said wait the loping boy stopped he turned back what was she like the bitch what she look like no that wasnt what he was curious about but jax didnt quite know how to phrase the question and then he decided he didnt want to ask it he shook his head go on bout your business later man the kid strolled off part of jaxs mind told him to stay here where he was but thatd be stupid better to put some distance between himself and the place hed find out soon enough one way or the other what happened when the girl looked through the bag geneva sat on her bed lay back closed her eyes wondering what she felt so good about well theyd caught the killer but that couldnt be all of the feeling of course since the man whod hired him was still out there somewhere and then there was also the man with the gun the one at the school yard the man in the army jacket she should be terrified depressed but she wasnt she felt free elated why and then she understood it was because shed told her secret unburdened her heart about living alone about her parents and nobodyd been horrified and shocked and hated her because of the lie mr rhyme and amelia had even backed her up detective bell too they hadnt freaked and dimed her out to the counselor damn it felt fine how hard itd been carrying around this secret just like charles had carted his with him whatever it was if the former slave had told somebody would he have avoided all the heartache that followed according to his letter he seemed to think so geneva glanced at the shopping bag of books the girls at langston hughes had gotten for her curiosity got the better of her and she decided to look through them she lifted the bag onto the bed as ronelles brother had said it weighed a ton she reached inside and lifted out the laura ingalls wilder book then the next one geneva laughed out loud this was even stranger it was a nancy drew mystery was this wack or what she looked at a few of the other titles books by judy blume dr seuss pat mcdonald childrens and young adult books wonderful authors she knew them all but shed read their stories years ago what was up with this didnt ronelle and the kids know her the most recent books shed read for pleasure had been novels for adults the remains of the day by kazuo ishiguro and the french lieutenants woman by john fowles the last time shed read green eggs and ham had been ten years ago maybe there was something better in the bottom she started to reach into it a knock on the door startled her come in thom entered carrying a tray with a pepsi and some snacks on it hi there he said hi thought youd need some sustenance he opened the soda for her she shook her head at the glass he was about to pour it into the cans fine she said she wanted to keep all the empties so she knew exactly how much to repay mr rhyme andhealth food he handed her a kit kat candy bar and they laughed maybe later everybody was trying to fatten her up fact was she just wasnt used to eating that was something you did with family around a table not by yourself hunched over an unsteady table in a basement as you read a book or jotted notes for a paper about hemingway geneva sipped the soda as thom took over unloading the books for her he held them up one by one there was a novel by c s lewis another the secret garden still nothing for adults theres a big one at the bottom he said lifting it out it was a harry potter book the first one in the series shed read it when it had first come out you want it thom asked she hesitated sure the aide handed her the heavy volume a jogger a man in his forties approached glancing toward jax the homeless vet wearing his trashpicked jacket sporting a hidden pistol in his sock and thirtyseven cents of charity in his pocket the joggers expression didnt change as he ran past but the man altered course just a tiny bit to put an extra foot or so between him and the big black guy a shift so little you could hardly see it except to jax it was as clear as if the man had stopped turned around and fled calling out keep your distance nigger he was sick of this racialdodgeball shit always the same is it ever going to change yes no who the hell knew jax bent down casually and adjusted the pistol that was stuffed into his sock and pressing uncomfortably against bone then continued up the street moving slow with his scartissue limp yo you got some change he heard the voice from behind him as a man approached he glanced back at a tall hunchedover man with very dark skin ten feet behind him the guy repeated yo change man he ignored the beggar thinking thiss pretty funny all day hed been fronting he was some homeless dude or another and here comes a real one serves me right yo change he said brusquely no i dont have any come on everbody got change an they fuckin hate it they wanta get rid of it all them coins be heavy and you cant buy shit with it i be doing you a favor brother come on get lost i aint ate for two days jax glanced back snapped course not cause you spent all your paper on those calvin kleins he glanced at the mans clothes a dirty but otherwise nicelooking set of royalblue adidas workout clothes go get a job jax turned away and started up the street hokay the bum said you aint gimme any change then hows bout you gimme your motherfuckin hands my jax found his legs pulled out from underneath him he slammed facedown onto the sidewalk before he could twist around and grab his gun both wrists were pinned behind his back and what seemed to be a large pistol was shoved into the nook behind his ear the fuck you doing man shut up hands patted him down and found the hidden pistol handcuffs ratcheted on and jax was jerked into a sitting position he found himself looking over an fbi identification card the first name on it was frederick the second was dellray oh man jax said his voice hollow i dont need this shit well guess what sonny there a lot more manure comin yo way so you better get used to it the agent stood up and a moment later jax heard this is dellray im outside i think i got boyds boyfriend down i just saw him slip some bills to a kid coming out of lincolns town house black kid maybe thirteen what was he doing therea bag fuck its a device probably gas boyd mustve given it to this piece of crap to sneak inside get everybody out and call in a ten thirtythree and get somebody to geneva now in rhymes lab the big man sat cuffed and legshackled in a chair surrounded by dellray rhyme bell sachs and sellitto hed been relieved of a pistol wallet knife keys a cell phone cigarettes money for a half hour utter chaos had reigned in lincoln rhymes town house bell and sachs had literally grabbed geneva and hustled her out the back door and into bell s car which sped off in case there was yet another assailant planning to move on geneva outside everyone else evacuated into the alley the bomb squad again in bio suits had gone upstairs and xrayed and then chemically tested the books no explosives no poison gas they were just books the purpose being rhyme assumed to make them think there was a device in the bag after theyd evacuated the town house the accomplice would sneak in through the back door or enter with firefighters or police and wait for a chance to kill geneva so this was the man dellray had heard rumors about yesterday whod almost gotten to geneva at the langston hughes school yard whod found out where she lived and whod followed her to rhymes to carry out yet another attempt on her life he was also the man rhyme hoped who could tell them whod hired boyd the criminalist now looked him over carefully this large unsmiling man hed traded in his combat jacket for a tattered tan sports coat probably assuming that theyd spotted him at the school yesterday in the green jacket he blinked and looked down at the floor diminished by his arrest but not intimidated by the crescent of officers around him finally he said look you dont shhhhh dellray said ominously and continued to rifle through the mans wallet as he explained to the team what had happened the agent had been coming to deliver reports about the fbis jewelry district moneylaundering investigations when hed seen the teenage boy come out of rhymes saw the beast pass the kid some bills then get his ass up off a bench and leave descrip and the limp matched what we heard before looked funny to me specially when i saw he had a deformed ankle the agent nodded toward the small automatic hed found in the mans sock dellray explained that hed pulled off his own jacket wrapped it around the files and slipped them behind some bushes then smeared some dirt on his running suit to impersonate a homeless man a role hed made famous in new york when he was an undercover agent hed then proceeded to collar the man let me say something boyds partner began dellray wagged a huge finger at the man well give ya this real clear little nod we want any words trickling outa yo mouth we altogether on that i altogether he nodded grimly the fbi agent held up what hed found in the wallet money a few family pictures a faded shabby photograph whats this he asked my tag the agent held the snapshot closer to rhyme it was an old boxy new york city subway the colorful graffiti on the side read jax graffiti artist sachs said lifting an eyebrow pretty good too you still go by jax rhyme asked usually dellray was holding up a picture id card you mayve been jax to the fine folk at the transit authority but its lookin like youre alonzo jackson to the rest of the world also known by the illuminating moniker inmate twotwoohninethreefo hailin from the department of corrections in the beeyootiful city of alden new york thats buffalo right rhyme asked boyds accomplice nodded the prison connection again that how you know him who thompson boyd i dont know anybody named boyd dellray barked then who hired ya for the job i dont know what youre asking bout a job i swear i dont he seemed genuinely confused and all this other stuff gas or whatever youre saying i you were lookin for geneva settle you bought a gun and you showed up at her school yesterday sellitto pointed out yeah thats right he looked mystified at the level of their information an you showed up here dellray continued thats the job were waggin our tongues about theres no job i dont know what you mean honest whats the story with the books sellitto asked thosere just books my daughter read when she was little they were for her the agent muttered wonnerful but xplain to us why you paid somebody to deliver em to he hesitated and frowned for once words seemed to fail fred dellray rhyme asked youre saying thats right jax sighed geneva shes my little girl chapter thirtyfive from the beginning rhyme said okay what it is i got busted six years ago went six to nine at wende the docs maximum security prison in buffalo for what dellray snapped the ar and murder we heard about one count armed robbery one count firearm one count assault the twentyfive twentyfive the murder he said firmly that was not a righteous count got knocked down to assault and i didnt do it in the first place never heard that before dellray muttered but you did the robbery sellitto asked a grimace yeah keep going last year i got upped to alden minimum security workrelease i was working and going to school there got paroled seven weeks ago tell me about the ar okay few years back i was a painter working in harlem graffiti rhyme asked nodding at the picture of the subway car laughing jax said house painting you dont make money at graffiti less you were keith haring and his crowd and they were just claimers anyway i was getting killed by the debt see venus geneva s mother had righteous problems first it was blow then smack then cookies you know crack and we needed money for bail and lawyers too the sorrow in his face seemed real there were signs she was a troubled soul when we hooked up but you know nothing like love to make you a blind fool anyways we were going to be kicked out of the apartment and i didnt have money for geneva s clothes or schoolbooks or even food sometimes that girl needed a normal life i thought if i could get together some benjamins id get venus into treatment or something get her straight and if she wouldnt do it then id take geneva away from her give the girl a good home what happened was this buddy joey stokes told me bout this deal he had going on up in buffalo word was up there was some armored car making fat runs every saturday picking up receipts from malls outside of town couple of lazy guards itd be a milk run joey and me left on saturday morning thinking wed be back with fifty sixty thousand each that night a sad shake of the head oh man i dont know what i was doing listening to that claiming dude the minute the driver handed over the money everything went bad he had this secret alarm we didnt know about he hit it and next thing therere sirens all over the place we headed south but came to a railroad crossing we hadnt noticed this freight train was stopped we turned around and took some roads that werent on the map and had to go through a field we got two flats and ran off on foot the cops caught up with us a half hour later joey said lets fight and i said no and called out we were giving up but joey got mad and shot me in the leg the state troopers thought we were shooting at them that was the attempted murder crime dont pay dellray said with the intonation if not the grammar of the amateur philosopher that he was we were in a holding cell for a week ten days fore they let me make a phone call i couldnt call venus anyway our phoned been shut off my lawyer was some legal aid kid who didnt do shit for me i called some friends but nobody could find venus or geneva theyd been kicked out of our apartment i wrote letters from prison they kept coming back i called everybody i could think of i wanted to find her so bad genevas mother and me lost a baby a while ago and then i lost geneva when i went into the system i wanted my family back after i got released i came here to look for her even spent what paper i had on this old computer to see if i could find her on the internet or something but i didnt have any luck all i heard was venus was dead and geneva was gone its easy to fall through the cracks in harlem i couldnt find my aunt either who they stayed with some then yesterday morning this woman i know from the old days works in midtown saw this hubbub at that black museum some girl getting attacked and heard her name was geneva and she was sixteen and lived in harlem she knew i was looking for my girl and called i got myself hooked up with this claimer hangs out uptown and he checked out the schools yesterday found out she went to langston hughes high i went there to find her when they spotted you sellitto said by the school yard thats right i was there when yall came after me i took off but i went back and found out from this kid where she lived over in west harlem by morningside i went there today was going to leave the books but i saw you put her in a car and take off he nodded at bell the detective frowned you were pushing a cart i was fronting that yeah i got a cab and followed yall here with a gun bell pointed out he snapped somebodyd tried to hurt my little girl hells yeah i got myself that piece i wasnt going to let anything happen to her you use it rhyme asked the weapon no were going to test it all i did was pull it out and scare that asshole kid told me where geneva lived boy name of kevin who was speaking bad about my girl worst that happened to him was he peed his pants when i pointed it at himwhich he deserved but thats all i did side from busting him up some you can track him down and ask him whats her name the woman who called you yesterday betty carlson she works next to the museum he nodded at his phone her numbers on the incomingcall list sevenoneeight thats the area code sellitto took the mans mobile and stepped into the hallway what about your family in chicago my what he frowned geneva s mother said you moved to chicago with somebody married her sachs explained jax closed his eyes in disgust no nothat was a lie i never even been to chicago venus mustve told her that to poison the girl against me that woman whyd i ever fall in love with her then rhyme glanced at cooper call doc no no please jax said his face desperate theyll violate me back i cant be outside twentyfive miles of buffalo i asked permission to leave the jurisdiction twice and both times they denied it i came anyway cooper considered this i can run him through the general doc database itll look routine the pos wont see it rhyme nodded a moment later a picture of alonzo jackson and his record popped up on the screen cooper read it confirms what he said goodbehavior timely discharge got himself some college credits and theres reference to a daughter geneva settle as next of kin thank you for that jax said relieved whats with the books i couldnt come up to yall and just say who i was id get violated back so i got copies of a bunch of books geneva read when she was young so shed know the note was really from me what note wrote her a note put it in one of the books cooper rummaged through the bag in a battered copy of the secret garden was a slip of paper in careful handwriting were the words gen baby this is from your father please call me beneath this message was his phone number sellitto stepped back into the doorway he nodded talked to the carlson woman everything he said checks out rhyme asked genevas mother was your girlfriend not wife thats why genevas not jackson thats right where do you live bell asked got a room in harlem a hundred thirtysixth once i found geneva i was going to bring her back to buffalo till i got permission to come back home his face grew still and rhyme saw what he believed was pure sorrow in his eyes but i dont think theres much chance of that happening now why sachs asked jax gave a wistful grin i saw where she lives that nice place near morningside i was happy for her of course real happy shell have herself two good foster parents taking care of her maybe a brother or sister which she always wanted but that didnt work out after venus had such a bad time at the clinic whyd geneva wanta come back with me shes got the life she deserves everything i couldnt give her rhyme glanced at sachs with a raised eyebrow jax didnt catch it his story was sounding legit to rhyme but he had a thick vein of policemans skepticism in him i want to ask you a few questions anything whos the aunt you mentioned my fathers sister lilly hall she helped raise me widow twice over shedve turned ninety this year august if shes still with us rhyme had no clue about her age or birthday but that was the name geneva had given them shes still alive yes a smile im glad about that ive missed her i couldnt find her either bell said you told geneva something about the word sir what would thatve been i told her even when she was little to look people in the eye and always be respectful but never to call anyone sir or maam unless they earned it the carolina detective nodded to rhyme and sachs the criminalist asked whos charles singleton jax blinked in surprise how dyou know about him answer the man scurv dellray snapped hes my i dont know greatgreatgreatgreatgrandfather or something keep going rhyme encouraged well he was a slave in virginia his master freed him and his wife and gave em a farm up north then he volunteered to be in the civil war you know like in that movie glory he came back home after worked his orchard and taught at his school an african free school made money selling cider to workers building boats up the road from his farm i know he got medals in the war he even met abraham lincoln once in richmond just after the union troops took it over or thats what my daddy said another sad laugh then there was this story he got himself arrested for stealing some gold or payroll or something and went to jail just like me do you know what happened to him after prison no never heard anything about that so you believe that im genevas father dellray looked at rhyme cocked an eyebrow the criminalist sized the man up almost one last thing open your mouth youre my father breathless nearly dizzy from the news geneva settle felt her heart pounding she looked him over carefully her eyes scanning his face his shoulders his hands her first reaction had been utter disbelief but she couldnt deny that she recognized him he still wore the garnet ring that her mother venus had given him for christmas when they were still celebrating christmas the memory she compared this man with though was vague like looking at someone with bright sun behind them despite the drivers license the picture of her as a baby with him and her mother the photo of one of his old graffiti drawings she still wouldve denied the connection between them to the last except for a dna test that mr cooper had run there was no doubt they were kin they were alone upstairs alone of course except for detective bell her protective shadow the rest of the police officers were downstairs working on the case still trying to figure out who was behind the jewelry exchange robbery but mr rhyme and amelia and all the others as well as the killer and everything else about the frightening events of the past few days were for the moment forgotten the questions that now consumed geneva were how had her father gotten here and why and most important what does this mean for me a nod at the shopping bag she picked up the dr seuss book i dont read childrens books anymore it was all she could think of to say i turned sixteen two months ago her point she guessed was to remind him of all the birthdays shed spent alone i brought you those just so youd know it was me i know youre too old for them what about your other family she asked coldly jax shook his head they told me what venus said to you genie she was pissed he was using the nickname hed given her years ago short for both geneva and genius she was making that up to turn you against me no no genie id never leave you i got arrested arrested its true miss roland bell said weve seen his files he got arrested the day he left you and your mother hes been in prison ever since just got out he then told her a story about a robbery about being desperate to get some money to make their life better to help her mother but the words were tired exhausted he was giving her one of the thousands of limp excuses you heard so often in the neighborhood the crack dealer the shoplifter the welfare scammer the chain snatcher i did it for you baby she looked down at the book in her hand it was used whod it been for when it was new where was the parent whod bought it originally for his or her child in jail washing dishes driving a lexus performing neurosurgery had her father stolen it from a used bookstore i came back for you genie ive been desperate to find you and i was even more desperate when betty called and told me youd been attacked what happened yesterday whos after you nobody ever told me i saw something she said dismissingly not wanting to give him too much information maybe somebody committing a crime geneva had no interest in the direction of this conversation she looked him over and said more cruelly than she intended you know that moms dead he nodded i didnt know it till i came back then i heard but i wasnt surprised she was a troubled woman maybe shes happier now geneva didnt think so and in any case no amount of heaven would make up for the unhappiness of dying alone the way she had her body shrunken but her face puffed up like a yellow moon and it wouldnt make up for the earlier unhappiness of getting fucked in stairways for a couple rocks of crack while her daughter waited outside the front door geneva said none of this he smiled youve got yourself a real nice place youre staying it was temporary im not there anymore youre not wherere you living im not sure yet she regretted saying this it gave him she realized a foot in the door and sure enough he pushed his way in im going to ask my po again if i can move back here knowing ive got family to take care of he might say its all right you dont have a family here not anymore i know youre mad baby but ill make it up to you i she flung the book to the floor six years and nothing no word no call no letter infuriatingly tears swelled in her eyes she wiped them with shaking hands he whispered an where would i write where would i call i tried steady all those six years to get in touch with you ill show you the stack of letters i got all sent back to me in prison a hundred of em id guess i tried everything i could think of i just couldnt find you well thanks for the apology you know if it is an apology but i think its time for you to go no baby let me not baby not genie not daughter ill make it up to you he repeated he wiped his eyes she felt absolutely nothing seeing his sorrow or whatever it was nothing that is except anger leave but baby i no just go away once more the detective from north carolina the expert at guarding people did his job smoothly and without wavering he rose and silently but firmly ushered her father into the hallway he nodded back at the girl gave her a comforting smile and closed the door behind him leaving geneva to herself chapter thirtysix while the girl and her father had been upstairs rhyme and the others had been going over leads to potential jewelry store heists and having no success the materials that fred dellray had brought them about moneylaundering schemes involving jewelry were smalltime operations none of them centered in midtown and they had no reports from interpol or local law enforcement agencies containing anything relevant to the case the criminalist was shaking his head in frustration when his phone rang rhyme here lincoln its parker the handwriting expert analyzing the note from boyds safe house parker kincaid and rhyme traded newsbites about health and family rhyme learned that kincaids livein partner fbi agent margaret lukas was fine as were parkers children stephie and robby sachs sent her greetings and then kincaid got down to business ive been working on your letter nonstop since you sent me the scan ive got a profile of the writer serious handwriting analysis never seeks to determine personality from the way people form their letters handwriting itself is relevant only when comparing one document with another say when determining forgeries but that didnt interest rhyme at the moment no what parker kincaid was talking about was deducing characteristics of the writer based on the language he used the unusual phrasing that rhyme had noted earlier this could be extremely helpful in identifying suspects grammatical and syntactical analysis of the lindbergh baby ransom note for instance gave a perfect profile of the kidnapper bruno hauptmann with the enthusiasm he typically felt for his craft kincaid continued i found some interesting things youve got the note handy its right in front of us a black girl fifth floor in this window october about she saw my delivery van when he was parked in an alley behind the jewelry exchange saw enough to guess the plans of mine kill her kincaid said to start with hes foreign born the awkward syntax and the misspellings tell me that so does the way he indicates the date putting the day before the month and the time is given in the twentyfourhour clock thats rare in america the handwriting expert continued now another important point he or she rhyme interrupted im leaning toward male kincaid countered tell you why in a minute he uses the gendered pronoun he referring it seems to his van thats typical of several different foreign languages but what really narrows it down is the twomember nominal phrase in the genitive construction the what rhyme asked the genitive construction a way to create the possessive your unsub wrote my delivery van at one point rhyme scanned the note got it but later he wrote plans of mine that makes me think your boys first language is arabic arabic ill say its a ninety percent likelihood theres a genitive construction in arabic called idaafah the possessives usually formed by saying the car john meaning the car of john or in your note the plans of mine but the rules of arabic grammar require that only one word is used for the thing thats possessed the delivery van wont work in arabic its a twoword phrase so he cant use idaafah he simply says my delivery van the other clue is the misuse of the indefinite article a in a alley thats common among arabic speakers the language doesnt use indefinite articles only the definite the kincaid added thats true of welsh too but i dont think this guys from cardiff good parker sachs said very subtle but good a faint laugh came from the speakerphone ill tell you amelia everybody in the businesss been doing a lot of boning up on arabic in the last few years thats why you think its a man how many women arab perps you see not manyanything else get me some more samples and ill compare them if you want we may take you up on that rhyme thanked kincaid and they disconnected the call rhyme shook his head staring at the evidence boards he gave a scoffing laugh whatre you thinking rhyme you know what hes up to dont you the criminalist asked in an ominous voice sachs nodded hes not going to rob the exchange hes going to blow it up yep dellray said sure those reports weve had about terrorists goin after israeli targets in the area sachs said the guard across the street from the museum said they get shipments of jewelry every day from jerusalem okay ill get the exchange evacuated and swept she pulled out her cell phone rhyme glanced at the evidence board and said to sellitto and cooper falafel and yogurtand a delivery van find out if there are any restaurants around the exchange that serve middle eastern food and if so who makes deliveries and when and what kind of van they use dellray shook his head half the city eats that stuff you can get gyros and falafel on every street corner in the city they the agent stopped talking as his eyes met rhymes pushcarts sellitto said there were a half dozen of them around the museum yesterday perfect for surveillance rhyme snapped and what a cover he delivers supplies to them every day so nobody pays attention to him i want to know who supplies the street vendors move according to the board of health only two companies delivered middle eastern food to the pushcarts in the blocks around the jewelry exchange ironically the largest of them was owned by two jewish brothers with family in israel and who were active in their temple they were hardly suspects the other company didnt own the carts but sold gyros kabobs and falafel along with the condiments and sodas as well as the heathen but everprofitable pork hot dogs to dozens of carts in midtown the operation was based out of a restaurantdeli down on broad street whose owners hired a man to make the deliveries around town with dellray and a dozen other agents and cops surrounding them these owners became extremely almost tearfully cooperative the name of their deliveryman was bani aldahab and he was a saudi national here on a visa long expired hed been a professional of some sort in jeddah and had worked as an engineer for a time in the us but after he went illegal hed taken what work he could cooking occasionally and delivering food to pushcarts and other middle eastern restaurants around manhattan and brooklyn the jewelry exchange had been evacuated and swept no devices were found there and an emergency vehicle locator was out on aldahabs delivery van which according to the owners might be anywhere in the city the man was free to set his own delivery schedule it was at moments like this that rhyme would have paced had he been able to where the hell is he is the man driving around with a van full of explosives at the moment maybe hed given up on the jewelry exchange and was going after a secondary target a synagogue or an elal airlines office lets get boyd down here put some pressure on him he snapped i want to know where the hell this guy is it was at that moment that mel coopers phone rang then sellittos followed by amelia sachss finally the main laboratory phone began to chirp the callers were different but the message was virtually the same rhymes question about the bombers whereabouts had just been answered only the driver died which considering the force of the explosion and the fact that the van was in the intersection of ninth avenue and fiftyfourth surrounded by other cars was pretty miraculous when the bomb went off the direction of the blast was mostly upward through the roof and out the windows scattering shrapnel and glass and injuring a score of people but the main damage was confined to the interior of the e the burning van had lurched up on the sidewalk where it slammed into a light post a crew from the fire station up the street on eighth avenue got the flames out fast and kept the crowd back as for the driver there was no point in even trying to save him the two largest pieces of his remains were separated by several yards the bomb squad had cleared the scene and the main job of the police now was to wait for the medical examiner tour doctor and the crime scene crew whats that smell the detective from midtown north asked the tall balding officer was creeped out by the stink which he took to be burnt human flesh the problem was that it smelled good one of the detectives from the bomb squad laughed at the greenfaced detective gyros gearo what the detective asked thinking it was short for something like fubar meaning fucked up beyond all recognition look the bomb squad cop held up a chunk of burnt meat in his latexgloved hands he smelled it tasty the midtown north detective laughed and didnt reveal how close to puking he was its lamb its the driver was delivering food that was his job the back of the vans filled with meat and falafel and shit like that oh the cop still didnt feel any less nauseous it was then that a bright red camaro ss one hell of a car skidded to a stop in the middle of the street just kissing the yellow police tape out climbed a stunning redhead who looked over the scene nodding to the detective hey he said as the woman detective hooked a headset onto her motorola and waved to the crime scene bus just pulling up as well she sniffed the air taking several deep breaths she nodded havent run the scene yet she said into the microphone but from the smell rhyme id say weve got him it was then that the tall bald detective swallowed and said you know ill be right back he jogged to a nearby starbucks praying hed make it to the restroom in time with detective bell at her side geneva walked into the laboratory portion of mr rhymes town house downstairs she glanced at her father who looked at her with those big puppydog eyes of his damnit she looked away mr rhyme said weve got some news the man who hired boyds dead dead the jewelry store robber things werent quite what they seemed mr rhyme said we were well i was wrong i was thinking whoever it was wanted to rob the jewelry exchange but no he wanted to blow it up terrorists she asked mr rhyme nodded toward a plastic folder that amelia was holding inside was a letter addressed to the new york times it said the bombing of the jewelry exchange was yet another step in the holy war against zionist israel and its allies it was the same paper that was used for the note about killing geneva and the map of west fiftyfifth street who is he she asked trying to remember a van and a middle eastern man in the street outside the museum a week or so ago she couldnt an illegal saudi national detective sellitto said worked for a restaurant downtown the ownersre pretty freaked of course they think we think theyre a cover for alqaeda or something he chuckled which they might be well keep checking but they all come up clean citizens been here for years couple kids in the army even i will say theyre a bunch of very nervous folks at the moment the most important aspect about the bomber amelia went on to say was that this man bani aldahab didnt appear to associate with any suspected terrorists the women hed dated recently and coworkers said that they didnt know of any times hed met with people who might be in a terrorist cell and his mosque was religiously and politically moderate amelia had searched his queens apartment and found no other evidence or connections to other terrorist cells his phone records were being checked for possible links to other fundamentalists though well keep looking over the evidence mr rhyme said but were ninetynine percent sure he was working alone i think it means youre probably safe he wheeled his chair to the evidence table and looked over some bags of burnt metal and plastic he said to mr cooper add it to the chart mel explosive was tovex and weve got pieces of the receiver the detonator the casing wire a bit of blasting cap all contained in a ups box addressed to the jewelry exchange attention of the director whyd it go off early jax jackson asked mr rhyme explained that it was very dangerous to use a radiocontrolled bomb in the city because there were so many ambient radio waves from constructionsite detonators walkietalkies and a hundred other sources detective sellitto added or he mayve killed himself he mightve heard that boyd was arrested or that the jewelry exchange was being searched for a bomb he mustve thought it was only a matter of time until hed be nabbed geneva felt uneasy confused these people around her were suddenly strangers the reason theyd come together in the first place no longer existed as for her father he was more alien to her than the police she wanted to be back in her room in the harlem basement with her books and her plans for the future college dreams about florence and paris but then she realized amelia was looking at her closely the policewoman asked whatre you going to do now geneva glanced at her father what would happen she had a parent true but one who was an excon who couldnt even be here in the city theyd still probably try to put her in a foster home amelia glanced at lincoln rhyme until things get sorted out why dont we stick with our plan have geneva stay here for a while here the girl asked your fathers got to get back to buffalo and take care of things there not that living with him is an option anyway geneva thought but kept this to herself excellent idea this came from thom i think thats what well do his voice was firm youll stay here is that all right with you amelia asked geneva geneva wasnt sure why they wanted her to stay she was initially suspicious but she constantly had to remind herself that after living alone for so long suspicion trailed her like a shadow she thought of another rule about lives like hers you take your family how you find them sure she said shackled thompson boyd was brought into rhymes lab and the two guards deposited him in front of the officers and rhyme geneva was once again upstairs in her room guarded at the moment by barbe lynch the criminalist rarely did this meeting the perpetrators facetoface for him a scientist the only passion in his job was the game itself the pursuit not the physical incarnation of the suspect he had no desire to gloat over the man or woman hed captured excuses and pleas didnt move him threats didnt trouble him yet now he wanted to make absolutely certain that geneva settle was safe he wanted to assess her attacker himself his face bandaged and bruised from his confrontation with sachs at the arrest boyd looked around the laboratory the equipment the charts on the whiteboards the wheelchair no emotion whatsoever no flicker of surprise or interest not even when he nodded toward sachs it was as if hed forgotten that shed brained him repeatedly with a rock somebody asked boyd about it howd it feel bein in a electric chair he said it didnt feel like anythin it just felt kinda numb he said that a lot toward the end he felt numb he asked howd you find me a couple of things rhyme answered for one you picked the wrong tarot card to leave as evidence it put me in mind of executions the hanged man boyd said nodding right you are i never thought about that just seemed like kind of a spooky one to lead you off you know rhyme continued what got us your name though was your habit habit you whistle i do that i try not to on the job but sometimes it slips out so you talked to yep some people in texas nodding boyd glanced at rhyme with red squinting eyes so you knew bout charlie tucker that unfortunate excuse for a human being making the last days of my peoples time on earth miserable telling em they were going to burn in hell nonsense talk about jesus and whatnot my people sachs asked was bani aldahab the only one who hired you he blinked in surprise it seemed the first true emotion to cross his face how he fell silent the bomb went off early or he killed himself a shake of the head no he wasnt any suicide bomber it wouldve gone off by accident fella was careless too hotheaded you know didnt do things by the book he probably armed it too early howd you meet him he called me got my name from somebody in prison nation of islam connection so that was it rhyme had wondered how a texas prison guard had hooked up with islamic terrorists theyre crazy boyd said but they have money those arab people and jon earle wilson he was your bomb maker jonny yes sir he shook his head you know bout him too you peoplere good i must say where is he that i dont know we left messages from pay phones to a voicemail box and met in public never traded moren a dozen words the fbill be talking to you about aldahab and the bombing what we want to know about is geneva is there anybody else whod want to hurt her boyd shook his head from what he told me aldahab was working alone i suspect he talked to people over in the middle east some but nobody here he didnt trust anyone the texas drawl came and went as if hed been working on losing it sachs said ominously if youre lying if something happens to her we can make sure the rest of your lifes totally miserable how boyd asked genuinely curious it seemed you killed the librarian dr barry you attacked and tried to kill police officers you could get consecutive lifetimes and were looking into the death of a girl yesterday on canal street somebody pushed her in front of a bus near where you were escaping from elizabeth street were running your picture past witnesses youll go away forever a shrug doesnt hardly matter you dont care sachs asked i know you people dont understand me i dont blame you but see i dont care about prison i dont care about anything yall cant really touch me im dead already killing somebody doesnt matter to me saving a life doesnt matter he glanced at amelia sachs who was staring at him boyd said i see that look youre wondring what kinda monster is this fella well fact is yall made me who i am we did she asked oh yes maamyou know my profession executions control officer rhyme said yes sir now something ill tell you bout that line of work you can find the names of every human legally executed in these united states which is a lot and you can find the names of all the governors who waited up till midnight or whenever to commute them if the inclination was there you can find the names of all the victims the condemned murdered and much of the time the names of their next of kin but do you know the one name you wont find he looked at the officers around him us people who push the button the executioners were forgotten everbody thinks bout how capital punishment affects the families of the condemned or society or the victims families not to mention the man or woman gets put down like a dog in the process but nobody ever spends a drop of sweat on us executioners nobody ever stops and thinks what happens to us day after day living with our people men women too course whore gonna die getting to know em talking to em bout everything under the sun hearing a black man ask how come is it the white guy who did the exact same crime gets off with life or maybe even less but he himselfs gonna die the mexican swearing he didnt rape and kill that girl he was just buying beer at eleven and the police come up and next he knows hes on death row and a year after hes in the ground they do a dna test and find out they did have the wrong man and he was innocent all along course even the guilty onesre human beings too living with all of them day after day being decent to them because theyre decent to you getting to know em and thenthen you kill em you all by yourself with your own hands pushing the button throwing the switchit changes you you know what they say you heard it dead man walking its supposed to mean the prisoner but its really us the executioners were the dead men sachs muttered but your girlfriend how could you shoot her he fell silent for the first time a darkness clouded his face i pondered firing that shot id hoped maybe id have this feeling that i shouldnt do it that she meant too much to me id let her be and run just take my chances but he shook his head didnt happen i looked at her and all i felt was numb and i knew that itd make sense to shoot her and if the children had been home and not her sachs gasped youdve shot one of them to escape he considered this for a moment well maam i guess we know that wouldve worked wouldnt it you wouldve stopped to save one of the girls stead of coming after me like my daddy told me its only a question of where you put the decimal point the darkness seemed to lift from his face as if hed finally received some answer or come to some conclusion in a debate that had been troubling him for a long time the hanged manthe card often foretells a surrendering to experience ending a struggle accepting what is he glanced at rhyme now you dont mind i think its time for me to get back home home he looked at them curiously jail as if what else would he possibly mean father and daughter got off the c train at th street and started east toward langston hughes high she hadnt wanted him to come but hed insisted on looking after her which mr rhyme and detective bell had insisted on too besides she reflected hed be back in buffalo by tomorrow and she supposed she could tolerate an hour or two with him he nodded back at the subway used to love to write on c trains paint stuck real nicei knew a lot of peopled see it did an endtoend in it was the bicentennial that year those tall ships were in town my piece was of one of those boats long with the statue of liberty he laughed the mta didnt scrub that car for at least a week i heard maybe they were just busy but i like to think somebody liked what i painted and kept it up for longer than normal geneva grunted she was thinking that she had a story to tell him a block away she could see the construction scaffolding in front of the same building shed been working on when shed been fired howd her father like to know that her job had been scrubbing graffiti off the redeveloped buildings maybe shed even erased some of his tempted to tell him but she didnt at the first working pay phone they found on frederick douglass boulevard geneva stopped fished for some change her father offered her his cell phone thats okay take it she ignored him dropped the coins in and called lakeesha while her father pocketed his cell and wandered to the curb looking around the neighborhood like a boy in front of the candy section in a bodega she turned away as her friend answered lo its all over with keesh she explained about the jewelry exchange the bombing that what was goin on damn a terrorist that some scary shit but you okay im down really geneva heard another voice a male one saying something to her friend who put her hand over the receiver for a moment their muted exchange seemed heated you there keesh yeah whos that nobody where you at you not in that basement crib no more right im still where i told you with that policeman and his girlfriend the one in the wheelchair you there now no im uptown going to school now pick up my homework the girl paused then listen ima hook up with you at school wanna see you girl when you be there geneva glanced at her father nearby hands in his pockets still surveying the street she decided she didnt want to mention him to keesha or anybody else just yet lets make it tomorrow keesh i dont have any time now daymn girl really better tomorrow whaever geneva heard the click of the disconnect yet she stayed where she was for some moments delaying going back to her father finally she joined him and they continued toward the school you know what was up there three or four blocks he asked pointing north strivers row you ever seen it no she muttered ill take you up there sometime hundred years ago this land developer fellow named king he built these three big apartments and tons of town houses hired three of the best architects in the country and told em to go to work beautiful places king model homes was the real name but they were so expensive and so nice thiss the story the place was called strivers row cause you had to strive to live there w c handy lived there for a time you know him father of the blues most righteous musician ever lived i did a piece up that way one time i ever tell you about that took me thirty cans to do wasnt a throwup i spent two days on it did a picture of w c himself photographer from the times shot it and put it in the paper he nodded north it was there for she stopped fast her hands slapped her hips enough genie just stop it i dont want to hear this you i dont care about any of what youre telling me youre mad at me honey who wouldnt be after everything look i made a mistake he said his voice cracking that was the past im different now everythings going to be different ill never put anybody ahead of you again like i did when i was with your moms youre the one i shouldve been trying to save and not by taking that trip to buffalo no you dont get it its not about what you did its your whole goddamn world i dont want any part of i dont care about strivers whatever it is i dont care about the apollo or the cotton club or the harlem renaissance i dont like harlem i hate it here its guns and crack and rapes and people getting fiended for a cheapass plated bling and drugstore hoops its girls all they care about is extensions and braids and and wall streets got insider traders and new jersey s got the mob and westchester s got trailer parks he replied she hardly heard him its boys all they care about is getting girls in bed its ignorant people who dont care how they talk its whats wrong with aave she blinked how do you know about that he himself had never talked ghetto his own father had made sure hed worked hard in school at least until he dropped out to start the career of defacing city property but most people who lived here didnt know that the official name for what they spoke was africanamerican vernacular english when i was inside he explained i got my high school diploma and a year of college she said nothing i mostly studied reading and words maybe wont help me get a job but its what drew me i always liked books and things you know that im the one had you reading from jump i studied standard but i studied vernacular too and i dont see anything wrong with it you dont speak it she pointed out sharply i didnt grow up speaking it i didnt grow up speaking french or mandingo either im sick of hearing people say lemme axe you a question her father shrugged axe is just an oldenglish version of ask royalty used to say it therere bible translations that talk about axing god for mercy its not a black thing like people say the combination of saying s and k next to each others hard to pronounce its easier to transpose and aint been in the english language since shakespeares day she laughed try getting a job talking vernacular well what if somebody from france or russia s trying for that same job dont you think the bossd give them a chance listen to em see if theyd work hard were smart even if they spoke different english maybe the problems that the boss is using somebodys language as a reason not to hire him he laughed people in new york damn well better be able to speak some spanish and chinese in the next few years why not vernacular his logic infuriated her even more i like our language genie it sounds natural to me makes me feel at home look youve got every right to be mad at me for what i did but not for who i am or what we came out of thiss home and you know what you do with your home dont you you change what oughta be changed and learn to be proud of what you cant geneva jammed her eyes closed and lifted her hands to her face the years and years she dreamed of a parent not even the luxury of two but just one person to be there when she came home in the afternoons to look over her homework to wake her up in the morning and when that wasnt going to happen when shed finally managed to shore up her life on her own and start working her way out of this godforsaken place here comes the past to yoke and choke her and drag her back but thats not what i want she whispered i want something more than this mess she waved her hand around the streets oh geneva i understand that all im hoping for is maybe we have a couple of nice years here fore you off into the world give me a chance to make up for what we did to you your mother and me you deserve the world but honey i gotta say can you name me one place thats perfect where all the streetsre paved with gold where everybody loves their neighbors he laughed and slipped into vernacular you say it a mess here well damn straight but where aint it a mess one way or thother baby where aint it he put his arm around her she stiffened but she didnt otherwise resist they started for the school lakeesha scott sat on the bench in marcus garvey park where shed been for the past half hour after shed come back from her counter job in the restaurant downtown she lit another merit thinking there are things we do cause we want to and things we do cause we gotta survival things and what she was about now was one of those hadto things why the fuck didnt geneva say that after all this shit she was booking on out of town and never coming back she was going to detroit or bama sorry keesh we cant see each other anymore im talking forever bye that way the whole fucking problemd be gone for good why why why and it was worse than that gen had to go and tell her exactly where she was going to be for the next few hours keesh had no excuse to miss the girl now oh shed kept up her ghetto patter when theyd been talking a while ago so her friend wouldnt hop to something going down but now sitting alone she sank into sorrow man im feeling bad but aint got no choice here things we do cause we gotta come on keesha said to herself got to get over lets go bring it on she crushed out her cigarette and left the park headed west then north on malcolm x past church after church they were everywhere mt morris ascension bethelite community ephesus adventist church baptist plenty of those a mosque or two a synagogue and the stores and shops papaya king a botanica a tuxedorental shop a checkcashing outlet she passed a gypsy cab garage the owner sitting outside holding his tapedtogether dispatch radio the long cord disappearing into the unlit office he smiled at her pleasantly how lakeesha envied them the reverends in the grimy storefronts under the neon crosses the carefree men slipping hot dogs into the steamed buns the fat man on the cheap chair with his cigarette and his fuckedup microphone they aint betraying nobody she thought they aint betraying the person was one of their best friends for years snapping her gum gripping her purse strap hard with her pudgy fingers tipped in black and yellow nails ignoring three dominican boys psssst she heard booty she heard bitch pssssst keesh reached into her purse and gripped her spring knife she nearly flicked it open just to see em flinch she glared but left the long sharp blade where it was deciding shed have a world of trouble when she got to the school let it go for now pssst she moved on her nervous hands opening a pack of gum shoving two fruity pieces into her mouth lakeesha struggled to find her angry heart get yourself mad girl think of everything geneva done to piss you off think of everything she be that you aint and never gonna be the fact the girl was so smart it hurt that she came to school every single fucking day that she kept her skinny little whitegirl figure without looking like some aids ho that she managed to keep her legs together and told other girls to do the same like some prissy moms acting like she better than us all but she wasnt geneva settle was just another kid from a mommygotahabit daddydonerunoff family she one of us get mad at the fact that shed look you in the eye and say you can do it girl you can do it you can do it you can get outa here you got the world ahead of you well no bitch sometimes you just cant do it sometimes its just too fucking much to bear you need help to get over you need somebody with benjamins somebody watching your back and for a moment the anger at geneva boiled up inside her and she gripped the purse strap even tighter but she couldnt hold it the anger vanished blew away like it was nothing more than the light brown baby powder shed sprinkle on her twin cousins buns when she changed their diapers as lakeesha walked in a daze past lenox terrace toward their school where geneva settle would soon be she realized that she couldnt rely on anger or excuses all she could rely on was survival sometimes you gotta look out for yourself and take the hand somebody offers you things we do cause we gotta chapter thirtyseven at school geneva collected her homework and wouldnt you know it her next language arts assignment was to report on claude mckays home to harlem the book that was the first bestselling novel by a black author cant i have e e cummings she asked or john cheever its our africanamerican sequence gen her language arts teacher pointed out smiling then frank yerby she bargained or octavia butler ah theyre wonderful authors gen her teacher said but they dont write about harlem thats what were studying in this segment but i gave you mckay because i thought youd like him hes one of the most controversial writers to come out of the renaissance mckay took a lot of flak because he looked at the underside of harlem he wrote about the primitive aspects of the place that upset dubois and a lot of other thinkers at the time its right up your alley maybe her father could help her interpret she thought cynically since he loved the neighborhood and its patois so much try it the man offered you might like it oh no i wont geneva thought outside the school she joined her father they came to the bus stop and both closed their eyes as a swirl of chill dusty air swept around them theyd reached a detente of sorts and shed agreed to let him take her to a jamaican restaurant that hed been dreaming about for the past six years is it even still there she asked coolly dunno but well find something be an adventure i dont have much time she shivered in the cold wheres that bus he asked geneva looked across the street and frowned oh no there was lakeesha this was so her she hadnt even listened to what genevad said and had come here anyway keesh waved whos that her father asked my girlfriend lakeesha glanced uncertainly toward her father and then gestured for gen to cross the street whats wrong the girls face was smiling but it was clear she had something on her mind maybe she was wondering what geneva was doing with an older man wait here she told her father and she started toward lakeesha who blinked and seemed to take a deep breath she opened her purse and reached inside whats the on this geneva wondered she crossed the street and paused at the curb keesha hesitated then stepped forward gen she said her eyes going dark geneva frowned girl whats keesh stopped fast as a car pulled to the curb past geneva who blinked in surprise behind the wheel was the school counselor mrs barton the woman gestured the student to the car geneva hesitated told keesh to wait a minute and joined the counselor hey geneva i just missed you inside hi the girl was cautious not sure what the woman knew and didnt about her parents mr rhymes assistant told me that they caught the man who tried to hurt you and your parents finally got back my father she pointed thats him right there the counselor regarded the stocky man in the shabby tshirt and jacket and everythings okay out of earshot lakeesha watched them with a frown her expression was even more troubled than before shed seemed cheerful on the phone but now that geneva thought about it maybe shed been fronting and who was that guy shed been talking to nobody i dont think so geneva mrs barton asked you all right she looked back at the counselor sorry yeah its fine the woman again studied her father closely and then turned her brown eyes on the girl who looked away is there anything you want to tell me uhm whats the real story here i it was one of those situations when the truth was going to come out no matter what okay look mrs barton im sorry i wasnt completely honest my fathers not a professor hes been in prison but he got released so where have you been living on my own with no trace of judgment in her eyes the woman nodded your mother dead she frowned im sorry and is he going to take custody we havent really talked about it anything he does he has to get it worked out with the court or something she said this to buy time geneva had half formulated a plan for her father to come back technically take custody but shed continue to live on her own for a few days im going to stay with mr rhyme and amelia at their place the woman looked once more at her father who was offering a faint smile toward the pair thiss pretty unusual geneva said defiantly i wont go into a foster home i wont lose everything ive been working for ill run away ill whoa slow up the counselor smiled i dont think we need to make an issue of anything now youve been through enough well talk about it in a few days wherere you going now to mr rhymes ill give you a ride geneva gestured her father over the man ambled up to the car and the girl introduced them nice to meet you maam and thanks for looking out for geneva come on get in geneva looked across the street keesh was still there she shouted i gotta go ill call you she mimicked holding a phone to her ear lakeesha nodded uncertainly withdrew her hand from her purse geneva climbed into the backseat behind her father a glance through the back window at keeshs grim face then mrs barton pulled away from the curb and her father started up with another ridiculous history lesson rambling on and on you know i did a piece once bout the collyer brothers homer and langley lived at th and fifth they were recluses and the weirdest men ever lived they were terrified of crime in harlem and barricaded themselves in their apartment set up booby traps never threw a single thing out one of em got crushed under a pile of newspapers hed stacked up when they died police had to cart over a hundred tons of trash out of their place he asked you ever hear about them the counselor said she thought she had no geneva replied and thought ask me if i care lincoln rhyme was directing mel cooper to organize the evidence that theyd collected from the bombing scene in between reviewing some of the evidenceanalysis reports that had returned a federal team under dellrays direction had tracked down jon earle wilson the man whose fingerprints were on the transistor radio bomb in boyds safe house hed been collared and a couple of agents were going to bring him over to rhymes for interrogation to shore up the case against thompson boyd it was then that bells phone rang he answered bell hereluis whats up he cocked his head to listen luis this would be martinez who had been tailing geneva and her father on foot since theyd left rhymes to go to langston hughes they were convinced that jax alonzo jackson was her father and no threat to the girl and that the terrorist had been working alone but that didnt mean bell and rhyme were going to let geneva go anywhere in the immediate future without protection but something was wrong rhyme could read it in bells eyes the detective said to cooper we need a dmv check fast he jotted a tag number on a postit note then hung up handed the slip of paper to the cs tech whats happening sachs asked geneva and her father were at the bus stop near the school a car pulled up they got inside luis wasnt expecting that and couldnt get across the street fast enough to stop them car who was driving heavyset black woman way he described her sounds like it mightve been that counselor barton nothing to worry about necessarily rhyme reflected maybe the woman just saw them at the bus stop and offered them a ride information from the dmv flickered over his screen what do we have mel rhyme asked cooper squinted as he read he typed some more he looked up eyes wide through his thick glasses a problem we have a problem mrs barton was heading into southcentral harlem moving slowly though the early evening traffic she slowed as they drove past yet another real estate redevelopment project her father shook his head look at all this he nodded at the billboard developers banks architects a sour laugh betcha theres not a single black person running any of em lame geneva thought she wanted to tune him out whining about the past the counselor glanced at the site and shrugged you see that a lot around here she braked and turned down an alley between one of the old buildings being gutted and a deep excavation site in response to her fathers questioning glance mrs barton said shortcut but her father looked around shortcut just to miss some of the southbound traffic he looked again squinted then spat out bullshit dad geneva cried i know this block roads closed off up ahead theyre tearing down some old factory no mrs barton said i just came this way and but her father grabbed the parking brake and pulled up as hard as he could then spun the wheel to the left the car skidded into the brick wall with the wrenching sound of metal and plastic grinding into stone grabbing the counselors arm the man shouted shes with them baby trying to hurt you get out run dad no youre crazy you cant but the confirmation came a moment later as a pistol appeared from the womans pocket she aimed it at her fathers chest and pulled the trigger he blinked in shock and jerked back gripping the wound oh oh my he whispered geneva leapt back as the woman turned the silver gun toward her just as it fired her father swung his fist into the womans jaw and stunned her flame and bits of gunpowder peppered genevas face but the bullet missed it blew the cars rear window into a thousand tiny cubes run baby her father muttered and slumped against the dashboard get her down cut her cut the bitch sobbing geneva crawled out the shattered back window and fell to the ground she struggled to her feet and started sprinting down the ramp into the murky demolition site chapter thirtyeight alina frazier the woman fronting as the counselor patricia barton didnt have the cool of her partner thompson boyd was ice itself he never got rattled but alina had always been emotional she was furious cursing as she scrabbled over the body of geneva s father and stumbled out into the alley looking left and right for the girl furious that boyd was in jail furious that the girl was getting away breathing deeply looking up and down the deserted alley stalking back and forth where could the little bitch a flash of gray to her right geneva was crawling out from behind a scabby blue dumpster and disappearing deeper into the job site the woman started off in pursuit panting she was large yes but also very strong and she moved quickly you could let prison soften you or you could let prison turn you into stone shed chosen the second frazierd been a gangsta in the early nineties the leader of a girl wolf pack roaming times square and the upper east side where tourists and residents whod be suspicious of a cluster of teen boys didnt think anything of a handful of boisterous sistas toting daffy dan and macys shopping bags that is until the knives or guns appeared and the rich bitches lost their cash and jewelry after stints in juvie shed gone down big and done time for manslaughter it shouldve been murder but the kid prosecutor had fucked up after release shed returned to new york here shed met boyd through the guy she was living with and when frazier broke up with the claimer boyd had called her at first she thought it was just one of those whiteguyhotforablackgirl things but when shed taken up his invitation for coffee he hadnt come on to her at all hed just looked her over with those weird dead eyes of his and said that itd be helpful to have a woman work with him on some jobs was she interested jobs shed asked thinking drugs thinking guns thinking perped tvs but hed explained in a whisper what his line of work was shed blinked then hed added it could net her upwards of fifty thousand bucks for a few days work a brief pause then a grin damn straight for the geneva settle job though they were making five times that this turned out to be a fair price since it was the hardest kill theyd ever worked after the hit at the museum yesterday morning hadnt worked out boyd had called her and asked for her help even offering an extra if she killed the girl herself frazier always the smartest in her crews had come up with the idea of fronting as the counselor and had a fake board of education id made up shed started calling public schools in harlem asking to speak to any of geneva settles teachers and had received a dozen variations on shes not enrolled here sorry until langston hughes high where some office worker had said that yes this was her school frazier had then simply put on a cheap business suit dangled the id over her imposing chest and strolled into the high school like she owned the place there shed learned about the girls mysterious parents the apartment on th street and from that detective bell and the other cops about the central park west town house and who was guarding geneva shed fed all this information to boyd to help in planning the kill she staked out the girls apartment near morningside until it got too risky because of genevas bodyguards shed been caught in the act this afternoon when a squad car pulled her over near the place but it turned out the cops hadnt been looking for her frazier had talked a guard at langston hughes into giving her the security video of the school yard and with that prop she managed to get inside the crippled mans town house where she learned yet more information about the girl but then boyd had been nailed hed told her all along how good the police were and now it was up to alina frazier to finish the job if she wanted the rest of the fee gasping for breath the big woman now paused thirty feet down a ramp that led to the foundation level of the excavation site squinting against a blast of low sun from the west trying to see where the little bitch had gone damn girl show yourself then movement again geneva was making her way to the far side of the deserted job site crawling fast over the ground using cement mixers bobcats and piles of beams and supplies for cover the girl disappeared behind an oil drum stepping into the shadows for a better view frazier aimed at the middle of the drum and fired hitting the metal with a loud ring it seemed to her that dirt danced up into the air just past the container had it slammed through the girl too but no she was up and moving fast to a low wall of rubble brick stone pipes just as she vaulted it frazier fired again the girl tumbled over the other side of the wall with a shrill scream something puffed into the air dirt and stone dust or blood had frazier hit the girl she was a good shot she and her exboyfriend a gunrunner in newark had spent hours picking off rats in abandoned buildings on the outskirts of town trying out his products she thought shed been on the mark now but she couldnt wait long to find out people wouldve heard the gunshots somed ignore them sure and somed think the workers were still on the job with heavy equipment but at least one or two good citizens might be calling just about now well go see she started slowly down the truck ramp making sure she didnt fall the incline was very steep but then a car horn began blaring from the alley behind and above her it was coming from her car fuck she thought angrily the girls father was still alive frazier hesitated then decided time to get the hell out of here finish dad off geneva was probably hit and wouldnt survive long but even if she wasnt wounded frazier could track her down later thered be plenty of opportunities fucking hornit seemed louder than the gunshot and had to be attracting attention worse it would cover up the sound of any approaching sirens frazier climbed to the street level up the dirt ramp gasping from the effort but as she got to the car she frowned seeing that it was empty genevas father wasnt in the drivers seat after all a trail of blood led to a nearby alleyway where his body lay frazier glanced inside her car thats whatd happened before hed crawled away hed pulled out the cars jack and wedged it against the horn panel on the steering wheel furious frazier yanked it away the piercing sound stopped she tossed the jack into the backseat and glanced at the man was he dead well if not he soon would be she walked toward him her gun at her side then she paused frowning how had a man as badly wounded as this poor motherfucker opened the trunk unscrewed the jack lugged it to the front seat and rigged it against the wheel frazier started to look around and saw a blur to her right heard the whoosh of air as the tire iron swept down and crashed into her wrist sending the gun flying and shooting a breathtaking jolt of pain through her body the big woman screamed and dropped to her knees lunging for the gun with her left hand just as she grabbed it geneva swung the iron again and caught the woman in the shoulder with a solid clonk frazier rolled to the ground the gun sliding out of her reach blinded by the pain and the rage the woman lunged and tackled the girl before she could swing the rod again geneva went down hard the breath knocked out of her the woman turned toward where the pistol lay but choking and gasping geneva crawled forward grabbed her right arm and bit fraziers shattered wrist the pain that could be no worse rose like a shriek through her frazier swung her good fist into the girls face and connected with her jaw geneva gave a cry and blinked tears as she rolled helpless onto her back frazier climbed unsteadily to her feet cradling her bloody broken wrist and kicked the girl in the belly the teenager began to retch standing unsteadily frazier looked for the gun which was ten feet away dont need it dont want it the tire irond do just fine seething with anger she picked it up and started forward she looked down at the girl with undiluted hate and lifted the metal rod above her head geneva cringed and covered her face with her hands then a voice from behind the big woman shouted no frazier turned to see that redheaded policewoman from the crippled mans apartment walking slowly forward her large automatic pistol held in both hands alina frazier looked down at the revolver nearby id like the excuse the policewoman said i really would frazier slumped tossed the tire iron aside and feeling faint dropped into a sitting position she cradled her shattered hand the cop moved close and kicked the pistol and tire iron away as geneva rose to her feet and staggered toward a duo of medics who were running forward the girl directed them toward her father tears of pain in her eyes frazier demanded i need a doctor youll have to wait in line the policewoman muttered and slipped a plastic restraint around her wrists with what under the circumstances frazier decided was really a pretty gentle touch hes in stable condition lon sellitto announced hed fielded the phone call from an officer on duty at columbiapresbyterian hospital he didnt know what that means but there you have it rhyme nodded at this news about jax jackson whatever stable meant at least the man was alive for which rhyme was immensely grateful for geneva s sake the girl herself had been treated for contusions and abrasions and released it had been a photo finish to save her from boyds accomplice mel cooper had run the tags on the car that the girl and her father had gotten into and found it registered to someone named alina frazier a fast check of ncic and state databases revealed that she had a record a manslaughter charge in ohio and two assaults with deadly weapons in new york as well as a slew of sealed juvie offenses sellitto had put out an emergency vehicle locator which alerted all law enforcers in the area to look for fraziers sedan a traffic enforcement cop had radioed a short time later that the vehicle had been seen near a demolition site in south harlem thered also been a report of shots fired in the vicinity at rhymes town house amelia sachs jumped into her camaro and sped to the scene where she found frazier about to beat geneva to death frazier had been interrogated but was no more cooperative than her accomplice rhyme guessed that one had to think long and hard about betraying thompson boyd especially in jail given the long reach of his prison connections was geneva finally safe or not most likely she was two killers under wraps and the main actor blown to pieces sachs had searched alina fraziers apartment and found nothing except weapons and cash no information that would suggest there was anyone else who wanted to kill geneva settle jon earle wilson the excon from new jersey whod made the booby trap in boyds queens safe house was presently en route to rhymes and the criminalist hoped hed confirm their conclusions still rhyme and bell decided to dedicate a uniformed officer in a squad car to protection detail for geneva now a computer sounded a friendly chirp and mel cooper looked over at the screen he opened an email ah the mystery is solved which mystery would that be rhyme said this gruffly his moods forever fragile tended to sour toward the end of a case when boredom loomed winskinskie the indian word on the ring sachs had found around the finger bone beneath the ruins of potters field tavern and thiss from a professor at the university of maryland aside from the literal translation in the delaware language winskinskie was a title in the tammany society title sort of

nodded as he considered this letting his mind wander back in time past this case into the smoky sepia world of nineteenthcentury new york and tweed hung out in potters field so he and the tammany hall machine were probably behind setting charles up he ordered cooper to add the recent findings to the chart he then spent some moments looking over the information he nodded fascinating sellitto shrugged the case is over with linc the hitmen excuse me hit peopleve been collared the terrorist is dead whys something that happened a hundred years ago so fascinating nearly a hundred and forty years lon lets be accurate he was frowning as he stared intently at the evidence chart the maps and the placid face of the hanged man and the answer to your question is you know how much i hate loose

and hadnt lost a nights sleep when it turned on its masters except to superficially console clients who hadnt listened to his advice this refusal to be wooed by fad combined with solid investing in blue chip companies and especially new york city real estate had made both himself and sanford bank and trust a huge amount of money old school sure but only to a point oh he had the lifestyle afforded by a millionplus annual salary along with the revered bonuses that were the mainstay of wall street several homes memberships in nice country clubs pretty welleducated daughters and connections with a number of charities that he and his wife were pleased to help out a private grumman for his notinfrequent trips overseas was an important perk but ashberry was also atypical of your forbeslevel business executives scratch the surface and youd find pretty much the same tough kid from south philly whose fatherd been a headknocking factory worker and whose grandfatherd done some book cooking and tougher work for angelo bruno the docile don and later for phil chicken man testa ashberry had run with a tough crowd himself made money with blades and brains and did some things that could have come back to haunt him in a big way if he hadnt made absolutely sure they were forever buried but in his early twenties he had the presence of mind to realize that if he kept loansharking and busting heads for protection money and hanging out on dickson and reed streets in philly his only rewardsd be cheesesteak change and a good shot at prison if he did more or less the same thing in the world of business and hanging out on lower broadway and the upper west side of manhattan hed get fucking rich and have a good shot at albany or washington he might even try to fill frank rizzos shoes why not so it was law school at night a real estate license and eventually a job at sanford bank first on a cash drawer then moving his way up through the ranks the money did indeed start coming in slowly at first then in a steady stream he rose fast to be head of the banks hottest division the real estate operation rolling over competitors both within the bank and outside with his bareknuckle approach to business then hed finagled the job as head of the sanford foundation the philanthropic side of the bank which was hed learned the best way to make political connections another glance at the jersey horizon another moment of debate rubbing his hand compulsively up and down his thigh solid from his tennis sessions jogging golf yachting yes or no life and death calculating one foot forever rooted on south phillys seventeenth street bill ashberry played with the big boys men for instance like thompson boyd ashberry had gotten the killers name from an arsonist whod made the mistake of burning down one of ashberrys commercial properties and got caught in the process some years ago after ashberry realized he had to kill geneva settle hed hired a private eye to track down the paroled burnman and had paid him to put him in touch with a professional killer the scruffy man for gods sake a mullet had suggested boyd ashberry had been impressed with the choice boyd was fucking scary yes but not in some overthetop ballsy south philly way what was scary was that he was so calm so flat not a spark of emotion behind his eyes never spitting out a single fuck or prick the banker had explained what he needed and theyd arranged for payment a quarter million dollars even that figure hadnt gotten a rise out of boyd he seemed more interested you couldnt say excited about the prospect of killing a young girl as if hed never done that before it looked for a time like boyd would be successful and the girl would die and all of ashberrys problems would be over with but then disaster boyd and his accomplice that frazier woman were in jail hence the debate yes noshould ashberry kill geneva settle himself with his typical approach to business he considered the risks despite his zombie personality boyd had been as sharp as he was frightening he knew the business of death knew about investigating crimes too and how you could use motive to point the police in the wrong direction hed come up with several phony motives to mislead the cops first an attempted rape which hadnt worked the second was more subtle hed planted seeds where theyd be sure to grow nowadays a terrorist connection he and his accomplice had found some poor raghead who delivered middle eastern food to carts and restaurants near the jewelry exchange the building that was across the street from where geneva settle was to be killed boyd located the restaurant he worked for and staked out the place learned which van was his boyd and his partner set up a series of clues to make it seem that the arab loser was a terrorist planning a bombing and that he wanted geneva dead because shed seen him planning the attack boyd had gone to the trouble of stealing sheets of scrap office paper from the trash behind the exchange hed drawn a map on one sheet and on another written a note about the girl in arabictinted english an arabic language website had been helpful there to fool the cops boyd was going to leave these notes near crime scenes but itd worked out even better than that the police found them in boyds safe house before hed planted them which gave more credibility to the terrorism hook theyd used middle eastern food for clues and called in fake terrorist bomb threats to the fbi from pay phones around the area boyd hadnt planned to go any further with the charade than this but then a goddamn policewoman that detective sachs showed up right here at the foundation to dig through their archives ashberry still remembered how hed struggled to stay calm making small talk with the beautiful redhead and offering her the run of the stacks hed used all his willpower to keep from heading downstairs himself and casually asking her what she was looking into but there was too great a chance that this would arouse suspicion hed agreed to let her take some materials and when he looked over the log after she left he didnt see anything too troubling still her presence alone at the foundation and the fact she wanted to check out some materials told the banker that the cops hadnt caught on to the terrorist motive ashberry had immediately called boyd and told him to make the story more credible the hitman had bought a working bomb from the arsonist whod put ashberry in touch with boyd hed planted the device in the delivery van along with a ranting letter to the times about zionists boyd was arrested just after that but his partner that black woman from harlem had detonated the bomb and finally the police got the message terrorism and since the raghead was dead theyd pull back the protection on the girl this gave alina frazier the chance to finish the job but the police had outsmarted her too and shed been caught the big question now was did the police believe the threat to the girl was finally gone with the mastermind dead and the two professional killers arrested he decided they might not be completely convinced but their defenses would be lowered so what was the level of risk if he went ahead minimal he decided geneva settle would die now he only needed an opportunity boyd had said shed moved out of her apartment in west harlem and was staying someplace else the only connection ashberry had was her school he rose left his office and took the ornate elevator downstairs then walked to broadway and found a phone kiosk always pay phones never private landlines and never ever mobile phones thank you thompson he got a number from directory assistance and placed the call langston hughes high the woman answered he glanced at the side of a nearby retailstore delivery truck and said to the receptionist this is detective steve macy with the police department i need to speak to an administrator a moment later he was put through to an assistant principal how can i help you the harried man asked ashberry could hear a dozen voices in the background the businessman himself had detested every minute hed spent in school he identified himself again and added im following up on an incident that involved one of your students geneva settle oh she was that witness right yep i need to get some papers to her this afternoon the district attorneys going to be indicting some of the people involved in the case and we need her signature on a statement can i speak to her sure hold on a pause as he asked someone else in the room about the girls schedule ashberry heard something about her being absent the administrator came back on shes not in school today shell be back monday oh is she at home wait hold on a minute another voice was speaking to the principal offering a suggestion please ashberry thought the man came back on the line one of her teachers thinks shes at columbia this afternoon working on some project the university yeah try a professor mathers i dont have his first name sorry the administrator sounded preoccupied but to make sure the man didnt call the police just to check on him ashberry said in a dismissing way you know ill just call the officers whore guarding her thanks yeah so long ashberry hung up and paused looking over the busy street hed only wanted her address but this might work out better even though the principal didnt sound surprised when ashberry mentioned the guards which meant that somebody might still be protecting her hed have to take that fact into account he called the main columbia switchboard and learned that professor matherss office hours today were from one to six how long would geneva be there ashberry wondered he hoped it would be for most of the day he had a lot to do at fourthirty that afternoon william ashberry was cruising in his bmw m through harlem looking around him he didnt think of the place in racial or cultural terms he saw it as an opportunity for him a mans worth was determined by his ability to pay his debts on time specifically and from a selfinterested point of view a mans ability to cough up the rent or mortgage on one of the redevelopment projects that sanford bank had going on in harlem if a borrower was black or hispanic or white or asian if he was a drug dealer or an ad agency executivedidnt matter as long as he wrote that monthly check now on th street he passed one of the very buildings his bank was renovating the graffiti had been scrubbed off the interior gutted building materials stacked on the ground floor the old tenants had been given incentives to relocate some reluctant residents had been urged to and had taken the hint several new renters had already signed expensive leases even though the construction wouldnt be completed for six months he turned onto a crowded commercial street looking at the vendors not what he needed the banker continued on his search the final task in an afternoon that had been hectic to say the least after leaving his office at the sanford foundation hed sped to his weekend house in new jersey there hed unlocked the gun cabinet and removed his doublebarreled shotgun at the workbench in the garage hed sawed the barrels off making the gun only about eighteen inches long a surprisingly hard job which had cost him a half dozen electricsaw blades tossing the discarded barrels into the pond behind the house the banker had paused looking around him reflecting that this deck was the place where his oldest daughter would be getting married next year after she graduated from vassar hed remained there for a long moment gazing at the sun breaking on the cold blue water then hed loaded the shortened gun and placed it and a dozen shells in a cardboard carton covered them with some old books newspapers and magazines he wouldnt need any props better than these the professor and geneva werent going to survive long enough to even look inside the box dressed in a mismatched sports coat and suit hair slicked back with drugstore reading glasses the best disguise he could come up with ashberry had then sped across the george washington bridge and into harlem where he now was searching for the last prop for the drama ah there the banker parked and got out of the car he walked up to the nation of islam street vendor and bought a kufi an islamic skullcap drawing not the least blink of surprise from the man ashberry who took the hat in his gloved hand thanks again thompson then returned to the car when no one was looking he bent down and rubbed the hat on the ground beneath a telephone kiosk where he guessed many people had stood during the past day or so the hat would pick up some dirt and other evidence ideally a hair or two which would give the police even more false leads on the terrorist connection he rubbed the inside of the hat on the mouthpiece of the phone to pick up saliva and sweat for dna samples slipping the hat into the box with the gun and magazines and books he climbed back into the car and drove to morningside heights and onto the columbia campus he now found the old faculty building that housed matherss office the businessman spotted a police car parked in front an officer sitting in the front seat looking vigilantly over the street so she did have a guard well he could handle it hed survived tougher situations than this on the streets of south philly and in boardrooms down on wall street surprise was the best advantage you could beat overwhelming odds if you did the unexpected continuing along the street he made a uturn and parked behind the building his car well out of sight and aimed toward the highway for a fast escape he climbed out and looked around yes it could work he could approach the office from the side then slip through the front door when the cop was looking elsewhere as for getting awaythere was a back door to the building two groundlevel windows too if the cop ran for the building the minute he heard the shots ashberry could shoot him from one of the front windows in any case he should have enough time to drop the kufi as evidence and get to his car before any other police arrived he found a pay phone he called the schools main switchboard columbia university a voice replied professor mathers please one moment a blackinflected voice answered hello professor mathers thats right in the persona of steve macy again ashberry explained that he was an author from philadelphia doing research at the lehman library the columbia facility devoted to social science and journalism the sanford foundation had given a lot of money to libraries and schools like this one ashberry had attended benefits there he could describe it if he had to he then said that one of the librarians had heard mathers had been looking into nineteenthcentury new york history particularly the reconstruction era was that right the professor gave a surprised laugh i am as a matter of fact its not for me actually im helping out a high school student shes with me right now thank god the girl was still there i can get it all over with now get on with my life ashberry said that hed brought quite a lot of material up from philly would he and this student be interested in taking a look the professor said they definitely would thanked him then asked what would be a convenient time to come by when he was seventeen billy ashberry had held a box cutter against the thigh of an elderly shopkeeper and reminded him that the mans protection payments were past due the razor was going to cut one inch for every day the payment was late unless he paid up instantly his voice had been as calm then as it was now saying to mathers im leaving tonight but i could drop by now you can make copies if you want you have a xerox machine i do yes ill be there in a few minutes they hung up ashberry reached into the box and clicked the safety button on the shotgun to the off position then he hefted the carton and started toward the building through a swirl of autumn leaves spun in tiny cyclones by the cold breeze chapter forty professor youre steve macy the dowdy professor sporting a bow tie and tweed jacket was sitting behind piles of papers covering his desk he smiled yes sir im richard mathers this is geneva settle a short teenage girl her skin as dark as the professors glanced at him and nodded then she looked eagerly at the box he carted she was so young could he really kill her then an image of his daughters wedding on the dock of his summer house flashed through his mind followed by a series of fast thoughts the mercedes amg his wife wanted his membership at the augusta golf course the dinner plans he had this evening at letoile to which the new york times had just given three stars those images answered his question ashberry set the box on the floor no cops inside he noticed with relief he shook matherss hand and thought fuck they can lift fingerprints from flesh after the shootings hed have to take the time to wipe off the mans palms he remembered what thompson boyd had told him when it came to death you did everything by the book or you walked away from the job ashberry smiled at the girl didnt shake her hand he looked around the office judging angles sorry for the mess mathers said mine isnt any better he said with a faint laugh the room was filled with books magazines and stacks of photocopies on the wall were a number of diplomas mathers was it turned out not a history but a law professor and a wellknown one apparently ashberry was looking at a photo of the professor with bill clinton and another with former mayor giuliani as he saw these photos the remorse raised its head again but it was really nothing more than a faint blip on the screen by now ashberry was comfortable with the fact that he was in the room with two dead people they chatted for a few minutes with ashberry talking in vague terms about schools and libraries in philadelphia avoiding any direct comments about what he was looking into he stayed on the offensive asking the professor what exactlyre you researching mathers deferred to geneva who explained that they were trying to find out about her ancestor charles singleton a former slave it was pretty weird she said the police thought that there was this connection between him and some crimes ones that just happened that turned out to be pretty wack i mean it was wrong but were all curious about what happened to him nobody seems to know lets take a look at what youve got mathers said clearing a spot on a low table in front of his desk ill get another chair this is it ashberry thought his heart began pounding fast he then recalled the razor knife slipping into the shopkeepers flesh cutting two inches for the two days of missed juice ashberry hardly hearing the mans screams recalled all the years of backbreaking work to get to where he was today recalled thompson boyds dead eyes he was instantly calm as soon as mathers stepped into the hallway the banker glanced out the window the policeman was still in the car a good fifty feet away and the building was so solid he might not even hear the gunshots with the desk between himself and geneva he bent down shuffling through the papers he gripped the shotgun did you find any pictures geneva asked id really like to find more about what the neighborhood looked like back then i have a few i think mathers was returning coffee he called from the hallway no thanks ashberry turned to the door now he started to rise pulling the gun from the box keeping it below genevas eye level aiming at the doorway finger around the trigger but something was wrong mathers wasnt appearing it was then that ashberry felt something metallic touch his ear william ashberry youre under arrest i have a weapon it was the girls voice though a very different sound an adult voice set that breakdown on the desk slow ashberry froze but the shotgun set it down the girl nudged his head with the pistol im a police officer and i will use my firearm oh lord noit was all a trap listen up now you do what shes telling you this was the professor though of course it wasnt mathers at all he was a standin too a cop who was pretending to be the professor he glanced sideways the man had come back into the office through a side door from his neck dangled an fbi identification card he too held a pistol how the hell had they gotten onto him ashberry wondered in disgust an don move that muzzle so muchs a skinny little millimeter we all together on that im not going to tell you again the girl said in a calm voice do it now still he didnt move ashberry thought of his grandfather the mobster he thought of the screaming shopkeeper he thought of his daughters wedding what would thompson boyd do play it by the book and give up no fucking way ashberry dropped into a crouch and spun around lightning fast lifting the gun somebody shouted dont the last word he ever heard chapter fortyone quite a view thom said lincoln rhyme glanced out the window at the hudson river the rock cliffs of the palisades on the opposite shore and the distant hills of new jersey maybe pennsylvania too he turned away immediately the expression on his face explaining that panoramic views like peoples pointing them out bored him senseless they were in the sanford foundation office of the late william ashberry atop the hiram sanford mansion on west eightysecond street wall street was still digesting the news of the mans death and his involvement in a series of crimes over the past few days not that the financial community had ground to a halt compared with say the betrayals visited on shareholders and employees by executives of enron and global crossing the death of a crooked executive of a profitable company didnt make compelling news amelia sachs had already searched the office and removed evidence linking ashberry to boyd and taped off certain parts of the room this meeting was in a cleared area which happened to feature stainedglass windows and rosewood paneling sitting beside rhyme and thom were geneva settle and attorney wesley goades rhyme was amused that thered been a few moments when hed actually suspected goades of complicity in the case owing to his suddenly materializing in rhymes apartment looking for geneva and the fourteenth amendment aspect of the intrigue the lawyer wouldve had a strong motive to make certain that nothing jeopardized an important weapon for civil libertarians rhyme had also wondered if the mans loyalty to his former insurance company employers had led him to betray geneva but rhyme hadnt shared his suspicion of the lawyer and thus no apologies were in order after rhyme and sachs had discovered that the case had taken an unexpected turn the criminalist had suggested that goades be retained for what was coming next geneva settle of course was all in favor of hiring him across the marble coffee table from them were gregory hanson the president of sanford bank and trust his assistant stella turner and the senior partner at sanford s law firm a trim midforties attorney named anthony cole they exuded a collective unease which rhyme assumed wouldve arisen late yesterday when hed called hanson to propose a meeting to discuss the ashberry matter hanson had agreed but added both quickly and wearily that he was as shocked as anyone about the mans death in the shootout at columbia university several days before he knew nothing about it or about any jewelry store robbery or terrorist attack except what hed read in the news what exactly did rhyme and the police want rhyme had offered standard copese just the answers to a few routine questions now pleasantries disposed of hanson asked could you tell us what this is about rhyme got right to the point he explained that william ashberry had hired thompson boyd a professional killer to murder geneva settle three horrified glances at the slim young girl in front of them she looked back at each of them calmly continuing the criminalist added that ashberry felt it was vital that nobody know the reason he wanted her dead so he and boyd had set up several fake motives for the girls death originally the kill was supposed to look like a rape rhyme though had seen through that immediately and as they continued to search for the killer he and the team had found what appeared to be the real reason for the murder that geneva could identify a terrorist planning an attack but there were some problems with that the bombers death shouldve ended any need to kill geneva but it didnt boyds partner tried again what was going on we tracked down the man who sold the bomb to boyd an arsonist in new jersey the fbi arrested him we linked some bills in his possession to boyds safe house that made him an accomplice to murder and he copped a plea he told us that he put ashberry and boyd together and this terrorist thing though the banks lawyer said skeptically with a sour laugh bill ashberry and terrorists it getting there rhyme said equally sour maybe more so he continued his explanation the bomb makers statement wasnt enough for a warrant to arrest ashberry so rhyme and sellitto decided they needed to flush him out they placed an officer at genevas high school a man pretending to be an assistant principal anyone calling to ask about geneva would be told that she was at columbia with a professor in the law school the real professor agreed to let them use not only his name but his office as well fred dellray and jonette monroe the undercover gangsta girl from genevas high school were more than happy to play the roles of the professor and student theyd done a fast but thorough job setting up the sting even having some fake photoshop pictures made up of dellray with bill clinton and rudy giuliani to make sure ashberry didnt tip to the scam and bolt rhyme now explained these events to hanson and cole adding the details about the attempted murder in matherss office he shook his head i shouldve guessed the perp had some connections to a bank hed been able to withdraw large amounts of cash and doctor the reporting statements but rhyme nodded to the lawyer what the hell was he up to i understand that episcopalians arent really a breeding ground for fundamentalist terrorism no one smiled rhyme thought bankers lawyers no sense of humor he continued so i went back to the evidence and noticed something that bothered me there was no radio transmitter to detonate the bomb it shouldve been in the wreckage of the van but it wasnt why not one conclusion was that boyd and his partner had planted the bomb and kept the transmitter themselves to kill the arab deliveryman as a diversion to keep us from finding the real motive for killing geneva okay hanson said the real motive what was it had to do some thinking about that i thought at first maybe geneva had seen some tenants being evicted illegally when she was scrubbing graffiti off old buildings for a developer but i looked into where thatd happened and found that sanford bank wasnt involved in those buildings so where did that leave us i could only come back to what wed originally thought he explained about the old coloreds weekly illustrated that boyd had stolen id forgotten that somebody had been tracking down the magazine before geneva supposedly saw the van and terrorist i think what happened was that ashberry stumbled on that article when the sanford foundation renovated its archives last month and he did some more research and found something real troubling something that could ruin his life he got rid of the foundations copy and decided he had to destroy all the copies of the magazine over the past few weeks he found most of them but there was one left in the area the librarian at the africanamerican museum in midtown was getting their copy from storage and mustve told ashberry that coincidentally there was a girl who was interested in the same issue ashberry knew he had to destroy the article and kill geneva along with the librarian because he could connect them but i still dont understand why cole the lawyer said his sourness had blossomed into fullfledged irritation rhyme explained the final piece of the puzzle he related the story of charles singleton the farm hed been given by his master and the freedmens trust robbery and the fact that the former slave had a secret that was the answer to why charles was set up in and its the answer to why ashberry had to kill geneva secret stella the assistant asked oh yes i finally figured out what it was i remembered something that geneva s father had told me he said that charles taught at an african free school near his home and that he sold cider to workers building boats up the road rhyme shook his head i made a careless assumption we heard that his farm was in new york statewhich it was except that it wasnt upstate like we were thinking no where was it hanson asked easy to figure out he continued if you keep in mind there were working farms here in the city until the late eighteen hundreds you mean his farm was in manhattan stella asked not only rhyme said allowing himself the colloquialism it was right underneath this building chapter fortytwo we found a drawing of gallows heights in the s that shows three or four big treefilled estates one of them covered this and the surrounding blocks across the road from it was an african free school could thatve been his school and on the hudson river rhyme glanced out the window right about there at eightyfirst street was a dry dock and shipyard could the workers there have been the ones charles sold cider to but was the estate his there was one simple way to find out thom checked the manhattan recorders office and found the record of a deed from charless master to charles yep it was his then everything else fell into place all the references we found to meetings in gallows heights with politicians and civil rights leaders it was charless house they were meeting in that was his secret that he owned fifteen acres of prime land in manhattan but why was it a secret hanson asked oh he didnt dare tell anyone he was the owner he wanted to of course thats what he was so tormented about he was proud that he owned a big farm in the city he believed he could be a model for other former slaves show them that they could be treated as whole men respected that they could own land and work it be members of the community but hed seen draft riots the lynchings of blacks the arson so he and his wife pretended to be caretakers he was afraid that somebody would find out that a former slave owned a large plot of choice property and destroy it or more likely steal it from him which geneva said is exactly what happened rhyme continued when charles was convicted all his property was confiscated including the farm and sold now thats a nice theory setting up someone with false charges to steal his property but was there any proof a tall order a hundred and forty years later talk about cold caseswell there was some evidence the exeter strongbow safes the type that charles allegedly broke into at the freedmens trust they were made in england so i called a friend at scotland yard he talked to a forensic locksmith who said itd be impossible to break into a nineteenthcentury exeter safe with only a hammer and chisel which is what they found at the scene even steampowered drills of that era would take three or four hours and the article about the theft said that charles was inside the trust for only twenty minutes next conclusion somebody else robbed the place planted some of charless tools at the scene and then bribed a witness to lie about him i think that the actual thief was a man we found buried in the basement of the potters field tavern he explained about the winskinskie ring and the man whod worn it that he was an officer in the corrupt tammany hall political machine he was one of boss tweeds cronies and another one was william simms the detective who arrested charles simms was later indicted for graft and planting false evidence on suspects simms the winskinskie man and the judge and prosecutor engineered charless conviction and they kept the money from the trust that wasnt recovered so weve established charles owned a huge estate in gallows heights and he was set up so somebody could steal it his eyebrow rose the next logical question the big one no takers obviously who the hell was the perp rhyme snapped who robbed charles well given that the motive was to steal his farm all i had to do was find out who took title to the land who was it hanson asked troubled but seemingly caught up in the historical drama the assistant smoothed her skirt and suggested boss tweed no it was a colleague of his a man who was seen regularly at the potters field tavern along with some of the other notorious figures back then jim fisk jay gould and detective simms a glance at each of the people across the table his name was hiram sanford the woman blinked after a moment she said the founder of our bank the one and only this is ridiculous said cole the attorney how could he do that he was one of the pillars of new york society just like william ashberry the criminalist asked sarcastically the business world wasnt really any different then than it is now lots of financial speculation one of charless letters quoted the new york tribune referring to the bursting bubbles on wall street railroads were the internet companies of the s their stocks were overvalued and crashed sanford probably lost his fortune when that happened and tweed agreed to bail him out but being tweed he naturally wanted to use somebody elses money to do it so the two of them set up charles and sanford bought the orchard at a rigged auction for a fraction of its value he tore down charless house and built his mansion on it where were sitting right now a nod out the window toward the blocks nearby and then he and his heirs developed the land or sold it off little by little didnt charles claim he was innocent tell them what happened hanson asked rhyme scoffed a former slave against the antiblack tammany hall democratic machine how successful would that have been besides hed killed the man in the tavern so he was a murderer the attorney cole pointed out quickly of course not rhyme snapped he needed the winskinskie man alive to prove his innocence the death was selfdefense but charles had no choice but to hide the body and cover up the shooting if theyd found out hed be hanged hanson shook his head only theres one thing that doesnt make any sense why would what hiram sanford did way back then affect bill ashberry granted its bad pr a bank founder stealing a former slaves property thatd be an ugly ten minutes on the nightly news but frankly there are spin doctors who can handle that sort of thing its not worth killing somebody for ah rhyme nodded very good questionweve done a little research ashberry was in charge of your real estate division right thats right and if it were to go under hed lose his job and most of his fortune i suppose so but why would it go under its our most profitable unit rhyme looked at wesley goades youre up the lawyer glanced briefly at the people across the table then down again the man simply could not hold eye contact nor was he given to rhymes pointed explanations and occasional digressions he said simply were here to inform you that ms settle intends to file a lawsuit against your bank seeking restitution for her loss hanson frowned and looked at cole who gave them a sympathetic look on the facts that youve given me making a tortious claim against the bank for infliction of emotional distress probably wouldnt get very far see the problem is that mr ashberry was acting on his own not as a bank officer were not responsible for his actions a glance toward goades which may or may not have been condescending as your fine counsel here will tell you hanson added quickly to geneva but were very sympathetic to what you went through stella turner nodded they seemed to mean this sincerely well make it up to you he offered a smile i think youll find we can be pretty generous his lawyer added what he had to within reason rhyme regarded the bank president closely gregory hanson seemed nice enough boyishly fifties an easy smile probably one of those naturalborn businessmen the sort who was a decent boss and family man did his job competently worked long hours for the shareholders flew coach on the company dime remembered his employees birthdays the criminalist almost felt bad about what was coming next wesley goades however exhibited no remorse whatsoever as he said mr hanson the loss were talking about isnt your corporate officers attempted murder of ms settle which is how we phrase the act not emotional distress no her suit is on behalf of charles singletons heirs to recover the property stolen by hiram sanford as well as monetary damages wait the president whispered giving a faint laugh damages equal to the rents and profits that your bank has made from that property from the date the court transferred title he consulted a piece of paper thatd be august the moneyll be placed in a trust for the benefit of all of mr singletons descendants with distribution to be supervised by the court we dont have the actual figure yet finally goades looked up and held hansons eye but were ballparking it conservatively at around nine hundred and seventy million dollars chapter fortythree thats what william ashberry was willing to kill for rhyme explained to keep the theft of charless property a secret if anybody found out and his heirs made a claim it would be the end of the real estate division and might even drive the entire sanford bank into bankruptcy oh well now thiss absurd the lawyer across the table from them blustered the two legal opponents were equally tall and skinny though cole had a better tan rhyme suspected that wesley goades didnt get out on tennis courts or golf courses very often look around you the blocksre developed every square inch is built on we have no claim to the construction goades said as if this were clear we only want title to the land and the rents thatve been paid with respect to it for a hundred and forty years its not our problem that thats when sanford robbed charles but most of the lands been sold off hanson said the bank only owns the two apartment buildings on this block and this mansion well naturally well be instituting an accounting action to trace the proceeds of the property your bank illegally sold but weve been disposing of parcels for over a hundred years goades spoke to the tabletop ill say again your problem not ours no cole snapped forget it ms settle is actually being quite restrained in her damage claim theres a good argument to be made for the fact that without her ancestors property your bank would have gone under altogether in the eighteen sixties and that shes entitled to all of your worldwide earnings but were not seeking that she doesnt want the present shareholders of the bank to suffer too much damn generous the lawyer muttered it was her decision i was in favor of closing you down cole leaned forward listen why dont you take a reality pill here you have no case for one thing the statute of limitations has run youll be kicked out of court on motion have you ever noticed rhyme asked unable to resist how people always lead with their weakest argumentsorry forgive the footnote as for the statute goades said we can make a solid argument that its been tolled and were entitled to bring the suit under principles of equity the lawyer had explained to rhyme that in some cases the time limit on bringing a lawsuit could be tolled extended if the defendant covers up a crime so that the victims dont know it occurred or when they arent able to sue like when the courts and prosecutors were acting in collusion with the wrongdoer which had happened in the singleton case goades reiterated this now but whatever hiram sanford did the other lawyer pointed out it had nothing to do with my client the present bank weve traced ownership of the bank all the way back to the original hiram sanford bank and trust limited which was the entity that took title to the singleton farm sanford used the bank as a cover unfortunatelyfor you that is goades said this as cheerfully as an unsmiling man could cole wasnt giving up well what proof do you have that the property wouldve been passed down through the family this charles singleton couldve sold it for five hundred dollars in and squandered the money away we have evidence that he intended to keep the farm in his family rhyme turned to geneva what did charles say the girl didnt need to look at any notes in a letter to his wife he told her he never wanted to sell the farm he said i wish the land to pass intact to our son and his issue professions and trades ebb and flow the financial markets are fickle but the earth is gods great constant and our farm will ultimately bring to our family respectability in the eyes of those who do not respect us now it will be our childrens salvation and that of the generations that will follow enjoying his role as cheerleader rhyme said just think of how a juryll react to that not a dry eye cole leaned forward angrily toward goades oh i know whats going on here youre making it sound like shes a victim but thiss just blackmail like all the rest of the slavery reparations bullshit right im sorry charles singleton was a slave im sorry he or his father or whoever was brought here against his will cole waved his arm as if shooing away a bee and glanced at geneva well young lady that was a long long time ago my greatgrandfather died of black lung you dont see me suing west virginia coal and shale looking for some easy money you people have to get over it just get on with your lives if you spent as much time hold up hanson snapped both he and his assistant glared at the lawyer cole licked his lips and then sat back im sorry i didnt mean it the way it sounded i said you people but i didnt mean he was looking at wesley goades but it was geneva who spoke mr cole i feel the same way like i really believe in what frederick douglass said people might not get all they work for in this world but they must certainly work for all they get i dont want any easy money the lawyer eyed her uncertainly he looked down after a moment geneva did not she continued you know ive been talking to my father about charles i found out some things about him like his grandfather was kidnapped by slavers and taken away from his family in yorubaland and sent to virginia charless father died when he was fortytwo because his master thought itd be cheaper to buy a new younger slave than to treat him for pneumonia i found out that charless mother was sold to a plantation in georgia when charles was twelve and he never saw her again but you know what she asked calmly im not asking for a penny because of those things no its real simple something charles loved was taken away from him and ill do whatever i have to to make sure the thief pays for that cole murmured another apology but his legal genes wouldnt let him abdicate his clients cause he glanced at hanson then continued i appreciate what youre saying and well offer a settlement based on mr ashberrys actions but as for the claim to the property we cant go there we dont even know that you have legal standing to bring the suit what proof do you have that youre really charles singletons descendant lincoln rhyme eased his finger across the touchpad and steered his chair imposingly close to the table isnt it about time somebody here asked why i tagged along silence i dont get out very much as you can imagine so what do you think brought me all these long blocks west lincoln chided thom all right all right ill get to the point exhibit a what exhibit cole asked im being facetious the letter he glanced at geneva she opened her own backpack and took out a folder she slipped a photocopy onto the desk the sanford side of the table looked it over one of singletons letters hanson asked nice handwriting rhyme observed that was important back then not like nowadays all this typing and careless jottingall right sorry no more digressions heres the point i had a colleague fellow named parker kincaid down in dc compare that handwriting to all the existing samples of charles singletons exemplars including legal documents in archives down in virginia parkers former fbi hes the handwriting expert the experts go to when they have a questioned document hes executed an affidavit stating that thiss identical to the known samples of singletons handwriting okay cole conceded its his letter so geneva rhyme said what does charles say she nodded at the letter and recited again from memory and yet the source of my tears the stains you see on this paper my darling are not from pain but from regret for the misery i have visited upon us the original letter contains several stains rhyme explained we analyzed them and found lysozyme lipocalin and lactoferrin proteins if youre interested and assorted enzymes lipids and metabolites those and water of course make up human tears by the way did you know that the composition of tears differs significantly depending on whether they were shed in pain or because of emotion these tears a nod toward the document were shed in emotion i can prove that i suspect the jury will find that fact moving too cole sighed youve run a dna test on the stain and it matches ms settles dna rhyme shrugged and muttered the byword for today obviously hanson looked at cole whose eyes slipped back and forth between the letter and his notes the president said to geneva a million dollars ill write you a check right now for a million dollars if you and your guardian sign a liability waiver goades said coolly ms settle insists on seeking restitution in the amount of the actual damages monies that all of charles singletons heirs will share in not just herself he leveled another gaze at the bank president im sure you werent suggesting that your payment would be for her alone an incentive maybe to neglect to inform her relatives about what happened no no of course not hanson said quickly let me talk to our board well come up with a settlement figure goades gathered up the papers and stuffed them into his knapsack im filing the complaint in two weeks if you want to discuss voluntarily creating a trust fund for the claimants you can call me here he slid a card across the desk when they were at the door the banks attorney cole said geneva wait please look im sorry about what i said before truly it wasinappropriate i honestly feel bad for what happened to you and to your ancestor and i do have your interest in mind here just remember that a settlement would be far and away the best thing for you and your relatives let your lawyer tell you how tough a trial like this would be how long it could take how expensive he smiled trust me we are on your side here geneva looked him over her reply was the battlesre the same as theyve always been its just harder to recognize the enemy she turned and continued out the door the attorney clearly had no idea what she meant which rhyme supposed more or less proved her point chapter fortyfour early wednesday the autumn air cold and clear as fresh ice geneva had just visited her father at columbiapresbyterian hospital and was on her way to langston hughes high shed finished the paper on home to harlem it turned out not to be such a bad book though shed still rather have written about octavia butler damn that woman could write and she was pretty pleased with her report what was especially phat though was that genevad written it on a word processor one of the toshibas in mr rhymes lab which thom had showed her how to use at school the few computers that worked were so overbooked that you couldnt get more than fifteen minutes of time on one let alone use it to write a whole paper and to find facts or research all she had to do was minimize wordperfect and call up the internet a miracle what wouldve otherwise taken her two days to write she finished in mere hours crossing the street she aimed for the shortcut through the school yard of ps elementary school which took a few minutes off the trip from the eighth avenue train station to langston hughes the chainlink fence around the school yard cast a gridded shadow on the bleachedgray asphalt the slim girl slipped easily through the gap in the gate which had long ago been wedged open wide enough for a teenage boy and a basketball to pass through the hour was early the yard deserted she was ten feet across the grounds when she heard a voice calling from the other side of the fence girlfriend yo she stopped lakeesha stood on the sidewalk decked out in tight green stretch pants a long orange blouse taut over her boobs book bag dangling bling and braids glistening in the sun her face had the same somber expression as when geneva d seen her last week when that wack bitch frazier tried to kill her and her father hey girl whereve you been keesh looked doubtfully at the gap in the chain link shed never fit cmon here meet me at school naw wanna talk just us geneva debated her friends face told her this was important she

damn him showin up musta been freaky you got that right girl finally the big girl slowed then stopped geneva looked at her friends evasive eyes and watched her hand disappearing into her purse gripping something inside a hesitation what geneva asked here the girl whispered fast lifting her hand and thrusting it forward in her fingers which ended in blackandwhitecheckered acrylic nails was a silver necklace a heart on the end of a chain thats geneva began what you give me last month fo my birthday youre giving it back i cant keep it gen you be needin benjamins anyway you can hock it dont

service for years and her father had a job at cbs and another one nights at the sheraton hotel her brother worked as well kevind have an eye on the whole familys benjamins you loan him any money

a baby fine but stay in school you can you aint my moms girl keesh snapped i know what im about anger flashed in the girls eyes all the more heartbreaking because it was the very same fury that had filled the girls round face when she stepped up to protect geneva from the delano or st nicholas project girls moving on her in the street get her down cut her cut the bitch then keesh added softly what it is girl he sayin i cant hang with you no more you cant kevin say you treat him bad at school treated him bad a cold laugh he wanted me to help him cheat i said no i told him it was fucked up what he was sayin me and you being so tight and everthing but he wouldnt listen he say i cant see you none so youre choosing him geneva said i aint got no choice the big girl looked down i cant take no present from you here she thrust the necklace into geneva s hand and released it fast as if she were letting go of a hot pan it fell to the filthy sidewalk dont do it keesh please geneva reached for the girl but her fingers closed on nothing but cool air chapter fortyfive ten days after the meeting with sanford bank president gregory hanson and his lawyer lincoln rhyme was having a phone conversation with ron pulaski the young rookie who was on medical leave but expected to return to duty in a month or so his memory was coming back and he was helping them shore up the case against thompson boyd so you going to a halloween party pulaski asked then paused and added a quick or whatever the last two words probably were meant to counteract any faux pas created by suggesting that a quadriplegic might attend parties but rhyme put him at ease by saying i am as a matter of fact im going as glenn cunningham sachs stifled a laugh really the rookie asked uhm whos that exactly why dont you look it up patrolman yes sir i will rhyme disconnected and looked over the main evidence board on the top of which was taped the twelfth card in the tarot deck the hanged man he was gazing at the card when the doorbell rang lon sellitto probably he was due soon from a therapy session hed stopped rubbing the phantom bloodstain and practicing his billy the kid quick draw which nobodyd yet explained to rhyme hed tried to ask sachs about it but she couldnt or wouldnt say much which was fine sometimes lincoln rhyme firmly believed you just didnt need to know all the details but his visitor at the moment it turned out wasnt the rumpled detective rhyme glanced into the doorway and saw geneva settle standing there listing against her book bag welcome he said sachs too said hello pulling off the safety glasses shed been wearing as she filled out chainofcustody cards for blood samples shed collected at a homicide crime scene that morning wesley goades had all the paperwork ready to file in the lawsuit against sanford bank and reported to geneva that she could expect a realistic offer from hanson by monday if not the legal cruise missile had warned his opponents that he would file suit the next day a press conference would accompany the event goadess opinion was that the bad publicity would last considerably longer than an ugly ten minutes rhyme looked the girl over unseasonably warm weather made gangsta sweats and stocking caps impractical so she was in blue jeans and a sleeveless tshirt with guess in glittery letters across the chest shed gained a little weight her hair was longer she even had some makeup on rhyme had wondered what was in the bag that thom had mysteriously slipped her the other day the girl looked good genevas life had achieved a certain stability jax jackson had been released from the hospital and was undergoing physical therapy thanks to some prodding by sellitto the man had been officially transferred to the care and feeding of the new york city parole authorities geneva was living in his minuscule apartment in harlem an arrangement that was not as dire as shed anticipated the girl had confessed this not to rhyme or roland bell but to thom whod become a mother hen to the girl and invited her to the town house regularly to give her cooking lessons watch tv and argue books and politics none of which rhyme had any interest in as soon as they could afford a bigger place she and her father were going to have aunt lilly move in with them the girl had given up her job slinging mchash and was now employed after school by wesley goades as a legal researcher and gofer she was also helping him set up the charles singleton trust which would disburse the settlement money to the freedmans heirs genevas interest in fleeing the city at the earliest opportunity for a life in london or rome hadnt flagged but the cases that rhyme overheard her passionately talking about all seemed to involve harlem residents whod been discriminated against because they were black latino islamic women or poor geneva was also engaged in some project she referred to as saving her girlfriend which she didnt go into with him either her advisor for this particular endeavor seemed to be amelia sachs i wanted to show you something the girl held up a piece of yellowing paper containing several paragraphs of handwriting that rhyme immediately recognized as charles singletons another letter sachs asked geneva nodded she was handling the paper very carefully aunt lilly heard from that relative of ours in madison he sent us a few things he found in his basement a bookmark of charless a pair of his glasses and a dozen letters this is the one i wanted to show you with beaming eyes geneva added it was written in after he got out of prison lets see it rhyme said sachs mounted it on the scanner and a moment later the image appeared on several computer monitors around the lab sachs stepped next to rhyme put her arm around his shoulder they looked at the screen my most darling violet i trust you have been enjoying your sisters company and that joshua and elizabeth are pleased to spend time with their cousins that frederick who was only nine when i saw him last is as tall as his father is a fact i find hard to grasp all is well at our cottage i am pleased to report james and i cut ice on the shore of the river all morning and stocked the icehouse then covered the blocks in sawdust we then traveled some two miles north through substantial snow to view the orchard that is offered for sale the price is dear but i believe the seller will respond favorably to my counteroffer he was clearly in doubt about selling to a negro but when i revealed that i could pay him in greenbacks and would not need to offer a note his concerns appeared to vanish hard cash is a great equalizer were you not as moved as i to read that yesterday our country enacted a civil rights act did you see the particulars the law guarantees to everyone of any color equal enjoyment of all inns public conveyances theaters and the like what a momentous day for our cause this is the very legislation about which i corresponded with charles sumner and benjamin butler at length last year and i believe that some of my ideas made their way into this important document as you can well imagine this news gave me cause for reflection thinking back to those terrible events of seven years past being robbed of our orchard in gallows heights and jailed in pitiful conditions and yet now reflecting upon this news from washington dc as i sit before the fire in our cottage i feel that those terrible events are from a different world entirely in much the same way as those hours of bloody combat in the war or the hard years of forced servitude in virginia are forever present but somehow as removed as the muddled images from an illremembered nightmare perhaps within our hearts is a single repository for both despair and hope and filling that space with one drives out all but the most shadowy memory of the other and tonight i am filled only with hope you will recall that for years i vowed that i would do whatever i might to cast off the stigma of being regarded as a threefifths man when i consider the looks i still receive because of my color and the actions of others toward me and our people i think i am not yet regarded as completely whole but i would venture to say that we have progressed to the point where i am viewed as a ninetenths man james laughed heartily when i told him this over supper tonight and i continue to have faith that we will come to be seen as whole within our lifetimes or in joshuas and elizabeths at least now my dearest i must say goodnight to you and prepare a lesson for my students tomorrow sweet dreams to you and our children my darling i live for your return your faithful charles croton on the hudson march rhyme said it sounds like douglass and the others forgave him for the robbery or decided to believe that he didnt do it sachs asked what was that law he was talking about the civil rights act of geneva said it prohibited racial discrimination by hotels restaurants trains theaters any public place the girl shook her head it didnt last though the supreme court struck it down in the s as unconstitutional there wasnt a single piece of federal civil rights legislation enacted after that for over fifty years sachs mused i wonder if charles lived long enough to hear it was struck down he wouldntve liked that shrugging geneva replied i dont think it wouldve mattered hed think of it as just a temporary setback the hope pushing out the pain rhyme said thats word geneva said then she looked at her battered swatch ive got to get back to work that wesley goadesive gotta say the man is wack he never smiles never looks at you and come on you can trim a beard sometimes you know lying in bed that night the room dark rhyme and sachs were watching the moon a crescent so thin that by rights it should have been cold white but through some malady of atmosphere was as golden as the sun sometimes at moments like this they talked sometimes not tonight they were silent there was a slight movement on the ledge outside the window from the peregrine falcons that nested there a male and female and two fledglings occasionally a visitor to rhymes would look at the nest and ask if they had names we have a deal hed mutter they dont name me i dont name them it works a falcons head rose and looked sideways cutting through their view of the moon the birds movement and profile suggested for some reason wisdom danger too adult peregrines have no natural predators and attack their prey from above at speeds up to miles an hour but now the bird hunkered down benignly and went still the creatures were diurnal and slept at night thinking sachs asked lets go hear some music tomorrow theres a matinee or whatever you call an afternoon concert at lincoln center whos playing the beatles i think or elton john and maria callas doing duets i dont care i really just want to embarrass people by wheeling toward them my point is that it doesnt matter whos playing i want to get out that doesnt happen very often you know i know sachs leaned up and kissed him sure lets he twisted his head and touched his lips to her hair she settled down against him rhyme closed his fingers around her hand and squeezed hard she squeezed back you know what we could do sachs asked a hint of conspiracy in her voice lets sneak in some wine and lunch pâté and cheese french bread you can buy food there i remember that but the scotch is terrible and it costs a fortune what we could do is rhyme sachs sat straight up in bed gasping whats wrong he asked what did you just do im agreeing that we smuggle some food into dont play around sachs was fumbling for the light clicked it on in her black silk boxers and gray tshirt hair askew and eyes wide she looked like a college girl whod just remembered she had an exam at eight tomorrow morning rhyme squinted as he looked at the light thats awfully bright is it necessary she was staring down at the bed youryour hand you moved it i guess i did your right hand youve never had any movement in your right hand funny isnt it youve been putting off the test but youve known all along you could do that i didnt know i could until now i wasnt going to try i was afraid it wouldnt work so i was going to give up all the exercise just stop worrying about it he shrugged but i changed my mind i wanted to give it a shot but just us no machines or doctors around not by myself he added though silently and you didnt tell me she slapped him on the arm i didnt feel that they laughed its amazing rhyme she whispered and hugged him hard you did it you really did it ill try it again rhyme looked at sachs then at his hand he paused a moment then sent a burst of energy from his mind streaking through the nerves to his right hand each finger twitched a little and then as ungainly as a newborn colt his hand swiveled across a twoinch grand canyon of blanket and seated itself firmly against sachss wrist he closed his thumb and index finger around it tears in her eyes she laughed with delight how bout that he said so youll keep up with the exercises he nodded well set up the test with dr sherman she asked i suppose we could unless something else comes up been a busy time lately well set up the test she said firmly she shut the light out and lay close to him which he could sense though not feel in silence rhyme stared at the ceiling just as sachss breathing stilled he frowned aware of an odd sensation trickling through his chest where there ought to be none at first he thought it was phantom then alarmed he wondered if it was perhaps the start of an attack of dysreflexia or worse but he realized that no this was something else entirely something not rooted in nerve or muscle or organ a scientist always he analyzed the sensation empirically and noted that it was similar to what hed felt watching geneva settle face down the banks attorney similar too to when he was reading about charles singletons mission to find justice at the potters field tavern that terrible night in july so many years ago or about his passion for civil rights then suddenly rhyme understood what he was feeling it was simple pride just like hed been proud of geneva and of her ancestor he was proud of his own accomplishment by tackling his exercises and then tonight testing himself lincoln rhyme had confronted the terrifying the impossible whether hed regained any movement or not was irrelevant the sensation came from what he had undeniably achieved wholeness the same wholeness that charles had written of he realized that nothing else not politicians or fellow citizens or your haywire body could make you a threefifths man it was solely your decision to view yourself as a complete or partial person and to live your life accordingly all things considered he supposed this understanding was as inconsequential as the slight movement hed regained in his hand but that didnt matter he thought of his profession how a tiny flake of paint leads to a car that leads to a parking lot where a faint footprint leads to a doorway that reveals a fiber from a discarded coat with a fingerprint on the sleeve button the one surface that the perp forgot to wipe clean the next day a tactical team knocks on his door and justice is served a victim saved a family reunited all thanks to a minuscule bit of paint small victories thats what dr sherman had said small victoriessometimes theyre all you can hope for lincoln rhyme reflected as he felt sleep closing in but sometimes theyre all you need authors note authors are only as good as the friends and fellow professionals around them and im extremely fortunate to be surrounded by a truly wonderful ensemble will and tina anderson alex bonham louise burke robby burroughs britt carlson jane davis

schuster brigitte smith and kevin smith special thanks as always to madelyn warcholik for those readers browsing through guide books in hopes of taking a walking tour of gallows heights you can stop searching while my depiction of life in nineteenthcentury manhattan is otherwise accurate and there were indeed a number of such villages on the upper west side that ultimately were swallowed up by the citys urban sprawl gallows heights and the nefarious doings i describe there are solely creations of my imagination the eerie name served my purpose and i figured that boss tweed and his cronies
