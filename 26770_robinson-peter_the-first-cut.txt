peter robinson the first cut for sheila whitby yorkshires coast martha martha browne arrived in whitby one clear afternoon in early september convinced of her destiny all the way she had gazed out of the bus window and watched the landscape become more and more unreal on fylingdales moor the sensors of the earlywarning missileattack system rested like giant golf balls balanced at the rims of holes and all around them the heather was in full bloom it wasnt purple like the songs all said but more delicate maroon laced with pink when the moors gave way to rolling farmland like the frozen green waves of the sea it led to she understood what dylan thomas meant by fire green as grass sea and sky were a piercing blue and the town nestled in its bay a pattern of red pantile roofs flanked on either side by high cliffs everything was too vibrant and vivid to be real the scene resembled a landscape painting as distorted in its way as van goghs wheat fields and starry nights the bus lumbered down toward the harbor and pulled up in a small station off victoria square martha took another quick glance at her map and guidebook as the driver backed into the numbered bay when the doors hissed open she picked up her small holdall and followed the other passengers onto the platform arriving in a new place always made martha feel strangely excited but this time the sensation was even more intense at first she could only stand rooted to the spot among the revving buses breathing in the diesel fumes and salt sea air she felt as if she was trying the place on for size and it was a good fit she took stock of the subtle tremors her arrival caused in the essence of the town others might not notice such things but martha did everyone and everythingfrom the sand on the beach to a guilty secret in a tourists heartwas somehow connected and in a state of constant flux it was like quantum physics she thought at least insofar as she understood it her presence would send out ripples and reverberations that people wouldnt forget for a long time she still felt queasy from the journey but that would soon pass the first thing was to find somewhere to stay according to her guidebook the best accommodation was to be had in the west cliff area the term sounded odd when she knew she was on the east coast but whitby was built on a kink in the shoreline facing north and the town is divided neatly into east and west by the mouth of the river esk martha walked along the new quay road by endeavour wharf in the estuary silt glistened like entrails in the sun a rusted hulk stood by the wharfnot a fishing trawler but a small cargo boat of some kindand rough unshaven men wearing dirty tshirts and jeans ambled around on deck coiling ropes and greasing thick chains by the old swing bridge that linked the east and west sides of the town stood a blackboard with the times of high tides chalked in and it was a few minutes before four the tide should be on its way in she walked along st ann s staith sliding her hand on the white metal railing that topped the stone walls of the quay small craft lay beached on the mud some of them not much more than rowing boats with sails ropes thrummed and flimsy metal masts rattled in the light breeze and flashed in the sun across the narrow estuary the white houses seemed to be piled haphazardly beside and on top of one another at the summit of the cliff stood st marys church just as it had in one form or another since the abbot william de percy built it between and the abbey beside it had been there even longer but it had been crumbling away for over four hundred years since henry viii dissolved the monasteries and now there was nothing left but a somber ruin martha felt a thrill at actually seeing these places she had only read about and she also had a strange sense of coming home a kind of déjà vu everything seemed so damn familiar and right this was the place martha knew it but shed have plenty of time to explore east cliff later she decided turning her attention back toward where she was going the pubs seafood stalls and souvenir shops on her left gave way to amusement arcades and a dracula museum for it was here in whitby where the celebrated count was said to have landed the road veered away from the harbor wall around a series of open sheds by the quayside where the fish were auctioned before being shipped to processing plants obviously the catch hadnt come in yet as nothing was going on there at the moment martha knew she would have to come down here again and again and watch the men as they unloaded their fish into iced boxes and sold them but like everything else it could wait now she had made up her mind she felt she had plenty of time attention to detail was important and it would help overcome whatever fear and uncertainty remained within her she stopped at a stall and bought a packet of shrimp which she ate as she carried on walking they sold whelks winkles and cockles too but martha never touched them it was because of her mother she realized every time the family had visited the seasideusually westonsupermare or burnhamonseaand martha had wanted to try them her mother had told her it was vulgar to eat such things it was too she had always believed what could be more vulgar than sticking a pin in the moist opening of a tiny conchlike shell and pulling out a creature as soft and slimy as snot it wouldnt bother her now though she had changed her mother didnt know it but she had now she could probably even rip apart a lobster and suck out the meat but her mothers words still stuck in her mind the more she thought about it the more she realized that it was not so much the act itself that her mother thought vulgar but its class associations only the lower classes went around at seaside resorts sticking pins in whelks and winkles a bingo caller from one of the arcades interrupted her stream of thought all the fives fiftyfivelegs eleven number eleven the amplified voice echoed through the empty auction sheds martha passed the bandstand and took khyber pass up to west cliff at the top she walked under the enormous whales jawbone set up like an archway into another world it was a hot day and by the time she had climbed the steep hill she was sweating she ran her hand along the smooth warm weatherdarkened bone and shuddered if this was just the jaw how gigantic the creature must have been a true leviathan and as she passed under its shadow she fancied she was like jonah being vomited forth from its mouth or was she going the other way entering the whales belly she could picture the old sunday school illustrations of the bible story inside the whale had looked as vast and gloomy as a cathedral with the ribs mimicking its vaulting and there sat poor jonah all alone she imagined how his cries must have echoed in all that space but could there really be so much emptiness inside a whale wasnt it all a twisted congestion of tubing and swollen throbbing organs like it was inside people she tried to remember the story hadnt jonah attempted to escape his destiny by running off to tarshish when he was supposed to go and cry against the wickedness in nineveh then a great tempest had raged and the sailors threw him overboard he spent three days and three nights in the belly of the whale until he prayed for deliverance and the beast spewed him forth onto dry land after that he accepted his destiny and went to nineveh she couldnt remember what happened next there was something about the people there repenting and being spared which didnt please jonah much after all hed been through but martha couldnt recall the ending still it seemed remarkably apt she had struggled against her fate too at first but now she had accepted her destiny the holiness of her task she was headed for nineveh where evil thrived and no matter what there would be no mercy this time captain cooks statue looked confidently out to sea just beyond the jawbone rolledup charts under his arm cook had learned his seamanship on the whitby coal ships martha had read and the vessels he had commanded on epic voyages to the south seas had been built here where that rusted hulk lay at anchor in the lower harbor the endeavour and the resolution good names she thought royal crescent curved in an elegant semicircle facing the sea offered a number of private hotels with vacancies but the prices were too high she might have to stay a week or two and over ten pounds a night would be too much it was a shame because these hotels were probably a lot more comfortable than what she was likely to get still a room with a bath and a color television was too much to ask for and you always had to pay more if you wanted to see the sea how often did people on holiday actually sit in their rooms and admire the view martha wondered hardly at all but it was the reassurance that counted the knowledge that it was there if you wanted to look and that privilege cost money the promenade along west cliff was lined with huge victorian hotels of the kind that were built in most seaside towns when holidays at the coast came into vogue martha knew none of these were for her either so she turned down crescent avenue to find a cheap bed and breakfast place on a nondescript street as it happened abbey terrace wasnt entirely without charm it sloped steeply down to the estuary though it stopped at east terrace before it actually reached the front and boasted a row of tall guesthouses all bearing recommendations from the rac or aa many of them even had their rates posted in the window and martha chose one that cost nine pounds fifty per night wiping the sweat from her brow with the back of her hand she opened the wroughtiron gate and walked up the path kirsten come on now lets be aving yer aint yer got no omes to go to the landlord of the ring obells voiced his nightly complaint as he came over to kirstens table to collect the glasses its half past eleven theyll have my license they will pray cease and desist said damon holding up his hand like a stop sign dost thou not ken tis the end of term knowst thou not tis the end of our final year in this fair city i dont bloody care the landlord growled its time you all pissed off home to bed he snatched a halfempty glass from the table hey that was my drink sarah said i havent finished it yes you have love he stood his ground not a big man but quick and strong enough to outmaneuver a bunch of drunken students out the lot of you now come on hugo stood up wait a minute she paid for that drink and shes got every bloody right to finish it with his curly blond hair and broad shoulders he looked more like a rugby player than a student of english kirsten sighed there was going to be trouble she could sense it damon was drunk and hugo was proud and foolish enough even sober to start a fight just what she needed on her last night at university the landlord tapped his watch not at this time she hasnt not according to the licensing laws are you going to give her it back no behind him the cellarman les an exfighter with a misshapen nose and cauliflower ears stood poised for trouble well fuck you then hugo said you can have this one too and he threw the rest of his pint of guinness in the landlords face les moved forward but the landlord put out an arm to stop him we dont want any trouble lads and lasses he said in an icily calm voice youve had your fun now why dont you go and have your party somewhere else might as well hugo said kirsten tugging at his sleeve the mans right well get nothing more to drink here and theres no sense starting a fight not tonight lets go to russells party hugo sat down sulkily and frowned at his pint glass as if he regretted wasting the stout all right he said then glared at the landlord again but its not fair you pay for your drinks and that bastard just snatches them off you we ought to get our money back at least how long have we been coming here two years and this is how we get treated come on hugo damon clapped him on the shoulder and they all got up to leave twould indeed be a great pleasure to drown yon varlet in a tun of malmsey but he pushed his glasses back up the bridge of his nose and shrugged tempus fugit old mate with his short haircut and raddled boyish complexion he looked like an oldfashioned grammarschool kid he whipped his scarf dramatically around his neck and the end tipped over a glass on the table it rolled toward the edge wobbled back and forth there undecided then stopped for a moment before dropping to the floor the landlord stood by patiently arms folded and les looked ready for a fight fascist bastards sarah said picking up her handbag they beat a hasty and noisy retreat out of the pub singing johnny b goode the song that had been playing on the jukebox when the landlord unplugged it russells is it then hugo asked everyone agreed no one had any booze to take along but good old russell always put on a good spread he had plenty of money what with his father being such a whiz on the stock market probably a bit of insider trading kirsten suspected but who was she to complain and so the four of them walked out into a balmy june eveningonly damon wearing a scarf because he affected eccentricityand made their way through the deserted campus to the residence buildings there were hugo sarah kirsten and damon all of them finalyear english students the only person missing from the closeknit group was galen kirstens boyfriend just after exams his grandmother had died and hed had to rush down to kent to console his mother and help out with arrangements kirsten was feeling a little tipsy as they hurried to oastler hall and up the worn stone steps to russells rooms she missed galen and wished he could be here to celebrate tooespecially as she had got a first still shed had enough congratulations to make her thoroughly bored with the whole business already now it was time to get maudlin and say her farewells for tomorrow she was heading home if only she could keep hugos wandering hands away the party seemed to have spilled over into the corridor and adjoining rooms even if they wanted to which was unlikely russells neighbors would hardly have been able to get to sleep the newcomers pushed their way through the crowd into the smoky flat calling greetings as they went most of the lights were off in the living room where the velvet underground were singing sweet jane and couples danced with drinks in their hands russell himself leaned by the window talking to guy naburn a trendy tutor who hung around with students rather than with his colleagues and welcomed them all when they tumbled in hope youve got some booze hugo shouted over the music we just got chucked out of the ring obells russell laughed for that you deserve the best try the kitchen sure enough halffinished bottles of red wine and a couple of large casks of ale rested on the kitchen table the fridge was full of newcastle brown and carlsberg special brew except for the space taken up by liter bottles of screwtop riesling the four latecomers busied themselves pouring drinks then wandered off to mingle it was hot dim and smoky kirsten went to stand by an open window to get some air she drank cold lager from the can and watched the shadows prance and flail on the dance floor smoke curled up and drifted past her out of the window into the night she thought about the three years they had spent together and felt sad now they were all going their separate ways in the big bad world beyond universitythe real world as everyone called it what an odd bunch theyd made at the start that first term they had circled one another warily and shyly away from home for the first time all lost and alone and none of them willing to admit it damon the witty eighteenthcentury scholar sarah feminist criticism and womens fiction hugo drama and poetry herself linguistics specializing in phonology and dialects and galen modernism with a touch of marxism thrown in for good measure through tutorials department social evenings and informal parties they had made their tentative approaches and discovered kindred spirits by the end of the first year they had become inseparable together they had suffered the vicissitudes the joys and the disappointments of youth kirsten consoled sarah after her nasty affair with felix stapeley her secondyear tutor sarah fell out with damon briefly over a disagreement on the validity of a feminist approach to literature galen stood up for hugo who failed his anglosaxon exam and almost got sent down and hugo pretended to be miffed for a while when kirsten took up with galen instead of him after being close for so long their lives were so intertwined that kirsten found it hard to imagine a future without the others but she realized sadly that was surely what she had to face even though she and galen had planned to go and do postgraduate work in toronto things might not work out that way one of them might not be acceptedand then what one of the dancers stumbled backward and bumped into kirsten the lager foamed in the can and spilled over her hand the drunken dancer just shrugged and got back to business kirsten laughed and put her can on the windowsill having got the feel of the party at last she launched herself into the shadowy crowd and chatted and danced till she was hot and tired then finding that her halffull can had been used as an ashtray in her absence she got some more lager and returned to her spot by the window the rolling stones were singing jumping jack flash russell sure knew how to choose party music how you doing it was hugo shouting in her ear im all right she yelled back a bit tired thats all ill have to go soon how about a dance kirsten nodded and joined him on the floor she didnt know if she was a good dancer or not but she enjoyed herself she liked moving her body to the beat of fast music and the stones were the best of all with the stones she felt a certain earthy pagan power deep in her body and when she danced to their music she shed all her inhibitions her hips swung wildly and her arms drew abstract patterns in the air hugo danced less gracefully his movements were heavier more deliberate and limited than kirstens he tended to lumber around a bit it didnt matter to her though she hardly ever paid attention to the person she was dancing with so bound up in her own world was she the problem was some men took her wild gyrations on the dance floor as an invitation to bed which they most certainly were not the song ended and time is on my side came on a slower number hugo moved closer and put his arms around her she let him it was only dancing after all and they were close friends she rested her head on his shoulder and swayed to the music ill miss you you know hugo she said as they danced i do hope we can all still keep in touch we will hugo said turning his head so that she could hear him none of us know what the hell were going to be doing yet on the dole most likely or maybe well all come out and join you and galen in canada if we get there he held her more closely and they stopped talking the music carried them along she could feel hugos warm breath in her hair and his hand had slipped down her back to the base of her spine the floor was getting more crowded everywhere they moved they seemed to bump into another huddled couple finally the song ended and hugo guided her back toward the window as street fighting man came on when theyd both cooled down and had something to drink he leaned forward and kissed her it was so quick that she didnt have time to stop him then his arms were around her running over her shoulders and buttocks pulling her hips toward him she struggled and broke away instinctively wiping her mouth with the back of her hand hugo oh come on kirsten its our last chance while were still young who knows what might happen tomorrow kirsten laughed and punched him on the shoulder she couldnt stay angry with him dont pull that gather ye rosebuds stuff with me hugo lassiter ill say this for you you dont give up trying do you hugo grinned but its still no kirsten said i like you you know that but only as a friend ive got too many friends hugo complained what i want is to get laid kirsten gestured around the room well im sure youve got a good chance if theres anyone here you havent slept with already thats not fair i know ive got a reputation but its completely unfounded is it how disappointing and here was me thinking you were such an expert you could find out for yourself you know he said moving closer again if you play your cards right kirsten laughed and wriggled out of his grasp no anyway im off home now ive got to be up early to pack in the morning especially if im to have time for lunch ill walk you no you wont its not far but its late its dangerous to walk out by yourself so late ive done it hundreds of times you know i have no thanks you stay here i dont want to end up fighting you off out there id rather take my chances hugo sighed and tomorrow we part perhaps forever you dont know what youre missing nor do you she said but im sure youll soon forget all about it remember tomorrow for lunch in the green dragon remind sarah and damon too one oclock thats right kirsten pecked him on the cheek and skipped out into the warm night martha the room was perfect usually a single room in a bed and breakfast establishment is nothing more than a cupboard by the toilets but this one clearly a converted attic with a dormer window and whitepainted rafters had been done out nicely candystriped wallpaper brightened the walls and a salmonpink candlewick bedspread covered the threequarter bed just to the left of the window stood the washstand with clean white towels laid neatly over a chrome rail the only other furniture consisted of a small wardrobe with metal hangers that jangled together when martha opened the flimsy door and a bedside lamp on a small chest of drawers the owner leaned against the doorjamb with his arms folded while she made up her mind he was a coarse man with hairy forearms and even more hair sticking out over the top of his white opennecked shirt his face looked like it was made of pink vinyl and six or seven long fair hairs curled on his chin we dont get many girls staying by themselves he said smiling at her with lashless blue eyes it was obviously an invitation to state her business yes well im here to do some research martha lied im working on a book a book eh romance is it i suppose youll find plenty of background for that here what with the abbey ruins and the dracula legends plenty of romance in all that history id say its not a romance martha said he didnt pursue the matter further but looked at her with a fixed expression a mixture of superior mocking humor and disbelief that she had often seen men use on professional women ill take it she said mostly to get rid of him as quickly as possible she didnt like the way he leaned against the doorway arms folded watching her was he hoping shed start taking out her underwear to put in the drawers the room began to feel claustrophobic he stood up straight right well heres the keys that big one theres for the front door come in any time you want but try not to disturb the other guests theres a lounge with a color telly on the ground floor you can make yourself a cup of tea or instant coffee there too if you like but be sure to wash out your cup afterward the wife has enough on breakfasts at eight thirty sharp if you want an evening meal let the wife know in the morning before you go out anything else not that i can think of he closed the door behind him as he left martha dumped her holdall on the bed and stretched the sloping ceiling was so low at that point that her fingers touched the plaster between the beams she poked her head out of the window to see what kind of view you got for nine pounds fifty a night not bad on her right very close at the top of the street loomed st hildas church with its high dark tower like one of the monoliths from to her left on the opposite hillside over the estuary stood st marys built of lighter stone with a smaller squarish tower and a white pole sticking up from it like the mast of a ship beside it stood what was left of the abbey where according to her guidebook the synod of whitby took place in ad when the churches in england dumped their celtic ways and decided to follow roman usages the poet caedmon had lived there at the time too and that was more interesting to martha after all caedmon was the one who had called her here she unpacked her toilet bag and went over to the sink to brush her teeth the shrimp had left fibers between them and a salty taste in her mouth as she spat out the water she glimpsed her face in the mirror it was the only part of her that hadnt changed much over the past year or so she wore her sandy hair cut short more for convenience than anything else as she never had any reason to do herself up to look nice for anyone it was far easier just to be able to wash it and forget about it she didnt have to wear any makeup either and that made for less fuss her complexion had always been clear anyway and the smattering of freckles across her nose was hardly a blemish her eyes were a little orientalslanted almonds and about the same light brown color her nose tilted up slightly at the endsnub they called itand revealed the dark ovals of her nostrils she had always thought it was her ugliest feature but someone had once told her it was sexy sexy now there was a laugh she had her mothers mouth tight thinlipped downturned at the edges all in all she thought she looked haughty stiff and aloofprissy in factbut she knew well enough that her appearance had diverse effects on men not so long ago she had overheard a conversation in a pub between two lads who had been giving her the eye all evening now theres a bird looks like she needs a bloody good fuck the first one had said rubbish his mate had replied ill bet shes had enough cock to pave the road from here to lands end ends up and they had laughed at that so much for her looks perhaps men just saw in her what they wanted to see they used her as a mirror to reflect their own vile natures or as a screen onto which they projected their obscene fantasies she put her toothbrush in the chrome holder on the wall and turned away from the mirror it was early evening now the tide would be on its way in she had enough money with her to survive away from home for far longer than she needed to and though she was almost certain that this was the place where she would find what she was looking for she knew there was always a chance she could be wrong it might be one of the smaller fishing villages along the coast staithes runswick bay or robin hoods bay no matter she would check them all out if she had to for now whitby felt right enough she was tired after her long journey maybe later around sunset she would go out and explore the town and find something to eat but for now a nap was her best bet first though she took what clothes shed brought with her out of the holdall and put them in the drawers by the bed there wasnt much all of it casual jeans cords denim shirts a jersey underwear the gray quilted jacket in case of chilly evenings she hung in the wardrobe finally she took out the most important thing shed brought and smiled to herself at how it seemed to have become a ritual object a talisman and how simply handling it gave her a sense of awe and reverence it was a small globeshaped glass paperweight flattened at the bottom smooth and heavy on her palm ten pounds shed paid for it at the craft center for ages there she had stood in the heat of the kilns and watched the man making the glassware he sold explaining the process as he went along he thrust the long blowpipe into the whitehot heart of the furnace and brought out a blob of molten glass then he dipped this in the dishes of bright colors vermilion aquamarine saffron indigo martha had always thought you were supposed to keep blowing down the tube but he had simply blown into it quickly and then covered the end with his hand when the air heated it expanded and puffed out the glass she never did find out how he got the colors inside the paperweight though or how he made it so heavy and solid this one was all dark shades of red carmine crimson and scarlet the folds and curves they made looked like a rose when martha turned it in the light the rose seemed to move slowly as if under water if ever she felt herself slipping away from her mission denying her destiny she knew that all she had to do was reach for it and the smooth hard glass would strengthen her resolve she placed it beside her on the bedspread and lay down the rose seemed to open and pulse in the changing light as she stared into it soon she was sleeping soundly beside it kirsten kirsten lingered on the pavement outside oastler hall and took a deep breath she could still hear the musicled zeppelins stairway to heavenabove the muffled talk and laughter behind her taking stock of herself she found that she didnt feel any more tipsy than she had earlierless so if anything at the party she had drunk only about a can and a half of lager and the dancing seemed to have driven much of the alcohol out of her system she must have sweated it out she supposed considering the way her blouse was sticking to her the night was warm and muggy there was no breeze to speak of just an occasional breath of warm air such as one feels on opening an oven everything was still and quiet kirsten headed for the park she had crossed it plenty of times before day and night and never had any cause to worry about the journey the worst that ever happened was that the gang of skinheads who hung out there early in the evening might hurl an insult or two at passing students but the skins would all be tucked up safely in bed at this time of night most of the houses in the area were old and far too large for one family these days so they had been bought by landlords and divided into flats and bedsits for the students it was a comfortable neighborhood kirsten thought no matter what time of day or night if you had a problem or just wanted a cup of tea and a chat there was always likely to be someone you knew burning the midnight oil not much more than five or ten minutes walk away like a village within the city really even now soft inviting lights burned behind many of the windows she would miss it all very much this was the place where she had grown up lost her virginity changed from a shy awkward teenager into a wiser more confident woman the park was a large square bordered on all sides by welllit roads treelined avenues crisscrossed the cropped grass in the daytime students would lie out in the sun reading or playing makeshift games of cricket or football up near the main road were the public toiletssaid to be a favorite haunt of local homosexualsand colorful flower beds at the center of the park thick shrubbery grew around the bowling green and the childrens playground at night the place felt a little spookier perhaps because there was no lighting in the park itself but you could always see the tall amber streetlights on the roads and the sound of nearby traffic was comforting kirstens trainers made no sound on the tarmac as she followed the path under the dark trees there was very little traffic about the only thing she could hear was the odd car revving up in the distance and the sound of her shoulder bag brushing against her hips somewhere a dog barked the sky was clear and the stars magnified by the haze looked fatter and softer than usual how different from winter stars kirsten thought all cold and sharp and merciless these ones looked like they were melting she looked up and turned her head in all directions but couldnt find a moon it had to be there somewhereperhaps behind the trees yes she would miss it all but canada would be exciting especially if galen came too as he intended neither of them had ever crossed the atlantic before if they could save enough money they would take a few months after completing their courses and travel the continent together montreal new york boston washington miami los angeles san francisco vancouver even the names sent shivers of excitement up kirstens spine three years ago she could never have imagined doing such a thing university hadnt only given her a firstclass education it had given her freedom and independence too soon she got to the center of the park near the bowling green the whole tract of land was slightly convex and this was the highest part she could see lights in all directions defining the valleys and hillsides upon which the city was built because of the warm moist air the faroff streetlights all had haloes just off the path stood a statue of a lion with a serpent coiled around it kirsten had noticed the other day that some idiotperhaps the skinheadshad spraypainted its head blue and scrawled filthy graffiti in red all over its body that didnt matter in the dark though and she decided to give in to an impulse she had often felt swishing over the grass she went up to the statue and ran her hand over the still warm stone then with sudden resolve she jumped astride it the lion was small enough that her feet easily touched the ground down the path she could see through the trees to the lights on the main road and the turning into her own street only a few hundred yards away to think she had been here all this time and had always wanted to sit on the lion but hadnt done so until now her last night she must have passed it at least a thousand times she felt silly but at the same time she was enjoying herself tremendously at least nobody was watching she gripped the smooth mane and pretended she was riding through the jungle in her mind she could hear screeching cockatoos chattering monkeys humming and clicking insects and snakes slithering through the undergrowth she raised her head to look for the moon again but before she could find it she noticed a strange smell and a split second later felt a rough hand cover her mouth and nose martha the tide was in when martha walked back under the whales jawbone to pier road and the small fishing boats bobbed at their moorings in the harbor the sun was going down behind west cliff and at the top of the hill opposite st marys church shone warm gold in the last rays there was still nothing happening in the auction sheds but some of the locals seemed to be pottering around on their own small boats martha leaned against the railing on st ann s staith and watched two men in navyblue jerseys washing the deck of a red sailboat she had brought her quilted jacket with her but the air was still so warm that she carried it slung over her shoulder as night came in the fishy smell of the place seemed to grow stronger something about the air made her crave a cigarette she had never smoked before the past year but now she didnt care one way or another whatever she felt like she would do and damn the consequences she went into a small gift shop near the dracula museum and bought ten rothmans that would do for a while at least then she went back to the railing and lit a cigarette one of the men down in the boat glanced up at her admiringly from time to time but he didnt call out or whistle she was waiting for them to speak finally one said something technical to the other who replied in equally incomprehensible jargon and martha moved on she was hungry she realized dropping the cigarette and grinding it out with the ball of her foot on the stone quay down by the bridge she saw people ambling along eating from cardboard cartons of fish and chips she hadnt noticed any other kind of food available so far the place was hardly crammed with french italian or indian restaurants and she hadnt even seen a mcdonalds or a pizza hut yet clearly it was a fishandchipsornothing kind of town at the first fish bar she found she bought haddock and chips and wandered around by the bus station as she ate the fish was fried in batter of course and had a kind of oily taste because the skin had been left on it was good though and martha licked her fingers when shed finished then carefully dumped the carton in a litter bin it was almost dark now she stood on the bridge for a while smoking another cigarette to take away the greasy taste in the lower harbor the rusted hulk she had seen earlier was still at dock on the north side of the bridge where the estuary widened toward the sea strings of red and yellow quayside lights reflected in the dark water twisting and bending as it lapped like peoples reflections in funfair mirrors on its cliff top st marys stood floodlit against the dark violet sky martha walked over the bridge to church street in the oldest section of town just below east cliff stopping to buy a newspaper on her way just before the shop closed it was that quiet time after dinner and before bed places like whitby shut down early martha was thirsty but already the monks haven café was shut there was nowhere you could just drop in for a cup of tea or coffee she also needed to sit down and think for a while the black horse pub across the street looked inviting enough martha went in antique brass fixtures attached to the walls shed real gaslight on the small wainscoted room the lounge was cozy with narrow pewlike wooden benches and scored oblong tables it was also quiet martha bought a half of bitter and found a free corner a few years ago she would never have thought of even entering a pub by herself let alone sitting in one but this place felt safe enough the few people who were there seemed to know each other and were already involved in conversation there were no lone wolves on the lookout for female flesh it clearly wasnt a pickup joint she glanced quickly through the copy of the independent shed bought finding nothing of interest she folded the paper and put it aside what she really had to do she thought was work out some kind of plan nothing too detailed or elaborate because she had recently learned that serendipity and intuition played a greater part in events than anyone imagined and she had to remember that she wasnt alone in her task she had spirits to guide her nonetheless she couldnt just wander the place aimlessly for days right now it was all right she was finding her way around becoming familiar with the environment there were certain spots she needed to know about sheltered places isolated paths the shadows of the town but she needed a plan of action taking out a small notebook and her guidebook she set to work first of all she scanned the map and made a note of places that looked like they were worth exploring the beach area st marys graveyard the abbey grounds a long cliff walk toward robin hoods bay then she turned her mind to a more serious problem where could she find someone who actually lived and worked in whitby where would he be likely to live for example so far she had seen no one but holidaymakers and those residents who ran guesthouses pubs and shops nobody else actually seemed to live around the harbor area where the men worked on their boats she flipped back to her map to see how far the town spread it was small with a population of about thirteen thousand and east cliff didnt seem to extend much at all beyond st marys that left the southern area further inland along the esk estuary and west cliff itself up there according to her map housing estates seemed to stretch almost as far as sandsend and then there were smaller places nearby like sandsend itself and robin hoods bay they werent exactly suburbs but it was possible that some people lived there and commuted to and from whitby at one time she might have felt as if she was looking for a needle in a haystack after all she had so little to go on but she trusted her instincts now there could be no doubt about it she would know when she had found the one she was looking for her spirits would help guide her toward him and whitby felt like the right place she could sense his nearness martha sipped her beer somebody put an old rockandroll song on the jukebox and it reminded her of something a long time ago another evening listening to old songs on a jukebox she shut it out memories and sentiment were luxuries she couldnt afford these days she stuck her hand in her holdall and felt for the smooth hard sphere kirsten a long oily blackness punctuated by quick vivid dreams a figure hunched over her dark and hooded and a blade flashed it seemed to slice at her skin long cuts flapped open and blood welled but there was no pain she saw as if from a great distance the sharp steel pierce the pale flesh of her thigh it went in deep and when it slid out blood oozed around the edges of the gash but she felt nothing at all then the darkness came again this time it was a figure all in white a human shape with no face the same things happened the knife was different but it cut just like the other and again there was no sensation they were all just dreams she couldnt possibly see these things could she her eyes were closed and if they had really happened then she would have screamed out in agony from the pain wouldnt she martha a loud shrieking woke martha at four oclock in the morning she turned over in bed and frowned as she looked at the luminous dial of her watch the row went on it sounded very close finally she realized it was the seagulls they must have found a shoal of fish or perhaps a cat had spilled the dustbin at the back of one of the fish bars and they had zoomed in on that it was a terrible noise the sound of raw hunger and greed she pictured the gulls ripping dead fish apart blank white faces speckled with blood she sighed and turned over again pulling the sheets up around her ears the gulls had woken her from a dream maybe she could get back to it all her dreams were good these daystechnicolor jaunts of indescribable beauty full of ecstasy and excitement visits to alien worlds flying easily through space and time they hadnt always been like that for a long time she had suffered from terrifying nightmares dreams of blood and shadows and then for a while she hadnt seemed to dream at all the good dreams only started when the dark cloud in her mind disappeared at least she had always thought of it as a cloud or perhaps a bubble it was opaque and whichever way she looked at it it always deflected the light so that she couldnt see inside she knew it was filled with all her agony and anger yet it refused her entry for so long she had walked around on the edge because of that cloud inside her always on the verge of violence despair or madness but then one day when she found the right perspective she saw inside and the darkness dispersed like a monster that vanishes when you discover its true name the seagulls were still wailing over their early breakfast when martha drifted off to sleep again and dreamed about her secret lake its waters flowed from the fountain of youth clear and sparkling in the sun that never stopped shining and she had to swim through narrow coral caverns to get to it only she knew about the lake only she could swim so effortlessly so far without the need for breath and as she swam the sharp pinkish coral cut thin red lines across her breasts stomach and thighs kirsten the first thing kirsten saw when she opened her eyes was a long curving crack in the white ceiling it looked like an island coastline or the crude outline of a whale her mouth was dry and tasted bad with difficulty she swallowed but the vile taste wouldnt go away around her she could hear only quiet sounds a steady hissing a highpitched rhythmic bleeping she couldnt smell anything at all she moved her head and glimpsed shadowy figures sitting beside her bed it was difficult to focus from so close and she couldnt make out who they were then she became aware of muffled voices look shes coming roundshes opened her eyes carefuldont touch hershell wake up in her own time and someone bent over her a faceless figure all in white kirsten tried to scream but no sound came out gentle hands touched her brow and pushed her shoulders firmly back onto the hard bed she let her head fall on the pillow again and sighed the voices were clearer now like a finely tuned radio is she all right can we stay and talk to her shell talk if she wants to dont push her shes bound to be feeling disoriented kirsten tried to speak but her mouth was still too dry she croaked water and someone seemed to understand an angled straw neared her mouth and she sucked greedily on it some of the water dribbled down the edges of her dry cracked lips but she managed to swallow a little that felt better i must go and fetch the doctor the door opened and hissed shut slowly kirstie kirstie love she turned her head and found it easier to focus this time her mother and father sat beside her she tried to smile but it felt like it came out all crooked her teeth felt too big for her mouth her mother looked beside herself as if she hadnt slept for days and her father had dark heavy bags under his eyes he looked down on her with a mixture of love and relief hello daddy she said he reached out and she felt his soft hand close on hers just like when they used to go for walks in the woods when she was a child oh kirstie her mother said taking out a handkerchief from her handbag and dabbing her eyes we were so worried her father still said nothing his touch told kirsten all she needed to know what about where dont try to speak her father said softly its all right its all over now everythings going to be all right her mother was still patting away at her eyes and making little snuffling noises kirsten rolled her head back again and stared at the scar on the ceiling she licked her dry lips sensation was returning to her bit by bit now she could catch the clean white antiseptic smell of the hospital room she could also feel her body her skin felt taut stretched too tightly over her flesh and bones in places it pinched at her as if it had snagged on something and puckered but worse than that was the burning ache in her breasts and in her loins she had no sensation of the tight flesh there just of a painful throbbing absence the door opened and a whitecoated man walked over to her she flinched and tried to roll away its all right she heard someone say the doctors here to take care of you then she felt her sleeve pulled up and a cool swab touched her arm she didnt feel the needle going in but it made a sharp prick when it slid out the pain began to recede warm soothing waves came to carry it far out to sea her senses ebbed and the long darkness advanced to reclaim her as she slipped away she could still feel her fathers hand in hers she turned her head slowly and asked whats happened to me daddy my skin feels funny it doesnt fit right martha when martha got downstairs for breakfast the next morning the other guests were already seated only one small table set for two remained beyond the bay window the sun was shining on abbey terrace and the sky was blue again by the door stood a helpyourself trolley jugs of orange and grapefruit juice milk and miniature packets of corn flakes special k rice krispies alpen and frosties martha took some alpen poured herself a glass of juice and sat down she helped herself to a cup of tea from the stainlesssteel pot on the table judging by its color the tea had been stewing too long she looked at the place opposite her and hoped that no one would join her for breakfast never very cheerful first thing in the morning she had just about managed to nod and say hello to the others conversation would be out of the question as she sipped the bitter tea she cast her eyes around the room in the bay window sat an old couple the mans dark brown hair was swept straight back from his wrinkled forehead and plastered down with brylcreem he had smiled when she came in showing a set of stained and crooked teeth his grayish face had the lined and hollow look of a fiftyaday man and his breath came in short emphysematic gasps confirming the diagnosis his wife hadnt smiled she had simply stared at martha with suspicious beady eyes as if to say i know your type young lady bluegray hair hovered around her moonshaped head like mist by the opposite wall sat a young couple probably on their honeymoon martha guessed they both looked very serious the man was thin swarthy bearded and precise in his teapouring the womans face as she sat bowed forward was almost completely hidden by a cascade of glossy black hair when she looked up at him a shy secret smile lit her eyes they hadnt even noticed martha come in most of the noise came from the third table near the serveyourself trolley where a tiredlooking young woman and an equally exhausted man both struggled to put on a brave face as they tried to control two finicky youngsters the children looked like twins same blond coloring same whiny voices i dont like shreddies daddy why arent there any sugar puffs i want sugar puffs have some frosties the pale mother said trying to placate them but to no avail she glanced up and smiled weakly at the others the father dressed for a day on the beach in white slacks and a pale blue sports shirt showing the curly ginger hairs on his forearms looked over and gave martha a whatcan youdowiththem shrug the owners wife came in to take their orders not that there was much choice you could have your eggs soft or hard your bacon medium or crispy there was a determined set to the womans mouth and she moved about her business with a brusque nononsense certainty all the while managing to smile and respond to small talk about the weather perhaps if anyone wore the pants around here martha thought it was the wife her husband probably had a day job and only happened to be around because martha had arrived late in the afternoon perhaps he was even a fisherman if she could get a chance to chat casually with him she might be able to find out something about how the local operation worked just after she had given her order for crispy bacon and mediumpoached eggs the final guest came down ordered and helped himself to cereal and juice which he brought over to marthas table and plonked down opposite her he was tall and athleticlooking probably a jogger with a deep suntan thin face aquiline nose and lively blue eyes his short curly black hair still glistened from the shower he smelled of old spice aftershave he poured some tea and grinned broadly showing a perfect set of dazzling teeth the kind one rarely sees in english mouths my god martha thought a morning person probably been for a run around the town before breakfast she managed to muster a tiny brief smile then looked away again to see how the couple were coping with the two kids sleep well pardon the young man leaned forward again and lowered his voice i said did you sleep well fine thank you i didnt oh just put me right next to the bathroom didnt they six oclock the blooming parade startsone after the otherand they all have to flush the loo i think the pipes run right through my bed talk about clatter and bang keiths the name by the way he stuck out his hand and smiled keith mclaren his accent was australian certainly martha thought but as she had specialized only in regional british accents she couldnt pin it down to any specific area martha took his hand reluctantly and gave it a quick limp shake martha browne and before you ask yes im an aussie im just taking a little time off from university to travel this lovely country of yours youre a student yes masters degree in surfing and sunbathing at bondi beach university he laughed not true wish it were im studying law not half as interesting im making my way up the coast to scotland got some family there martha nodded politely seagulls too keith said apropos of nothing as far as martha could make out what bloody seagulls kept me awake too didnt you hear them seagulls you say the owners wife arrived at their table and set down two plates which she held with worn oven gloves mind theyre hot seagulls eh you get used to them if you live here have to they never wake you up keith asked her never not after the first couple of months fraid i wont be here that long he looked at martha again moving on tomorrow traveling by local buses whenever i can walking or hitching if i cant well good luck to you the woman said and moved on keith stared at his plate and prodded a dark medallion of reddish black stuff with his fork whats that he asked turning up his nose and leaning forward to whisper whatever it is i dont remember asking for it martha examined the contents of his plate they were the same as hers bacon egg grilled tomato and mushrooms fried bread and the thing that keith was pointing to black pudding i think she said must be todays special whats it made of you dont want to know not at this time in the morning keith laughed and tucked in well it sure tastes all right thats what i like about staying at these places they always give you a breakfast that sets you up for the entire day i wont need much more than a sandwich till the evening meal are you eating here not in the evenings no oh you should i usually come back well i say usually but this is only my third day they do a decent spread good value too when he went back to his food he stopped talking and left martha in peace she ate quickly hoping to get away before he started up again even though she knew a rushed meal would give her indigestion across the room one of the children flicked a slice of tomato at the wall with his spoon it splattered on the faded rosepatterned paper and slithered down leaving a pink trail behind his father reddened and took the spoon from him angrily and his mother looked as if she were about to die from embarrassment martha pushed her chair back and stood up to leave excuse me she said to keith must be off lots to do arent you going to finish your cup of tea keith asked ive had two already anyway its stewed and she hurried upstairs to her room there she locked the door opened the window and enjoyed a cigarette as she leaned on the sill and looked at the small white clouds over st marys after shed finished the rothmans and paid a visit to the toilet she picked up her holdall and set off down the stairs again at the firstfloor landing she bumped into keith coming out of his room just my luck she thought want to show me around he asked what with both of us being alone herewell it seems a shame im sure you know more about the place than i do ive just arrived and youve been here three days already yes but youre a native im just a poor ignorant foreigner im sorry martha said but ive got work to do oh what would that be then research im working on a book they were walking down the last flight of carpeted stairs to the hallway martha couldnt just break away from him she wanted to see which way he turned in the street so that she could walk the other way well maybe we can have a drink this evening after youve finished work and ive worn out my poor feet im sorry i dont know what time ill be finished oh come on say seven oclock all right you know what they say all work and no playtheres a nice quiet little pub just on the corner at the end of the street the lucky fisherman i think its called is it a date im away tomorrow anyway so youll only have to put up with me the once martha thought quickly they had passed the door now and were already walking down the front steps to the path if she said no it would look very odd indeed and the last thing she wanted was to appear conspicuous in any way it was bad enough being a woman by herself here if she acted strangely then this keith might just have cause to remember her as some kind of oddball and that wouldnt do at all on the other hand if she did agree to have a drink with him he would no doubt ask her all kinds of questions about her life still she thought there was no reason why she couldnt tell him a pack of lies that should be easy enough for a woman with her imagination all right she said as they reached the gate seven oclock in the lucky fisherman keith smiled great see you then have a good day he turned left and martha turned right kirsten when kirsten drifted out of the comforting darkness for the second time she noticed the vases of red and yellow flowers and the cards standing on her bedside table then she turned her head and saw a stranger sitting at the other side of the bed she gripped the sheets around her throat and looked around the rest of the room the whitesmocked nurse still hovered in the backgroundthat at least was reassuringand sitting against the wall by the door was a man in a light gray suit with a notebook on his lap and a pencil poised ready to write kirsten couldnt focus all that clearly on him but he looked too young to be as bald as he seemed the man beside her leaned forward and rested his chin on his fists he was about her fathers ageearly fiftieswith short spiky gray hair and a red complexion his eyes were brown and a tiny wen grew between his right eye and his nose wedged between his left nostril and his upper lip was a dark mole with a couple of hairs sprouting from it he wore a navyblue suit white shirt and a blackandamberstriped tie his expression was kindly and concerned how are you feeling kirsten he asked do you feel like talking a bit groggy she replied can you tell me whats happened to me nobodys told me anything you were attacked youve been hurt but youre going to be all right who are you are you a doctor im detective superintendent elswick the bright young lad over by the door there is detective sergeant haywood were here to see if you can tell us anything that might help us catch whoever did this kirsten shook her head its all darkii cant stay calm elswick said softly dont struggle with it just relax and let me ask the questions if you dont know the answers shake your head or say no dont get worked up about it all right kirsten swallowed ill try good you were at a party the night it happened do you remember that yes vaguely there was music dancing it was the end of term bash thats right now as far as we can gather you left alone at about one oclock am i right ii think so i dont remember the time i did go out by myself though it was a lovely warm night kirsten remembered standing by the door of oastler hall and breathing in the honeyed air and then you walked through the park yes its a shortcut ive done it lots of times nothing ever relax kirsten we know nobodys blaming you dont get upset about it now did you notice anyone else around at all no it was quiet there was no one did you hear anything only the cars on the road nobody left the party and followed you i didnt see anyone were you aware at any time of someone following you no i suppose i might have run if i had been but no what about earlier in the evening as i understand it you were at a pub with some friends the ring obells is that right kirsten nodded did you notice anyone taking an unusual interest in you anyone who seemed to be watching you closely no any strangers there ii dont remember it was busy earlier but there was some trouble wasnt there could you tell me about it kirsten told him what she could remember about the incident with the landlord it seemed so silly now she felt embarrassed to think of it so you and your friends were the last to leave yes and you didnt see anyone hanging around outside no what about the attack itself do you remember anything about how it happened kirsten closed her eyes and confronted only darkness it was as if a black cloud had formed somewhere in her mind and inside it was trapped everything that this man wanted to know the rest of hermemories feelings sensationscould only circle the thick darkness helplessly it was a chunk of her life a package of pain and terror that had been wrapped up and hidden away in the dark she didnt know if she could penetrate it or if she wanted to inside she sensed lived horrors too monstrous to confront i was looking for the moon she said what i sat on the lionyou know that statue in the middle of the parkand i threw my head back i was looking for the moon i know it sounds silly i wasnt drunk or anything its just that it was my last night and id always wanted toto justsit thats all i can remember what happened when what do you mean you were sitting on the lion looking for the moon what happened next superintendent elswicks voice was soft and hypnotic it was making kirsten feel sleepy again now that she had come round fully she could feel her aching body with its tight skin and she wanted to sail out on the tide again and leave it behind a hand she said thats all i remember a hand came from behind over my nose and mouth i couldnt breathe and then it all went black you didnt see anyone no im sorryithere was something yes kirsten frowned and shook her head its no good i cant remember dont worry about it kirsten just take it slowly you cant remember anything at all about the person who attacked you no matter how insignificant it might seem no only the hand what was the hand like was it big or small iiits hard to say it covered my nose and mouthit was strong and rough rough in what way like someone whos done a lot of hard work i suppose you know lifting things i dont know ive never felt a hand that rough before we had a gardener once and his hands looked like this one felt i never touched them but they looked rough and callused from doing manual work this gardener elswick said whats his name it was a long time ago i was just a little girl do you remember his name kirsten i think it was walberton my daddy called him mal short for malcolm i suppose but i dont see why at this point kirsten we know nothing we need everything we can get everything no matter how absurd it seems is the gardener still around no not anymore daddy knows hell tell you all right is there anything else i dont think so i cant remember what happened after the hand grabbed me how long have i been here ten days thats why we have to act as quickly as we can the more time goes by the harder it is to pick up a trail can you think of anyone who might have wanted to harm you any enemies an angry boyfriend perhaps ten days it was hard to believe what had she been doing here for ten days just sleeping and dreaming she shook her head no theres only galen theres no one whod do something like this i dont understand it i never did any harm to anyone in my life tears began to trickle from the corners of her eyes into the fine hair above her ears im tired i hurt she felt herself fading again and didnt want to stop thats all right elswick said youve been very helpful well go now and let you get some rest he stood up and patted her arm then nodded to sergeant haywood that it was time to go ill come back and see you again soon kirsten when youre feeling better your mother and father are still here waiting outside do you want to see them later kirsten said wait wheres galen have you seen galen your boyfriend yes elswick said he was here he said hed come back he left those flowers he pointed to a vase of red roses when elswick and haywood left the nurse came over to straighten the bed just as the door was closing kirsten could hear elswick saying better keep a man here twentyfour hours a daymight come back to finish what he started before the nurse could move away kirsten grabbed her wrist whats happened to me she whispered my skin feels tight and twisted somethings wrong the nurse smiled thatll be the stitches dearie they do pull a bit sometimes she ruffled the pillow and hurried out stitches kirsten had had stitches before when she fell off her bicycle and cut her arm on some broken glass it was true they did pull but those stitches had been put in her arm she had felt only very minor localized pain if stitches were the cause of her discomfort this time then why did her whole body feel as if it had been sewn tightly and ineptly around its frame she could have a look of course ease down the covers and open her nightdress surely nothing could be simpler but the effort was too much for her she could manage the movements all right but what really stopped her was fear fear of what she might find instead she welcomed oblivion martha there were no names on the gravestones martha stood in the clifftop cemetery by st marys and stared in horror most of the stones were blackened around their edges and where the chiseled details should have been there was just pitted sandstone on some of them she could see faint traces of lettering but many were completely blank it must be the salt wind she thought come from the sea and stolen their names away it made her feel suddenly and inexplicably sad she looked down at the ruffled blue water and the thin line of foam as waves broke along the beach it didnt seem fair the dead should be remembered as she remembered them shivering despite the heat she wandered over to the church itself it was an impressive place inside she skipped the taped lecture and instead picked up a printed guide and wandered around at the front stood a huge threetier pulpit and below it stretched a honeycomb of rectangular box pews said to resemble the tweendecks of a wooden battleship some of the boxes had engraved brass nameplates screwed to their doors marking them out as reserved for notable local families most of these were at the back where the minister would have a hard time seeing for all the fluted pillars in the way the rich could sleep with impunity through his sermons but at the front right under his eyes some boxes were marked free and others for strangers only thats me martha thought opening the catch on one and stepping inside a stranger only when the latch clicked behind her the small enclosure gave her an odd sense of isolation and sanctuary within the busy church all around her tourists walked and cameras flashed but the box seemed to muffle and distance the outside world a fanciful idea to be sure but it was what she felt she ran her finger along the worn green baize that lined the sides of the box and the pew bench itself there was even a red carpet and patterned cushions to kneel on marthas knees cracked as she knelt now she was even further away from the world outside it would make a good place to hide if things should ever come to that she thought nobody would be able to find her in a box pew marked for strangers only it was just like being invisible she smiled and let herself out through the car park by the abbey ruin was a footpath part of the cleveland way according to marthas map it would take her all the way from east cliff to robin hoods bay for the moment she decided to explore just a short stretch of it as she walked she kept her eyes open for keith mclaren just as she had done while touring the cemetery and church she already had a good idea of the story she would tell him that evening and if he did happen to see her walking around st marys and the cliff top then her lies would gain even more credibility she didnt want to run into him by accident though a narrow boardwalk ran right along the edge of the high cliffs in places some of the crossboards were missing and erosion had eaten away the land right up to the path itself there was a fence between the walk and the sheer drop but even that was down here and there and signs warned people to tread carefully and to walk in single file it was dizzying to look down on the sea swirling around the sharp rocks way below when she got to saltwick nab a long knobbly finger of rock jutting out into the sea martha noticed ramshackle wooden stairs and a path leading down slowly she made her way to the pinkish red rock it started near the base of the cliff as a big hump then dropped so that it was hardly visible above the water for a short distance and finally rose to another knobrather like a submerged camel with a long way between humps she thoughtfurther out to sea there was nobody else around so martha sat down on the sparse grass for a rest in the distance between the humps a white tanker was slowly making its way across the horizon waves caught the low section of the nab sideways on and spray cascaded over it in a shower of white martha lit her second cigarette of the day it tasted different out in the fresh salt air she crossed her legs and contemplated the rhythms of the sea as it swelled and slapped against the rock soon she could see the waves coming and predict how hard they would break she had got the feel of the place now so much so that she felt quite at home there were no problems as far as she could seeexcept perhaps for the australian but even he seemed naïve and harmless enough she could string him along over a couple of drinks and tomorrow hed be gone all she had to do now was find the one she was looking for it might take a day or two but she would succeed he was close of that there could be no doubt again she felt a shiver of fear and her confidence wavered when the time came she would have to summon up the nerve and do what had to be done she slipped her hand into the holdall and felt for her talisman that would help her of coursethat and her guiding spirits after a while she flicked her cigarette into the sea and stood up fear is for the passive she told herself when you act you dont have time to feel afraid she brushed the grass and sand from her jeans and headed back toward the footpath kirsten the nurse popped her head around the door a visitor for you dearie beyond her kirsten could make out the shoulder of the uniformed policeman sitting outside her room then the door opened all the way and sarah walked in sarah what are you doing here some welcome actually it wasnt easy first i had to get permission from that bloody detective superintendent and as if that wasnt enough i had to get past dixon of dock green out there she jerked her thumb toward the door then pulled up a chair and sat beside the bed for a long moment she just looked at kirsten then she started to cry she leaned forward and the two of them hugged as best they could without dislodging the intravenous drip come on kirsten said finally patting her back youre hurting my stitches sarah moved away and managed a smile sorry love i dont know what came over me when i think of everything you must have been through dont kirsten said the way she felt she needed sarah to be her usual self outrageous downtoearth solid funny angry she was sick of sympathy even less did she want empathy its no wonder you had a hard time getting in dressed like that she hurried on sarah wore her usual uniform of jeans and a tshirt this one bore a logo scrawled boldly across the front a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle they probably think youre a terrorist sarah laughed and wiped her eyes with the back of her hand so how are you then kid im all right i suppose and it was partly true that day kirsten did feel a bit betterat least physically her skin felt more like its old self and the frightening internal aches had diminished during the night she felt numb inside though and she still hadnt found the courage to look at herself do i look a mess sarah frowned and examined her features not so bad most of the bruises seem to have gone and theres no permanent damage to your face no disfigurement in fact i wouldnt say you look much worse than usual thanks a lot but kirsten smiled as she spoke sarah was clearly back to normal after her brief bout of tears you must have taken a hell of a beating though i must you mean you dont know nobodys told me what happened thats typical of bloody doctors that is i suppose hes a man yes well there you are then what about the nurse she seems too timid to talk much frightened of him i should think hes probably a real tyrant most of them are the police have been too theyre even worse do you know what happened all i know love is what it said in the paper you were attacked by some maniac in the park and stabbed and beaten stabbed thats what it said perhaps that explained the stitches and the way her skin had felt puckered and snagged she took a deep breath and asked did it say if i was raped as well if you were the newspaper didnt report it and knowing the press theyd have made a field day out of something like that its just that i feel so strange down there really said sarah bloody doctors act like they own your body they ought to tell you whats wrong maybe i havent pushed hard enough or maybe they dont think im strong enough yet ive been feeling very weak and tired dont worry love youll soon get your strength back you know im sure if you refuse to take your pills or start screaming in the night theyll tell you whats wrong would you like me to tackle the doctor for you kirsten managed a weak smile no thanks i need him in one piece ill try later all right you didnt answer my question what questions that what are you doing here i thought you were going home for the summer sarah reached out and took kirstens hand her own was small and soft with long fingers and short bitten nails someones got to look out for you love she said but seriously seriously thats the main reason i tell no lie oh itd only be rows at home anyway you know how much my parents approve of me i lower the tone of the neighborhood besides who wants to spend a bloody summer in hereford of all places lots of people would kirsten said its in the country sarah shrugged maybe ill pay a brief visit but thats all im here to stay were getting a feminist bookshop together where that old secondhand record shop used to be know what were going to call it kirsten shook her head harridan harridan but doesnt that mean yes a badtempered old bag remember all that fuss when anthony burgess said virago was a poor choice of name for a womans press because it meant a fierce or abusive woman well were going a step further well show them that feminists can have just as much sense of irony as anyone else she laughed or bad taste kirsten said often the same thing love now what are we going to do about you what do you mean when you get out of here i dont know i suppose ill be going home i dont really feel right sarah my mindim very mixed up sarah squeezed her hand bound to be itll pass though probably the drugs theyre giving you i have terrible nightmares you dont remember what happened do you no thatll be it then temporary amnesia the brain blanks out painful experiences it doesnt like temporary it might come back sometimes you have to work at it kirsten looked away toward the window outside beyond the flowers and the getwell cards on her table she could see the tops of trees swaying slowly in the wind and a distant block of flats white in the july sun i dont know if i want to remember she whispered i feel so empty you dont have to think about it yet love rest and get your strength back and dont worry i wont be far away ill take good care of you i promise kirsten smiled wheres galen the police said hed been here yes i phoned him and he dashed up to see you as soon as i told him the news he stayed for three days hed have sat by your bedside all the time if theyd let him anyway his mothers having a really hard time getting over his grannies death so he had to go back apparently shes on the edge of a nervous breakdown very highly strung woman he said hed come again though when you regained consciousness hes probably on his way right now poor galen kirsten what i wouldnt expect too much i meanoh shit never mind what tell me all i mean is that sometimes when things like this happen men go funny how they cant deal with it they just act strangeashamed embarrassed they get turned off thats all im sure galen will be all right of course he will love of course he will sarah im thirsty will you pass me some water please ive got these damn tubes in one arm and the others just too tired sure sarah picked up the plastic bottle from the bedside table and held it for kirsten tilting it so that she could suck on the straw easily like being a bloody baby again isnt it kirsten nodded then removed the straw from her mouth okay thats enough thanks i hate feeling so helpless sarah put the bottle back and took her hand again whats been happening in the outside world kirsten asked well we havent had a nuclear war yet if thats what youre worried about and the police came and questioned us all about you how did they find out who i am they found your bag look you dont know any of this i can see so i might as well tell you what i know do you want me to kirsten nodded slowly but not aboutyou knowthe attack all right like i said i dont know what actually happened but apparently a man taking his dog for a walk found you in the park and acted quickly they reckon he saved your life as soon as the police found out who you were from your student card they were round at the university asking questions about your friends it didnt take them long to find out about the party so we all got a visit from pc plod the next day i suppose they thought one of us might have followed you and tried to do you in but no one left the party for a long time after you i stayed till two and hugo was still there trying to put his hand down my knickers they even found out about the row in the ring obells ill bet that fascist landlord and his simian sidekick got a good grilling too kirsten nodded yes the superintendent mentioned that the police moved fast didnt they well what do you expect you are a poor innocent student and your father is managing director of that hushhush government electronics firm connections love its not as if you were just some street tart touting for rough trade is it dont be so cynical sarah im sorry i didnt mean to sound callous but its true isnt it i dont know id like to think they do everything in their power to catch someone who does things like this no matter who to so would i but dream on kid what about the others how are they hugo dropped by a couple of times and damon put off his summer job for a week to come and see you but you were out to the world then they left flowers and cards she gestured toward the bedside table yes i know thank them for me will you youll be able to thank them yourself im sure theyll be back now they know youre in the land of the living again where are they now hugo dashed off home to bedfordshire no doubt to sponge off his parents and bonk the local milkmaids for the rest of the summer and damons going hoppicking in kent imagine that poor damon getting those lilywhite hands dirty so theyre all gone yes love all but me and you wont get rid of me that easily kirsten smiled and sarah squeezed her hand again theyll be back just wait and see anyway i think id better go now you look all in youll come again soon promise get some rest sarah bent and kissed her forehead lightly then left as kirsten lay there she tried to take in all that sarah had told her of course she couldnt expect the others to stick around for so long and a visit from the police must have given them a scare hugo probably thought they were after that gram of coke hed bought to celebrate the end of term but all the same she felt deserted abandoned she knew they all had to go their separate ways in fact she remembered that had been very much on her mind that last night why did she call it her last night she wondered but it wasnt as if she had the plague or anything was there something in what sarah had hinted were damon and hugo embarrassed by what had happened to her ashamed even afraid to face her but why should they be she asked herself they had work to do they would be back as soon as they could get away just as sarah had said and galen was probably on his way right now sarahs visit had renewed her spirits a little it had also inflamed her curiosity obviously there was more to this whole business than she was aware of could she really get the doctor to open up if she kept nagging at him or having screaming fits at least there was one thing she could do right now tentatively she pushed down the bedclothes and started to unbutton the top of her nightgown it was a slow job as her good arm was hooked up to an iv machine and she had to fumble with the weak and awkward fingers of her left hand the one she hardly ever used she didnt really believe that shed get very far but to her surprise she found once shed started she couldnt stop no matter how difficult and painful the movements were finally she managed to get the first four buttons undone it was hard to bend her head forward and look down so she shuffled herself back against the pillows and slumped against the headboard from there she could just tilt her head forward without straining her neck too much at first she couldnt see anything at all the nightgown still seemed to cling around her breasts she rested a moment then pulled at it with her free hand when she looked down again she started screaming martha the lucky fisherman a bit off the beaten track turned out to be an unpretentious little local frequented mostly by townspeople martha didnt notice any real difference between the public bar and the lounge both had the same small round tables and creaky wooden chairs the woodwork was old and scratched and one of the embossed glass panels in the door between the bars was broken at one end of the room was a dartboard which no one was using when she walked in at five past seven there were only a few other customers in the place most of whom leaned easily against the bar chatting to the landlord keith was sitting at a table in the far corner under a framed photograph an old sepia panorama of whitby in its whaling days with tallmasted ships in the harbor and chunky men in souwesterslike the man on the packets of fishermans friend cough lozengesleaning against the railing on st anns staith and smoking stubby pipes the fence had been made of wood in those days martha noticed one long beam held up by occasional props good day keith said standing as she came up to him good day martha answered he laughed no i mean did you have a good day we dont all talk like paul hogan you know martha put her holdall on a vacant chair and sat down opposite him who paul hogan crocodile dundee a famous aussie lord dont you ever go to the movies or watch television martha shook her head she vaguely remembered the name but it seemed centuries ago and she could recall no details her mind seemed to have no room left for trivia these days what do you do for entertainment i read ah very sensible drink bitter just a half please keith went to the bar and returned with her beer and another pint for himself so how was your day he asked again good it was a long time since martha had talked like this with a boya man reallyor conversed with anyone for that matter she seemed to have lost all her skill at small talk she must have had it once she assumed though she couldnt remember when all she could do was let keith take the lead and follow as best she could she dipped into her bag for her cigarettes and offered him one no i dont he said but please go ahead she lit the rothmans noting that she would soon need another packet and reached for her drink again well keith said martha got the impression that she was supposed to say something so she forged ahead what about you where did you go oh i just walked around visited the usual places sat on the beach for a while i even went for a dip im not used to it being so warm over here it is unusual martha agreed im making my way up the coast to scotland i think i told you martha nodded anyway its a complete holiday no papers no radio no tv i dont want to know whats going on in the world its not usually good martha agreed too true and what about you im curious why are you here all by yourself if its not a rude question martha thought of saying that yes it was a rude question but that would only get his back up it was much easier to lie she realized that she could tell him anything she wanted anything under the sunthat she lived in mozambique for example and was taking a rest from organizing safaris or that she had run away from her husband an arabian prince to whom she had been sold as a young girl and shut away in a harem she could tell him she was traveling around the world alone as stipulated in the will on a legacy left by her billionaire armsdealer father it was an exhilarating feeling a feeling of tremendous power and freedom best keep it simple and believable though she decided and told him she was doing research for a book you a writer then he asked silly of me i suppose you must be if youre working on a book well im not famous or anything its my first one you wont have heard of me maybe one day who knows who knows its a historical book though more of an academic study really i mean its not fiction or anything whats it about thats hard to say its partly about early christianity especially on the east coast here you know bede caedmon st hilda the synod of whitby keith shook his head slowly fraid youve lost me im just a simple aussie law student sounds fascinating though it is martha said glad to have lost him with luck there would be no more questions about what she was doing she finished her cigarette then drained her glass keith immediately went for refills do you know anything about the fishing industry here martha asked when he came back he squinted at her his eyes really were a sharp blue as if he had spent so much time staring into blue skies and oceans that they had taken their color from the water and air fishing industry thats a funny question no i cant really say i do i just wanted to see them bring in the catch thats all she said quickly its supposed to be very interesting they take them to that long shed down by the harbor and auction them off thatll be on friday keith said fish on friday is that a joke keith laughed no what i mean is i heard they go out on a sunday and come back friday so thats when the catch comes in thats the big boats little boats like keelboats and cobles come and go every day but theyve so little to sell its all over before the sun comes up martha thought for a moment making mental calculations trying to remember what happened on which day the person she was looking for must have a small boat of his own she concluded that might be easy to trace if she knew where to look there should be a register of some kind its only a couple of days keith said pity i wont be here youll have to get up early in the morning to see the boats come in but the auctions go on for quite a while what sorry to see the boats come in i said youll have to get up early they come in before dawn oh well im sure the seagulls will wake me keith laughed noisy little blighters arent they tell me do you come from this part of the country yorkshire no i thought your accent was different where you from then exeter martha lied never been there youve not missed much its just a city like all the rest tell me about australia and keith told her it seemed to suit both of them keith could find suitable expression for his homesickness in talking about sydney life and martha could pretend to be interested the whole evening was beginning to seem like a farce to her and she wondered why she had bothered to agree to meet him at all it brought back disturbing memories too mostly of her years as a teenager pretending to be interested in what the boys said as they showed off and then later fending off their wandering hands for as long as it seemed proper to do so would keith turn out to be just like the rest too she put that last thought right out of her head as flash as a rat with a gold tooth keith was saying but thats just what people from melbourne say its hardly surprising sydney s like a flashy whore to them melbourne s more like an old maid in surgical stockings the place was filling up already most of the tables were taken and three men had just started to play darts martha nodded in all the right places she soon found that shed finished her second halfpint another keith asked are you trying to get me drunk why would i want to do that to take advantage of me keith blushed i wasnti mean i she waved dismissively doesnt matter yes ill have another if you like it was while he was away at the bar that martha first heard the voice it made her hackles rise and her throat constrict casually she looked around only two men were playing darts now and it was one of them who had spoken he was small and swarthy and wore a navyblue fishermans jersey he looked as if he hadnt shaved for a couple of days and his eyes seemed to glitter unnaturally like the ancient mariners under his ragged fringe he caught martha looking and returned her gaze quickly she turned away keith came back with the drinks and excused himself to go to the gents martha turned her head slowly again trying to catch the man in her peripheral vision had he recognized her she didnt think so this time he was so absorbed in throwing the dart that he didnt notice her looking could it really be him do you know him martha almost jumped at the sound of keiths voice she hadnt seen him come back no what makes you ask that keith shrugged just the way you were looking at him thats all of course i dont know him martha said this is my first day here you just seemed to be staring rather intently thats all maybe its someone you thought you recognized ive told you i dont know what youre talking about just drop it will you are you sure youre all right yes im fine martha said and it was probably the truest thing shed said to him all evening now she had something concrete to work on her mind seemed more able to focus and concentrate on the other hand she felt herself drifting further and further away from keith it was becoming harder for her to follow his conversation and respond in the appropriate way at the right time he began to seem more like an irritating fly that she kept having to swat away she needed to be alone but she couldnt escape just yet she had to play the game you a student then he asked yes im doing postgraduate work at bangor and this book is it your doctoral thesis sort of it was excruciating like some awful interview she had to go through as she answered keiths inane questions martha was conscious all the time of the darts match going on behind her her skin was burning and her pulse beat way too fast finally the game drew to a close the man she had been watching walked over to the bar where she could see him out of the corner of her eye and put his empty glass down on the counter well thats my limit for tonight he said to the barman see you tomorrow bobby the accent was right the voice hoarse night jack said the barman martha watched jack walk toward the exit he glanced briefly in her direction before he opened the door but still showed no sign that he recognized her she looked at her watch it was a quarter to ten for some reason she got the impression that what had just happened was a kind of nightly ritual jack finishing his game putting his glass on the counter and making some remark about the lateness of the hour if he was a fisherman then he would probably have to be up early in the morning but shouldnt he already be out at sea it was all so confusing still if it was his habit to do this every night she could come back tomorrow when keith was out of the way andwell the next move would take careful planning and a lot of grace but she had plenty of time want to go with difficulty like focusing on something from a great distance martha turned her attention back to keith she nodded and reached for her holdall outside the warm fresh air felt good in her lungs a bright halfmoon hung high over st marys want to go for a walk keith asked okay they walked along east terrace by the row of tall white victorian hotels toward the cook statue as they passed the whales jawbone keith stopped and said that must have been exciting setting off after whales i suppose id have been one of the waiting women martha said hoping to see the jawbone of a whale nailed to the masts what it was a sign it meant everyone was safe the women used to walk up here along west cliff and look out for the ships coming home martha looked at the huge arch of bone from where she stood it framed the floodlit st marys across the harbor as perfectly as if the whole setup had been contrived by an artist its hard to imagine you doing that keith said moving on slowly pacing and waiting why do you say that well i cant really say i know you of course but you give me the impression that youre a modern woman liberated or whatever youd have been more likely to be out there on the ships they didnt take women i dont suppose they did but you know what i mean martha didnt it had been his first really personal remark and it took her aback how could someone just sit and talk about inconsequential things for an hour or two and then come out with a statement like that she hadnt even been paying attention to him most of the time could he really see into her character she hoped not he wouldnt like what he saw by the cook statue they sat on a bench and looked out to sea a cool breeze ruffled her hair and the moons reflection seemed to float somewhere far in the distance yet its eerie white light spread over all the ripples and billows of the water as far as the eye could see martha thought of the passage from lawrence s women in love where birkin threw pebbles at the moons reflection in a pond it was supposed to symbolize something or so her english teacher had said but nobody really knew what symbols to her had always stood for things you felt but couldnt explain and now she felt like throwing pebbles at the rippling white sea do you have a boyfriend keith asked what do you think you seem to know what kind of person i am what would you say id be surprised if you didnt but if i was him i wouldnt let you go away by yourself like this why not stands to reason doesnt it a pretty girl like you a pretty girl martha almost laughed out loud from where they sat at the top of the cliff and back a little bit from its fenced edge she couldnt see the waves break on the beach below she could hear them though and the deep grumbling hiss as one withdrew filled the silence before keith spoke again theres something disconcerting about you though he said oh whats that well for a start youre not easy to get to know martha looked at her watch weve been together about three hours she said how much do you expect to get to know about someone in that time its not time that counts some people you can get to know real quickly not you though theres hidden depths to you why am i disconcerting martha asked despite herself she was becoming interested in his perception of her oh i dont know you seem so distant and you dont get my jokes its like youve spent the last few years on another planet i mean if i make a little joke you dont laugh you ask a question like what keith laughed like that martha felt herself blushing it wasnt a feeling she enjoyed she smiled i suppose youre right its just curiosity he shook his head no its not its more like a form of defense youre very evasive youve got a lot of defenses martha youre hiding in there somewhere behind all the walls and barbed wire why martha became aware of keiths arm slipping around her shoulder it made her stiffen surely he must sense her resistance she thought but he didnt remove it why what she asked why do you need to protect yourself so much to hide away whats there to be afraid of theres a lot to be afraid of martha said slowly and what makes you think im protecting myself from the world maybe im protecting the world from me now that really is choice im not sure i understand you not at all but i do find you intriguing and very attractive a ships light blinked far out to sea keith leaned over and kissed her martha managed to contain her boiling rage and let him it was a soft tentative kiss not a violent tongueprobing attack a small price to pay she told herself amid her anger for appearing normal she knew she wasnt responding with the enthusiasm he expected but there was absolutely nothing she could do about that its a shame i have to go tomorrow he said breaking away gently clearly her response or lack of it didnt mean very much to him id like to spend more time with you get to know you a bit better martha said nothing she just stared out at the rippling moon on the water and watched the ships light move across the horizon like a star through the sky he kissed her again this time more passionately exploring her teeth with his tongue when she felt his other hand slip up over her side and reach for her breast she pulled away no she said as calmly but firmly as she could what do you think i am weve only just met im sorry keith said really i am i didnt mean to offend you i just thoughti mean i hoped oh god you cant blame a bloke for trying can you martha could but she didnt say so instead she tried to placate him despite the rage she felt its not that i dont like you she said its just too soon i guess im not the kind of person for a holiday quickie now keith seemed offended thats not fair thats not what i had in mind but it was martha knew oh keith was a nice enough boy not too pushy but all it came down to was that he wanted to go to bed with her he would make out that he didnt usually do such things and she was supposed to say the same then he would tell her how it was different with her really special he was a wolf all right but a tame one getting the brushoff just made him sulk and become petulant they werent all as easy as him to fight off come on martha said lets go back its getting chilly hands in pockets head down keith walked beside her back to the guesthouse kirsten its my body i have a right to know kirsten leaned back on the pillows her eyes were puffed up and the tear tracks had dried on her cheeks the doctor stood by the bottom of the bed and her parents sat beside her you were in no state to be alarmed the doctor said youve been suffering from severe trauma we had to avoid upsetting you for the first time kirsten actually looked at him he was a short darkskinned man with a deeply etched frown that converged in a v between his thick black eyebrows somehow the lines made him look like a shorttempered person though kirsten had seen no evidence of this if he had tried to keep the full extent of her injuries from her he had at least been gentle im already alarmed she said her nightgown was buttoned up again now but the memory of what she had seen still frightened her look im not a little girl somethings wrong tell me we didnt want to upset you dear her mother echoed the doctor theres plenty of time to go into all the details later when youre feeling better why dont you just rest now the doctor will give you a sedative kirsten struggled to sit up i dont want a bloody sedative i want to know now if you dont tell me ill only imagine its worse than it is i feel awful but i dont think im going to die am i what else could be so bad what could be worse than that lie back and keep calm the doctor said gently pushing her down no youre not going to die at least not until youve had your three score and ten if you were youd have done so before today he moved back to the end of the bed so tell me whats wrong the doctor hesitated and looked toward her father go on he said quietly tell her kirsten wanted to let him know that his permission wasnt required she was twentyone she didnt need his approval but if this was the only way to find out so be it the doctor sighed and stared at a spot on the wall above the top of her head what you saw he began is the result of emergency surgery the sutures it looks bad now but when they heal it will be better not like new but better than now anything would be better than now kirsten thought picturing her red and swollen breasts covered with stitch marks like zippers like something out of a frankenstein movie when you were brought in the doctor went on one breast was almost severed we counted thirteen separate stab wounds to the mammary region alone he shrugged and leaned forward gripping the metal bed frame we did the best we could under the circumstances alone you said alone what else was there youd been beaten around the face and head and all in all you had thirtyone stab wounds its a miracle that none of them hit a major artery or organ kirsten gripped the top of the bedsheet and held it tight across her throat what did they hit then apart from my tits kirsten her mother gasped theres no need to speak like that in front of the doctor its all right the doctor said i suppose she has every right to be angry thank you kirsten said thank you very much you were saying the doctor fixed his gaze on the wall again most of the other entry points were in the region of the abdomen thighs and vagina he went on it was a vicious attack one of the worst ive ever seenat least on a victim who survived there were also shallow slashes across the stomach and something that looked like a cross with a long vertical had been cut from just below the breasts to the pudenda the cuts werent deep but they needed stitching nonetheless thats why your skin feels so tight kirsten lay silent and relaxed her grip on the sheets it was even worse than she had thought thirtyone stab wounds that terrible ache between her legs she gulped and struggled to force back the tears she was damned if she was going to prove them right and react like a baby if im not going to die she said why are you all looking like undertakers whats the bad news youre hiding from me what is it youre all trying to save me from am i disfigured for life is that it there will be some disfigurement yes the doctor said glancing at kirstens father again for the goahead chiefly of the breasts and the pubic area but thats not the main damage theres always the possibility of further surgery to correct some of the disfigurement the real problems are internal kirsten he said for the first time using her christian name and saying it softly when you came in you were unconscious we had to operate immediately to put things right to save your life and we had to do it quickly because theres always considerable anesthetic risk when a patient is unconscious well you were suffering from severe internal bleeding and there was a strong chance of infection of peritonitis we had to perform an emergency hysterectomy i know what that means kirsten said it means i cant have children doesnt it it means surgical removal of the uterus but it means ill never be able to have babies doesnt it the doctor nodded kirstens mother began to sob into a handkerchief her father and the doctor looked solemn one machine beside her bleeped rhythmically another hissed and colorless fluid dripped into her arm from the iv everything in the room seemed white apart from her fathers charcoal gray suit it wasnt something id planned for the immediate future anyway she said with a little laugh showing them she could put a brave face on things but this time she couldnt stop the tears from flowing her father and the doctor were both staring down at her why are you looking at me like that she shouted turning her face to the wall go away leave me alone you insisted i tell you everything kirsten the doctor said and youd have to have been told eventually i said i thought it was too soon ill be all right kirsten reached for a kleenex how did you expect me to react jump for joy is there anything else now youve started you might as well get it all over with there was a short pause then the doctor said some of the stab wounds perforated the vagina her mother turned away to face the door such frank talk was clearly too much for her vaginas breasts penises and the rest had always been forbidden subjects around the house so kirsten said im assuming you patched that up as well the doctor nodded oh yes we had to close the lacerations stop the bleeding but as i said it was an emergency patchup are you trying to tell me you made some kind of mistake because you were in a hurry is that it no we followed standard emergency procedure i told you you were unconscious we had to act fast so what are you trying to say well there was some tissue loss and the damage could be serious enough to cause permanent problems could be we just dont know yet kirsten and where does all this leave me intercourse might be a problem the doctor explained it could be painful difficult kirsten lay silent for a moment then she laughed and said oh wonderful thats just what i was feeling like right now a really good fuck kirsten her father snapped showing the first signs of anger she had seen in him in years listen to the doctor her mother started crying again theres a chance that reconstructive surgery sometime in the future might help the doctor went on but there are no guarantees it finally dawned on kirsten what he meantmore from his tone than what he actually saidand she felt a chill shoot through her whole being this could be forever im afraid so and a hysterectomy cant be reversed either can it no kirsten turned toward the window and noticed it was raining outside the treetop leaves danced under the downpour and the distant flats had turned slate gray forever she repeated to herself im sorry kirsten she looked at her father it was odd to be discussing such things as her sex life in front of him she had never done so before she didnt know what he assumed about her activities at university but now here he was looking sad and sympathetic because she couldnt make love perhaps never would again or maybe it was the bit about no children that hit him the hardest her being an only child she didnt know which was worse herself for the first time in her life the two things converged in a way they never had before she had been on the pill for two years and had slept regularly with galen only her second lover they had never thought about children and the future but now as she remembered their gentle and ecstatic lovemaking she couldnt help but think of new life growing inside her how ironic that it took the loss of the ability both to enjoy sex and to bear children to make her see how intimately connected the two functions were she laughed are you all right her father asked coming forward to take her hand she let him but hers lay limp i dont know she looked at him and shook her head i dont know i feel sort of empty inside all dried out and dead the doctor was still hovering at the foot of the bed as i said there is a chance that reconstructive surgery might help its something to think about i dont know if you understand this kirsten he said or at least if you realize it yet but you really are very lucky to be alive yes said kirsten rolling on her side lucky martha the next morning the honeymooners were gone leaving one empty table but keith sat with martha anyway he made polite conversation over breakfast but demonstrated none of the ebullience and energy hed shown the previous day when he had first found himself at the table with her enforced celibacy she guessed had seriously dampened his spirits it would be best to say nothing about last night she decided after all it was keiths last day perhaps tomorrow she would be able to eat alone a particularly near and noisy flock of seagulls had awoken most of the guests at about three thirty in the morning and that provided a safe and neutral topic of conversation over the black pudding and grilled mushrooms that again augmented the usual bacon and egg martha ate quickly wished keith a good journey and hurried upstairs she hadnt slept well it wasnt only the scavenging gulls that had disturbed her but thoughts and fears about what she had to do next for weeks she had planned it and dreamed of it gone over it all so often in her mind that she could perform the act in her sleep now that it was close she felt terrified what if something went wrong what if when the time came she couldnt go through with it even the holiest have their doubts she reminded herself faith would see her through across the harbor a few woolly clouds hung over st marys but they were drifting slowly inland the sun lit up the cottages that straggled up the steep hillside beyond st hildas closer at the other end of the street the sky was clear a light breeze wafted through the window bringing the salt and fishy smell of the sea martha didnt know what to do with herself all day she couldnt act until after dark and she had already got the lie of the land it would look suspicious if she stayed in her room though especially on such a lovely day at the seaside spells of warm sunny weather were rare on the yorkshire coast whatever she did she would have to go out she waited until she had heard the other guests leave for the day hoping that keith was among them then crept down the stairs and out into the morning sun already courting couples strolled hand in hand along skinner street content after a night of love set to the music of screeching gulls families paused and glanced idly at the racks of postcards and guidebooks outside the gift shops children in shorts and striped tshirts swinging bright plastic buckets and spades demanded ice creams babies slept in their prams oblivious to the noise and bustle of life going on all around them martha went into the first newsagents she came across and bought the times and a packet of twenty benson amp hedges the ten rothmans a brand she hadnt liked all that much anyway hadnt lasted very long and she had a feeling she wouldnt want to be caught without for twentyone years she hadnt smoked a single cigarette now within about a year she had become addicted she wandered down busy flowergate a narrow street crammed with shoppers toward the estuary overhead flocks of gulls screamed and flashed white in the sun when she reached the bridge she checked the hightide times chalked on the board and it was ten oclock now that meant the tide would be well on its way out she jotted the times down in her notebook in case she should forget one problem with the guesthouse was that the managers wife made awful coffee martha would have preferred it to tea in the morning but she had no stomach for a pot of powdered nescafé now she craved the caffeine that only a cup of strong dripfilter coffee could provide she crossed the bridge and turned left along church street joining the procession heading for the steps up to caedmons cross st marys and the abbey ruin a short distance along the narrow cobbled street just before the marketplace she found the café she had noticed before the monks haven near the black horse pub the café was meant to look very olde worlde a painted sign much like a pub sign in gothic script hung above the entrance and pots of bright red geraniums ranged along the top of the frontage above the mullioned windows with their whitepainted frames martha ordered a cup of black coffee and sat down to struggle with the times crossword while mulling over clues she watched the ebb and flow of people beyond the windows more couples pushing babies in prams toddlers hanging onto mummys hand stout old women with gray hair and sensible shoes outside the music shop opposite a skinny young man clad in jeans and a checked shirt who looked like he hadnt slept for a month or combed his hair for at least as long started singing folk songs in a nasal voice some people dropped coins into the hat that lay on the pavement beside him when she had done as much of the crossword as she could martha read through the paper she found nothing of interest waiting was no fun it must be like this for soldiers she thought just before they know they are going into action they sit around in the trenches or on landing craft smoking and keeping very quiet she had no idea what she would do when it was all over that was an aspect of the business she had left completely to instinct because she didnt know how she would feel when it was done she couldnt make any plans about what to do she just hoped that possibilities would present themselves when the time came she wandered up and down church street gazing at the displays of jetware beautiful polished black stones set in gold and silver or larger chunks carved into ornamental chess pieces and delicate figurines by noon she was hungry again so much for the staying power of black pudding and bacon desperate for an alternative to fish and chips she nipped into the black horse and ordered a steak and kidney pie which she washed down with a half of bitter then she smoked a cigarette and struggled for a while longer with the crossword by half past one she was out on the street again wondering what to do with the rest of the day she didnt want to go up to st marys again and there was no sense in simply tramping the streets all day close to the junction of church street and bridge street stood a small bookshop the bell pinged as martha went inside and a plump bespectacled girl smiled at her from behind a counter stacked with invoices and orders the place had a large and comprehensive paperback fiction section which martha browsed through methodically starting with a ackroyd amis austen burgess chatwin dickens drabble greene hardy can i help you the assistant asked coming out from behind her counter and raising her glasses no martha said flashing her a quick smile just browsing ill find something the woman went back to her paperwork and martha carried on scanning the titles she wanted an ordered world she could lose herself in for a while nothing modern would do twentiethcentury literature with its experiments in style its selfconscious artistry and its lack of morality and order had never much interested her at one time she had liked to escape into the occasional crime novelruth rendell p d jamesbut such things held no appeal for her now for a moment she considered mobydick she had never read it and the seaside especially an old whaling center would be the ideal place to start but when she got to the m s she found they hadnt a copy left in stock the only melville book they had was pierre and she was in no mood for that finally she settled for jane austens emma she had read it at school for her alevels but that seemed a lifetime ago with jane austen you could count on nothing more to ruffle the ordered surface than an occasional social gaffe or mistaken romantic intentions what better to do then than spend an afternoon on the beach reading emma she just hoped keith wasnt there he had said he was moving on but he could have changed his mind she made her way back over the bridge with the tide out the river esk was reduced to a narrow channel in the sand boats leaned in the silt at odd angles martha walked along st ann s staith thinking of the old days in the photograph when the railing was made of wood she passed the amusement arcades seafood stalls and dracula museum then at the end of pier road she took the steps down to the beach whitby sands runs below west cliff and over the centuries the sea has carved small caves and caverns in the sheer rock wall martha poked her head inside one it didnt go very deep but it was a dank gloomy place full of slimy rocks smelly seaweed and dead driedout molluscs that crunched underfoot she shivered and turned away the beach itself was crowdedonly to be expected on such a fine daybut martha managed to find a spot where she could lean back against the rock and stretch her feet out children screamed and splashed in the water bravely taking it in turns to stand fast as waves came in and bowled them over anxious parents kept one eye on the knitting or the newspaper and the other on the kids some children were busy constructing elaborate sand castles with turrets battlements moats and drawbridges some people were even sunbathing a couple of teenage girls wearing skimpy bikinis lay flat out on towels a group of boys about the same age playing cricket nearby kept hitting the ball in their direction just to make an excuse to chat the girls up what martha was watching she realized was another way of life another world completelyor one she had once known but lost if she felt like a visitor from outer space when she watched lovers walk hand in hand parents push babies in prams and children play in the foam she felt even more so when she watched the elaborate contact and courtship rituals of these teenagers bursting with hormones the first couple of times the cricket ball kicked up a little sand on the girls bare stomachs they responded with abuse anyone watching would think they didnt like getting sand in their navels after a while though they started to join in the spirit of the game they would pick up the ball and throw it toward the sea or run off and bury it in the sand laughing and making fun of the boys martha had never before noticed the importance of sheer repetition and persistence in the human mating ritual it was like watching a species of animal or insect martha thought putting jane austen aside and lighting a cigarette no matter how much progress we seem to have made we still dance to primitive patterns so deeply imprinted that we wouldnt recognize them if they tripped us up in the street which they often do though we have the miracle of language we still make more sense with meaningless sounds gestures looks and silences and beneath all the elaborate courtship rituals martha thought lay pure animal desire and the scarcely recognized impulse to perpetuate the species just like keith last night he had wanted martha he had wanted to take her to his bed naked and enter her for the pleasure it gave him all that fuss over five minutes of grunting soundsor was it squelching soundssomeone had once said people would do anything for it lie cheat steal maim kill even die the whole human drama seemed so sad and pointless to martha that day on the beach people amounted to nothing more than puppets manipulated by forces they didnt understand or worse even perceive shakespeare was right as usual as flies to wanton boys are we to thgods they kill us for their sport martha included herself too hadnt she experienced the sport of the gods and just how much choice did she really have in this tragedy or farce she was acting out she was jumping to strings as much as anyone else different strings perhaps with more sinister pullers but beyond her control nonetheless despite the heat she shivered finally she managed to pull herself out of the philosophical gloom she told herself she was just getting nervous that was all and that the weak and cowardly part of her nature was trying to sap her confidence she had to be strong it was no good giving in to a sense of futility only one thing kept her going and until that was done she couldnt afford to reflect on life besides who was she to make such judgments anyway she crossed her legs and picked up jane austen it was a hot day on the beach and there she lay in jeans and a shirt buttoned up to the neck she was too warm but she couldnt take her clothes off and lie almost naked like the teenage girls in their bikinis and the rituals and consummation of courtship were beyond her too but for her she thought there was another kind of consummation devoutly to be sought and seek it she would tonight kirsten like most people who hear bad news kirsten went through all the textbook stages including the belief that a second opinion would prove the doctor wrong and that what he had told her was gone forever would somehow be miraculously restored the first night she convinced herself that it was all a bad dream it would pass but it didnt even in the mild light of the next morning everything was the same her stitches her aches her wounds her loss the nightmares of painless almost bloodless slashing and slicing continued she never woke up screaming but sometimes she would open her eyes suddenly at some ungodly hour of the morning to escape the relentless images and to puzzle over them other times she lay awake all night especially when it was raining she liked to try and empty her mind and pretend that her hard hospital bed was really a pallet of pine needles deep in the woods behind her parents house in brierley coombe the rain pattered gently on the leaves outside her window and for short periods she could imagine it falling soft and cool on her eyelids and she could almost escape the horror of her condition at least she wasnt dead in a way the doctor had been right she was lucky if that man hadnt been walking his dog so late and hadnt got curious when it started to growl and scratch around in the shrubbery then she would have simply bled to death on a summers night out in the park only a hundred yards or so from home but the man had stopped and for that she should be grateful now she was a cripple with all her limbs intactexternal limbs anyway her sense of violation and loss was almost unbearable at times that most intimate part of herself had been stolen and destroyed she cried prayed and even at one time fell into a fit of hysterical laughter but ultimately she accepted the truth and depression bore down on her at its heart was that thick cloud an opaque mass swelling like a tumor in her mind repelling all light and taunting her with its darkness and its heaviness the doctor and nurses ministered as best they could to her healing body the stitches dissolved leaving the flesh bunched up and corrugated around her breasts livid scars quartered her like the doctor had said in the shape of a cross with a long vertical bar and a short horizontal from just below the breasts to her pubic hairat least to where that hair had been for the nurse had shaved her down there and now all she had was itchy stubble externally the pubic region didnt look too bad she glimpsed it for the first time when she was able to walk to the toilet alone it was red and sore covered in a lattice of fading stitchwork but she had expected worse it was inside where most of the damage had been done her parents came in and out her mother still too upset to say very much and her father taking the burden stoically superintendent elswick dropped by again but to no avail she still couldnt remember what had happened or give them any information about her attacker beyond the feel of his callused hands sarah visited again too she said shed take on the small flat if kirsten was going home to convalesce kirsten agreed it would save a lot of trouble moving stuff when her parents took her home she didnt tell sarah about the full extent of her injuries maybe later at that time she couldnt bear to talk about it she did though ask her to try and keep the others away for a while and then a full week after she had been given the news galen turned up breathless from the station lank dark hair flopping over his ears concern etched in every feature of his thin handsome face he sat beside her and grasped her hand at first neither of them knew what to say i came before galen told her finally they said you were unconscious and they didnt know when youd come round i phoned every day i couldnt stay my kirsten squeezed his hand i know i understand thank you for coming back you look a lot better how are you feeling i can get up and walk around now they tell me ill be able to go home soon she touched her face gingerly the bruises have all gone now the swellings gone down how much did he know about what had happened to her she didnt want to give anything away galen lowered his head and shook it his face darkening he smashed his fist into his palm if i could get my hands on the bastard dont kirsten said justdont id rather not talk about it im sorry you cant imagine how i feel ive been blaming myself ever since it happened if only id been there like i should have been dont be silly its not your fault it could have happened to anyone at any time you cant be expected to guard me night and day galen looked into her eyes and smiled his grip tightened on her hand i will from now on he said after youve recovered and all that i promise i wont let you out of my sight kirsten turned her head aside and looked out at the dazzling tower blocks rinsed by last nights rain and the sunlight dancing in the polished leaves what are you going to do she asked galen shrugged i dont really know i suppose ill just hang about at home for the rest of the summer mothers still taking it very badlygrandmothers death and ill come and visit you in brierley whenever i can its not too far away and ill have the car it might be better if you didnt visit me kirsten said slowly at least not for a while galen frowned and scratched his earlobe why what do you mean just that i need some time by myself to recover she managed a smile call it postoperative depression i wouldnt be very good company that doesnt matter youll need me kirstie and i want to be there for you she rested her free hand on his forearm no not for a while please just let me get myself sorted out galen got up and wandered over to the window hands in pockets his shoulders slumped the way they always did when he was disappointed about something just like a little boy kirsten thought if you say so he said with his back to her i suppose its theerthe psychological effects that are worse than even the physical ones is it i mean i dont know i couldnt know could i being a man but ill do my best to understand he turned around again and looked at her i know you will kirsten said i just think its best if we dont see each other for a while im all confused she still wasnt sure how much they had told him he knew that shed been attacked that was clear enough but had they been vague about the nature of the assault perhaps he assumed that shed been raped had she been kirsten wasnt too sure about that herself as far as the doctor had been able to make out there had been no traces of semen in the vagina it had been such a mess however that she didnt see how he could possibly be so certain did penetration by a short sharply pointed metal object count as rape she wondered in the end she just had to settle for the general opinion that people who do what this man did to her are usually incapable of real sexual intercourse what about toronto galen asked returning to the chair and hunching over her i dont know i just cant see myself going not the way things are now not this year at least but its still a month or so off youll probably feel better by then maybe anyway you go ahead dont worry about me i wouldnt go without you galen dont be so stubborn theres no point sacrificing your career because of me i cant promise you anything right now i cant even and she almost told him then but pulled herself back just in time i just dont know how things are going to go she started crying cant you understand the effort of letting him down gently and hiding her feelings and her disability from him at the same time was proving too much she wished he would just leave when he bent down to comfort her she felt herself freeze the reaction surprised her it was something shed never done before and it came from deep inside it was completely involuntary like a twitch or a reflex action galen felt it too and he backed off looking wounded i understand he said stiffly at least ill try he patted her hand lets just leave it be for now okay plenty of time to think about our future later on when youre fully recovered kirsten nodded and wiped the tears away with the backs of her hands galen passed her a kleenex is there anything you want he asked anything at all i can bring you no not really a book ive not felt much like reading i cant seem to concentrate but thank you very much youd better go galen go back home and take care of your mother im glad you came i know i dont seem it but honestly i am he looked disappointed as if he had been summarily dismissed kirsten knew she hadnt managed to sound very convincing her breasts ached and she felt close to tears again he took hold of her hand that littleboylost expression on his face and didnt seem to want to let go ill come again he said i promise ill be up here for a couple of days sorting things out anyway all right but im tired now he leaned forward and kissed her gently on the lips she caught the toothpaste smell on his breath he must have brushed his teeth on the train she thought or as soon as he got to the hospital when he left she gave in and let the tears fall there just seemed to be no future certainly there would be no life for him with her if he was lucky they would drift apart and he would go to toronto in september he might even meet someone else kirsten had no idea what her full recovery would feel like or even if such a thing were possible the doctor hadnt sounded very hopeful about reconstructive surgery presumably she would feel fine on the outside though the scars would remain and have to be covered up was she just supposed to get used to her new state put her past behind her and get on with life go to toronto with galen even he would be very understanding about her disability at least for a while perhaps he would even marry her out of love and pity and as time went on she would considerately turn a blind eye to the bits on the side he needed to give him what she could no longer supply she would be grateful just because he was selfsacrificing enough to love a cripple no it didnt sound right such a life could never be should never be without really telling him why she would have to ease galen out of her life for his own good the depression was on her in her a kind of numbing fatalism that would admit no light no comfort she couldnt imagine it ever ending things getting back to normal already the carefree cheerful young graduate who had stepped out of oastler hall enjoyed the warm air and scanned the night sky for the moon as she sat on the stone lion was gone utterly irredeemably and who or what was going to take her place kirsten wondered she felt vague and disturbing forces moving inside her like flitting shadows in places so deep and dark she had not known they existed and she felt powerless to do anything about them just as she had when galen had tried to hold her and shed frozen on him she was no longer in control but it was more even than that she knew she only controlled enough of herself to give the comforting illusion of being in command at best like most people she could control certain aspects of her behavior it was mostly a matter of manners like not burping at the dinner table but her habits and mannerisms shouldnt change so dramatically unless she made a great conscious effort to alter them she surely wouldnt just wake up one morning and no longer bite her nails under stress or stop blushing when she overheard someone talking about her no more than galen could stop his shoulders slumping when he didnt get what he wanted or sarah sucking on her upper lip with deceptive calm before responding sharply to a remark that had offended her yet that seemed to be just what had happened what kirsten had done when galen had reached for herbefore she had even had time to think about itwas something that had never been in her repertoire of responses it was her habit always to return the embrace of a friend or a loved one but that part of herthe part perhaps that responded to affection and lovewas gone now changed she no longer recognized herself it would be typical of the doctors she thought to put it down to what had happened to her its like they would say touching a hot coal and flinching the next time the hand nears another once bitten twice shy conditioning one of pavlovs dogs naturally they would go on anyone who has suffered and survived such a vicious attack is bound to react with suspicion when another man however familiar approaches her in any intimate way well maybe they were right perhaps it would pass in time animals and humans who are used to being illtreated often strike out at first when someone finally offers them love but in time they come to accept it and trust those who give it surely she too could relearn the right responses but kirsten wasnt convinced for some reason she believed that this new instinctive and frightening reaction to her lovers concern was only the beginning that there were other changes going on other powers at work and that she had no control over any of them what was she going to become all she could do was wait and see even then she realized she would probably be none the wiser for she would have shed her old self and would have nothing left to compare the new one with after all she wondered does a butterfly remember the caterpillar it used to be martha martha found a pizza place to eat in that evening oddly enough instead of giving her butterflies in her stomach nervousness was making her hungry upstairs was a takeaway where busy whitejacketed cooks prepared orders but downstairs was a tiny cellar restaurant with only four tables each bearing a redchecked tablecloth and a candle burning inside a dark orange glass very italian martha was the only person in the place the whitewashed stone walls arched over to form the curved ceiling and the way the candles cast shadows over the ribbing and contours made the place look like a white cave or the inside of that whale martha had imagined herself entering the first time she passed under the jawbone on west cliff the menu offered little choice pizza with tomato sauce with mushrooms or with prawns when the young waitress came martha settled for mushrooms whats the wine she asked weve got white or red yes but what kind is it the waitress shrugged medium what does that mean is it dry or sweet medium either she hadnt a clue or she was clearly taking no chances on offending anyone martha sighed all right ill have a glass of red she hoped it was dry whatever the quality she lit a cigarette and settled to wait it was chilly in the cellar despite the warm evening outside and she put her quilted jacket over her shoulders she had used it as a headrest during her afternoon on the beach and when she lifted it a few trapped grains of sand fell on the tablecloth she swept them onto the stone floor wincing at their gritty feel against her fingertips she had read until the incoming tide had driven her away from the beach then she had gone back to the guesthouse for a bath she had got sweaty sitting in the sun all afternoon with her jeans on and her shirt buttoned up to the neck after that feeling restless and edgy she had gone walking nowhere in particular for a couple of hours until hunger had driven her in search of somewhere to eat while she waited for her pizza she rummaged in her holdall for the smooth hard paperweight for the umpteenth time that day yes it was still there she needed to touch it her talisman to bolster her resolve at last the waitress returned with a small thincrusted pizza and a glass of wine it was dry some kind of cheap and ordinary chianti but at least drinkable the pizza was barely edible the crust was like tough cardboard and about six slices of canned mushroom lay on top of a watery spread of tomato saucecompletely lacking in spicing or herbal ingredientsthat dribbled over the edge when she cut into it still it wasnt fish and chips she had that at least to be grateful for she ate as much as she could manage and soon found herself getting full a young couple came in looked around the cavern suspiciously and took a corner table in the shadows they held hands and made eyes at one another in the candlelight martha felt sick she ordered a cappuccino wondering how that would turn out and lit another cigarette she still had time to kill the cappuccino turned out to be half a cup of nescafé with what tasted like condensed milk all churned up by a steam machine and dusted with a few grains of chocolate the lovers talked in whispers occasionally laughing and stroking one anothers bare arms on the tablecloth martha could stand it no longer she demanded the bill rather snappily as the waitress was dashing off with the couples order it was still a good ten minutes before it arrived not bothering to leave a tip martha took the slip of paper upstairs and paid a sullen young man who actually did look italian at the till outside it was already getting dark the narrow channels of water left in the harbor rocked and twisted the strings of red and yellow lights in their oily mirror it was almost nine oclock and the tide was well on its way out the man called jack had left the pub at a quarter to ten the previous evening though the whole scene had the appearance of a ritual to martha she couldnt be sure he would leave at exactly the same time again or even if hed be in the pub for one thing the darts gamepart of the ritualmight last longer what was even worse was that he might leave with his friend still martha planned simply to follow him if she could and find out where he lived even if he didnt leave alone he was bound to go home eventually it was her intention to lean against the iron railing close to the pub near the jawbone at the top of west cliff and wait for him to come out she would take note of which way he walked and would follow she had thought of going inside the lucky fisherman again alone this time but that would only draw attention to her he might even talk to her and try to pick her up then everybody would see them that was too dangerous to be worth the risk if she got there for nine thirty she would probably be all right he would hardly leave before then more likely later than earlier that left her time for a quick nip to calm her nerves she went into the first pub she saw a bustling tourist place and ordered a double whisky she drank it slowly so it wouldnt go straight to her head the last thing she needed was to get drunk but the cardboard pizza should be enough to soak up anything that came along in the next hour or so at quarter past nine when she could wait no longer she set off for the lucky fisherman it was dark by then and the towns usual illuminations were all on it took her five minutes to reach her waiting place once there she leaned forward on the railing and looked over first at st marys basking in its sandy light directly opposite then to her left out to sea beyond the pincerlike piers where all was dark she could see the thin white line of waves breaking on the sand she looked at her watch nine thirtyfive it seemed to be taking forever time for a cigarette no one but the occasional courting couple ambled by they would pause for a moment arm in arm look out to sea by captain cooks statue perhaps kiss and then walk around the corner by the white hotels along north terrace a strong fishy smell drifted up from the harbor martha remembered it was thursday evening the fishing boats would be coming in tomorrow nine fortysix he was late must be having trouble getting that last double twenty or whatever it was he needed she pictured him carrying his empty glass over to the bar and saying well thats my limit for tonight see you tomorrow bobby yes he would be there he had actually said so she remembered see you tomorrow bobby and bobby would say night jack as usual any moment he would be walking out of that door martha was hardly breathing her chest felt tight with excitement and apprehension she ground out the cigarette and glanced over at the pub at ten oclock it happened the door rattled open and one manher manwalked out in his dark jersey and baggy jeans she stayed where she was as if rooted to the spot her hands frozen to the railing she must try to look like a casual tourist she told herself just admiring the nighttime view st marys the abbey ruin the lights reflected in the harbor a slight breeze ruffled her hair and brushed along her cheek like cold fingers he was walking in her direction toward the cook statue she turned her head to watch him coming how it happened she wasnt sure perhaps it was just the sudden movement or maybe the light from a street lamp had caught her face as she turned but he saw her she could have sworn that he smiled and his eyes glittered more than usual he started walking toward her she felt pure terror as if her very bone marrow had turned to ice he walked up beside her and rested his hands on the railing too hello he said in that familiar hoarse voice lovely night isnt it martha could hardly catch her breath she was shaking so much that she had to clutch the railings tight to stay on her feet but she had to go through with it it was too late to back off now she turned to face him hello she said in a voice that she hoped wasnt trembling too much dont you remember me kirsten the doctor insisted that kirsten leave the hospital in a wheelchair though by then she was quite capable of walking unaided the demand was made even more ridiculous when she reached the top of the front steps and had to get up out of the chair and walk down them her fathers mercedes was parked right outside with galen in front carrying her things and one parent on each side kirsten made her way toward it at the car galenwho true to his word had visited her almost every day that weekshook hands with her father said goodbye to her mother who inclined her head regally and gave kirsten a peck on the cheek he had learned she noticed not to expect too much from her physically though she still hadnt told him the full extent of her injuries are you sure i cant offer you a lift anywhere her father asked him no thank you galen said the stations not much of a walk and its out of your way ill be fine back or front her father asked kirsten back please in the spacious rear of the car she could stretch out her head propped up against the window on a cushion blanket over her knees and watch the world go by are you sure you want me to go ahead galen asked her through the open window kirsten nodded be sensible galen theres no point missing the start of term if you do that you might as well not bother and i cant persuade you to come with me not yet no i told you dont worry about me ill be okay and youll join me soon yes she had finally managed to convince him to go to toronto partly by insisting that she was fine and needed only rest and partly by promising to join him as soon as she felt well enough when he agreed she wasnt sure if it was due to the logic of her arguments or because she had given him an easy way of getting off the hook he had acted a little stranger each daydistant embarrassedand kirsten had come to believe that perhaps there was something in what sarah had hinted about men friends turning funny when women became victims of sexual attacks also hugo and damon had sent more flowers and messages through sarah but they hadnt visited again kirsten was beginning to feel rather like a pariah in a way it suited her for at the moment what she wanted above all was to be left alone galen stretched his arm through the window and patted kirstens hand take care he said and remember i want to see a full recovery soon kirsten smiled at him and the car pulled away she watched him waving as the mercedes headed down the road until it turned a corner and she could see him no longer her father cleared his throat i suppose youd like to drop by the flat first and pick up a few things he suggested kirsten didnt in particular want to set foot in her tiny bedsit again but neither did she want her parents to think she had lost all interest in life even if some of her deepest feelings were numb and her instincts were beyond her control she could still make an effort to behave in the normal accepted manner they seemed dispirited enough as it was her mother had more or less accused her already of not trying hard enough to snap out of it and her father had become more and more resigned and distant if she showed no interest at all in her possessions they would only worry more so she said yes and offered directions appearances were important to her parents the car slid smoothly away from the gloomy victorian hospital and toward the student area of town rows of tall old houses in which entire families and servants once used to live blackened by two hundred years of industry and emptied by a succession of changesthe breakup of the family unit the great war the depression the inability of most people to afford servantsthey had fallen into the hands of local businessmen who transformed the once magnificent rooms with their high ceilings and fixtures where the chandeliers used to hang into small flats or bedsitsas many to a building as they could manageand rented them to students kirsten had an attic room in a culdesac near the park after spending her first year feeling miserable in a bright noisy student residence she had been happy there for the last two years as the three of them got out of the sleek silvergray car she noticed people along the street looking out through their curtains it must be quite a spectacle she supposed finding a mercedes parked in such a place where the cobbles still stuck through the various attempts at tarmac torn newspapers chip wrappers empty cigarette packets and cellophane paper littered the pavement and gutters weeds and unmown grass consumed the garden in the hallway which looked as if it hadnt been swept for a month neat piles of mail lay on a rickety old table the timeswitch kirsten pressed revealed a bare bulb on each landing and cobwebs in the high cornices the walls were painted a color somewhere between eggshell blue and institutional greenpainted that is to say some years agoand the high ceilings were pucewhat sarah called puke in the light of the unshaded sixtywatt bulbs the place looked even worse than it was as they climbed the stairs kirsten was aware of her mothers stiff disapproval on entry she seemed to have held her breath and not let it out for fear of having to breathe in again feeling foolish as she did so kirsten knocked on her own door she still had a key but the room was officially sarahs now and she couldnt just barge in she hoped sarah didnt have a naked man in her bed the door opened kirsten noted with relief the empty room behind sarah who wasnt even wearing one of her calculatedly offensive tshirts that day instead she wore white trousers and a baggy blue sweatshirt with ucla printed across the front kirstie love she yelled her fine porcelain features broke into a smile anyone would have expected to shatter them and she flung her arms around kirsten kirsten returned the embrace then broke away gently she didnt react as badly as she had to galens touch but she still felt herself drawing back inside holding in my mother and father she stood back and introduced her parents who hovered in the doorway cup of tea sarah asked thatd be lovely kirsten looked at her father who nodded her mother shook her head slightly and looked at her watch not for me thank you dear we really must set off soon if were to be home this evening she directed the comment at her husband oh weve time for a cup of tea he said smiling at sarah and sitting down in the scuffed red armchair with winged arms it was kirstens favorite the spot where she had sat to do her reading and make notes for essays the lshaped room was just about large enough to hold four people all it contained was the two matching armchairs in front of the gas fire a threequarter mattress on the floor beneath the window a small clothes cupboard set in the wall and a desk and bookshelves by the other wall a portable stereo cassette player stood on one of the shelves beside a rack of tapes sarah was playing bruce springsteen singing nebraska she turned down the volume before she went to put the kettle on in the kitchenette which was tucked away in the short end of the l and separated from the rest of the room by a thin red curtain kirsten sat on the mattress which had always had to double as a sofa when she had guests she gazed over at the poster on the wall above the pillowsa print of van goghs sunflowersand remembered the first time she and galen had made love on that very mattress the night after the english department christmas dance at the start of their second year as she thought about it and about all the other wonderful times they had slept there together her loins ached with longing and loss she could still see him standing by the roadside waving of course she would never see him again it was for his own good her mother made a point of standing by the window with her arms tightly folded whether it was the sight of the parkthe scene of the crimeat the end of the street that intrigued her or whether she was just keeping an eye on the merc kirsten didnt know she could sense her mothers disapproval of the bedsit nose in the air she seemed only a hairbreadth away from running her finger down the wall to see how much dirt came off if she did that kirsten thought she would run off screaming for the maids in two seconds flat her parents had never visited the roomor even the citybefore the roughandready atmosphere and basic living conditions must have been just as much of a shock to their tender southern sensibilities as they had been to hers at first over two years though she had had a chance to get used to it at her age too she was more concerned about parties books films plays and love than she was about living in a spotless mansion unlike her mother kirsten had never been particularly houseproud even her room at home had always been a mess surfaces hadnt mattered too much as long as she had been having fun she washed the dishes regularly dusted and went to the launderette once a week that was it besides these houses were so old and decrepit you couldnt do much with them even if you tried they were only temporary places to pass through not to make nests in sarah came back with the cracked teapot and three mugs kirstens father accepted his sugarless tea graciously and her mother continued to stand like a statue by the window her father made small talk with sarah while kirsten made a pretense of searching the room for the things she was supposed to want she picked up the small pile of mailmostly junkfrom the desk and shoved a few clothes and a random selection of books into the old suitcase in the cupboard then she sat down to finish her tea which had cooled by then is that all you want sarah asked for the moment ive got plenty of stuff back homeclothes and that but the books hang on to them for me will you i think i need a rest from literature sarah eyed the shelves still more than threequarters full i suppose its about time i read shelley and coleridge she said smiling though id planned on a summer with thomas hardy and george eliot i dont know about the linguistics and phonetics stuff though you know i never could understand all that kirsten shrugged and took one book down for her thats a good one the prof who wrote it is supposed to be able to tell what village you come from just by your accent they say hes usually accurate within ten miles or so i never got as good as that but thanks said sarah ill give it a try they must all kirsten thought be conscious of her mother looming over them radiating waves of discomfort were the circumstances different she might have gone into one of her why did you have to leave a clean decent home spiels even her father might have reminded her of how he had tried to persuade her to go to a university closer to home instead of moving so far away but shed had to fly the coop she knew she wouldnt have been able to stand living at home while all the other students were free to live their own lives for the first time how humiliating it would have been to have to run off back to mummy and daddys in time for tea after the milton lecture and the further the better she had thought while offering convincing arguments about the quality of teaching and the reputations of professors i think we really should go dear her father said finally looking for somewhere to put down his mug kirsten got up took it from him and carried it into the kitchen she was ready too shed had enough of this tension and pretense if everyone was going to treat her as if she were made of glass for the rest of her life then she wanted out she began to get an inkling of what the physically handicapped must feel like everyone acting so embarrassed condescending and pitying and trying so hard not to offend them or refer to their disability in any way sex and babies would now be unmentionable subjects back home she realized along with all the other dirty words taboo dont mention youknowwhats her mother would whisper to visitors at the door or youll upset poor kirsten she was tired all she wanted to do was crawl in the back of the car and be chauffeured home quickly and quietly sarah came down the stairs with them and hugged kirsten again on the doorstep dont worry she said ill take care of everything oh i forgot what about your tapes its all right sarah you hang on to them ive got as much music as i want at home and it was true she had a deluxe stereo in her spacious bedroom the one her father had bought her for her eighteenth birthday it was too bulky and expensive to cart all the way up to university so she had made do with the portable system and kept the other at home to enjoy on holidays sarah said she would write soon and come down to visit when she could and with that they were off necks craned behind windows to watch them go perhaps kirsten thought its not so much the posh car as her new celebrity status theres the girl that nearly got herself killed by that maniac they would be saying to themselves how odd the words sounded in her mind got herself killed as if what happened had been somehow her own fault her mother was clearly relieved to be out of the room and back in the more congenial and appropriate environment of the mercedes the two of them had her father told her been staying in the big hotel near the station all the time she had been in the hospital poorer or less powerful people kirsten knew would have been able to spare neither the time off work nor afford the luxury she had always taken her familys wealth and status for granted as the young do but now for the first time she was conscious of privilege the private room in the hospital the family home a renovated tudor mansion in brierley coombe near bath and the comfortable mercedes that glided down the m toward it through a thin drizzle she watched the dull south yorkshire landscape of slag heaps and motionless pit wheels flash by and soon they were passing turnoffs for nottingham and derby kirstens father was a motorway driver as a rule even if it meant more mileage he would generally stick to the motorways and drive as fast as he could get away with but this time she realized as he turned off the m near northampton before it swung southeast toward london they were taking the scenic route perhaps he thought a good dose of the green and pleasant land would prove therapeutic as if to prove the point the rain slackened off and the sun burst through before they had even skirted the south midlands kirsten was comfortable in the back the mercedes seemed to float on air without making a sound and after a few attempts at making conversation her parents had fallen quiet too her father switched on radio three and kirsten relaxed to the busoni piano music that was playing they passed through banbury and chipping norton and soon entered the cotswolds by then it was indeed a perfect day in the english countryside blue sky one or two fleecy white clouds drifting over rounded green hills and quaint villages sunlight warmed the weathered limestone cottages with their flagged roofs and gardens full of roses they drove straight through stowonthewold which was jampacked with parked cars and tourists and finally stopped for a pub lunch at a small sixteenthcentury inn near bourtononthewater kirstens mother seemed at ease there back in her natural environment of gentility and wellpolished brassware kirsten picked at a ploughmans lunch after the intravenous drip and so long on hospital food she seemed to have lost her appetite after lunch they took a stroll around the town walked along by the river and then set off for the last leg of the journey kirsten dozed uneasily as an interminable mahler symphony played disturbed even during the clear daylight hours by her dreams of the dark man and the light man cutting at her body and then on the long hill that wound down into bath she felt the first twinge of fire deep in her loins she ignored it and looked on the familiar city its light stone glinting in the sun below but before they even reached pulteney road the fiery shooting pains between her legs had her almost doubled up gritting her teeth in the back of the car martha remember you the man looked puzzled then he smiled and jerked his thumb back toward the pub you were in the fisherman last night with your boyfriend i remember that hes not my boyfriend martha said besides hes moved on now martha didnt know whether to feel angry or glad that he didnt remember her it was an insult yes but one that she could use to her advantage she had stopped shaking now and her blood was warming a little all she had to do was keep reminding herself what he was what he had done and she would find the courage she needed from her anger and disgust this was her destiny after all her mission it was the reason she had survived what many had not she still found it difficult to look at him but when she did she noticed in the dim glow of a streetlight that he was not as old as she had first thought late twenties perhaps or early thirties at the most for some reason she had expected him to be older he stood just an inch or so taller than she with a shaggy thatch of dark hair and the kind of facial growth that looks like a perpetual five oclock shadow just as on the previous evening he was wearing a navyblue guernsey jersey and baggy dark pants made of some heavy material he had a strong local accent the voice was right she was certain and the face she had to trust in faith and instinct now logic alone could never be enough to lead visionaries to their grails on holiday he asked leaning easily against the railing beside her you could say that martha looked straight ahead as she spoke over the water st marys stood squat as bright as polished sand in its floodlight the red and blue and amber lights twisted like oil slicks in the dark harbor below footsteps clicked behind hera woman in highheeled shoesand further away down in the town itself a group of noisy kids came out of a pub shouting and whooping out to sea something splashed in the water its just that most people who live here dont really notice its beauty the man went on i mean when its all around you the sea and all you hardly bother to stand and gawp at it am i so obvious he laughed i stand and look myself sometimes especially way out where its all dark and you just get a tiny speck of light moving across in the distance i often wonder what it must be like out on the boats like that in the dark youre not a fisherman me good lord no whatever gave you that idea i have a small boat and i go out sometimes but just for myself and always during the day i justoh never mind as a matter of fact im a joiner by trade do a lot of work for the theater too in seasonchief scenery fixer and bottle washer martha was confused she had so much expected her quarry to be a fisherman now she thought about it though she didnt know how she had got that idea fixed in her mind in the first place perhaps it was the smell the fishy smell but anyone who lived by the sea might pick that up easily enough and he did say he went fishing from time to time no she told herself she had to be right no excuses instinct have you been doing it long she asked whatthe joinery or the theater martha shrugged both i suppose since i left school the only thing i was any good at was woodwork and ive always been interested in the theater not acting just the practical stuffthe illusions it creates and you have you worked anywhere else or are you here all the time ive traveled a fair bit the provinces theres not enough work to keep me here all the time but its where i live home i suppose born and brought up aye born and bred in whitby you didnt answer my question martha felt a chill in the wind off the sea and put her jacket over her shoulders again what question i asked about you martha laughed and pushed back a lock of hair that the breeze had displaced oh im not very interesting im afraid im from portsmouth just a dull typist in a dull office youll be used to the sea then pardon the sea portsmouth s a famous naval base isnt it oh yes the sea the most ive had to do with it is a hovercraft trip to the isle of wight and even that made me feel sick he laughed look would you like to go for a drink somewhere i hope you dont think me forward or anything but not at all no martha thought quickly she couldnt go to a pub with him that was for certain so far her only link with him was the lounge of the lucky fisherman and she didnt imagine anyone but keith had noticed their fleeting eye contact the previous evening but to go about publicly would be courting disaster well i dont really fancy a drink its far too lovely an evening to spend sitting in a noisy smoky bar why dont we just walk fine with me where martha wanted to avoid the town where the pubs would soon be disgorging groups of drinkjolly tourists and locals who might just remember seeing the two of them together if they stuck to quieter dimly lit streets nobody would notice them and she had to get him alone somewhere somewhere private no doubt he would have the same thing in mind he was certainly a cool one no matter what he pretended though she was certain that he must remember her how could he forget and how could she forget what he was she thought of the beach and the caves lets wander down toward the pier she said and take it from there okay by the way im jack jack grimley he stuck out his hand martha martha browne she shook the hand it was rough with callusesfrom sawing and planing planks of wood no doubtand touching it made her shudder pleased to meet you martha they took the steps and cut across khyber pass down to pier road it was after ten thirty now and all the amusement arcades had closed for the night only a few pairs of young lovers strolled by the auction sheds and they were all absorbed in one another they walked out on the pier and sniffed the sea air martha lit a cigarette and wrapped her jacket a little tighter around her throat against the chill out there jack hadnt tried to touch her or make any kind of a pass so far but she knew it was bound to happen soon for now he seemed content to stand quietly as she smoked watching the distant lights out in the dark sea she wondered when he would pounce the pier was too open it was dark all around them but the whole thing stood out rather like a long stone stage in the water it was the kind of place where he might make his first move thougha fleeting caress or a comforting arm around the shoulders to lull her into a false sense of security fancy the beach she asked dropping her cigarette onto the pier and stepping on it i like to listen to the waves why not he walked beside her back toward pier road and down the stone steps to the deserted beach a thin line of foam broke along the sands and after that came the sucking hissing sound of the sea drawing back the moon now almost threequarters full stood high and shed its sickly light on the water it seemed to float there like an incandescent jellyfish just below the waters surface they walked close to the rock face where the sand was drier it was pitchdark down there apart from the moon they were hidden from the town by the slightly concave curve of the cliffs at last jack took hold of her arm gently this is it she thought tensing she tried to act normally and not freeze as she usually did when a man tried to touch her she had to distract him for a moment are you sure you dont remember she asked dipping her free hand into her bag remember what me it still seemed the ultimate insult that he pretended not to remember her after all that had happened i looked a bit different she said her hand closing on the paperweight warmth and certainty flooded her senses he laughed martha im sure id remember if id seen you bef martha wasnt my name then it wasnt at all as shed imagined the way she had made it happen so many times in her minds eye he was supposed to just fall down neatly and that was that but he didnt when the heavy paperweight smacked into his temple and made a dull crack he only dropped to his knees groaned and put his hand up to the wound in disbelief blood bubbled between his fingers and glistened in the moonlight then he turned and stared at her his glittering eyes wide open for a moment martha froze she just stood there hesitating sure that she couldnt go on she had been through this situation so many times both in her waking mind and in her dreams but it wasnt happening the way it was supposed to then out of fear and outrage she hit out again and heard an even louder crack this time he pitched forward into the sand but he wouldnt lay still his body jerked and convulsed in spasms like a marionette out of control his stubby fingers clawed at the sand martha stood and watched horrified as the prone figure danced on the sand his arms twitched and his whole body seemed to shudder as if it was about to explode and shatter then all of a sudden it stopped and he lay still at last the blood around his head looked viscous in the faint white light martha bent forward and put her hands on her knees she took a few deep breaths and tried to slow her racing heartbeat she had almost blown it reality never happened the way she thought it would she had left so much of the business to her instinct and imagination that she should have known to allow for things not going exactly as planned at least it was done now and he lay at her feet even if the deed itself had been more horrible and frightening than she had expected but it wasnt over yet she couldnt just leave him out here on the beach and she couldnt stay in the open herself any longer glancing around nervously martha steeled herself and set to work gasping for breath she struggled with the heavy body and slowly dragged it into the mouth of the nearest cave the opening was a rough arch about six feet high but it narrowed quickly the further in it went in all it only extended about fifteen feet into the cliff curving as it went and ending almost in a point but that was enough for marthas purposes the dark walls glistened with slime as if the very rock itself were sweating in anticipation as soon as she had hauled the body inside the opening martha paused and listened it was after eleven now the pubs would have closed and some people might fancy a drunken walk on the beach moments later someone giggled by the pier and then she could hear voices coming closer quickly she braced herself and heaved the body by its ankles back into the cave as far as it would go just beyond the slight bend in the middle she almost screamed when she snagged a broken nail on one of his woollen socks and couldnt free it without a struggle finally she got him as deep in the cave as she could the effort exhausted hersweat beaded on her foreheadbut at least she was safe now the slanting moonlight only illuminated the first four or five feet of the interior and beyond that it was cut off by the top of the arched entrance nobody could see them so far back behind small boulders set in the sand past the kink in the wall cautiously martha peered from behind a boulder and saw a young couple framed in the caves opening she held her breath they were about thirty yards away down by the breaking waves even at that distance she could catch fragments of their conversation late lets go a minutepeacefulgive me nocoldcome on then there was more laughter and the boy started chasing the girl back toward the steps martha breathed out it was quiet again just to make sure that no other revelers were going to come and spoil her work she waited hardly breathing for about fifteen minutes when nothing else had happened by then she pulled the body forward into the patch of moonlight near the caves entrance to make sure he was dead grimleys body crunched over the dead and driedout shellfish that gleamed like tiny bones in the moonlight strands of dry seaweed crackled under marthas feet and the smell of sea wrack salt and rotten fish was strong in her nostrils a small dark shape scuttled over the sand back in the shadows she shuddered outside there was only the even quiet rhythm of waves breaking and retreating first martha washed the paperweight in a small rock pool dried it off on her shirt and put it back in her bag she checked her hands and clothing but could see no blood she would have to look more closely later when she got back to her room lastly she forced herself to look at the body blood veiled one side of his face where his eye bulged from its socket and seemed to stare right at her his left temple was shattered in horror martha put a finger to it and felt the bone fragments shift under her touch like broken eggshell the second blow had caught the top of his skull and she could trace the deep indentation again the bones had splintered and this time her finger touched something squelchy and matted with hair she shivered and a cry caught in her throat as she began to heave kneeling beside him she vomited on the sand until she thought she would never stop the ancient rotten sea smell stuck in her nostrils and the blood and brain matter were smeared all over her fingers when she could catch her breath again she washed her hands in the rock pool and knelt there gasping until she had controlled her heartbeat she couldnt bear being close to the body any longer crawling to the mouth of the cave she listened for a few moments it was all quiet on the beach except for the crash and hiss of the waves martha slipped out of the cave like a ghost in the moonlight and set off back to the guesthouse kirsten youll have to expect a bit of pain now and then said dr craven writing on her prescription pad with a black felttip pen traumatic injuries often cause extreme pain but dont worry it wont last forever ill prescribe some analgesic it should help she sat back and handed the slip of paper to kirsten behind the doctor a brusque woman in her early forties with severely cropped gray hair steady blue eyes and a beak of a nose kirsten could see the small norman church and the village green with its two superb copper beeches rose beds little white fence and benches where the old people sat and gossiped she could even hear the finches and tits twittering beyond the open window brierley coombe home the previous evening she had managed to keep the pain from her parents she had simply claimed tiredness after the journey then taken four aspirin and a long hot bath before going to bed the pain receded and she had actually slept well for the first time since the attack dr craven leaned forward and tapped a blue folder the stethoscope around her neck swung forward and clipped the edge of the desk ive got all your details kirsten she said and ive been on the telephone to dr masterson at the hospital if anything at all bothers you please dont hesitate to come and see me and id like you to drop by once a week anyway just to see how youre doing all right kirsten nodded dr masterson she hadnt even known his name the man who had probably saved her life one of her benefactors anyway she didnt know the name of the person who had so fortunately been walking his dog on the night of her attack either but dr masterson she remembered his dark complexion and his deeply lined brow how he always looked cross but acted shyly and kind she had even invented stories about him to pass the time his father must have been an army officer serving in india she had decideda captain in the medical corps most likelyand he had married a highcaste indian woman after independence they had come to england the ease with which she could make up stories about people on so little evidence always surprised her it was a skill or a curse that she had had since early childhood when she had filled notebooks with stick drawings and family histories of invented characters if she could make up lives for others she thought then she could probably do the same for herself that would certainly be preferable to telling the truth to everyone she met already on her way to the doctors surgery that morning she had noticed neighborspeople who had known her since childhoodgiving her those pitying looks what was worse was that one of themcarrie linton a stuckup busybody shed never likedhad given her a different kind of look more accusing than pitying kirsten what oh sorry doctor i was daydreaming i said make sure you eat well and get plenty of rest the healing process is doing very nicely or dr masterson wouldnt have approved your coming home but youre still convalescent and dont forget it of course and if you have any difficulty at all in adjusting to your condition i can recommend a very good doctor in bath a specialist adjusting condition good lord thought kirsten she makes it sound as if im pregnant or something i mean psychologically and emotionally dr craven went on her eyes fixing on the diagram of the human circulatory system on the wall it might not be an easy road you know a psychiatrist dr craven tapped her pen on the desk only if you feel the need they can help you know theres no stigma attached these days especially shes embarrassed kirsten thought just like all the rest they dont know what to do with me in cases such as mine she offered finishing the sentence well yes dr craven seemed to miss the irony in kirstens voice the corners of her lips twitched in one of her rare brief smiles you are rather unique you know few women if any have ever survived an attack from such a maniac i suppose not kirsten said slowly i hadnt really thought of it that way like jack the ripper you mean did anyone survive him im afraid i dont know criminology isnt my forte she leaned forward what im saying kirsten is that there may be some resultant emotional trauma i want you to know that help is available you only have to ask for it thank you the doctor sat back in her chair and peered at kirsten over the top of her halfmoon glasses how do you feel she asked feel not so bad the pains eased a little now no i mean emotionally what do you feel what do i feel i dont know really just blank numb i cant remember anything about the attack do you keep running over events in your mind yes but i still cant remember it keeps me awake sometimes i cant concentrate for it i cant even sit down and read a book i used to love reading the amnesia may only be temporary i dont know if i want to remember thats understandable of course as are all your feelings youve suffered a tremendous shock kirsten not just to your body but to your whole being all your symptomsemotional numbness bad dreams inability to concentratetheyre all perfectly normal given the circumstances awful but normal in fact id be worried if you didnt feel like that you feel no anger no rage no should i itll come later i suppose i do feel that id like to kill him the man who did this to me but its more of a cold feeling than an angry one if you can understand what i mean she shrugged still i dont imagine ill get the chance will i i wouldnt know him from adam no but lets hope the police find him soon before he can attack anyone else such people dont usually stop at one and the next victim might not be so lucky dr craven stood up and held out her hand dont forget what i said take good care of yourself and ill see you next week kirsten shook her hand and left outside the sun was shining in a clear blue sky the rounded hills that fringed the village seemed to glow bright green with some kind of inner light as if they formed the backdrop to a painters vision kirsten put her hands in her pockets and ambled along the high street not much there really a pub the village hall an construction the newest building in brierley coombe the shops converted cottages most of thempost office grocers butchers chemists newsagents the village stood on the edge of the mendips between bath and wells and it had its share of thatched roofs and awardwinning gardens orderly riots of roses petunias periwinkles hollyhocks and nasturtiums assaulted kirstens senses as she walked by the trim fences the place always reminded her of those picturepostcard villages in english murder mysteriesmiss marples st mary mead for examplewhere everyone knew his or her place and nothing ever changed but no one ever got murdered in brierley coombe kirsten took the prescription from her pocket and walked into the chemists it was only a small place more decorative than functional and one of the few chemists shops that still kept those huge red green and blue bottles on a shelf high in the window the sunlight filtered through them onto mr hayess wrinkled face he had a good dispensary kirsten knew especially for female ailments hello kirsten he said with a smile i noticed youd come back sorry to hear about your trouble thank you kirsten said she hoped he wasnt going to go on and tell her how you couldnt be too careful these days could you he was that kind of man but perhaps something in her voice or expression put him off his stroke anyway he just looked puzzled and went to fill the prescription immediately with the painkillers in her pocket kirsten headed for the house brierley coombe had been her home ever since the family had moved from bath itself when she was six although the village was equidistant from bristol and bath they had always frequented the latter for shopping and entertainment her mother regarded bristol big city once busy portas too vulgar and kirsten had consequently only been there twice in her life it hadnt seemed so bad to her but then neither had the north of england kirsten had no friends left in brierley coombe and the way she felt now that was a blessing the last thing she wanted was to have to go around explaining herself to people indeed she had to think hard to remember ever having friends or even seeing any young people there at all that was another way in which it resembled an agatha christie villagethere were no children nor could she remember any it was absurd she knew as she had been a child there herself and played with others then but there was no village school and try as she might she couldnt bring to mind the voices of children playing on the green over the years they had all drifted apart they went to prep schools first of course then on to public schools as boarders as she had done for there were no poor people in brierley coombe after that it was universityusually oxford or cambridge and a profession in the city perhaps when they had inherited their parents houses and made their fortunes or retired from public office they would come home to spend their remaining days tending the garden and playing bridge the peace and quiet that kirsten had enjoyed at home during the long summer and easter holidays had always suited her after the hectic social life up at university she was a bright and studious girl and managed to get plenty of work donebut she was easily distracted by a good film a party or the chance of a couple of drinks and a chat with friends at home she had usually been able to catch up with her work and read ahead for the next term but what would she do with her time now her student days were over her life was utterly changed if not ruined entirely she didnt know if she would be able to pick up the pieces let alone put them back together again come to that she didnt know if there were any pieces left perhaps she didnt even care she was still thinking about it when she opened the gate and walked down the broad path to the housemore of a mansion than a cottage her mother was in the garden doing something nasty to the honeysuckle with her secateurs gardening and bridge they were the strict borders of her mothers existence when she saw kirsten coming she wiped her brow and put down the clippers which flashed in the light and shielded her eyes from the sun as she looked up at her daughter a difficult smile slowly forced the corners of her lips up but it didnt reach her eyes it was going to be a long haul this recovery kirsten thought with a sudden chill of fear it wasnt going to be easy at all martha the seagulls were grotesquely distorted no longer sleek white bulletfaced birds their feathers were mottled with ash gray and their bodies were bloated almost beyond recognition they could hardly stand their wiry legs above webbed feet as yellow as egg yolk couldnt support their distended bellies which were stretched so tight that a pattern of blue veins bossed through the gray and white markings their wings creaked and flapped like old motheaten awnings in a storm as they tried to fly but mostly it was their faces that were different they still had seagull eyescold dark holes that knew nothing of mercy or pitybut their beaks were encased in long gelatinous snouts smeared with blood they still sounded like seagulls even though they could no longer fly they waddled on the dark sands and keened like the ghosts of a million tortured souls martha woke sweating in the early dawn outside the gulls were screeching circling they must have been at it for a while she thought as her heartbeat slowed she must have heard them in her sleep and her mind had translated the sound into the pictograph of a dream it was like dreaming of searching for a toilet when youve had a bit too much to drink and your body is trying to wake you up before your bladder bursts just the thought of moisture made martha thirsty she got up and drank a glass of water then crawled into bed again the sour taste of vomit still in her mouth unable to get back to sleep immediately she found herself thinking of the gulls as her allies she could imagine them with their sharp hooked beaks picking and pulling at the body in the cave snatching an eyeball loose or making an ear bleed did they never stop for them life seemed nothing more than a long drawnout feast one for which you had to go out and catch your own food and tear it to pieces while it was still alive had she become like them martha glanced at her watch that day she remembered high tide was chalked in as so the gulls couldnt have found the body unless it was floating on the waters surface already the cold north sea would have stuck its tongue into the cave and slurped jack grimleys corpse into its surging maw shivering with horror at what she had done martha turned on her side pulled the covers up to her chin and drifted back into an uneasy sleep with the paperweight in her hand and the harsh music of squabbling gulls echoing in her ears kirsten they came back again that night the dreams of slashing and slicing to invade kirstens childhood room the white knight and the black knight as she had come to call them both without faces this time they seemed to be trying to teach her something the black knight handed her a long ivoryhandled knife and she plunged it herself into the soft flesh of her thigh it sank as if into wax a little blood bubbled up around the edges of the cut but nothing much slowly she eased out the blade and watched the edges of torn skin draw together again like lips closing a pinkish bubble swelled and burst and all the time she didnt feel a thing not a thing somehow she knew the faceless white knight was smiling down at her martha the dead fish stared up at martha with glazed oily eyes pinkish red blood stained their gills and mouths and sunlight glinted on their silvery scales and pale bellies the fishy smell was strong in the air overpowering even the seas fresh ozone holidaymakers paused as they walked along st ann s staith and took photographs of the fish sales the people involved no doubt used to being camera fodder for tourists didnt even spare them a glance the auction sheds that friday morning were hives of activity earlier while martha had still been sleeping the boats had come in and the fishermen had unpacked their catches into iced boxes ready for the sales crab pots were stacked and nets lay spread by the sheds as martha watched a man hosed fish scales from the stone quay gulls gathered in a raucous cloud and occasionally one swooped down after a dropped fish of course martha realized they only sold the fish here they didnt clean them and gut them that must be done elsewherein canning factories perhaps where the loaded lorries were headed how little she really knew about the business it didnt matter now though did it odd that he had turned out not to be a fisherman after all but you cant be right about everything even so as she walked by and watched the sales she scanned the groups of fishermen by the railings and the auctioneers and buyers in the open sheds it was what she had planned to do and she was doing it anyway even though there was no longer any point martha felt strangely dazed and lightheaded as she walked down the staith toward the bridge she hadnt slept well after the gulls had woken her and the thought of what she had done haunted her at breakfast time shed been very hungry and had even eaten the fried bread she usually left the old couple at the window table were still there he grinning and even now winking while his wife glared with her beady eyes but all the others were gone or had changed into someone else martha was finding it hard to keep track the guests were all starting to look the same serious young honeymooners tired but optimistic couples with mischievous toddlers old people with gray hair and morning coughs she felt the same way she had on the only occasion she had tried marijuana she could see more sense more each line on the face the flecks of color in the eyes but ultimately it all added up to the same the more individual the people became to her the more they became alike she crossed the bridge bought a newspaper and turned up church street it was becoming a routine still this morning she needed waking up even more than usual there were important decisions to be made in the monks haven she sipped strong black coffee and smoked a cigarette while she flexed her brain on the crossword then she flipped through the headlines to see if there was anything interesting going on in the world there wasnt only for a short while when she had finished with the paper and still had some coffee and cigarette left did she allow herself to think of the previous evening it had been awful a million times worse than anything she had imagined she could still feel the loose fragments of bone shifting under her fingers and that soft pulpy mass like a wet sponge at the top of his head she didnt feel sorryhe had deserved everything he gotbut she was appalled and amazed at herself for really going through with it after leaving the body in the cave she had run down to the sea and rinsed her hands and her paperweight again before going back to the guesthouse she hadnt seen a soul on the way the door opened smoothly on its oiled hinges and the carpet muffled her ascent to her room once safe she had brushed her teeth three times but still hadnt been able to get rid of the bitter taste of vomit even now after the breakfast coffee and cigarettes she felt herself gagging as she recalled grimleys body jerking on the sand and those long minutes in the dank stinking cave the blood the staring eye the tide would have carried the body out to sea by now she wanted it to be found soon wanted to be there to enjoy all the fuss it wasnt because she was conceited or proud or anything but because the discovery was all part of the same event to go now would be like leaving a book unfinished and martha always finished the books she started even if she didnt like them surely when they found out the dead mans identity they would go to his home and find something to connect him with the atrocities he had committed a man like that couldnt avoid leaving some kind of evidence behind and martha wanted to be around when the full story hit the newspapers even if there was a little risk involved she wanted to stay to hear the gossip and whispers in the pubs and along the staithto know that she was the one who had rid the world of such a monster she knew nothing of the tides and currents but hoped the body would wash up soon somewhere nearby it would be too much to expect it to land back on whitby sands but it might drift only a short way up the coast to redcar saltburn runswick bay or staithes or even further down to robin hoods bay scarborough flamborough head or bridlington wherever it turned up she hoped it wouldnt take long she finished her coffee and stubbed out her cigarette it was eleven oclock already now that she had fulfilled the main part of her purpose here time was beginning to hang heavy all she could do was wait a much more passive activity than searching and planning to kill time until lunch she found herself again mounting the steps to st marys and the abbey ruins there were even more people about this time children racing one another to the top counting out loud as they did soeightyfour eightyfive eightysixold folk in elastic stockings wheezing as they went dogs with their tongues hanging out running back and forth as if they didnt know up from down martha climbed steadily counting under her breath again it came to though legend said it was hard to get the same figure twice at the top stood caedmons cross a thin twentyfoot upright length of stone tapering toward the top where a small cross was mounted the length of it was carved with medieval figuresdavid hilda and caedmon himselflike some sort of stone totem pole and at the bottom was the inscription to the glory of god and in memory of caedmon the father of english sacred song fell asleep hard by martha knew it wasnt that old though it had been carved and erected in not in the real caedmons time but it still had power she particularly loved the understated simplicity of fell asleep hard by when she had to die that was the way she would like to go again she thought of jack grimley and shivered as if someone had just walked across her grave getting her breath back after the long climbit came less easily since she had started smokingshe paused in the graveyard and looked at the town spread out beyond and below the cross she could easily pick out the dark monolithic tower of st hilda s at the top of her street and the stately row of white fourstory hotels at the cliffside end of east terrace she could see the whales jawbone too that entry to another world the rough sandy gravestones with their burntlooking knobbly tops stood in the foreground the trick of perspective made them look even bigger than the houses over the harbor martha turned and wandered into the church again a recorded lecture was in progress in the vestry it sounded tinny from constant playing she found herself drifting almost unconsciously toward the front of the church where below the tall ornate pulpit she slipped into the box marked for strangers only it was the same one shed been in before and again she felt that sense of luxurious isolation and wellbeing even the sounds of the tourists in the church with their whispered comments and clicking cameras were barely audible now in the hush she ran her fingertips over the green baize and knelt on a red patterned cushion there cut off from the rest of the world she offered up a prayer of a kind kirsten kirsten lay in bed late the next morning outside her window the birds sang and twittered in the trees and the village went about its business not that there was much of that occasionally she could hear the whirr of bicycle wheels passing by and once in a while the thrum of a delivery vans engine she put the empty coffee cup back on the traybreakfast in bed her mothers ideaand went to open the curtains sunlight burst through catching the cloud of dust motes that swirled in the air its all dead skin kirsten thought wondering where on earth shed heard that probably one of those educational television programs science for the masses she opened the window and warm air rushed to greet her carrying the heavy scent of honeysuckle a fat bee droned around the opening then seemed to decide there was nothing for him in there and meandered down to the garden instead kirstens room reflected just about every stage of her transition from child to worldly student of language and literature even her teddy bear sat on the dressing table propped against the wall stretching she wandered around touching things her feet sinking deep into the walltowall carpet the walls and ceiling were painted a kind of sea green or was it blue it really depended on the light kirsten decided those greeny blue colors often looked much the same to her turquoise cerulean azure ultramarine but today with the light shimmering on it as on ripples in the ocean it was definitely the color of the mediterranean she remembered from family visits to the riviera the walls seemed to swirl and eddy like the water in a hockney swimmingpool painting when kirsten stood in the middle of the room she felt as if she were floating in a cave of water or frozen at its center like a flower in a glass paperweight it was two rooms really the bed itself with a threequartersize mattress far too soft for kirstens taste was set in a little recess up a stair from the large main room just below the small window also tucked away in there were the dresser and wall cupboards for her clothes down the step was the spacious studycumsittingroom her desk stood at a right angle to the picture window so that she could simply turn her head and look out at the round green mendips as she worked there she had written essays during her summer vacations and made notes as she read ahead for the following term above the desk her father had fixed a few bookshelves to the wall on brackets apart from some old childhood favorites like black beauty the secret garden grimms fairy tales and a few enid blytonsfamous five secret sevenmost of the books were to do with her university courses they were either for subjects she had studied over the past three years brought home to save space in her bedsit or books she had bought secondhand usually in bath for courses she had intended to take in the future like the ones on medieval history and literatureincluding bedes an ecclesiastical history of the english people julian of norwichs revelations of divine love and the anonymous the cloud of unknowing but kirsten had never taken that course instead she had chosen at the last moment special tutorials on coleridge with a visiting world expert in the field an american academic who had turned out to be a crashing bore far more interested in trying to look up the frontrow womens skirts than in the wisdom of biographia literaria by the side of the shelves was a corkboard still spiked with old postcards from friends visiting kenya nepal or finland photos of her with sarah and galen and poems she had clipped from the tls there were no posters of pop stars in the room she had taken them all down last year thinking herself far too mature for such things the only work of art that enhanced her wall was a superb monet print which looked wonderfully alive in the sunlight that rippled over it she also had an armchair with a footrest for reading in and the expensive stereo system her records were mostly a mixture of popular classicsbeethovens ninth tchaikovskys pathétique which she had bought after seeing ken russells the music lovers at the university film society and the soundtrack of amadeusand a few dated pop albums rolling stones wham u david bowie kate bush tom waits she wasnt interested in any of these now and had a hard time choosing the music she wanted to listen to finally she settled for the pathétique and dressed as the music swelled and surged from its slow and quiet beginning but she couldnt stand it as soon as the lush romantic theme came in she snatched the needle from the turntable scratching the records surface as she did so the burning pain in her loins had receded but she had a headache that made music difficult to bear she was sure it was caused by that dark mass lodged in her mind if she closed her eyes she could even see it a globe blacker than the rest of the darkness behind her eyes a black hole perhaps that sucked everything in and turned it inside out or the beginning of an emotional or spiritual cancer about to spread through her whole being kirsten sat down crosslegged on the carpet holding her head in her hands with the music gone she could hear the birds again someone called a greeting out in the lane she could even hear her mother pottering around downstairs it was after ten oclock and such a beautiful day outside that she felt she ought to go for a walk any other day she would have been up before breakfast and down to the woods at the back of the house for a leisurely stroll under the lightdappled leaves not today though after ten and she still had no idea what to do with herself she tried to look ahead into the future but it was all darkness before that night in the park she had never really given it a thought somehow she had always believed the future would take care of itself and would be just as privileged as bright and exciting as the past but now she had no idea what to do with her life whenever she thought of such things her head began to ache even more as if the bubble were growing inside it and pushing at the inside of her skull she couldnt concentrate well enough to read a book she couldnt bear to listen to music what the hell was she supposed to do she put her fists to her temples and tensed up the headache was pounding inside her she wanted to scream she wanted to crack open her skull and claw her brain out with her fingernails but the rage and the pain ebbed away slowly she got to her feet and walked up the step to the bedroom there she took her clothes off again dryswallowed three prescription analgesics and crawled back into bed martha saturday brought martha two important pieces of news one that she had been expecting and another that changed everything the day started as usual with a wink from the old man and a glare from his wife at breakfast martha wasnt very hungry so she skipped the cereal and just picked at her bacon and eggs she was wondering whether to move out that day and find somewhere else in another part of the town it seemed a good idea people were getting far too used to her here and there might come a time when awkward questions would be asked after breakfast she went back up to her room and packed her gear in the holdall she had one last smoke there leaning on the windowsill and looking left and right from the close and overbearing st hildas to the distant st marys it was the first overcast day in the entire week a chill wind had blown in off the north sea bringing the scent of rain with it already a light drizzle was falling like a thin mist enveloping the town visibility was poor and st marys looked like the blurred gray ghost of a church on top of its hill after checking the room once more to make sure she had forgotten nothing martha padded downstairs and found the proprietor helping his wife carry the dirty dishes through to the kitchen id like to settle up now if thats all right she said fine he wiped his hands on the grubby white apron he was wearing ill make out the bill martha waited in the hallway the usual flyers about whitby s scenic attractions restaurants and entertainments lay on the polished wood table by the registration book on the wall above was a mirror martha examined herself what she had done hadnt changed her appearance she looked no different from when she had arrived same toothin lips tilted nose and almond eyes the same untidy cap of light brown hair all she needed was pointed ears she thought and she might be able to pass for a vulcan here you are the man eyed her with amusement as he handed over the bill martha checked the total and pulled the correct amount from her wallet cash he seemed surprised thats right she didnt want to use checks or credit cards they could be too easily traced she had cashed her fathers check and emptied her bank account before she set off for whitby so she had quite a bit of moneynot all of it so obviously bulging out of her wallet but hidden away in the holdalls secret pockets i suppose youll need a receipt for a second she was puzzled why would she want a receipt for tax purposes he went on oh yes please hang on tax purposes of course she was supposed to be a writer here to do research she could deduct her expenses from her income tax she was slipping forgetting the details the man returned and handed her a slip of paper i hope the books a success he said certainly plenty of atmosphere in whitby i dont read romances myself but the wife does well look out for it yes please do martha said she wanted to tell him it was an academic historical work but somehow that just didnt seem important now it was all lies anyway romance or history what did it matter thank you very much she said and walked out of the door it really was cool outside she had been intending to carry the quilted jacket over her arm but she put it on instead as she set off on her usual morning trek to the monks haven she wasnt sure what to do with the rest of the day maybe go up to st marys again and shut herself in the box pew she hadnt felt as safe and secure in years as she had the previous day up there and then she would have to find another b ampb to stay at the rain smelled of dead fish and seaweed browsers on silver street and flowergate wore plastic macs or carried brollies and fathers held on to their childrens hands martha thought that was odd when the sun shone everyone seemed more relaxed and the children ran free swinging their buckets and spades dancing along the pavement and bumping into people but as soon as it rained pedestrians drew in and held on tight to one another it was probably some primordial fear she decided a throwback to primitive instinct they werent aware they were doing it after all man was just another species of animal despite all his inflated ideas about his place in the great chain of being people had no idea at all why they behaved the way they did most of the time they were merely victims of forces beyond their control and comprehension just as she had been you could only depend on reason and organization to a certain degree martha had discovered and beyond that point lived monsters sometimes you had to cross the boundary and live with the monsters for a while sometimes you had no choice at her usual newsagents on the corner just past the bridge she bought a local paper and the independent and headed for warmth coffee and a cigarette first she picked up the local paper and found what she was looking for on the front page it wasnt much just a small paragraph tucked away near the bottom but it was the seed from which a bigger story would soon grow body washed up near sandsend the smallcaps headline ran sandsend was only about four miles away that was better than shed hoped for she thought it would have been carried further than four miles and such an event might not seem so important in a large town like scarborough she read on the body of a man was discovered by a young couple on an isolated stretch of beach near sandsend last night so far police say the man has not been identified chief superintendent charles kallen has asked anyone with information about a missing person to come forward and contact the police immediately time of death is estimated at no earlier than thursday and the body appears to have been drifting in the sea since then police had no comment to make about the cause of death they didnt know very much or if they did they werent saying martha would have thought it was obvious how the man had met his death but the sea did strange things she reminded herself the police would probably think that his head injuries had been caused by rocks the forensic people were clever though and they would soon discover at a postmortem examination what had really happened a little disappointed at the thinness of the story martha ordered another black coffee and lit her third cigarette of the day should she stay in town until the real news broke she wondered this story just seemed so flat and anticlimactic she should hang on at least until he was identified on the other hand that news would make the national dailies which she could read anywhere no it was best to stay stick close to the action she had gone so far that it would be futile to pull out now next she turned to the independent she didnt expect to read anything about the discovery of grimleys body there but she looked just the same at the bottom of the second page tucked away like a mad relation in a cellar was a short paragraph that caught her eye it appeared under the simple heading another body found perhaps that was it martha folded the paper and read on police last night say they found the body of a nineteenyearold female on a stretch of waste ground near the university of sheffield evidence suggests that the girl a student at the university was killed shortly after dark on friday evening detective superintendent elswick in charge of the field investigation told reporters that evidence indicates the unnamed woman is the sixth victim of the killer who has come to be called the student slasher all his victims have been female students at northern universities police refused to reveal the exact nature of the girls injuries the killer has been operating in the north for over a year now and there has been much criticism of the polices handling of the investigation when asked why the killer hadnt been caught yet superintendent elswick declined to comment martha felt herself grow cold the conversations going on around her turned to a meaningless background hum all she could hear clearly was the litany of names running through her mind margaret snell kathleen shannon jane pitcombe kim waterford jill sarsden and now another name unknown hands shaking she lit another cigarette from the stub of her old one and read the article again it said exactly the same word for word the student slasher had struck again she had been mistaken in grimley she had killed the wrong man choking back the vomit she crushed out her cigarette rushed to the tiny toilet and locked the door behind her after bringing up her breakfast she splashed icy water on her face and leaned against the sink breathing fast and deep she still felt dizzy everything was spinning around her as if she was standing on a high balcony suffering from vertigo her skin felt cold and clammy her mouth tasted dry and sour she took a deep breath and held it another another her pulse began to steady the wrong man she thought sitting down on the toilet and holding her head in her hands and she had been so damn sure the hoarse voice the accent the callused hands the low dark fringe the glittering eyesit had all been right so where did she go wrong she couldnt have been thinking clearly at all it had already occurred to her that her original theorythat he was a fishermanmust have been wrong but she had gone ahead anyway her search had been based on slender enough evidence from the start anyone else would have said that she was looking for a needle in a haystack and whats more that she had no idea which haystack it was supposed to be in but martha had trusted her instincts she had been sure that she would find him and that she would know him when she did well so much for her bloody instincts looking back she could see that she should have known that her perception had been flawed he was too young for a start and though the voice was close certainly in accent it was pitched lower and had less of a rasp the eyes and hands were the same but there had been no deeply etched lines on his face how could she have let herself get carried away this made her a murderer pure and simple there was no excuse she remembered with a shudder his body twitching on the sand in the moonlight the shattered bone and the sticky brain matter beneath her fingertips and the stifling seawrack smell of the cave she had killed an innocent man a man who would probably have forced himself on her eventually anyway truebut an innocent man and now she had to live with it she got up drank some water from the tap and washed her face she looked pale but not enough that people would really notice taking another deep breath she unbolted the door and walked back to her table she seemed steady enough on her feet she hoped nobody in the café had seen the way she had panicked still they would have no idea why her coffee had cooled down but the cigarette improperly stubbed out still smoldered in the ashtray the story in the folded paper stared up at her she turned it over and stared out of the window holidaymakers drifted by like shades in limbo i had not thought death had undone so many she found herself thinking but she couldnt remember where the words came from should she call the hunt off then go back home to the shell of a life she had made for herself no even now at such a low point she knew she must not do that if she did then it all came to nothing grimley would have died for nothing only if she fulfilled her purpose set out to do what she had to would any of it mean anything she was still convinced she had got the right place she would find her man in whitby or somewhere very close by he was still here she grieved for jack grimley would do anything to undo what she had done but she reminded herself this was a war of a kind and in war there are no innocent bystanders grimley might have been a good person but he was still a man to martha all men were potentially the same as the one she sought grimley given the chance would have led her into one of those caves and tried to rip her clothes off andit didnt bear thinking about men were all the same all violators and murderers of women no doubt the real student slasher was an ordinary wellrespected citizen on the outside maybe he even had a wife and children but martha didnt care about that she just wanted to kill him why did he travel inland so often was it just because that was where the universities were or was it something to do with his work she could no longer bank on his being a fisherman after all so maybe he was a traveling salesman based in whitby this was the kind of thing she had to do nowthink again plan again act again she couldnt let herself get dragged down by one mistake no matter how horrifying it was she had simply been too eager too sure of herself too impatient she would have to focus more clearly on the task ahead bring her intellect into harmony with her instinct so start by thinking she told herself he travels inland frequently why there at least was something concrete a place to start anything else love what it was the waitress clearing away the empty table next to hers another cup of coffee yes all right her last one had gone cold anyway martha remembered you stay there and ill bring it over love youre looking a bit peaky had a shock martha shook her head thank you no no nothing serious she would have to watch herself she realized it wouldnt do at all if she went around town making a spectacle of herself people would remember her when the waitress had brought the coffee martha returned to her thoughts she knew that superintendent elswick and his minions would be wasting their time trying to figure out the killers motives and come up with a psychological profile it hadnt got them very far yet had it but she didnt give a damn about the mans unhappy childhood or the time hed been forced to kiss his dead grandmother maybe his mother had abandoned him and gone to university perhaps that was why he always attacked young female students perhaps he had a daughter who had been corrupted as a student or maybe he just thought university campuses were dens of iniquity full of sluts and sexcrazed bitches the kind of place he was most likely to find loose womenand women liberated careless or foolish enough to walk home alone in the dark again she didnt care when she found him she wasnt going to psychoanalyze him she was going to kill him simple as that the rush of thoughts lifted marthas spirits it proved that her mind was working clearly again and that she could harden herself against experience as she had to when she looked back on what she had done the other night keeping the grotesque images at bay she saw that there was good in it too it hadnt really been a wasted effort at all if she looked at it from a positive viewpoint she could see killing grimley as a kind of dress rehearsal for the real thing a horrible thought perhaps but at least now she knew she could go through with it grimleys murder had also been an initiation of a kind a baptism in blood she had killed once therefore she could kill again only next time she thought fingering the paperweight in her holdall she would be certain to get it right kirsten kirsten remembered how she used to love the gossamer light in the woods green and silver filaments dancing in the leaves and the way it shot through gaps in the foliage here and there and lit up clumps of bluebells or tiny forgetmenots by the brook making them seem like stilllife paintings rather than living growing plants today though she felt no elation as she trudged along the winding path under the high trees after two days of hiding in her room she had made the effort to go outmore for her parents sake than for her own her father was beginning to look even more haggard than ever and her mother was getting more impatient by the minute they were almost at their wits end with her she could tell they wanted to tell her to put the unpleasantness behind her stop moping and get on with her life only pity prevented them they still felt sorry for her and it was a sorrow they couldnt give voice to so she had come to the woods to get them off her back if she pretended all was well they wouldnt know any different and it had worked as soon as she had come downstairs the previous evening they had cheered up offered her a drink and sat companionably watching television with her that morning her father had returned to work albeit reluctantly and her mother had said she was going to wells to do some shopping as bath was getting far too shabby and touristy of late but nature did nothing for kirsten as she walked she remembered a passage from coleridges dejection ode a grief without a pang void dark and drear a stifled drowsy unimpassioned grief which finds no natural outlet no relief in word or sigh or tear looking at the flowers in the light she felt for coleridge when he wrote i see not feel how beautiful they arei may not hope from outward forms to win the passion and the life whose fountains are within too true kirsten thought the light that danced among the leaves could give her nothing and her inner fountains had all dried up had all been sucked through the dark star in her mind and turned to blood there was no point going on about halfway along her usual route she turned around and headed back home her room was the best place to be and the house would be quiet with everyone out maybe in a few weeks the emptiness and the pain would go away and she would find herself back to normal already though she was finding it hard to remember what normal was two black and white cows watched her with their big mournful eyes as she crossed the narrow stretch of grass between the woods and the back gate of the house her head still ached and the depression suddenly gripped her more tightly than before back in the house she wandered aimlessly from room to room for a while thought of making a sandwich then decided she wasnt hungry getting drunk seemed like a good idea at first but she had an even better one first she took a plastic bag from the cupboard under the stairs then went up to the bathroom and opened the cabinet inside were the usual things aspirin antihistamine antacid tablets cold capsules cough medicine and some old prescription antibiotics leaving only the cough mixture she emptied the rest into the bag next she crept into her parents room they kept their various pills in the top drawer of the bedside dresser she took out her mothers tranquillizers and mogadons and her fathers bloodpressure tablets and poured them all into the plastic bag too in her own room she opened her shoulder bag and found the prescription analgesic the doctor had given her for her pain it was the same bag shed been carrying the night of the attack and she realized that she had never really wondered what had happened to it before the police must have been through it then had probably returned it to her room at the hospital while she was still unconscious emptying it on her bed she found half a months supply of birthcontrol pills still left smiling at the irony she added them to her bagful and carried the lot back downstairs the living room was a huge splitlevel affair at the front was a bay window that looked out on the lawn the honeysuckle the rose beds and the high street beyond the white fence at the back french windows opened out onto the large garden with its central copper beech more flower beds and a croquet lawn beyond that was the woods kirsten opened the windows to let the sun slant in and sat on the carpet in its rays she had taken a bottle of her fathers best whisky from the cocktail cabinetglenwhereami he always called itand set it down beside her she picked up the plastic bag and poured the collection of pills onto the carpet in front of her they were all the colors of the rainbow and more besides blue green red white yellow pink orange then she picked a few up trying to get a nice selection of colors in her palm swallowed them and washed them down with a belt of scotch straight from the bottle it was idyllic sitting crosslegged there in the honeyed sunlight as the bees droned from flower to flower outside the french windows kirsten hadnt eaten all day and she soon began to feel lightheadedlight except for the dark cloud which was far more dense than possible for something so small at least it was small today sometimes it swelled up like a balloon but today it was a nasty black marble if she held it in her hand she thought it would probably burst right through her flesh with its weight a red one a blue one a yellow one and a gulp of fiery whisky so it went on the level in the bottle dropped and the pile of pills on the tan carpet diminished handful by handful soon kirstens head was swimming specks of light danced behind her closed eyes when she opened them and looked out onto the sunlit garden again she could have sworn it was snowing out there martha after martha got off the bus at the station near valley bridge road in scarborough at about one oclock in the afternoon the first thing she did was grab a ham and cheese sandwich and a halfpint of lager and lime in the nearest pub a quiet rundown place with sticky tables she felt much calmer than she had earlier in the day the news had hit her so hard she had almost given up but in the end it had only strengthened her resolve she couldnt go back without finishing her business on the coast but now she knew that her precious instinct wasnt infallible she would have to be much more certain the next time how she could find proof beyond what she remembered of his appearance and voice she didnt know perhaps she would have to lure him on and confront him when grimley had said he didnt remember her he had been telling the truth the real killer most likely would remember her and if she could get him to admit to that then she would be sure she didnt want to leave a string of bodies behind her before she got the right one she shivered at the thought of turning into the kind of monster she was out to destroy she stubbed out her cigarette and got up to leave things werent as simple as they had been a couple of days ago now there was a chance that the police would soon identify grimley and start looking into his death martha couldnt let herself get caught she had already moved out of the abbey terrace room but there were a few other things she could do to preserve her freedom before returning to whitby she walked past the train station then turned right down westborough where there seemed to be plenty of activity the street guide shed bought in whitby gave her some sense of direction as she explored the side streets but it didnt mark the main shopping areas from what she could see however she was close to what she needed the weather was just as gray as it had been earlier in whitby though the drizzle had stopped and it was warm enough now for her to take off her quilted jacket and carry it over her arm what she needed first was a big department store marks amp spencer would do fine she thought noticing the frontage the clothes there were well made and reasonably stylish but not too expensive after wandering around the ladies wear floor and flicking through the racks she chose a plain pleated black skirt which hung well below her knees and some black patterned tights to go with it for the top she bought a cream cotton blouse which buttoned up to the throat she also picked out a navyblue cardigan in case it got cool again in the shoe department she chose a pair of nononsense pumpssensible shoes her mother would have called themdurable enough and easy to walk in as soon as she had made her purchases she went outside to a public toilet and changed storing her old gearjeans tshirt sneakers and quilted jacketin the holdall no point throwing the stuff away she thought nobody was likely to want to search her bag and she could certainly wear the clothes again she studied herself in the mirror and approved of the result nice girl secretary perhaps or receptionist it was just the right inconspicuous anonymous effect she was after to improve the new look she could also start wearing her glasses instead of contact lenses the sun had bored a few ragged holes through the cloud covering and families were heading down eastborough toward the south beach the children no longer hung onto their parents hands but dawdled and squabbled swinging bright plastic buckets and spades the occasional courting couple ambled by hand in hand in no hurry to be anywhere as long as they were with each other martha found a boots and made a beeline for the makeup counter there she bought the basics lipstick eye shadow mascara foundation blusherall in perfectly ordinary conservative colors in a café toilet across the street she stood next to another woman who was also doing her face the woman smiled and made small talk about the weather and the way men always complained about how long a woman spent in the toilet and do you know she went on squinting as she applied thick mascara i dont even think they notice the difference when we come back what do they think were doing in here all that time do they think our bladders take longer to empty or something she chuckled then sighed is it worth it i ask myself she put on a coating of glossy red lipstick and patted her lips with a kleenex to remove the excess then she sucked and pursed them a few times just to make sure martha looked at her and noticed the red stain on her front teeth it made her think of vampires i dont know she replied i suppose it depends on what you want this was too philosophical for the woman she crumpled the smeared tissue and dropped it in the bin then frowned sighed again patted her hair and left martha did the best she could she had never been very good with cosmetics never used them much except for dances and parties the object this time though was not so much to turn herself into an irresistible beauty but simply to look different from the young woman who had left whitby that morning this turned out to be surprisingly easy the eye shadow and mascara accentuated her eyes but helped to disguise their shape blusher highlighted her cheekbones and the shadows it cast below altered the planes of her face the lipstick thickened and lengthened her lips just enough to make her mouth look larger and fuller all in all she thought admiring the result it was a success already she looked like a different person and she hadnt even finished yet she decided against wearing her glasses for the time being why go too far in the next department store she headed for the small wig section she didnt want anything showy like platinum blond or jet black but something perhaps just a little darker than her natural color it had to be longer though and it had to look real can i help you madam an assistant asked just browsing martha didnt want anyone helping her on and off with wigs and making up her mind for her that was the kind of thing a shopgirl might remember luckily another customer came along an older woman with tufts of hair missing as if shed been undergoing chemotherapy for cancer and the assistant sidled up to her the two of them began an involved discussion on exactly what was required and the assistant led the woman over to a chair in front of a mirror martha had never bought a wig before she had never even tried one on gingerly she picked up a long ashblond one just to see what it looked like on her the effect was astonishing the makeup alone had done a good job but the addition of the wig changed her looks completely it changed her into an entirely new person with a different history and personality martha stood and stared at herself making up a story about the young woman she saw there born in kings lynn norfolk educated at an exclusive girls boarding school sexy independent the owner of a chain of boutiques perhaps and often abroad on buying trips suddenly afraid that people might be watching her she snapped out of the game and got back to business after trying on a number of other hairpieces when she was sure nobody was paying her much attention martha finally found one that suited her it was chestnutcolored but not unrealistically shiny and curled under just above her shoulders a short fringe fell over her forehead too and somehow this made her eyes look even more different she carried the wig over to the nearest till paid and took it away with her she took the escalator to the womens toilets on the fourth floor when she pushed the door open a fraillooking woman with a scrawny body and a large head jumped up from where shed been sitting on the edge of a sink and quickly stuck her hand behind her back martha noticed that she was wearing a sales assistants uniformblue suit and white blouse with a brass name tag on the jacket identifying her as sylvia wieldand she looked as guilty as a schoolkid caught smoking behind the cycle sheds when she saw it was only a customer she relaxed and put her free hand to her chest you gave me the fright of my life she said i thought it was the supervisor do you know were not even allowed to smoke in our own lounge these days thats why i have to sneak in here whenever i want a fag its usually quiet up here in furnishing martha smiled in understanding then she went and sat in a cubicle until the saleswoman had gone the shock of the meeting had made her own heart beat faster too when all was quiet again she put on the wig and looking around the door on her way out to make sure she wasnt noticed she slipped down the nearest staircase back into the street she knew she should get back to whitby soon and check into a different bed and breakfast place but while she was in scarborough she couldnt resist a walk down to the harbor just in case there wasnt much activity there the lobster pots were stacked on the quay and only one or two locals stood around painting their boats or fiddling with the engines the smell of fish was even stronger there than it was in whitby mixed with the stink of diesel oil it made her feel nauseated as soon as she became aware of a young lad leaning nearby against the wall and giving her the eye she decided she was wasting her time and headed for the bus station on the journey back to whitby she read jude the obscure which she had bought at the same little bookshop on church street after finishing emma within half an hour or so it was time to get off again this time instead of climbing up to west cliff she turned into the area behind the station another part of the town noted for its holiday accommodation on a terrace of tall dark guesthouses facing the railway tracks all with vacancy signs in their windows she chose the middle one moments after she had pushed the doorbell a stout young woman with rubbery features came rushing from somewhere out the back and opened the door her hands were wet and she looked tired and flustered as if she was trying to juggle ten domestic chores at once but she managed a smile when martha said shed like a room she was probably only in her twenties martha thought but hard work children and worry had aged her single love her voice had a singsong whining quality yes please an attic will do if youve got one martha liked being high up in rooms with beams and slanting ceilings sorry love the woman said drying her hands on her pinafore the only single weve got is a small room at the back ill take a look martha said it was on the second floor a depressing little room with white stuccoeffect wallpaper looking out on backyards full of dustbins and prowling cats its quiet the woman said being at the back like you cant hardly hear the trains not that there are many these days she seemed anxious to please martha reckoned that she and her husband probably hadnt been in the place long and were finding it difficult to make ends meet the woman had clearly made an effort to make the hall and rooms appear cheerful but the house itself was drab and old it gave the impression of being damp and chilly even though it wasnt and its proximity to the railway tracks must surely put people off martha didnt mind though it was hidden anonymous even if it didnt boast a view of st marys it would make a cozy retreat and she liked this woman with her tired eyes and washreddened hands felt sorry for her in a way martha saw herself as perhaps a champion of women like this onenot just the obviously abused attacked and assaulted but the weary the downtrodden and the dispirited how much is it she asked eight pounds fifty love and we dont do evening meals im sorry thats all right im usually out then anyway martha thought it over quickly it was cheap obscure and the woman hadnt asked her any awkward questions about what she was doing in whitby all alone there would be a husband around no doubt but hed probably have a day job and with luck she wouldnt see much of him even the husband at the other place had stayed out of the way except when she had arrived and left ill take it she said dropping her holdall on the pale green bedspread the woman looked relieved good if youll just come down and register ill give you the keys martha followed her back down noticing as she went how the stairs creaked here and there that could be a problem if she had to sneak in late like before but if she did a bit of discreet checking on her way up and down in the first day or so she could find out exactly which stairs to avoid the hall was much shabbier than the one in abbey terrace there was no mirror and even the advertising flyers looked dusty and curled at the edges im mrs cummings by the way said the woman giving martha a card to fill in sorry if i seem to be rushing you but my husbands usually out on the boats so ive got to run the place more or less by myself boats is he a fisherman well sort of he takes groups of tourists out for morning and afternoon fishing trips its not as if they catch enough to sell or anything some of them just want a ride out in a boat but he makes a decent living in season still it means hes up before dawn and often not back till after teatime depends on the tides like and how many want to go out theres good days and bad we get by it would have been too ironic to be true martha thought if she had actually found herself staying in the same house as the man she wanted but at least he might know where the fishermen hung out and what other local industries had close links to fishing she could only question him casually like an interested tourist but it might be worth a try breakfast is eight to eight thirty mrs cummings said i have to get it all over and done with quickly so i can get the kids off to school and here are the keys she handed martha two keys on a ring the big ones for the front door we always lock up at about half past ten but you can come in when you want and the yales for your room theres a small lounge on the ground floorits markedwith a kettle and a telly only black and white im afraid but theres teabags and a jar of nescafé you can brew up there any time you like thank you martha said with a smile im sure everything will be fine mrs cummings took the card martha had given her going out now are you yes i thought id just have a little walk before dinner good idea well see you laterer she looked at the card susan is it yes thats right bye for now and susan bridehead walked out into the late whitby afternoon kirsten yes i am sure that kirsten doesnt need her stomach pumped dr craven repeated patiently you saw for yourself she brought up the tablets before they had time to work their way into her bloodstream at worst shell feel a little sick and dizzy for a whilewhich is no more than she deservesand shell probably have a heck of a headache they stood in kirstens room where she lay tucked up in bed her mother was flapping about and wringing her hands like a character in a victorian melodrama youre upset understandably the doctor went on perhaps it would be best if you were to take a tranquillizer and lie down for a while yourself yes kirstens mother nodded then she frowned oh but i cant she looked at her daughter she took them all it wasnt meant as an accusation kirsten knew but she was made to feel once again that she had done nothing but make a nuisance of herself since she got back home first she had refused to go out then she had been sick all over the living room carpet and now she was depriving her mother of the oblivion the poor woman so desperately needed in order to cope with the nasty twists of fate that had disrupted her life of late luckily dr craven reached for her bag and came to the rescue samples she said tossing over the small foil and cellophane package inside were four yellow pills each in its own compartment and ill give you another prescription to replace the ones you lost kirsten needs rest now she scribbled on her pad ripped off the sheet and passed it over the brusqueness of her tone and gesture got through even to kirstens mother who normally seemed impervious to hints that her company wasnt required yesyes clutching the package and the prescription she drifted toward the door yesill just go and get a glass of water and have a liedown when she had finally gone the doctor sighed and sat on the edge of the bed beside kirsten she means well you know she said kirsten nodded i know dr craven let the silence stretch for a while before she said in a tone far gentler than kirsten would have believed possible for her but it was a silly thing to do wasnt it kirsten didnt answer she wasnt sure look dr craven went on i cant pretend to know what you feel like after what happened i cant even imagine what you went through what youre still going through but i can tell you this suicide isnt the answer why did you do it i dont know kirsten said it just seemed like a good idea at the time im not being facetious i didnt know what else to do dr craven looked puzzled what do you mean i didnt enjoy being outside i wasnt really hungry i didnt fancy reading a book or watching television i was just at a loose end then i thought id get drunk thenive not been sleeping well there are other options kirsten thats what youve got to remember i dont suppose i should be all that surprised you tried something foolish as i said i cant imagine how you feel but i know it must be terrible what you have to do now is understand that theres no quick and easy way back to health your body is taking care of itself well enough but your emotions your feelings are damaged too perhaps even more than we realize rest will help of course and time but you wont be able to go on hiding forever therell come a time when you have to make the effort to start living again to get out and about meet people get involved in life i know it probably sounds terrifying just at the moment but you must make that your goal if you let your fears dominate you then youve lost you mustnt give in you have to fight it do you understand what im trying to tell you i think so kirsten said ii just dont know if i can i dont know how sermon over dr cravens lips twitched in a smile again now back to practicalities nobody can make you but i strongly suggest that you see a specialist in bath someone who knows about the kinds of things youre feeling i can recommend just the right person a psychiatrist like you mentioned before yes i feel its even more important now ill set up an appointment for you but what i want to know kirsten is will you go kirsten turned her head aside and looked through the small window at the sky and treetops at least it had stopped snowing she thought that had been the last thing she had registered before coming over faint and retching on the carpet how odd that it was snowing in august it hadnt been snowing at all of course it had just been her vision going haywire she turned back to dr craven all right she said ill go i dont suppose ive got anything to lose youve got quite a lot to gain young lady the doctor said patting her hand good ill fix up an appointment and let you know now are you sure youre feeling all right physically no ill effects no im fine just a bit woozy mostly i feel silly and so you jolly well should back to her normal self the doctor stood up and walked to the bedroom door just before she left she turned and said you can stay in bed till tomorrow morning thats quite reasonable for someone whos done what you just did but after that i want to see you up and about understood kirsten nodded left alone she pulled the sheets up to her chin and stared at the long faint crack in the ceiling her head was still throbbing and her stomach felt sore but apart from that everything seemed in working order considering the mixture of pills and the amount of alcohol she had taken as dr craven had said none of the tablets had had time to do any damage and she was suffering more from the effects of the scotch which was all the stomach wall had had time to absorb she would go to the specialist in bath she decided though she had little faith in psychiatrists having studied and dismissed both freud and jung in a firstyear general studies course she felt desperate enough to try anything if only he could get that dark cloud out of her mind and give her somethinganythingto replace the terrible cold emptiness that she felt about everything it wasnt fear that kept her indoors in her bed it was just apathy there was nothing she wanted to do nothing at all she felt foolish and despised and that was about it with a bit of luck perhaps the specialist really could help maybe he could give her something to live for susan during the night the seagulls by the lower harbor were just as noisy as the ones on west cliff but breakfast at mrs cummingss establishment was an altogether less elaborate affair for a start there was no cereal just a small glass of rather watery orange juice for each person nor was there a choice between tea or coffee only tea the main course consisted of one fried egg with the white still runny two thin rashers of bacon and a slice of fried bread there were no grilled tomatoes mushrooms or slices of black pudding there was of course plenty of cold toast and marmalade and the whole meal seemed to be taking place at fastforward sue was a little late coming down as she had her face to fix and her wig to secure no sooner had she sat down than the plate appeared in front of her the tea had already been mashing for some time and it tasted so bitter by then that she had to resort to sugar she never had time to get around to the orange juice the only other guests in evidence were a bedraggledlooking bachelor in a gray sleeveless vneck pullover who hadnt either shaved or combed his hair and two bored teenage girls with multicolored spikes of hair and warpaint makeup sue finished quickly went up to her room to smoke a cigarette and pick up her bag then wandered out it was another gray day outside but the thin light was piercingly bright weather like this always puzzled sue there was no sun in sight no blue sky no dazzle on the water but she found that she had to screw up her eyes to stop them from watering she considered buying sunglasses and perhaps a widebrimmed hat but decided against it enough was enough there was no point in going overboard and ending up looking like someone in disguise first she bought cigarettes and newspapers at the closest newsagents then she found a different café on church street in which to enjoy her morning coffee she had read in crime novels about people changing their appearance but still getting caught because they were stupid enough to stick to the same inflexible routines when she looked at the local newspaper she noticed that it was a saturday late edition she hadnt seen of course today was sunday there would be no local papers only the nationals in the stoppress section at the bottom of the lefthand column on page one she saw an update on the grimley story police are not satisfied that the body washed up on sandsend beach last night now identified as that of mr jack grimley died of natural causes detective inspector cromer has informed our reporter that a postmortem has been ordered mr grimley was last seen alive when he left a whitby pub the lucky fisherman at about pm thursday evening anyone with further information is asked to get in touch with the local police as soon as possible mr grimley was a selfemployed joiner and parttime property assistant at whitby theater he lived alone sue chewed on her lip as she read slowly but surely they were stumbling toward the truth and the police always knew more than they told the newspapers she felt a vacuum in the pit of her stomach as if she were suspended over a bottomless chasm but she told herself she mustnt panic there might not be as much time left as she had hoped for especially if she was racing against the police investigation but she must stay calm she lit a cigarette and turned to the sunday times this was hardly the place to look for salacious sensational and scandalous news but surely they would at least report the latest developments in the student slasher case and so they did police simply confirmed that the friday evening murder was the work of the same man who had killed five other girls in the same way over the past year they refused to discuss details of the crime but this time they gave a name susan added it to the other five she knew by heart another spirit to guide her margaret snell kathleen shannon jane pitcombe kim waterford jill sarsden and now the sixth brenda fawley sue idled over the rest of the paper hardly paying attention and by midmorning she had come up with a plan for the day it was time to start checking out the nearby fishing villages first she headed back across the bridge and picked up a timetable at the bus station it took her a while to figure out the schedule but in the end she discovered that there were no buses going up the coast on sundays the service ran between loftus and middlesbrough further north and that was it she thought of renting a car though she knew that might also be difficult on a sunday even if she could get one she realized it might cause all kinds of problems with identificationlicense insurance means of paymentand that was exactly the kind of trail she didnt want to leave behind her there was no train line so it had to be a bus then or nothing turning to the scarboroughwhitby service she found that there were buses to robin hoods bay they ran regularly at twentyfive past the hour and took less than half an hour coming back would be simple too she could catch a bus at robin hoods bay shelter which would be up on the main road at or in the evening or even later right up to pm robin hoods bay it would have to be sue wasnt sure what she would find there but the place had to be checked out she was certain that her quarry came from whitby and that he had something to do with fishing but it was quite possible that he lived in town and worked in one of the smaller places nearby or vice versa for that matter besides she also felt the need to get away from whitby for a while she knew the town too well now and was becoming tired of tramping its streets day in day out the place was beginning to feel oppressive it was closing in on her breakfast at the cummingses had been a depressing and suffocating affair toothe obvious poverty the noise of children the lack of cleanliness the teacups were stained and there had been one or two spots of dried egg that hadnt been washed off her plate properly and the sense of hurry and bustle that even now was causing her heartburn yes another day trip out of whitby would be a very good idea checking her timetable again she found that she had missed the never mind she thought finishing her kenco coffee she was in no hurry there were the papers to read crosswords to do plenty to keep her occupied she could even go up to st marys and spend a while in her favorite box if she wanted kirsten come in kirsten sit down make yourself comfortable dr hendersons office was on the second floor of an old house and the window which was open about six inches looked out over the river avon toward the massive abbey the last of the great medieval churches to be built in england it was still very much in use instead of a couch kirsten found a padded swivel chair opposite the doctor who sat at the other side of her untidy desk with her back to the window filing cabinets stood to kirstens right and glassenclosed bookcases to her left many of them filled with journals from one shelf a yellowed skull stared out it seemed to be grinning at her behind her was the door and beside that an old hat stand dr henderson leaned back in her chair and clasped her hands on her lap of course it had to be a woman kirsten realized they wouldnt have sent her to a male psychiatrist after what happened but she hadnt expected such a young woman dr henderson looked hardly older than kirsten herself though she must surely have been at least thirty she had short black hair neatly trimmed so as not to be a nuisance which complemented the angles of her face and emphasized her high cheekbones she had dark blue eyes kind but glinting with an edge of mischievous humor her voice was soft husky and deep with just a trace of a geordie accent and her lips were turned up slightly at the corners as if always on the verge of a smile a smattering of freckles covered her small nose and the tight skin over her cheekbones kirsten made herself comfortable in the swivel chair and after glancing around nervously at the office she turned to face the doctor who smiled well kirsten how do you feel all right i suppose dr henderson opened a file on her desk and pretended to read kirsten could tell she knew the contents already and was just doing it for effect dr craven has passed on the full medical details but theyre not what interest me why dont you tell me what happened in your own words then she leaned back and clasped her hands again the springs in her chair creaked as she moved kirsten felt her mouth turn dry what do you mean what details dr henderson shrugged perhaps you could start with the attack itself i was just walking home and somebody grabbed me then everything went black thats all hmm the doctor started playing with a rubber band stretching it between her fingers like the silence she was stretching in the room kirsten shifted in her seat outside on the river avon a young couple rowed by kirsten could hear them laugh as their oars splashed water well kirsten said when she could bear the tension no longer dr henderson widened her eyes well what ive told you what happened what do you think what advice have you got for me now hold on a minute kirsten dr henderson put the rubber band down and spoke softly thats not what im here for if anybody has given you to believe that youre coming to me for some kind of magic formula andhey prestoeverythings back to normal again then theyve seriously misled you what are you here for then the best way to look at the situation is that you are here and thats whats important youre here because youve got problems you cant deal with alone im here to help you of course i am but youre the one wholl have to do all the work your description of what happened for examplea bit thin wasnt it i cant help it can i i mean i can only tell you what i remember how do you feel about it how do you think i feel you tell me your description sounded curiously flat and unemotional kirsten shrugged well i suppose thats how i feel how are you getting along with your parents i dont see what thats got to do with anything have you told them about your feelings i told you i dont see what thats got to do with anything of course i havent told them do you think i what nothing kirsten have you ever been able to talk to your parents about your feelings of course i have when what do you mean give me an example of something youve discussed with them iiwell i cant think of anything offhand youre making me flustered all right dr henderson sat up straight lets take it easy then shall we and she smiled again kirsten found herself relaxing almost against her wishes the doctor took out a packet of ten embassy regals from her desk drawer mind if i smoke kirsten shook her head she was shocked to find a real doctor smokingespecially for some reason a young female doctorbut she didnt mind dr henderson turned in her chair and opened the window a little further can i have one kirsten asked of course the doctor pushed the packet toward her i didnt know you smoked kirsten almost said i dont but she managed to stop herself sometimes she said then lit up though the first few drags hurt a bit she didnt make a fool of herself and start coughing and spluttering and crying she had smoked once or twice before just to see what it was like the smoke made her feel a little dizzy and sick at first but her system seemed to adapt quickly and my first names laura the doctor said i want us to be friends she poured two cups of coffee from a thermos on the desk and pushed one toward kirsten milk sugar kirsten shook her head black then so i take it you havent really been able to talk to anyone about what happened to you no i cant remember you see i really cant its like theres a heavy black cloud inside my head where its all stored and i cant see inside it i dont mean the event itself so much as your feelings about it now laura said i dont think i feel anything why did you take all those pills was it because of this cloud partly i suppose but its mostly because i dont feel im really living i mean i dont enjoy things like before readingcompanyand i dont sleep well i have bad dreams over and over again i thought it might just be better if i i see dr henderson made a note in the file how important are sex and children in your life kirsten kirsten swallowed shocked by the sudden change of direction her mouth turned dry again and the bitter coffee made it worse she turned away never thought about them i dont suppose one does tilltill till theyre gone yes had you ever considered having children kirsten shook her head one day i imagined id have some one day but not for a long time what about sex were you sleeping with your boyfriend regularly in spite of herself kirsten blushed as she told dr henderson about galen and about how she was now trying to cut him out of her life the doctor listened then made more notes in her file as far as i understand it she said dr masterson told you that sexual intercourse would be painful if not impossible am i right kirsten nodded but thats not all there is to sex is it what do you mean what i mean said the doctor is that perhaps you should start thinking about the pleasurable things you can do rather than the ones you cant im not going to embarrass you by explaining them but there are manuals available what im saying is that you have to accept the loss of your full sexuality yes but that you mustnt think that means the end of your entire sensual and erotic life its important to know that you can still have those feelings and can still satisfy them in some waysyou can still touch and you can still feel kirsten stared down at the floor she hadnt thought about this had tried not to think about sex at all since leaving the hospital and she didnt know what to say it was probably best to let it go by for the time being just think about what ive said anyway the doctor said it might be a long haul kirsten but if you stick with it well get you there and if at any time you feel the need to talk to someone please call me any time do you understand kirsten nodded what about dreams you said youve been having bad dreams about what happened kirsten told her about the black and white figures slashing and slicing at her in the recurring dream are you talking about nightmares laura asked do you wake up screaming no nothing like that how do you react then i dont really its all very ordinary a bit frightening i suppose but theres no pain its like im detached from it all just watching why do you think you keep having that dream i dont know i suppose its some version of what happened but i didnt see anything so it cant be real why are there two figures a black one and a white one theyre both doing the same thing yes but why two i dont know like i said it cant be anything to do with what happened i didnt see anything the doctor stubbed out her cigarette and drank some more coffee the minds a curious thing she said it remembers things that happen even when youre asleep or unconscious obviously if your eyes are closed you cant see but you can hear and smell for example some of those things that happen come up in dreams what the imagination does is translate them into pictures based on what the sensations were and what you feel about them im not a freudian but i do think dreams can tell us a lot these two figures cutting you who do you think they are i suppose one of themthe black onemust be the man the one whoyou know or maybe they both are white and black yes but if what you say is true and i remember things even when im unconscious then maybe the white ones the doctor they operated on me for a long time cutting in the same way i suppose white and black one for good one for evil she felt pleased with herself as if she had finally cracked a particularly obscure code but laura didnt seem impressed perhaps she said now whats in this cloud do you think i dont know everything everything what happened that night do you believe that you were conscious for part of the time that you saw the man and struggled and that youve repressed the memory i dont know for certain but i must have mustnt i otherwise why would i feel theres something in me i cant get at do you want to get at it kirsten crossed her arms and drew in on herself i dont know it might be necessary if youre to make any progress i dont know the doctor made some more notes in the file then closed it and put it in an overflowing traywhether it was in out or pending kirsten couldnt tell she suspected that laura henderson had no such efficient system for dealing with paperwork well said laura i dont suppose it matters for the moment youll come again i have a choice yes you must come of your own free will all right good laura stood up and kirsten noticed how slim and healthy her figure looked even under the loose white coat it made her feel unattractive herself in the hospital her skin had acquired that yellowish gray pallor that sick people get and the stodgy food had done her figure no good at all later when she had lost her appetite she had lost weight again and now her skin felt wrinkly and loose her face was spotty too as it hadnt been since she was fourteen and even her hair seemed to hang lifeless and dry they walked over to the door which laura opened for her and kirsten she said finally remember this its all right to feel things even bad things its all right to feel hatred and anger toward whoever did this to you in fact if you want to get better you must the feelings are there in you and you have to admit them to yourself kirsten nodded and left she felt even as she walked out and crossed pulteney bridge to grand parade that the doctors words had planted the seeds of a recovery in her as she watched the daring canoeists go through their paces in the wild water down by the city weir she reminded herself of the doctors last words its all right to hate him its all right to hate him and she did something inside her began hardening into a cold enduring hatred for the man who had shattered her future and crippled her sex below the canoeists maneuvered deftly tracing crazy patterns on the water kirsten joined the crowd and watched them for a while longer for some reason they reminded her of yeatss lines like a longlegged fly upon the stream his mind moves upon silence it was an image she found strangely comforting susan monday morning found sue riding up the coast toward staithes on the bus her plan was to have lunch there look around then walk the three miles or so along the cleveland way to runswick bay for tea from there she could get a bus back to whitby at in the evening robin hoods bay though quaint enough with its hotchpotch of pastel cottages almost sitting on top of one another had proved disappointing not only had sue seen no evidence of fishing there she had felt very strongly that this was not the place she should be wasting her time in that evening she had ventured into the lounge alone to watch tv and make a cup of instant coffee and mr cummings had joined her for a while he was a pleasant ruddyfaced young man more than willing to talk about fishing in the whitby area it turned out that there were more jobs connected with the industry than sue had imaginedcanning freezing processing shippingand some of them might be worth looking into but staithes was a strong fishing community so she couldnt afford to overlook it the coast road to staithes cut across a landscape of rolling farmland that ended abruptly in sheer cliffs at the north sea to the west lay a patchwork quilt of hedged fields some were brown after harvest some still pale gold with uncut wheat and barley while others were plain green pastures where black and white cows grazed the bus passed a faroff village a cluster of light stone houses with red pantile roofs almost hidden by a clump of trees in a hollow the weather had turned sunny again and the colors of the landscape were saturated with light like a color transparency on the seaward side in a field next to a local rubbish dump hundreds of white gulls squatted fat and replete after feeding the sight disgusted sue and made the bile rise in her throat she looked beyond them to the clear blue sea where the sun glinted silver on distant ships the bus stopped in the modern part of the village up on the main road and sue had to walk about a mile down to the village itself the street by roxby beck was so steep that cars werent allowed down it below her the houses a mixture of different stones colors and styles seemed to tumble over one another down to the sea on the way she stopped at a newsagents and bought a local paper and a daily mirror the village at the foot of the hill was penned in on both sides by high headlands huge skulls of grasstopped rock where the horizontal strata of light sandstones and reddish brown clays had been bared by the wind and rain over the centuries the only view from the promenade was of the cliffs looming on each side or out to the sea itself there was nobody about the place was deathly quiet even the gulls seemed to be swooping in silence and the air was thick with the smell of rotten fish first sue wandered into the cod and lobster a whitewashed pub right on the seafront above the thick stone wall she ordered a lager and lime and surprised to find they didnt do meals sat down for a cigarette and a read there werent many people in a man in a yorkshire dales tshirt scratched the neck of his red setter two lads in navy jerseys baggy jeans and wellingtons chatted up the young barmaid and that was it in fact she hadnt seen many tourists at all even on her way down the hill staithes seemed to be much more of an isolated working village than robin hoods bay it seemed to be the kind of place where she might have more luck in finding the man she wanted as she smoked sue examined the photographs on the walls some of them showed a terrible storm that had hit staithes in and damaged the pub badly others showed groups of local fishermen and sue studied them keenly she knew she could rely on her visual memory least of all in her quest but she had glimpsed him briefly in the moonlight and remembered the thick black eyebrows meeting in the middle the ancient mariner eyes and the thatch of dark hair no one in the photographs resembled him so she turned to her newspapers there was nothing more on the sandsend body in the local paper obviously the police were stuck and the reporters couldnt justify repeating the same story day after day it didnt mean that the investigation had come to a dead end though she realized the police would still be working on it questioning people digging around for evidence the very idea that they might be drawing closer gave her butterflies in her stomach she had bought the mirror because she thought it might have more news about the student slasher she found a whole page recapping his exploits with the familiar blurred photos of the victims faces taken from old students union cards or passports not sues of course for she had never been officially identified as his first victim there they were kathleen shannon with her long wavy hair jane pitcombe with her large farapart eyes margaret snell with her lopsided smileand the three others apart from veiled hints about what he did to the nubile young bodies suggesting between the lines that some of them asked for it and a number of editorial calls for the police to get a move on and catch him this could happen to your daughter too there was no real information at all sue stared at the six faces she had never met any of the women but she felt closer to them than she did to anyone else sometimes late at night she had even fancied she heard them whispering in her ear they helped her guided her when she felt weak and lost and for them if not for herself she had to carry on to the end feeling hungry she stubbed out her cigarette and finished her drink outside a little further around the harbor from the cod and lobster was a café attached to a private hotel she walked in and found the small room crowded with full tables and only one waitress trying to deal with all the orders though she was obviously rushed off her feet by a recent influx of six or seven customers the woman managed everything as quickly as she could and with a smile from the glimpses sue got when the kitchen door swung open there was only one cook too the menu offered little choice the special of the day was cod and chips sue ordered it smoking was not allowed in the café so she passed the twenty minutes or so she had to wait for lunch doing the crosswords and reading about the sexual exploits of famous tv personalities and pop stars in the mirror when the meal finally came it was good sue realized that she had spent too much energy avoiding fish and chips in whitby because it seemed that that was the only food availableas she actually enjoyed it at least in moderation as she ate she remembered the local chippie near the university where she and her friends had often stopped on their way home from the pub and eaten out of newspaper as they walked if only her mother could have seen her shed have had a fit but the north seemed so full of fish and chip shops what could you do though she had never thought about it at the time she guessed now that much of the fish came from places like whitby and scarborough and even the smaller villages like staithes it came well obviously it was delivered it didnt fly there by itself a whole fleet of vans must be constantly rushing back and forth from the coast to service inland towns and cities sue paused with her fork in the air as the simplicity of it all came to her the final piece of the puzzle of course how could she have been so stupid now she knew exactly what to do next when she had finished eating she pushed the empty plate aside and lit a cigarette one or two fellow diners gave her nasty looks but no one actually walked over and asked her to stop the waitress also ignored her she had much more on her mind than telling a patron to stop smoking eventually sue got the bill paid it and walked out into the sea air its rottenfish smell now seemed mingled with the odors of seaweed and ozone and just a trace of diesel fuel from the boats there was no point remaining in staithes any longer she thought as she walked along the harbor wall she had always been certain in her heart of hearts that whitby was the place where she would find him now even logic backed up her instinct still it was pleasant enough walking in the sun and watching the placid blue sea the place seemed less oppressive now that she had decided to leave it soon she could at least wait until she had digested her lunch the only discomfort she felt was a hot and itchy scalp under her wig she sat down on the sea wall and let her legs dangle over the edge stretching her arms out behind her and resting her palms on the warm tarmac she leaned back and let the sun warm her closed eyelids one more cigarette she decided then back up the long hill to the bus stop shifting position she checked her timetable and found out that there was a bus at it was twenty past one now so she had just missed the one before plenty of time as she sat watching a distant tanker move across the horizon she became aware of someone staring at her the hackles at the back of her neck under the wig stood on end at first she brushed off the feeling as ridiculous hadnt she just decided that she would find her man in whitby he couldnt be here then for a moment she panicked what if it was the police what if they had somehow got on to her or were they just following her watching she could bear it no longer turning her head slowly and casually toward the rail in front of the cod and lobster where she thought the watcher was standing she picked out the tall tanned figure it was keith mclaren the australian shed met at the abbey terrace guesthouse and he recognized her even as she looked he waved smiled and started to walk toward her kirsten august gave way to september and the nights turned cooler as the weeks passed kirsten began to look forward to her sessions with laura henderson they smoked and sipped terrible coffee together in that cozy room overlooking the river avon the immediate sights beyond the window became as familiar to kirsten as if she had looked out on them all her life robert adams pulteney bridge with its row of shops along each side all built of cotswold stone the huge square lategothic tower of the abbey the guildhall and municipal buildings often she stared over lauras shoulders during the long silences or stood at the window as laura sought out an article in a journal some evenings when their sessions ran late laura would take a bottle of scotch from her filing cabinet and pour them each a drink they talked more about kirstens childhood her parents her feelings about sex laura said that kirsten was making progress and so she was she still didnt like going out or meeting people but she began to enjoy the simple things again mostly solo pursuits like a walk in the woods music the occasional novel she even found that she could concentrate and sleep well again though she no longer flirted with suicide she hung on to her cold hatred and the dark cloud still throbbed inside her mind sometimes it made her head ache she and laura didnt talk about the attack it would come kirsten knew but only when laura thought she was ready at home her mother continued to fuss and fret and she often seemed to regard her daughter with a combination of embarrassment and pity but kirsten grew used to it the two of them kept out of each others way as much as possible it wasnt difficult with her garden her croquet her bridge parties and her myriad social engagements kirstens mother managed to keep busy hugo and damon sent getwell cards and galen phoned several times during august at first kirsten instructed her mother to tell him she was out soon however she realized that wasnt fair she spoke to him and tried to respond to his concern without encouraging him too much one friday he paid a visit and tried again to persuade kirsten to go with him to toronto they walked in the woods and she let him take her hand though her flesh felt dead to his touch it wasnt too late he said they had both been accepted and term didnt begin for a few weeks yet gently she put him off told him she would join him later and sent him away partially appeased finally at the beginning of september he went to canada and sent her a postcard as soon as he got to toronto she had never told him what was really wrong with her nor had she mentioned the suicide attempt if anyone sustained kirsten outside laura hendersons office it was sarah who phoned almost every week and wrote long entertaining letters in between always outrageous funny and compassionate she made kirsten laugh again when she asked if she might visit over christmas when her own parents would be touring australia kirsten jumped at the chance her father saw that it was a good idea too but her mother perhaps recalling her only meeting with sarah in the dingy northern bedsit was reluctant at first christmas was a family time she said she didnt want strangers around her husband argued that it wasnt a very big family anyway kirstens grandparents two uncles and aunts usually came for christmas dinner then her parents visited friends in the village for drinks on boxing day surely he argued it would be good for kirsten to have a friend of her own age around finally her mother gave in and it was settled sarah was due to arrive on december and kirsten would pick her up at the station after her lateafternoon session with dr henderson she would have her mothers audi as usual one day in early october when the elegant old city looked gray and a cold wind drove the rain through its georgian crescents circles and squares kirsten forsook her usual walk by the avon and drove straight home from lauras office when she arrived she noticed a strange car parked in the drive and hermother peeking out from behind the lace curtainssomething she didnt usually doand her heart began to beat faster something was wrong was it her father she wondered as she hurried to the door her ordeal had taken a terrible toll on him and though he did seem stronger and happier of late the bags still hung dark under his eyes and he had lost his boyish enthusiasm for things was his heart weak had he had an attack her mother opened the door before kirsten even had time to fit her key into the lock someone to see you she said in a whisper what is it kirsten asked is father all right her mother frowned of course he is dear whatever gave you that idea kirsten hung up her coat and dashed into the splitlevel living room two men sat close to the french windows near the spot on the carpet now drycleaned back to perfection where kirsten had had her scotch and pills picnic one of the men she recognized or thought she should but the memory was vague spiky gray hair red complexion dark mole between left nostril and upper lip shed seen him before and then it came to her the policeman superintendent elswick miss he said as if reading her mind detective superintendent elswick we have met before kirsten nodded yes yes of course and this is detective inspector gregory inspector gregory stretched out his hand which was attached to an astonishingly long arm and kirsten moved forward to shake it then he disappeared back into the chairher fathers favorite armchair she noticed gregory was probably in his midthirties and his dark hair was a bit too long for a policeman he was dressed scruffily too with brown corduroy trousers threadbare from being washed too many times a tan suede jacket and no tie kirsten thought he seemed a bit shifty she didnt like the way he looked at her superintendent elswick wore a navyblue suit a white shirt and a blackandamberstriped tie it was the same one he wore last time she remembered probably from an old school or regiment he looked like an exmilitary type how are you kirsten elswick asked kirsten sat down on the sofa before answering her mother hovered over them and asked if anyone would like more tea i havent had any yet kirsten said yes id like some please the two policemen said they wouldnt be averse to another cup and kirstens mother walked off promising to make a fresh pot kirsten looked at elswick how am i i suppose im doing fine good im very glad it was a nasty business yes they sat in tense silence until kirstens mother returned with the tea tray having deposited it on the mahogany coffee table before the stone hearth she disappeared again saying ill leave you to it then after her sessions with dr henderson kirsten was used to silence at first it had disconcerted her made her fidgety and edgy but now they sometimes sat for as much as two minuteswhich is a very long time for two people to be silent togetherwhile kirsten meditated on something laura had said or tried to frame a reply to a particularly probing and painful question elswick and gregory were easy meat there was something they wanted obviously so all she had to do was wait until they got to the point gregory played mother clearly an unsuitable role for him and spilled as much tea in the saucer as he got in the cups elswick frowned at him and added milk and sugar then when they were settled again gregory crossed his long legs and took out a black notebook he did his best to pretend he was part of the chair he was sitting in kirsten said superintendent elswick i should imagine youve guessed that i wouldnt come all this way unless it was important kirsten nodded have you caught him for a moment she panicked and thought the attacker might actually be someone she knew someone from the party she didnt know if she would be able to handle that no said elswick no we havent thats just the point it was obviously very difficult for him to talk to her kirsten realized but she didnt know how to make it any easier finally he managed to blurt it out im afraid theres been another attack like mine yes in the park no it took place on some waste ground near a polytechnic not far away huddersfield in fact i thought you might have read about it in the papers i havent been reading the papers lately i see anyway this time the victim wasnt quite as lucky as you she died whats her name elswick looked puzzled margaret snell he answered kirsten repeated the name to herself how old was she she asked nineteen what did she look like elswick tipped the tea from his saucer into his cup before answering she was a pretty girl he said finally and a bright one too she had long blond hair and a big crooked smile she was studying hotel management kirsten sat in silence the reason were here elswick continued is to see if youve remembered anything else about what happened anything at all that might help us catch this man before he does it again elswick nodded gravely does that mean theres some kind of maniac some kind of ripper running loose up there elswick took a deep breath we try to avoid alarmist terms like that he said it was a vicious attack much the same as the one on you from our point of view were pretty sure it was the same man so it looks like weve got a serial killer yes but the newspapers dont know that they dont know anything about the similarity between your injuries and those of the dead girl and were certainly not going to tell them were doing our best to prevent anyone linking you to the business why kirsten asked suddenly apprehensive all the bad publicity it would upset your parents make your life a misery youve no idea how persistent those damn reporters can be when they get on the scent of a juicy story theyd be up here from london like a shot kirsten could tell he was lying he wouldnt look her in the eye its because you think he might come after me isnt it she said youre worried that if he knows you connect him to two victims and he knows one is still alive then hell want to finish me off in case i know something arent you its not as simple as that kirsten elswick shifted in his chair when you were in the hospital hes already tried yes you must have noticed that we had a man on the door all the time as soon as news of your survival hit the papers the attacker came back apparently he must have entered the hospital dressed as an orderly he cant have been all that bright otherwise hed have known wed be guarding you anyway when he turned the corner he spotted the constable and ducked quickly back the way he came our man was good he saw from the corner of his eye that someone was behaving suspiciously but he had orders not to leave his post a more headstrong bobby might have done just that but if hed gone chasing after the intruder looking for the glory of an arrest then he could easily have got lost in the maze of corridors and chummy couldve nipped back in and finished me off yes instead the constable stayed put and called in on his radio but by the time we got there our man was long gone we didnt even get a description and he never tried again no not as far as we know does he know where i live i dont think so how could he the press details were sketchy the local police have been warned to keep a lookout for any strangers in the area but i dont think youve got anything to worry about kirsten thought of all her walks in the woods all the times she had lingered in the streets of bath after sessions with dr henderson she felt a sudden chill why didnt you tell me all this before she asked we didnt want to alarm you thanks a lot elswick leaned forward and rested his palms on his knees believe me kirsten youve been perfectly safe i can understand how you feel but look at it this way whoever attacks you is worried when he hears youve survived so he rushes over to the hospital with some halfbaked scheme of trying to silence you he fails time goes by he no doubt loses track of you when you come down here and lo and behold its already three months ago and nothings happened to him hes still free as a bird so obviously from his point of view you cant know anything youre not a threat until he strikes again i still dont think youre in any danger well keep an eye on you dont worry but its more for forms sake than anything else kirsten felt a little relieved there was some truth in what elswick had said if anything was going to happen it would have happened long before now and she wasnt about to start walking around in fear of her life it wasnt worth that much though she no longer felt suicidal she did feel reckless sometimes and often drove the car too fast or walked alone after dark in streets she shouldnt visit even genteel bath had its seedy characters and sleazy areas so she wasnt going to give in to fear she had determined not to spend the rest of her life jumping at every sound and running from every shadow if he found her so be it may the best person win more than anything she was angry at the police for being so useless and for joining the growing list of people who didnt want to alarm her by telling her the truth why does he do it she asked mutilate women like that why does he hate us so much elswick shook his head if we knew the answer to that we might have an easier job stopping him usually its a him and thats about all we can be sure of who can say what sets them off we have people in to do profiles and doctors write books but who knows really often its prostitutes they go after but this time it seems to be female students if were reading the pattern correctly no doubt theres a million unresolved conflicts from his childhood on that have turned him into what he is perhaps he was sexually abused but plenty of other people suffer from cruel parents and dont turn into killers we dont know what the trigger is that makes the odd one different he shrugged i suppose it comes down to fear really people like him are terrified by women whatever the reason and the only thing they can do about it because of the kind of people they are is strike out and despoil and kill how do you know its the same person kirsten asked you said something earlier about the similarity of injuries elswick looked at her grimly do you really want to know he asked kirsten wasnt sure but she certainly didnt intend to give in considering that so much else has been kept from me i think i have a right dont you elswick sat back and studied her face for a moment all right he said the wounds were the same the areas he used his knife on were the same there was also bruising about the face consistent with punching and slapping and that strange cross he cut with the long vertical and short horizontal just below the breasts that was found on her body too do you want me to go on kirsten nodded when he was with you he was disturbed the dog we assume up to that point your injuries are identical with those of the other victim what killed her then she was strangled elswick pinched his nose then scratched the mole lightly oh shed no doubt have died of loss of blood or internal bleeding but just to make sure the bastard strangled her and according to our forensic experts he did this after he had inflicted the other injuries are you saying that she was conscious while he did allwhat he did to me elswick shook his head we dont know it would have been difficult for him if shed been able to struggle the blows to the face and head were probably enough to cause loss of consciousness and it seems that they were the first injuries he grabbed her from behind threw her down onto the ground straddled her pinning her arms down with his knees and then began beating her about the face perhaps it wasnt until she was unconscious that he went on to the more serious business and this time he wasnt disturbed kirsten felt sick she could feel the blood drain from her cheeks she struggled to control herself she wasnt going to be sick she wasnt going to let elswick say i told you so she wouldnt appear as the weak woman in front of these men who were intimate with every aspect of her brutalization to cover up her discomfort she poured another cup of tea inspector gregory shook his head quickly when offered some he was so still and silent he seemed really to have become part of the chair what we were wondering elswick went on slowly was whether youd remembered anything else no matter how insignificant or unimportant it might seem to you kirsten shook her head no i havent ive tried of course but after what i told you its all still a blank you see elswick persisted what we think is that the victim must have still been conscious at least at the time he threw her onto her back and if thats so then it might have been the same with you you might have got a glimpse of his face maybe he was wearing a mask or a stocking but even that could help us or maybe he said something anything im sorry kirsten said really i am but i just cant remember you might be right maybe i did see his face maybe he did talk to me but i cant remember do you think i dont want to of course id like to help you but i cant after that rough hand closed over my mouth i cant remember a thing she felt tears in her eyes and fought to hold them back there was a moon that night elswick said yes i was looking for it whenbefore but i couldnt see it it was there behind you just over the tops of the trees weve checked why light because if you were conscious when he pushed you down to the ground there would have been just enough light to make out at least something about his appearance it was a clear nighta bit hazy maybeand there was a full moon but i cant have been conscious kirsten said i dont remember never mind then elswick glanced over at inspector gregory who slipped his notebook back in the inside pocket of his tan jacket and both men swung forward in their chairs preparing to leave im sorry to have brought such bad news and stirred up painful memories elswick went on getting to his feet his knees cracked and he put his hand to the small of his back as if it hurt getting old i hear youve been seeing a doctor kirsten theres not much you dont know is there kirsten said as a matter of fact yes i have her names laura henderson and shes a psychiatrist elswick smiled indulgently yes we know dont tell meyou checked her out its standard procedure in cases like this elswick followed her out of the room down to the hall doing you any good yes i think she is she says my loss of memory might be anterograde amnesia caused by the trauma hmm yes wed heard and its consistent with the facts all you remember is the hand and youve blotted out all the violence all the pain according to our medical experts the memory may or may not come back youve certainly done your homework havent you superintendent elswick seemed embarrassed again he changed moods remarkably quickly for a policeman kirsten thought one minute he was all confident and superior the next he was avuncular and then he got all tonguetied this time she decided to help him what is it you want she asked do you want to talk to her do you want access to her records of our sessions they wont tell you anything you know er no no that wont be necessary elswick said as kirsten handed them their coats from the hall cupboard she sensed from his hesitation that he might already have had such access or could easily get it if he wanted and she felt a surge of anger toward laura what i was wondering was he went on scratching his mole againkirsten felt like telling him to get it seen to before it turned cancerouswas well with the doctors permission of course i was wondering if youd consider trying hypnosis susan it was partly the way you smoke your cigarette keith said everybodys different you hold it straight out between your first two fingers like a real lady or like youre just pretending to smoke he grinned but why the change in appearance you look so feminine i mean not that you didnt before its just he slowed to a halt sue smiled and flicked her cigarette end onto the sand you know what they say a change is as good as a rest why the hell did he have to turn up she asked herself and what am i supposed to do about him did you need a rest no i needed a change they both laughed but seriously martha he persisted its almost as if youre trying to avoid someone you arent are you its nothing but a skirt and a blouse youre acting as if im dressed like richard iii or something there is the wig sue touched the false hair i was sick of having it short i couldnt wait and the makeup cant a girl put a bit of lipstick on anymore keith smiled im still not convinced i think youre a spy i just dont know whose side youre on he seemed happy to meet up with her again despite the sour note they had parted on but she could tell he was suspicious by the way he studied her he had recognized her without much difficulty that was clear enough maybe it was because he fancied her and when you fancy someone you notice little things like how they hold their cigarettes and the way they walk she was sure that strangers people she had passed in the street or sat near in a pub wouldnt connect her with the shorthaired tomboyish martha browne but keith could be a problem what are you doing up here he asked just taking a break for the day and you id have thought youd be in edinburgh by now oh no im moving very slowly first sandsend then runswick bay now staithes sue noticed again how pronounced his australian accent was staithes came out as stythes im in no hurry he went on i might never see these places again and the weathers been so bloody good another first in england from what ive heard you still in whitby yes still in the same bed and breakfast yes still get black pudding for breakfast most days sues mind was working fast she didnt want to be noticed with him in public for a start and they could hardly get more public than here on the sea wall luckily though there was hardly anyone around at the moment one or two people sat on the beach but they were facing the sea and two blond children dressed identically in white shorts and blueandredstriped tshirts stood eating icecream cones near the cod and lobster everyone else was either in the pub at the shops or waiting for lunch in the restaurant the steep hill down to the village probably put a lot of older visitors off too sue thought no matter how warm it was people so much liked to sit in their cars right beside the sea but they couldnt do that here though it was easy enough getting down to the beach the walk back up the hill was no doubt too great a price for many to pay for a day at the seaside so far no one had so much as glanced at them the first thing to do was get keith away somewhere off the beaten track then she would be able to think clearly she didnt like the idea that was forming forcing itself on her but she hadnt thought of another way out yet what are your plans he asked well sue said i was intending to walk along the coast to runswick bay then catch the bus back to whitby what do you think is it too far no its not far at all ive done it myself nothing to it tell you what if youve no objection ill come with you theres an even better walk in my guidebook though you walk along the cliffs to port mulgrave then cut back inland through some woods and circle around to the main road thatll take you to your bus stop and me back to staithes how about it all right are you sure you dont have anything else you want to do i told you im on holiday no plans no newspapers no television a vacation from the world sue remembered the bit about not reading newspapers from their last meeting it made her feel a little saferespecially as he had made no mention of jack grimleys deathbut there were still too many ways that someone like keith could come across a local news story a photo of grimley and a request for information in some pub or café up the coast for example or from the newspaper used to wrap his fish and chips one evening perhaps someone might be watching a local news program on the tv in the lounge of his guesthouse just as he walked in to make a cup of tea and he would remember that was the problem he recognized her even in disguise so he would surely recognize jack grimley the man he had caught her staring at in the lucky fisherman then he might remember how he had thought she knew grimley the more she worried about what keith knew the more she realized she didnt feel safe at all why hadnt he gone straight up to scotland or taken the plane back to oz keith took her silence for hesitation look martha he said scratching his earlobe and looking out to sea i know i was out of order like before whenyou knowand im sorry i want you to know im not on the make i just think itd be nice to go for a walk with you i wont try anything honest sue got to her feet and brushed the sand from the back of her long skirt she was forming a plan and a little inducement would go a long way its all right she said i didnt mean to seem so brusque with you before its not that im a nun or anything it was just too soon i mean i hardly knew you she smiled at him keith looked surprised yes wellershall we be off havent you got your gear gear good lord you dont need gear for a simple walk like this he looked her up and down you could even do it dressed like that though i wouldnt recommend it no all ive got is my ordnance survey guide he patted the back pocket of his jeans no i mean your stuff your rucksack and all that its back at the b ampb i was only having a little stroll around the village no what you see is what you get he spread his arms and stood before her tall slim thinfaced and tanned his curly black hair still looked glossy as if he had just stepped out of the shower and his eyes reflected a bluer ocean than the one that stretched before them what did you mean about me not being dressed right sue asked i was only joking really its not a hard walk its just that skirts tend to snag on thorns and things and those pumps will take a hell of a beating wait here a minute sue hurried into the public toilet made sure that no one was around and went into a cubicle to change first she took off her wig scratching her head in relief when she had done so then she put on her jeans a darkblue checked shirt and her trainers carefully she rolled up the wig long skirt white blouse and cardigan and placed them in the holdall sometimes she thought it was a nuisance having to carry the damn thing everywhere with her but it was light enough and she could adjust the strap and carry it over her shoulder if she wanted she put the quilted jacket on top of everything in case it got chilly high up on the cliffs finally she combed her hair in the cracked and grimy mirror above the sink and examined her makeup it wasnt bad she hadnt put too much on that morning as she had intended to be out of whitby for the day anyway and now there was no point in standing here and washing it all off someone might come quickly she gave her lips a dab with a kleenex then dashed back outside to join keith lead on she said bowing and standing aside for him keith laughed are you sure youre not a spy or an actor or something not at all sue gave him what she intended to be an enigmatic smile and they set off they wound their way up by the mission church of st peter the fisherman then followed the signs for the cleveland way past some farm buildings over a couple of stiles and right up the hill to the cliff edge the village lay spread out below them even though it was a clear warm day smoke drifted lazily from some of the chimneys up on the cliff top there was a cool breeze from the sea pausing for breath sue put on the quilted jacket shed been carrying in her holdall what have you got in that thing keith asked your lifes work something like that the unfenced path ran close to the edge of the cliff and the drop was sheer after keith had stopped to point out boulby cliffs further up the coast they started walking in single file the pathway was rough though mostly level and they soon got into a comfortable rhythm keith was talking most of the time half turning his head to look at her he talked about how he was loving england but still felt homesick and about a body that had been washed up on the beach at sandsend while he was staying there no he hadnt got a good look at it by the time he had noticed that something was happening quite a crowd had gathered and the police had arrived sue realized now that she would have to kill him he was just too much of a liability to let go free she didnt know how the police were progressing on the grimley investigation but she was sure that without keith they couldnt link her to the dead man keith might not have seen the body but there was a chance he might find out who it was and if questioned remember that strange girl who had acted as if she recognized the manthe girl who kept changing her appearance but she didnt know if she could do it keith had done her no harm he had only tried to kiss her but he could give her away before shed finished and she couldnt afford to let that happennot after everything else grimley had been a mistake in the first place and one that almost sent her screaming back home now keith all she had wanted to do was find the man who had hurt her and murdered the other girls and kill him put a stop to his carnage once and for all but she was so deep in blood already and she hadnt even found him yet how much further would she have to go with an effort she pulled her mind back from the negative track it wasnt as if she had any choice in the matter she told herself somehow from somewhere she would have to dredge up the courage he was a man after all wasnt he when it came down to it they were all the same underneath hadnt he tried to force himself on her and wouldnt he do the same again she shuddered at the thought it would be easy to do it up here just a gentle push over the edge or quick kick at the ankles to make him stumble and fall an accident but it was too open and she could see two other walkers approaching from the opposite direction as it was they turned out to be serious hikers with binoculars boots and rucksacks far more interested in distant seabirds than in fellow human beings but there must be no witnesses and no probing timeconsuming inquest as the men passed sue looked the other way so far she was sure that nobody would remember seeing her with keith but there was no point in being careless gulls swooped low flashing white in the sun and curious insects buzzed around sues head before long she could see the crumbling jetty of port mulgrave way below and they began their descent into the tiny village keith wanted to stop for a cup of tea and a sandwich at the boat house tea room but sue urged him on saying she was still full from lunch she was nervous now she had made her decision and that made her cautious when she took his hand he gave in quite easily and they set off up the road to hinderwell soon they were on a rough track approaching a caravan site then they turned right crossed some more fields and walked down a steep hill to a footbridge over a beck it was a dramatic change of landscape from coast to inland valley they walked through brambles and blackberry bushes and sue could see what keith had meant about snagging her skirt on the thorns even in jeans she had to walk carefully the smell was different here too rotten fish and seaweed were distant memories replaced by crushed berries and wild garlic in the honeyed air droning with insects beyond the brambles they entered the woods the path was bounded on both sides by dense thickets and tall trees they passed an elderly couple who smiled and said hello then after a few minutes walking in the quiet woods sue suggested that maybe it was time for a rest but theres nowhere to rest here keith said just the path theres the woods isnt there sue broke free and ran off through the undergrowth come on its nice in here she called back cool and dark im sure well find somewhere to sit down keith ran after her when theyd gone far enough that they couldnt be seen from the path sue pointed to a concave patch of ground between two trees there perfect she sat and leaned back against a tree trunk filtered green light streamed down through the leaves and birds called to one another from their high nests passing on warnings that intruders had come keith lowered himself down beside sue so close that their arms touched it wasnt long before his hands started wandering as she had expected just touching her hair and throat at first the tension inside her was almost unbearable but she tried not to stiffen up then he kissed her she let him she took off her quilted jacket to make a pillow against the rough bark and he started fiddling with the buttons on her shirt she let him one button two buttons three buttonsshe had one arm around him and the other groping in her holdall her mouth was dry and it still tasted of greasy cod four buttons now her bra was exposed and he bent forward and kissed the dark cleavage she sighed his fingers quickened and soon unbuttoned the shirt right down to her waist without bothering to take it off he pulled the bra up over her breasts she let him her free hand stroked the nape of his neck and tears ran down her flushed cheeks suddenly he froze my god martha what happened what on earth happened he pulled back and stared in horror at the puckered zigzags across the skin of her breasts they looked like an old hags dugs as sue well knew her hand closed on the paperweight nothing she said softly nothing for you to worry about why does it turn you off well no he said awkwardly i didnt mean that i just go on then keith go ahead kiss them if you like she put her free hand on the back of his head and drew him toward her as she felt him resist she pushed harder she could feel his oily black hair under her fingers and the strength in the knotted muscles at the back of his neck as he shoved against her hand tears of anger burned in her eyes his lips brushed the dead skin where the severed nerve ends had never knit back together he strained back but she kept pushing him down when his mouth reached the place where her right nipple used to be she brought the paperweight down on the side of his head he didnt jerk and twitch like jack grimley and for that she was grateful she didnt know if she would have been able to stand that without going mad he just slumped forward into her arms she rolled him off and he fell onto his back at her feet blood bubbled over his ear through his glossy hair onto the earth she wasnt going to make the mistake of touching the wound this time her heart was beating wildly but at least she didnt feel sick perhaps like everything else murder got easier with practice sue raised the paperweight again but the sound of rustling in the undergrowth stopped her heart thudding she looked up straight into the eyes of a large panting collie the dog just stared at her with its tongue hanging out and its head cocked to one side as if it wondered what the hell was going on sue felt more naked under its gaze than she had under keiths and she quickly pulled down her bra and began to button up her shirt the dog just stood there watching her with that pained and puzzled expression in its eyes then she heard a faint cry in the distance the dogs ears pricked up and with a final despairing glance at her it turned and ran off through the thicket toward two distant figures standing on the path this place was too dangerous she had to get out before someone else came first she took keiths ordnance survey guide from his back pocket she would need that to find her way back to the main road then she felt for his pulse she didnt really know where to look except from programs shed seen on television but she couldnt feel anything on his wrist quickly she hit him once more just to make certain surely one of the blows must have fractured his skull she thought she wiped the paperweight carefully on his shirt wrapped it in paper handkerchiefs and put it back deep in her holdall next she piled all the loose brush and dead leaves she could find over keiths body he looked so innocent lying there such a babe in the woods then she remembered the pressure of his muscles as he had pushed himself away from her rejected her and that split second of balance when their strength had been equal and she had killed him she patted her hair and brushed the leaf mold and twigs from her jeans then hurried back toward the path looking behind her she couldnt see anything of keith just a small mound that looked like an old tree stump she followed the map about threequarters of a mile to the main road without passing another soul not that it mattered anyway if anyone did recollect her it would be martha browne they remembered the police might find keith soon and they would make inquiries and track down the bus driver too but it would be martha browne he remembered and as soon as she got to the toilets near whitby bus station martha browne would disappear forever and sue bridehead would return at the bus stop she caught her breath then sat on the warm brick wall at the bottom of someones garden where she watched the ants and smoked a cigarette as she waited for the back to whitby kirsten you realize it might take several sessions said laura henderson brushing some ash off her white coat and even then theres no guarantee kirsten nodded but you can do it yes i can do it about ten percent of people arent susceptible to hypnosis but i dont think well have much trouble with you youre bright and youve got plenty of imagination what did superintendent elswick say kirsten shrugged nothing much just asked me if id give it a try laura leaned forward look kirsten she said i dont know whats on your mind but i sense some hostility i want to remind you that what goes on between us in this office is confidential i dont want you thinking that im somehow just an extension of the police naturally theyre keeping tabs on you and when they found out you were seeing me they made inquiries i want you to know though that i havent told them anything at all about our sessions and nor would i without your permission i believe you kirsten said besides theres been nothing to tell has there hypnosis might change that do you still trust me yes and even if we do come up with something even if the man told you his name for some reason and you remember it none of what we discover will be of any legal use i know that superintendent elswick just said that i might remember something that would help them catch him right laura said relaxing again i just dont want you to expect too much thats alleither from the hypnotherapy or from the police dont worry i wont are you going to get your watch out and swing it in front of my eyes have you ever been hypnotized before never laura grinned well im sorry but i dont carry a pocket watch im not going to make hand passes at you either and my eyes wont suddenly start to glow bright red you do need something to fix your attention on true but i think thisll do fine she picked up the heavy glass paperweight from on top of a pile of correspondence inside caught in the glass globe was what looked like a dark green tangle of seaweed and fronds do you want to start now kirsten nodded laura got up and closed the blinds on the gray afternoon so that the only light left shone from a shaded desk lamp then she took off her white coat and hung it on the stand first of all she said i want you to relax loosen your belt if its too tight its important to feel as comfortable as possible physically okay kirsten shifted in her chair and tried to relax all her muscles the way she had done in yoga classes at university now i want you to look at that globe concentrate stare into it stay relaxed and just listen to me and she started to talk general stuff about feeling at ease heavy sleepy kirsten stared into the globe and saw a whole underwater world the way the light caught the glass the green fronds seemed to be swaying to and fro very slowly as if they really were seaweed at the bottom of the sea weighed down by so much pressure when laura said your eyelids are heavy they were kirsten closed her eyes and felt suspended between waking and sleep she could hear a distant buzzing in her ears like bees in the garden one childhood summer the soft voice went on taking her deeper finally they went back to that night last june youre leaving the party kirsten youre walking out into the street and she was again it was that muggy night so vivid that she really felt as if she was there she entered the park aware of the soft tarmac path yielding under her trainers the amber streetlights on the main road the sound of an occasional car passing by and she could almost recapture the feelings too that sense of an ending the sadness of everyone going his or her own way after what seemed so long together a dog barked kirsten looked up the stars were fat and blurred almost buttercolored but she couldnt find the moon she was at the center of the park now and she could see haloed streetlights on the bordering roads she felt a sudden impulse to sit on the lion the grass swished under her feet as she walked over and touched the warm stone of the mane then she mounted it and felt silly but happy like a little girl again she thought of cockatoos monkeys insects and snakes then she threw her head back to look for the moon again and felt herself choking lauras voice cut through the panic steady and calm but kirsten was still struggling for breath as she tried to drag herself out of the trance she could feel the callused hands with their stubby fingers over her mouth and she was being turned around pulled off the lions back onto the warm grass the world went dark and she couldnt breathe the cloud in her mind hardened and gleamed like jet blotting everything out she felt her back pushed hard against the grass a great weight on her chest then she burst up to the surface gasping for air and laura reached forward to hold her hand youre all right laura said its over take a deep breathanotherthats right kirsten glanced around her terrified and found she was back in the familiar office with its glassenclosed bookcases filing cabinets grinning skull and old hat stand will you open the blinds she asked putting a hand to her throat and rubbing i feel like im at the bottom of the sea she was still gulping for breath laura pulled the blinds up and kirsten walked over to look out hungrily on the twilit city she could see the river below a slate mirror and the people walking home from work it was just after five oclock and the streetlights had come on all over the city she stood there taking in the ordinariness of the scene and breathed deeply for a couple of minutes then she sat down opposite laura again i could do with a drink she said of course laura fetched the scotch from the cabinet poured them each a shot and offered her cigarettes are you all right now better yes it was just soso vivid i felt as if i was really living through it all again i didnt expect it to be as real as that youre a very imaginative woman kirsten its bound to be that way for you did you learn anything kirsten shook her head no it all went black when he turned me around and dragged me to the ground he did that yes of course he did laura tapped a column of ash into the tin ashtray thats not what you said before what do you mean dont you remember before you could only remember up to the point of the hand coming from behind you said nothing about being dragged down kirsten frowned but thats what must have happened isnt it yes but this time you actually relived it it was true kirsten had remembered the sensation of falling or of being pushed onto her back on the ground and the soft warmth of the grass as it tickled the nape of her neckthen the darkness the weight i didnt see anything though she said perhaps not i told you this might take several sessions the point is that youve made progress you remembered something you didnt remember before something youd buried it might not be much and it might not tell you anything but at least it proves that you can do it you can remember theres something else too kirsten said reaching for her scotch its true that i didnt see anything new this time but youre right i did get further than ive been before its not just images visual memories but there are feelings too that come back arent there what kind of feelings do you mean fear pain yes but not just that intuitions inklingsits hard to describe try well what i felt was that i did see his face i dont mean now today but when it happened i know i saw him but im still blocking the memory and there was something else as well i dont know what it was but there was definitely something else about him it was almost there like a name on the tip of your tongue but i resisted i couldnt breathe and it was so dark i just had to come out do you want to carry on laura asked offering the bottle again you dont have to nobody can make you you know how painful it can be kirsten tossed back the last of her scotch and held her glass out the experience had terrified her true but it had also given her something she hadnt felt before a resolve a sense of purpose her cold hatred had crystallized into a desire to see her attacker it was all connected in some strange way with the dark cloud that weighed down her mind when she finally spoke her eyes were shining and her voice sounded strong and sure yes she said yes i do want to carry on whatever happens i want to know who did this to me i want to see his face susan the newspapers had nothing much to report the next morning sue sat in her new café on church street drinking coffee to get rid of the taste of mrs cummingss tea she knew she would be better off not drinking the vile brew in the first place but she needed something hot and bitter to wake her up it was drizzling outside and the café was full of miserable tourists keeping an eye on the weather spinning out a pot of tea and a slice of gateau until the rain stopped and they could venture out again sue hadnt slept well she had already been awake when the seagulls started at a quarter to four even under the blankets and the bedspread she had been trembling with delayed shock at what she had done to keith mclaren she could still see his stunned innocent face the blood pouring over his tanned cheek she told herself he was just like the rest like all men but she still couldnt help hating herself for what she had been forced to do when she came to analyze her actions it was mostly the way she had deliberately set up the situation that disgusted her because she didnt see herself as a coldblooded killer she had lured keith into the woods and forced him to put her in a position from which she could strike out in selfrighteous anger in a way it had been as coldblooded as any execution she had just needed to get herself excited enough to kill and to that end she had seduced keith seduced him to death there was a perverse logic in that somewhere that made even sue twist her lower lip in the semblance of a smile the next morning but the night had been dreadful full of selfloathing recrimination loss of nerve even the talisman and the litany of victims offered scant comfort in the small hours she had also worried as it happens when you lie awake during those dreadful hours of the not quite morning with something on your mind one fear leads directly to another the disturbed mind seems to toss up terrors with the prolific abandon of a tempestuous ocean by killing keith she had more than doubled her chances of getting caught before she finished what she had set out to do with two murders to investigate the police would surely spot the similarities and start stepping up their search somebody might have seen her with keith in staithes port mulgrave or hinderwell and then someone else might remember seeing her with grimley in the lucky fisherman her only hope was that keiths body would remain undiscovered in the woods until she had finished her task and that was what she prayed for as she tossed and turned and finally slipped into an uneasy sleep lulled by the cacophonous requiem of the gulls the coffee and cigarette helped her wake up there was nothing in the nationals about the student slasher but according to the local paper the police were now certain that jack grimley had been murdered detective inspector cromer said that they were looking into his past for anyone who might have a grudge against him and they still wanted to know if anyone had seen him after he left the lucky fisherman on the night of his death clearly no one had come forward so far sue remembered that night she was sure nobody had noticed them and once they had gone down to the beach and the cave no one had even known they were there sues hands shook a little as she combed the rest of the paper for news of keiths body thank god there was nothing they clearly hadnt found him yet but she would still have to move quickly with the police stepping up their search and keiths body lying out in the woods for anyone to find time was no longer on her side she knew what she had to do next but it was still too early in the day a short distance inland on the eastern edge of town by the river esk stood a factory complex there much of the locally caught fish was cleaned filleted and otherwise processed for resale some of it was frozen the factory employed about a hundred and fifty workers an even mix of men and women if the person she was looking for was not a fisherman but was still connected with the industry that had to be the place to look she was thinking much more clearly now after the mistake with jack grimley even though she knew where to look she still wasnt sure how to go about it she could hardly hang about outside the factory gates check everyones appearance and ask all likely suspects to say a few words but what else could she do but watch she had thought of applying for a job there to get her foot in the door but that would raise questions of identification references and national insurance stamps she couldnt afford that another alternative was to find out if the workers had a favorite pub whatever she decided she would have to start with hanging around the place at five oclock when the workers left for the day then she could take it from there much as she wanted to she couldnt rush things the plan left so much time on her hands and time was a gift to the enemy also today was not the kind of day for sitting on the beach reading and her room at mrs cummingss was far too depressing to spend a whole day in she had the perennial problem of the english person at the seaside what to do on a rainy day she could always look for a cinema that showed afternoon matinees she thought or spend her time and money on the onearmed bandits in an amusement arcade then there were the museum and art gallery and captain cooks house there would also be bingo of course last resort for the truly desperate but sue knew she wouldnt be able to concentrate on things like that she had to be actively engaged in her search or her fears would get the better of her at least she could walk up to the factory and reconnoiter that would be a positive step it was in a part of the town that she had never seen before and she needed to know its layout its dark corners its entrances and exits she also had to find a suitable spot to watch from there was a chance that she might even need binoculars though they would look a bit too suspicious if she had to use them in the open but first she realized there was something else she must do something she had decided on during her restless guilty paranoid hours awake in the night she needed something to replace her holdall it wasnt especially conspicuous just a khaki bag with side pockets and an adjustable strap but she had been carrying it all the time she had been staying in whitby whether as martha browne or as sue bridehead it was exactly the kind of mistake that could get her caught far better she thought to buy something else fill the holdall full of stones and dump it in the sea along with all her martha browne gearjeans checked shirt quilted jacket the lot it would be a shame to throw away such goodquality clothing but it would be dangerous not to apart from those few moments on the front at staithes it was only as martha browne that she could be linked with keith mclaren and jack grimley so martha browne would have to disappear completely she paid her bill then crossed the bridge and walked up to one of the department stores on flowergate there she bought a smaller dark gray shoulder bagfor she wouldnt have as much bulky clothing to carry arounda lightweight navyblue raincoat and a transparent plastic rainhood in the toilet she transferred all the things she would needpaperweight money makeup underwear bookinto the new shoulder bag and put the old one in the empty plastic bag bearing the stores logo anyone who noticed her would think she was simply carrying her shopping that would do for the moment but sometime soon she would have to go for a walk along the cliffs and get rid of the holdall permanently she walked back over the swing bridge and instead of turning left onto the touristy part of church street she went right and continued about half a mile along past new bridge which carried the a to scarborough and beyond over the river esk to her right rain pitted the gray surface of the river and on her left she came to one of those functional residential parts of town that every holiday resort tucks away from public view consulting her map she turned sharp left perpendicular to the river and walked a hundred and fifty yards or so up a lane at the southern edge of a council estate finally she turned right and found herself in the short culdesac that ended at the large mesh gates of the fishprocessing plant it was the kind of street that would look drab and uninviting whatever the weather terraced houses stood on both sides set back from the road by small gardens complete with privet hedges and wooden gates with peeling paint the houses were prewar judging by the crust of grime and the white patches of saltpeter that had formed on the graybrown brick on the road surface the ancient tarmac had worn away in spots like bald patches to reveal the outline of old cobbles beneath to sues left a short section of the terrace had been converted into a row of shops grocer butcher newsagenttobacconist video rental and on the right about twenty yards from the factory gates stood a tiny café certainly from the outside there was nothing attractive about the place the white sign over the grimy plateglass window was streaked reddish brown with rusty water that had spilled over from the eaves and the r and the f of roses cafe had faded to no more than mere outlines hanging in the window itself was a bleak handwritten card offering tea coffee and sandwiches the location was ideal though from a table by the window sue would just about be able to see through the film of dirt and she would have a fine view of the workers filing out of the gates down the street as far as she could tell there was no other direction they could take she walked all the way up to the gates themselves they stood open and there was no guardhouse or sentry post obviously national defense wasnt at stake and a fishprocessing plant had little to worry about from terrorists or criminal gangs a dirt path ran a hundred yards or so through a weed and cindercovered stretch of waste ground to the factory itself a long twostory prefab concrete building with a new redbrick extension stuck on the front for clerical staff inside the glass doors was what looked like a reception area and the windows in the extension revealed offices lit by fluorescent light apart from the front the only other side of the factory that sue could see was the one closest to the river and it was made up entirely of numbered loading bays several white vans were parked in the area and drivers in blue overalls stood around talking and smoking as sue stood by the gates memorizing the layout a loud siren sounded inside the building and a few seconds later people started to hurry out toward her she looked at her watch twelve oclock lunch hour quickly she turned back and slipped into the café a bell pinged as she entered and a wrinkled beanpole of a woman in curlers and a greasy smock glanced up at her from behind the counter where she had been buttering slices of thin white bread for sandwiches you must have nipped out early love the woman said cheerfully usually takes them all of thirty seconds to get here after the buzzer goes them as comes that is now the brown cow up the road does pub lunches theres plenty as deserted poor roses dont hold with lunchtime drinking myself whatll you have then a nice cup of tea was there any other kind sue wondered yes thanks thatll do fine she said the woman frowned at her just a cup of tea you need a bit more than that lass put some meat on your bones how about one of these lovely pottedmeat sandwiches or are you one of them as brings her own lunch her glance had turned suspicious now sue felt flustered it was all going wrong she was supposed to slip into the place unobtrusively and order from a bored waitress who would pay her no attention instead she had gone and made herself conspicuous just because she had run for cover when the siren went and everyone had started hurrying toward her she was too jumpy not very good at this kind of thing im on a diet she offered weakly huh the woman snorted i dont know about young uns today i really dont no wonder youve all got this annexa nirvana or whatever they calls it cup of tea it is then but dont blame me if you start having them there dizzy spells she poured the black steaming liquid from a battered old aluminum pot milk and sugar sue looked at the dark liquid yes please she said new there are you the woman asked pushing the cup and saucer along the red formica counter yes said sue only started today been taking time off for shopping already too i see the woman said looking down at sues carrier bag dont see why youd want to shop in that place when theres a marks and sparks handy she looked at the bag again pricey that lot are they charge for the name you know its all made in hong kong anyroads would she never stop sue wondered blushing and thinking frantically about what to say in reply as it happened she didnt have to the woman went on to ask an even more difficult question who dyou work for old villiers yes said sue without thinking at all the woman smiled knowingly well take my advice love and watch out for him wandering hands hes got and as many of em as an octopus so ive heard she put a finger to the side of her nose the door pinged loudly behind them hey up here they come she said turning away from sue at last right whos first come on dont all shout at once sue managed to weave her way through the small crowd and take the table by the window she hoped that old villiers and his friends were among the people who had deserted roses for the brown cow if they were management it was very unlikely that they spent their lunch hour eating pottedmeat sandwiches and drinking tannic tea in a poky café still it was a bloody disaster sue had thought she could come to this place every day at about five oclock for as long as it took without arousing much attention after that providing the weather improved and the police didnt catch up with her if she needed to stay any longer she could buy some cheap binoculars and watch from the clump of trees just above the factory site but now she had been spotted and whats more she had lied if the woman found out that sue really didnt work at the factory she would become suspicious after all roses café was hardly a tourist attraction she would have to spy from the woods now whatever the weather the only bright spot on the horizon was the brown cow if workers went there at lunchtime perhaps some also returned in the evening after work it was easier to be unobtrusive in a large busy pub than in a small café like roses annoyed with herself and with the weather sue lit a cigarette and examined the faces of the others in the café making the best of what time she had calm down she told herself it wont take that long to find him if hes here it cant kirsten what else did you remember sarah asked leaning forward over the table and cupping her chin in her hands thats just it kirsten said nothing its so frustrating ive had two more sessions since then and got nowhere every time i pull back at the same point it was seven oclock in the evening kirsten had parked the car off dorchester street and met sarah at the station about an hour earlier they had walked up to the city center in the lightly falling snow and now sat in a pub on cheap street near the abbey the place was busy with the afterwork crowd and christmas shoppers taking a break kirsten and sarah had just managed to squeeze in at a small table are you going to carry on sarah asked kirsten nodded ive got another session in the morning so you do want to know yes you know theres been another one dont you just before the end of term that makes two nowthree including you kathleen shannon kirsten said aged twentytwo she was a music student i only wish what nothing come on kirstie its me sarah remember kirsten smiled youll probably think im mad i feel so empty sometimes and then i get so angry i keep thinking of those two others and theres this block like a huge black lump or a thick cloud in my mind and the whole memorys locked in there i dont think it will go away sarah even if the police do get him what if they find him and they cant prove he did it what if he gets off with probation or something he might even slip away from them well thats their problem isnt it you know im not the polices greatest fan but i suppose they know their job when it comes to things like this after all its respectable middleclass girls getting killed not prostitutes maybe but i just wish i knew who it was i wish i could find him myself sarah stared at her and narrowed her eyes and what would you do kirsten paused and drew a circle on the wet table with her finger i think id kill him vigilante justice why not have you ever thought that it might turn out the other way round that hed be the one killing you yes kirsten said quietly ive thought of that dont tell me youre feeling suicidal no thats gone dr henderson laura helped a lot they all say im making wonderful progress and i suppose i am really but but what kirsten fumbled for a cigarette sarah raised her eyebrows but said nothing the couple beside them left and two young men took their place someone put a u song on the jukebox and kirsten had to speak louder to make herself heard they dont know what it feels like to be me do they living half a life in limbo i dont feel that ill get out of it until ive met him again and i know hes dead thats ridiculous said sarah besides you wouldnt know where to look for him any more than the police do no i wouldnt not yet anyway she took a long deep drag on the cigarette and blew the smoke out slowly shall we have another drink then you can tell me all about the others and how harridans doing sarah nodded and kirsten made her way to the bar she didnt have to wait long to get served the crowd had thinned out a bit now as many of the afterwork drinkers had gone home and the evening regulars hadnt arrived yet the two lads at the next table were still there though talking enthusiastically about girls kirsten ignored the way they looked at her as she walked back and sat down again what about galen sarah asked i got a christmas card from him he seems to be doing all right are you two kirsten shook her head its not his fault really he triedgod how he triedbut i put him off i dont think i could handle a relationship with a man right now she remembered that she had never told sarah the full extent of her injuries and wondered whether she should do so not now she decided but perhaps sometime over the next few days sarah had stuck by her she deserved to know kirsten also remembered the small pile of unopened letters most of them from galen that she had put away in her drawer as they chatted about old friends the bookshop and the bedsit kirsten noticed the two lads looking at her again and talking to one another during a lull in the conversation the old kinks song on the jukebox ended and she overheard them one said something about her looking stuckup and needing a really good fuck the other laughed and said something she could only catch the end of enough cock to pave the road from here to lands end ends up and they burst into laughter kirsten whirled round and flung the rest of her lager at them as they recoiled in shock their knees knocked the table and their glasses tipped over rolled onto the stone floor and smashed beer spilled all over the place in a flash the landlord rushed over hey i dont want no trouble before they knew what had happened kirsten and sarah found themselves back out in cheap street they had no idea where the two boys had got to kirsten leaned against a lamppost to catch her breath and sarah stood beside her laughing well you really showed them didnt you and i thought getting chucked out of pubs was my speciality did you hear what they said yeah some of it come on love lets walk a bit their kinds not worth bothering about besides its not as far from here to lands end as it is from up north i suppose that does water down the insult a bit kirsten said lancashire id say from the way they talked probably manchester sarah raised her eyebrows im impressed ive already forgotten most of what i learned last year but you still remember that linguistics stuff kirsten managed a smile i suppose its like riding a bike you never forget anyway we should be going home soon i said we wouldnt be late the snow was still falling now the flakes were bigger and fatter and an inch or two had settled on the roads and pavements where it was soon churned up into gray slush by cars and pedestrians they walked past the floodlit abbey and turned right onto pierrepont street beyond parade gardens the river reflected the strings of redandgreen christmas lights and snowflakes drifted down to melt on the waters surface there were still plenty of shoppers about with huge carrier bags full of presents nice said sarah when she saw the audi kirsten took a scraper from the boot and wiped the snow from the windscreen then she negotiated the oneway system onto wells road soon they had left the city behind and turned off the main road onto the narrow country lanes here the snow lay undisturbed before the cars wheels a pristine white carpet glittering in the headlights thick flakes fell and stuck to the window melting before the wipers could brush them away almost without realizing it kirsten found herself pressing her foot down on the accelerator she knew these winding roads like the back of her hand they were all so narrow that drivers had to pull into the frequent passing places if they met someone coming in the opposite direction and the hedgerows were so tall that no one could see what was around the next corner kirsten felt the car going faster and faster the snow rushing at the windscreen like a blizzard she started to slip a little on the corners the needle edged higher and adrenaline surged in her veins she couldnt stop herself even if she wanted to after a while she became aware of a distant voice and felt a hand shaking her it was sarah yelling for her to slow down she looked terrified all of a sudden kirsten felt herself snap back and eased her foot off the accelerator she felt drained sarah was still ranting on about getting them killed and asking her if she was crazy finally kirsten just had to stop she pulled into the first passing place she came across put on the brakes and turned off the engine her hands were shaking on the wheel are you trying to get us both killed sarah yelled kirsten couldnt speak well its all right with me if you want to kill yourself sarah went on angrily but just leave me out of it all right id rather bloody well walk even though i dont know where the hell i am and she reached for the door handle kirsten leaned over to stop her dont she said urgently im sorry sarah ii dont know sarah paused and turned back concern showing in her fine pale features you all right kirstens hands still gripped the wheel so tightly that her knuckles shone as white as the snow she shook her head she could feel the intense silence and darkness outside the car without lights the snow only showed up as a faint pearly sheen on the road and hedges the mendip hills were lost somewhere in the night inside their breath misted the windows kirstie sarah asked again are you all right love kirsten let go of the wheel and threw herself toward sarah with a strength and desperation that almost sent them both flying out of the door no she cried no im not all right at all she hung on tight and felt sarahs arms close around her holding her and muttering soft words for the first time since it happened she began to really cry the warm salt tears didnt just trickle down her cheeks they welled up in her eyes and poured over onto sarahs shoulder as kirsten clung on and sobbed susan after two days without success sue almost gave up there seemed to be too many obstacles in her way and she was making too many mistakes for a start the conversation with the woman in roses café worried her then she overheard two workers talking and learned that the factory operated on a shift system only the office workers came teeming out of the mesh gates at five oclock most of the people on the shop floor worked one of the shifts noon to eight eight to four and four to noon finding him now seemed like an impossible task she could hardly turn up there at four in the morning and stand gawking as the workers filed out even the weather continued to work against her it rained on and off and the temperature dropped low enough that she had to wear her cardigan under the raincoat she was quite prepared to spend some of her fastdwindling money on binoculars and go up to the woods even though the ground would be wet but luckily it didnt come to that a couple of pieces of good luck kept her going the first evening at five she approached the gates again and when she passed the café she noticed a different woman behind the counter this one was younger with long stringy blond hair there were a few people sitting in the place already so sue entered head bowed like someone just seeking refuge from the rain bought a cup of tea without having to answer any questions and took the window seat perhaps the woman she had met there before only worked lunchtimes she wouldnt need to spend so much of her money on binoculars and end up catching pneumonia in the damp woods after all the problem of the shifts remained and sue didnt know how to get around that one she certainly couldnt afford binoculars with infrared lenses so the four am changeover was beyond her that left noon and eight at night both of which she could cover from the brown cow cheered by the turn in her fortunes sue left roses café just after five thirty on the first day treated herself to cannelloni and salad in a rather expensive restaurant on new quay road near the stationa place that didnt specialize in fish and chipsand then went back over the esk at a quarter to eight to find the brown cow instead of turning right at the culdesac that led to the factory she continued up the lane past the edge of the council estate and found the pub about a hundred yards further on it was an undistinguished modern redbrick place with a tetleys sign hanging outside the doors opened into a large lounge completely lacking in character dull beige wallpaper and a stained brown carpet sticky and worn in patches the tables were made of some kind of tough black plastic and the molded seats were uncomfortable it was a functional place clearly the only people who went there were those who lived on the nearby estate factory workers might drop by at lunchtime sue thought glumly but they werent likely to make an evening of it there when the shift ended at eight oclock however depressing the brown cow seemed to sue though it was certainly busy enough well over threequarters of the tables were occupied and everyone seemed to be having a good time the obligatory jukebox had a tendency toward ancient engelbert humperdinck and tom jones songs and the row of onearmed bandits and video games winked seductively by the far wall like a line of tarts in a brothel plump women smoked and gossiped while plump men smoked and shoved coins into the machines in her raincoat and hood sue thought she looked drab and anonymous enough not to attract too much attention in her dim corner as it turned out though she didnt have to stay long when no crowd of workers had turned up by twentyfive past eight she felt her suspicions confirmed and left like most seaside cafés roses had closed at six oclock just about the time when people were ready for dinner so there was nowhere else to watch from lunchtime on the second day seemed more promising not only did several of the office workers call in at the brown cow but quite a few of the factory men came in for a pie and a pint at the end of their shift sue still didnt see the man she wanted and she began to wonder how much longer she could go on though keiths body hadnt been found yet and nothing new had appeared in the papers she was beginning to worry that the police might be getting close her money wouldnt last forever either and she hardly dared contemplate the consequences if she was wrong about her quarrys origins she had put so much energy into the search gambled so much of herself on the outcome that failure didnt bear thinking about especially now that two innocent people lay dead because of her she went to roses café again that evening around five and turned up at the brown cow at eight still nothing by the third day she was thoroughly discouraged and depressed by the endless shuttling between two such awful environments the world she now seemed to inhabit though no more than a mile or so from the beach the whales jawbone captain cooks statue st marys and the twee shops of church street was so drab and anonymous that it could have been almost anywhere in any english city it was also a world of shadows she was getting jumpy thinking people were following her and watching her it was silly she told herself she was the one doing the watching but she couldnt get the feeling out of her mind she hardly slept at night now and not only because of the gulls she started to think that her days in the sun on west cliff had been a dream now she had passed through the whales jawbone into its dark dank dripping belly and there was no way out then on the third day she saw him kirsten the green fronds began to sway and kirsten felt the weight of the ocean on her eyelids lauras voice murmured in the distance urging her deeper pressing her on and then she heard the buzzing in her ears and she was walking out into the street one muggy june night eons ago she could feel the tarmac path softened by the days heat yield like a pile carpet under her feet and hear the swishing of her jeans as she walked a car droned in the distance a dog barked kirsten looked up the stars were fat and blurred almost buttercolored in the haze but she couldnt find the moon it must be behind those high trees she thought as she hurried on she stood at the center of the park where she could see the glow of the haloed streetlights beyond the trees and felt an urge to sit on the lion she walked across the narrow patch of grass and mounted it images of cockatoos monkeys insects and snakes ran through her mind she laughed and tossed her head back to look for the moon again behind the trees then she felt the rough hand over her mouth and nose her chest was tight and she knew she was kicking and struggling for air as someone maneuvered her off the lion onto her back long grass tickled the nape of her neck and suddenly there was a moon it was shining through a gap between the trees on the spot where she had been dragged and it lit up his face it was dim and ghostly in the pale light but a face nonetheless deeply lined with a short black fringe low on the broad forehead and dark eyebrows that met in the middle and his eyes even in the poor light she could see how they glittered and how they were far beyond reason for a moment the image seemed to freeze and two time frames superimposed she lay pinned to the ground looking up into his face but at the same time she seemed to be facing him directly through a haze the vision disappeared almost as soon as it had formed again she lay on the ground fighting for breath as he shoved a coarse oily rag in her mouth she was gagging suffocating she couldnt go onthe next thing she heard was lauras voice slowly drawing her up from the depths kirsten opened her eyes and took several deep breaths laura poured her a cup of coffee as usual after the hypnotherapy sessions kirsten was grateful for the big window and its view of the city she felt she had been lost in a deep airless vault and needed some air in her lungs to see horizons again laura always waited a while before speaking but this time kirsten broke the silence did you get it all down laura nodded she looked pale you went further than youve ever been before i know this time it was different i couldnt stop myself going on even if i wanted until he put that awful smelly ragi couldnt breathe i was choking she put her hand to her throat as if she still felt the pain your voice wasnt always easy to catch laura said you spoke very quickly and sometimes you mumbled could we go over some of the details kirsten nodded and laura took notes as they analyzed the session when it was over kirsten wandered out into the gray day and stood watching the avon churn down by the city weir she felt curiously detached from the bustling city life around her she knew that she could have gone on reliving the experience if it hadnt been for the choking sensation that had felt too real to suffer through but she did remember something else now something she hadnt been quite able to grasp at the time hands in pockets she sauntered toward high street to meet sarah for lunch the pub was warm and noisy conversations swirled around kirsten like the buzzing of insects she felt as if she were floating it was a pleasant sensation though it had been a long time since she had felt grateful for the atmosphere of a crowded pub sarah was sitting close to the side door a half of lager in front of her and a paperback in her hand kirsten waved to her stopped at the bar for drinks and went over sarah shifted some parcels from the chair next to her and put them on the floor kirsten sat down christmas presents sarah said kirsten sipped her double scotch and reached for her cigarettes are you all right sarah asked you look a bit pale im fine kirsten said i just had a bit of a shock thats all i feel dazed what was it the hypnosis kirsten nodded i remembered sarah i remembered what he looked like her voice sounded shaky and far away to her sarah put her hand on kirstens arm you dont have to talk about it no its all right i dont mind at least not with you anywaya friend lauras a doctor shes being paid to help me however nice she is i mean i like her and im very grateful to her but it doesnt go any deeper no when its not me in the office its someone else isnt it and shes probably just the same with them its nothing special its impersonal like the police and she told sarah about finally seeing her attacker how old do you think he was sarah asked i never really thought about forty fortyfive i suppose pretty old its just that he had this lined face you know roughhewn like lines from the edges of the nose and the mouth she drew them with her fingers on her own face then she shuddered it was awful sarah it was like going through the whole thing again but i couldnt stop myself i didnt want to what happened next laura brought me out of it did you tell the police what he looked like kirsten sipped some scotch and glanced toward the bar things were coming into clearer focus now her feet were touching the ground not yet lauras going to phone them and send a report are you sure youre telling me everything sarah asked why you sound vague and youve got that shifty look on your face ive known you long enough to tell when youre holding something back what is it kirsten paused and swirled her drink in her glass before answering there was something elsejust an impression i cant really be sure what was it when he put the gag in my mouth i was too busy struggling trying to catch my breath to really notice at the time notice what the smell there was a smell of fish you know like at the seaside fish kirsten nodded it probably doesnt mean anything what did the doctor say nothing what do you mean i didnt remember it until id left her office when i was coming here to meet you why dont you phone her kirsten shrugged like i said its probably not important but thats not for you to decide kirsten toyed with her cigarette in the large blue ashtray shaping the end in one of its grooves she felt herself starting to drift again like the smoke that curled and twisted in front of her i dont know she said it just seems that i keep feeding them bits of my memory you know things ive had sweated out of me and nothing happens theyre so impersonal just a big bureaucratic machine i mean two more girls have been killed since mytwo i cant explain myself sarah not yet but its me and him i feel ive got it in me to find him its as if hes inside me and im the only one who can flush him out and then what i dont know jesus christ kirstie if you ask me youre turning a bit batty it must be all that solitude and country air she put her hand on kirstens arm again you really should tell the police everything you can remember like you said hes killed two women already and theres bound to be more people like him dont stop till theyre caught you know do you think i dont know that said kirsten pulling her arm away angrily do you think i dont feel for those women i have to live what they died come again it doesnt matter im sorry if i seem so touchy about it i cant explain im not even sure what i mean myself kirsten sipped some more scotch and looked around the pub again the people looked indistinct their conversations were just meaningless sounds sarah changed the subject to shopping as she halflistened and let herself be lulled by the buzz of talk around her kirsten came to a decision people didnt understand her it seemed not even sarah people didnt understand how personal it was not just for her but for margaret snell and kathleen shannon too doctors policewhat did they know in the future she would have to be careful just how much she told them when she tasted that foul rag he had stuffed in her mouth and smelled his rough stubby fingers she recognized the saltwater taste as well as the fishy odor the rag tasted as if it had been dipped in the sea wasnt there then a good chance that he had come from a coastal town and there was something else not only had she remembered the smell but when he had thrown her to the ground and put the rag in her mouth as she stared up at him in the moonlight his mouth had been moving he had been talking to her she couldnt hear any sounds or words but she knew he had spoken and if she could bring that back there was no knowing what it might tell her about him it might even lead her to him susan as susan approached the brown cow at lunchtime on the third day she saw two white factory vans parked in front and before she had even got near the entrance two men came out of the pub and walked over to them it was impossible to be sure from such a distance but one of them matched the image in her memory low dark fringe the thick eyebrows meeting in the middle she had to get closer to see if he had deep lines on his face and most of all she needed to hear his voice when they started their vans and pulled out she followed on foot at least she could see which way they turned as they drove down the lane if they went left they would be on their way to the factory and if they carried on down to the main road they would be off making a delivery somewhere she was in luck they turned left sue hurried after them she didnt know what she was going to do but there was no point in hanging around the brown cow any longer when she reached the turning the vans had already pulled up outside the loading bays a hundred yards beyond the mesh gates and the drivers were nowhere in sight she walked along the street as far as the row of shops she couldnt just wander through the factory gates and go looking for the man nor could she sit in the café where the inquisitive woman would be on duty what could she do before she had time to come up with a plan she noticed the man walk out of the glass doors of the office building he seemed to be slipping a small envelope of some kind into his pocket a pay packet perhaps whatever it was he looked as though he had finished for the day if he was a driver the odds were that he had just returned from an overnight run padded his time sheet with an hour or so at the brown cow and was now on his way home he was walking toward her only about forty yards away now on the dirt track that led out of the factory she had nowhere to hide she couldnt just stand there in the street until he came level with her what if he recognized her she had changed a lot since their last meeting lost a lot of weight though her wig was about the same length as her hair had been then surely he couldnt have got a much clearer impression of her looks than she had of his but she couldnt stand rooted to the spot there was only one thing to do she rushed forward and ducked into the newsagents she needed her morning papers anyway as she had been so absorbed in her new routine that she hadnt even spent her usual hour in the church street café she hadnt looked for news of keith and she was still feeling nervous about the grimley investigation though no one had knocked on her door in the middle of the night yet the newspapers were arranged in small overlapping piles on a low shelf just inside the window below the rack of magazines from there as she pretended to make her selection with her back turned to the newsagent she could get a closer look at the man as he went past she bent and pretended to leaf through the stack as if she were scanning the front pages for the best headlines when suddenly he appeared right outside he didnt walk past as she had expected instead he patted his pocket turned and came inside sue kept her back to the counter and examined the radio times and womens own in the rack above the papers afternoon greg she heard the woman say in for some baccy i suppose yes please the mans voice sounded muffled and sue couldnt hear him clearly usual aye oh and ill have a box of matches too please love swan vestas finished for the day aye just got back from the leeds and bradford run cant leave the poor beggars without their fish and chips can we the newsagent laughed sue gripped the rack of magazines to keep herself from falling over her heart was beating so fast and loud that she thought it would burst at the very least both the newsagent and the man in the shop must be able to hear it her face was flushed and her breath was hard to catch everything seemed to swim and ripple in front of her eyes like motes dancing in rays of light the magazine covers the grim terraced houses across the street and all the while she struggled to stay on her feet she couldnt let these two people see that there was anything wrong with her they would rush over to help and then sue held on and fought for control as the voice the horrible familiar voice that had been whispering hoarsely in her nightmares for a month carried on making small talk as if nothing terrible had ever happened kirsten when kirsten stood on the platform and watched the intercity pull out at on january she felt frightened and desolate despite an awkward beginning christmas at brierley coombe that year had turned out to be the best time she had enjoyed since the assault she had been glad to have sarah around especially as a counter to all the uncles aunts and grandparents who had treated her as if she were a halfwitted invalid the village itself looked like a christmascard illustration the snow that began on december went on for almost two days and settled a treat particularly out in the country where there was little traffic and no industry to spoil it it lay about two feet thick on the thatched roofs smooth and contoured around the eaves and gables and in the woods where kirsten often took sarah for earlymorning walks the snow that rested on twigs and branches created an image of two worlds in stark contrast the white superimposed on the dark they went into bath once more to do some shopping at the boxing day sales and have drinks with laura henderson whom sarah liked immediately also one night they shocked the locals in the village pub sarah wore her fish on a bicycle tshirt and everyone looked embarrassed there she was the careless tangle of blond hair the pale complexion and exquisite features that looked as if they had been expertly worked from the finest porcelain then smoothed and polished to perfection and to cap it all that great advertisement for the redundancy of the male sex scrawled across her chest nobody bothered them like the lancashire lads in bath had but the village men glanced over and muttered nervously among themselves some of them smiling superciliously it was the most uncomfortable evening of the holiday for kirsten her enjoyment of crowded pubs didnt seem to have lasted long she could relax with laura and sarah but the proximity of men still made her tense and angry and when they looked over with those superior smiles on their faces her cheeks burned with fear and anger after all a man had taken what other men wanted from her somehow she reasoned they were all implicated in that on new years eve kirstens parents went to a party kirsten and sarah were invited but neither of them fancied spending the evening with a bunch of drunken old stockbrokers their bored wives and yuppie offspring so they decided to stay at home and celebrate by themselves the cocktail cabinet was well stocked a log fire blazed in the hearth and they turned out the lights and lit candles instead the open curtains of the french windows revealed the snowcovered garden and trees kirsten brought some of her records and tapes down from her room to play on her fathers stereo and everything seemed perfect they sat on the thick rug in front of the spitting fire listening to mozart with the cognac bottle beside them what are you going to do sarah asked as she poured out their second drinks with my life you mean yes i dont know i havent made any plans you cant just stay here forever you know sarah looked around the room where the candles and fire tossed shadows like dark sails in a storm and out of the windows at the fairytale garden in the snow nice as it is it isnt real life not yours and what is my life for christs sake you got a first a good one youre not going to waste your education are you kirsten laughed listen to yourself you sound like a bloody guidance counselor or something sarah bit her lip and looked away im sorry kirsten reached out and touched her shoulder i didnt mean that its just that i havent thought about it i suppose ive put the future off and i resent being made to dwell on it why dont you go back to university do your ma it neednt be up north if you dont want theres plenty of other places would be glad to have you kirsten nodded slowly i wont say it hasnt crossed my mind but i couldnt start till the next academic year what would i do in the meantime sarah laughed how the hell should i know what do you think i am a guidance counselor but seriously you could get a job something in bath just to keep you going and take you out of yourself youve got too much time to brood on the past hanging around this village what about a bookshop for example youd probably like that but what would my mother think she put on a finishingschool accent i mean its awfully common being a shopgirl dear sarah laughed is that why shes so frosty toward me maybe i should tell her my father owns half of herefordshire think that would help im sure it would shes such a snob seriously though kirstie youve got to do something get out of here what about toronto you could go out there and join galen kirsten topped up both their drinks it was eleven thirty mozarts requiem had just ended and the world outside was silent and still well sarah repeated what about it or is it over between you kirsten stared into the fire flames licked the wood like angry tongues if i dont tell her now she thought i probably never will she looked at sarah so lovely in the winter firelight with red and orange and yellow flames dancing in her eyes and flickering over her face her skin looked almost transparent especially where the fire seemed to shine a delicate coral through her nostrils and over her cheekbones and she had it all not just the looks but a whole body she could make love and have orgasms and have children what is it sarah asked softly kirsten realized that a tear had trickled from the corner of one eye quickly she wiped it away she would have to stop this crying business once was all right it had helped drain her of tension but it mustnt become a habit a weakness over another cigarette she finally told sarah all about the damage to her body sarah listened in horror and couldnt find anything to say she poured more cognac they leaned back against the sofa and sarah put her arm around kirsten and held her close there were no more tears they sat like that content and silent for a while sipping rémy finally sarah swore softly shit its ten past twelve weve forgotten the new year kirsten looked up and the spell was broken her back ached from the position shed been sitting in so it is never mind ill get the veuve clicquot and well have our own new year a bit late she stood up rubbed her aching muscles and went into the kitchen and so they had poured champagne sung auld lang syne and wished each other a happy new year at twenty past twelve and now sarah was gone kirsten walked aimlessly around bath its streets quiet with postseasonal depression and thought over what sarah had said about the future she decided that she would resume her studies or at least apply for next year it would be a good cover and it would keep her parents off her back in the meantime she was going to attempt to find out who had crippled her it might take months she realized but at least now she had discovered that the knowledge was there locked inside her of course she must take care that no one suspected what she was really up to she had to appear as if she was simply getting on with her life and putting the past behind her she didnt know yet what she was going to do if she did discover anything but she had to find the key unlock the voice and thenfirst though she had a lot of thinking and a lot of planning to do susan by the time the man had left the newsagents sue had managed to get her breathing under control she bought her papers and a packet of cigarettes then walked back out into the drizzle he had reached the end of the street and turned left down the lane toward the water without really considering what she was going to do sue started following him she half expected him to turn into the council estate assuming that was where he lived but he didnt instead of walking right down to church street however he turned right along a narrow road that ran parallel to it there were no houses on the righthand side of the street just a stretch of waste ground that sloped up to the southern edge of the council estate almost hidden beyond the convex swell of the land on the left stood a row of small detached cottages they were nothing much reallyjust red brick with slate roofsbut each had its own front and back gardens their rear windows would also look out over the harbor toward west cliff and a good view always costs money sue had tried to hang back a reasonable distance behind the man and she didnt think he had spotted her beyond the row of cottages lay another open tract of weeds and nettles where the street itself petered out into a narrow dirt path that veered left eventually to join church street by the esk it might be difficult to follow him over open land sue thought although she looked ordinary enough in her long navyblue raincoat and hood if he turned he might just recognize her from the shop and then he would wonder what a tourist was doing following him through such an unattractive part of town before she had time to decide whether to go on or turn back however she saw him walk down the path to the last cottage in the row she paused taking cover behind a parked van and watched him put the key in the lock and enter so that was where he lived she wondered if he lived alone if he really was the man who had attacked her and she had been certain as soon as she heard his voice that he was he probably did then she thought of peter sutcliffe the yorkshire ripper who had lived with his wife sonia throughout the period he had killed and butchered thirteen women and hadnt there been two or three others who had survived his attacks sue wondered what had become of them anything was possible but somehow she couldnt bring herself to believe that the man she was after shared his life with a woman when he had disappeared inside the cottage sue turned and walked back down the lane to the road there was nothing more she could do at the moment a little careful planning at least was called for now she couldnt just go barging in and kill him she had to lure him to an isolated open place after dark because she had been attacked in just such a place she felt that she would have more chance of succeeding somewhere similar when the tables were turned he was stronger than her so she would have to use cunning she couldnt see it happening in a house or on a street but she knew where he lived now and that was comforting knowledge it gave her an advantage as if to mark her entry into tourist whitby the drizzle stopped and the clouds began to break allowing a few feeble rays of sun through here and there she was on the narrow cobbled part of church street again north of whitby bridge the world went on as normal there families and courting couples wandered down the road as usual pausing to look in the windows of the jet shops and the little gift shops that sold flavored fudge or sachets of earl grey tea and colombian coffee it was one thirty and sue hadnt eaten yet she was also eager to read the papers she went into the black horse bought a half of lager and ordered a steak and kidney pie the place was moderately busy mostly with young couples eating lunch mackintoshes strewn on the seats beside them and umbrellas propped up against the wall she managed to find a small corner table and sat down to read the papers while she ate there was nothing about the student slasher in the independent it had after all been almost a week since he had last struck unless the police caught him or found an important clue there would be nothing more about him until he had slashed and strangled his next victim sue meant to see that that never happened she glanced quickly at the headlineswar lies corruption miseryand then turned anxiously to the local paper the news was on the front page staring her right in the face crimes linked police in whitby are attempting to establish whether there is any link between the murder of a whitby man jack grimley and the serious wounding of an australian national keith mclaren whose unconscious body was discovered by a wildlife worker in some woods near dalehouse late last night mr mclaren suffering from serious head injuries is presently in a coma in st marys hospital scarborough doctors refuse to comment on his chances of recovery but one hospital spokesman admitted there is a strong risk of permanent brain damage when asked if the attacks could have been carried out by the same person a police spokesman told our reporter it is too early to say we are looking at two different cases both with similar head wounds but so far there is no evidence of a connection between these two men police are still anxious to interview anyone who might have seen grimley after he left the lucky fisherman last thursday they are also interested in discovering the identity of a woman seen with mclaren in hinderwell last monday afternoon she is described as young with short light brown hair wearing jeans a gray jacket and a checked shirt police are eager that anyone who can identify her come forward at once sue put the paper down on the table and tried to control her shaking hands he wasnt dead keith wasnt dead she should have known she hadnt hit him hard enough instead of finishing the job she had been frightened by that damn dog and hurried away without making sure perhaps she had felt sorry for him too and that had made her soft but it had never entered her mind that she might not have killed him what could she do now what if he were to come round and tell the police who she was they already had a description of martha browne sue pushed the rest of her pie aside and lit a cigarette she had no appetite left it was time to get a grip on herself she went to the bar bought a double brandy then settled down to reread the article carefully she must be careful not to panic not now that she had the scent of her true prey she had to think clearly the description of the girl was vague for a start and it certainly didnt resemble the way she looked now but would the proprietor of the abbey terrace guesthouse remember her and what about grimleys pals in the lucky fisherman she had been dressed much the same that night she recalled as when she had walked in the woods with keith would the men remember seeing her sitting with the australian glancing over at grimley as if she knew him and had anyone seen her with keith in staithes she had been wearing her new outfit at first before she had changed in the toilet so what if someone could connect the one girl with the other the police could be getting very close indeed she realized she would have to act quickly there was no sense in staying around to get arrested for killing jack grimley when she had now caught up with the man she really wanted time was definitely working against her its winged chariot snapping at her heels and what about keith he might recover consciousness at any moment would he still be able to identify her or would his memory of the incident be gone as hers had been for so long she didnt know all she knew was that she had her man in sight and she had better find a way of luring him into the open soon or the whole mission would be at risk a tweedy woman who had just come to sit at the next table gave her a curious look it was probably time to change her haunts she had been to this pub and the nearby café far too often she sipped some more brandy it warmed her throat and settled her fluttering stomach should she go to the hospital in scarborough creep into keiths room and put the pillow over his face could she do it did she have the nerve but she remembered that her attacker had tried to get to her in a similar situation and he hadnt succeeded there would be police guards security would be far too tight for her to be able to get through to him no that was out of the question all she could do was hope that he wouldnt recover there was still the holdall back in her room she hadnt got rid of it yet that was something she could do while she worked out a plan to deal with greg then she would have to leave town quickly no foolish hanging around to wallow in the outcome of her actions she would have to read about and savor her success at a distance like everyone else kirsten with sarah gone kirsten had only her fears and a growing sense of mission to keep her going in late january the killer claimed his fourth victim a secondyear biology student called jane pitcombe carefully kirsten cut out her picture and all the details she could find and put them in the scrapbook she had started to keep track of the victims also that month she told laura henderson that she wanted to stop the hypnotherapy sessions as they were becoming too painful for her in reality she was worried that she would give away to laura whatever she discovered and that the police would find the killer first she had come to realize shortly after sarah left that she wanted him for herself it was the only way to heal her wounds and put the spirits of margaret kathleen and jane to rest it wasnt difficult to convince laura to stop the hypnotism after all the police had gotten as good a description of the killer as they were likely to it was important to try to keep everyone happy so to this end she finally read galens letters and wrote him a long cheery but noncommittal reply she apologized for not writing sooner but said she had just come through a lengthy period of depression she also told him she was going to resume her studies probably back up north canada just seemed too far away from home for her to consider yet she was sure he would understand february bleak and cold came and went kirsten spent much of the time in her room brooding on the dark places in her mind trying to find ways to make the cloud yield up its secrets this was her main problem without lauras hypnotherapy she couldnt get at her censored memories she bought a book on selfhypnosis and practiced with some success she could relax easily enough and induce a light trance but she couldnt get beyond the fishy odor nonetheless she intended to keep at it until she dispersed the cloud toward the end of that month and until well into april she found some solace in the cloud of unknowing the fourteenthcentury masterpiece of christian mysticism which she picked off her shelf to help her set her mind on university studies again yet kirsten very much doubted that she read it the way its author intended the words seemed to address her own problem in a startlingly direct way and the irony wasnt lost on her when you first begin you find only darkness and as it were a cloud of unknowing you dont know what this means except that in your will you feel a simple steadfast intention reaching out towards god do what you will this darkness and this cloud remain between you and god and stop you both from seeing him in the clear light of rational understanding and from experiencing his loving sweetness in your affection reconcile yourself to wait in this darkness as long as necessary but still go on longing after him whom you love it was a kind of inversion of what kirsten feltcertainly it wasnt god she was seeking nor did she love the object of her questbut the words gave her sustenance nonetheless and helped her through the darkness both internal and external the book also helped describe what she was experiencing in a way that even laura henderson hadnt been able to get at do not think because i call it a darkness or a cloud it is the sort of cloud you see in the sky or the kind of darkness you know at home when the light is outby darkness i mean a lack of knowingjust as anything that you do not know or may have forgotten may be said to be dark to you for you cannot see it with your inward eye it was exactly like the dark bubble or cloud she felt in her mind it came between her and the devil the man who had maimed her and it wasnt so much an object or an element as a feeling a sense of something impenetrable anchored deep in her mind the book offered more in the way of practical advice too and kirsten began to wonder how she had ever sustained herself for so long without it especially the fifth meditation which read if ever you are to come to this cloud and live and work in it as i suggest then just as this cloud of unknowing is as it were above you between you and god so you must also put a cloud of forgetting beneath you and all creation we are apt to think that we are very far from god because of this cloud of unknowing between us and him but surely it would be more correct to say that we are much further from him if there is no cloud of forgetting between us and the whole created world kirsten had to distance and detach herself from the everyday world if she wanted to follow through with her purpose there was no use clinging to sentimental notions of good and evil she had to learn to exist in a detached rarefied world where the object of her quest had supreme importance and everything and everyone else was lost for as long as it took in a cloud of forgetting but nobody must know this she had to appear to be making progress as far as family and friends were concerned the book was arranged into seventyfive short numbered chapters or meditations and it was not the kind of text one could read for hours on end kirsten read a chapter a day occasionally skipping a day to read a novel so she managed to stretch the book out for over two months as winter turned into spring soon bluebells and forgetmenots grew in the woods again and dandelions and buttercups gilded the open fields the bitter air warmed and released the scents of the countryside from its wintry grip grass and tree bark after rain wild garlic rubbed between the fingers damp earth recently plowed over as she walked and took it all in kirsten remembered last autumn when she had felt dead inside and nothing could touch her now that she had a purpose a sense of mission she could enjoy the world again the book continued to convince her of the holiness of her task and seemed to promise success when on the final page one fresh bright morning in midmay she read that it is not what you are or have been that god looks at with his merciful eyes but what you would be she knew without doubt that she would succeed all holy desires grow by delays and if they fade because of these delays then they were never holy desires tenacity determination they were the qualities she had to nurture in order to prove her desires holy her need would not fade it was with her part of her day and night throughout this period she still continued to visit bath and see laura too though not as frequently as before once a fortnight seemed enough for what they had to talk about the main topic toward the end was kirstens feelings about being a victim some schools laura explained hold that there are people who are born victims who somehow attract killers when the circumstances are right they will get what they were born for things happen to us because of what we are some psychologists maintain and because of this some of us keep making the same mistakes time after timemarrying the wrong man or woman for example or seeking out situations in which we are abused asking for trouble it wasnt masochism laura said but something rooted deep in a persons unconscious that led him or her to keep making the same wrong choices did kirsten think she was one of those people did she feel guilt over what had happened to her did she feel as if she had asked for it the whole subject puzzled kirsten at first for a long time she had simply assumed that it had been her bad luck to be in the wrong place at the wrong time the unfortunate victim of a random assault it had never in fact occurred to her that she might have been asking for it that was the rapists common defense wasnt it that his victim had been asking for it because she had dressed in a certain way or smiled at the wrong time kirsten couldnt accept that if she had given in to hugos advances that night and gone home with him none of this would have happened if she hadnt had to get home reasonably early and sober to pack for the next day then she might have stayed at the party longer and walked across the park with a group of drunken colleagues if she hadnt walked across the park that night but had taken the welllit roads around it if she hadnt strayed from the path to sit on the lion like a silly girland so it went on nothing but a lot of ifs and on the plus side if that man hadnt been walking his dog at precisely the right time then kirsten would have died like the later victims had but the more she talked about it with laura the more she realized that things could only have been different had she been a different kind of person those schools were right in a way the roots of what happened were tangled up with who she was she could easily have given in to hugo for example he was attractive enough and plenty of her friends would have done so indeed most of them had at one time or another but no she wasnt that kind of girl and she did habitually cross the park alone after dark no matter how often people expressed concern also it would never have occurred to her not to give in to that childish impulse to ride the lion unless she had been with company in other words maybe she did think of herself as a born victim and she just hadnt admitted it before but she didnt tell laura this she could sense that laura was testing her trying to find out how sensitive she was so she gave what she thought were the right answers laura seemed relieved but kirsten continued to question herself why did she cross the park by herself in the dark for example was she looking for something to happen she certainly hadnt been making any kind of a feminist gesture when women want to make a point about their right to walk the streets and parks in safety they do so in large wellpublicized groupsthe sensible way but kirsten often did it alone why was she inviting destruction somehow a simple chain of causality wasnt enough to explain what had happened to her she had been living in a dream ever since the attack had occurred simply because she had accepted it in such a shallow way and had never really contemplated the deeper implications that was no acceptance at all the cloud of unknowing her last talks with laura henderson both of these gave a shape and depth to her quest that she had never imagined possible before they concentrated her resolve and acted like a magnet forming a rose pattern from iron filings it all meant somethingeverything happened for a reasonand the more she thought about it if there was a part of her deep inside that made her the victimjust as hatred twisted deep inside the man made him a killerthen the person who had found her must have been destined to be her savior he had found her for a purpose she now realized she hadnt died like the others she had been delivered from that and this was when the compelling idea of fate destiny and retribution started to occur to her if she had been a victim not by blind chance but for a reason then she was still alive for a reason she bore her stigmata for a reason she carried within her the means of destroying this evil force in a sense she was his nemesis and that was destiny too she never told laura all this like the true nature of the cloud or bubble in her mind it would have been too difficult to put into words besides she wasnt at all clear about it herself at first it didnt evolve as a fully fledged theory like a pallas athena sprung from the head of zeus but the ideas took shape over time it was something that she thought about a lot in the spring months of may and june while she reread old novels plowed through julian of norwichs revelations of divine love and considered which university to apply to and which area of study to concentrate on it would probably be best she decided to apply to several placessay the north where sarah suggested they share a flat together and to bath and bristol where her parents wanted her to go then when the time came she could see how she felt and make her choice in early june the killer the man the press were now calling the student slasher claimed yet another victim kim waterford a petite brunette with a twinkle in her eyes that even the poorquality newspaper photograph couldnt dim well he had dimmed it hadnt he now her eyes would be dull and lifeless as dead fish kirsten pasted the picture and articles in her scrapbook and worked even harder at selfhypnosis one glorious day in late june when bath was filled with tourists again and boaters splashed and laughed on the avon outside the halfopen window laura smiled at the end of the session offered kirsten a cigarette and said i think weve gone as far as we can go together if you need me ill be here dont hesitate to call but really i think youre on your own now love kirsten nodded she knew she was susan still clutching her holdall in the carrier bag sue returned to the shops again that afternoon and spent a few pounds of her fastdwindling funds on some dark gray marks amp spencer slacks and a blue windbreaker with a zipup front she spent a good while in front of the toilet mirror on her makeup changing the emphasis a little here and there and found that it was possible to fasten her wig back in a ponytail without revealing any of her own hair her glasses also went well with the new outfit now she looked just different enough not to spark any memories among those who might have noticed her ghostlike presence she was no longer just the plain primly dressed nice girl in the raincoat nor was she the shorthaired tomboy in jeans and a checked shirt she looked more like a family holidaymaker taking a break from her parents company for a while the new clothes would also be more suitable for hanging around in the woods watching over the factory if it came to that she was annoyed about the holdall when she had got to saltwick nab she found that the tide was coming in not going out she would have to go back later in the evening or perhaps it would be easier to throw it from the top of west cliff or somewhere closer there would be too many people around in that area though someone might see her she shoved the raincoat and hood along with everything else in the holdall and took it back to her room at least it was coming in useful now she had more stuff to get rid of she thought about keith a lot too lying in that hospital in scarborough with tubes and needles stuck in him just as she had lain over a year ago she had dismissed the idea of trying to get to himsecurity would be too tight and she wasnt sure she could go through with it in cold bloodbut she couldnt stop worrying the police might be looking for her at that very moment all the more reason to hurry up at a quarter to five she dropped in at roses café the stringy blonde behind the counter showed no interest in her beyond taking her money sue needed some idea of what her mans hours were when could she expect to find him walking alone in the dark when did he make his deliveries when did he sleep she assumed that he had either made a morning delivery that day or had set off the night before and stayed over if the latter then the odds were that he would be at home tonight it annoyed her that she couldnt find out for sure she certainly couldnt ask anyone no doubt the drivers worked very irregular hours taking loads when they were ready and standing in for mates who were ill or had driven too many hours all she could really do was watch a little longer and she didnt know how much time she had left over the next two days the weather though still chilly continued to improve sue took to hanging around the area by the factory almost constantly all the time she felt as if she were looking over her shoulder for the police when she was the one who should be doing the watching she read the papers every morning but they reported no change in keiths condition or in the state of the police investigation in a way though she still felt nervous and paranoid at times she took heart that nothing had happened yet surely they must have reached a dead end or they would have been on to her already nothing could stop her now she was meant to succeed her task was holy she kept a low profile in roses and the brown cow but found that now she had the man in sight she could even recognize his squat dark figure from the woods above the factory she also investigated another pub called the merry monk at the bottom end of the council estate and found that from one of its small windows in a dark corner she could just about see across the waste ground down to his cottage at the end of the row as she had expected his comings and goings were irregular and as far as she could make out he lived alone she would have to know her opportunity when it arose and grab it without hesitation first she wanted him to know that she had found him when she finally lured him to his death she wanted him to know who was doing it and why he would be asking for it but she had to do this without causing undue danger to herself also though she was certain this time after her mistake she wanted more confirmation she needed proof if she killed or wounded another innocent man in the area her chances of success would be practically nil slowly as she watched him she began to form a plan she almost bumped into him on her way back to town from roses café at five thirtyfive on her second day of full surveillance he was walking the other way back toward the factory she averted her face but for a moment she could have sworn that he noticed her he didnt know who she wasshe would have felt that kind of recognition jolt her like an electric shockbut perhaps he connected her with the woman hed seen yesterday in the newsagents or perhaps given what he was he looked at all women that way sue hurried on with her head down and didnt stop until she got to the end of the street from there hidden by the wall of the corner house she saw him in the distance by the loading bays talking to a man in a white smock and trilby probably a foreman who gave him some papers her man got in his van and drove off sue carried on walking down the lane she hadnt got far before he passed her then he turned right toward the junction for the main scarborough road it didnt mean that he was going to scarborough of course as it was one of the few ways out of the town and could lead to york or to the leeds area but one thing was for certain he was out on a job and he wouldnt be home for a while sue hurried down to the main road but he was nowhere in sight she walked north a little way on the pavement then doubled back on the dirt path that eventually curved around past his cottage sues heart felt as if it were in her throat as she approached the cottage coming from that direction across the waste ground she couldnt be seen from any of the other houses on the row luckily too there were no buildings on the other side of the street only the scrub ground that sloped up to the council estate she could be seen from her little window in the pub but it was still early in the evening for drinkers and there was no reason why anyone enjoying a pint and a chat in the merry monk should make the effort of looking out of that particular window especially as it meant pulling the curtain aside a little even if they did what they saw would mean nothing to them she had thought of waiting until dark but that meant she would need a torch which would in the long run give her much more risk of being spotted no this was better a blind approach at a time when most people would be busy preparing their evening meals anyway she had already noticed that he kept his curtains closed whenever he was out and that would keep her hidden should anyone pass by while still giving her enough light to search by there was only one small window in the side of the house that faced the waste ground and that was too high to reach a kitchen extension built on the back which also shielded her from the neighbors view looked more promising the back door itself was solid and locked and the curtained window that probably led into the living room or dining room also proved impossible to open the kitchen window looked like a better possibility the wood was old and the unfastened catch had been painted over in the open position long ago sue wedged the heels of her hands against the crossbar and pushed up at first nothing happened and she thought that perhaps the window too had been painted shut but the paint was cracked and peeling on the outside and before long it began to shudder upward sue paused after she had made a space big enough to enter but there was no sound nobody had heard her nimbly she slipped in over the kitchen sink and closed the window behind her the palms of her hands felt sore and sweaty from the effort she had no idea what she expected to findwalls daubed in blood perhaps or heads on spikes and violent red graffiti scrawled over whitewashed walls and the whore must diebut she wasnt prepared for the sheer ordinariness of the place the only uncurtained window was the one through which she had climbed and that let plenty of light into the kitchen everything was in its place the washingup lay in the draining rack glasses and plates shone like new the surfaces were all clean too and the room smelled of lemon washingup liquid a refrigerator she could see her reflection in hummed cans of soup and tins of spaghetti stood in an orderly row on a shelf above the dining table with its salt and pepper set out neatly on a mat at its center even the small cooker was spotless the living room where light filtered in pale blue through the thin curtains was just as tidy magazines stood in the vertical rack by the hearth corners and pages aligned so they looked like one solid block as thick as a telephone directory a pipe rack hung above the mantelpiece and the air was acrid with the smell of stale smoke in the corner near the window was a television on a stand with a video on the shelf beneath it and next to that a cassette storage rack with a varnished wood finishand not a speck of dust in sight what did this man watch sue wondered pornography snuff movies but when she examined the cassettes she saw they were all ordinary enough he had labeled each one in clear print and most of them were simply tapes of recent television programs he must have missed while out driving nothing more interesting than a couple of episodes of coronation street no doubt taped while he was out on a delivery a bbc wildlife special a few american cop programs and two movies rented from a local shop angel heart and fatal attraction they werent exactly mary poppins but they werent hardcore pornography either an old sofa sat in front of the fireplace its beige upholstery protected by lace antimacassars and one matching armchair stood at a precise angle to it like the rest of the house the room was small and spotless and as far as sue could make out in the faint light the walls were painted light blue rather than papered the only thing that struck her as at all odd was the complete absence of photographs and personal knickknacks the mantelpiece was bare as were the solid oak sideboard and the walls there was however a small bookcase by the kitchen door most of the titles were on local history some of them large illustrated volumes and the only novels were used paperbacks of blockbusters by robert ludlum lawrence sanders and harold robbins bedes history was there of course sue picked it up and noticed that the old paperback had been well thumbed one passage in particular had been heavily underscored sue shivered and put the book back upstairs revealed nothing different about the owner of the cottage in the bathroom every fixture fitting and surface looked in shining pristine condition and in the bathroom cabinet various pills potions and creams stood in orderly rows like soldiers at attention there was only one bedroom his the bed was made covered in yellow nylon sheets and there was nothing in the drawers and cupboards but carefully ironed shirts a couple of sports jackets one pressed suit and neatly folded underwear and socks the place seemed to have no personality at all was he really her man surely there ought to be some sign beyond the book back downstairs sue looked for a cellar door but couldnt find one perhaps it was just as well she thought she was feeling edgy being there at all if she found a body in the cellar she didnt know how she would react but that was silly she told herself just nerves he didnt take the bodies home with him she opened the doors of the sideboard and found a little port sherry and brandy along with glasses of various shapes and sizes place mats and a white linen tablecloth in one of the top drawers were the everyday odds and ends one needs around a house fuse wire string candles matches penknife extra shoelaces pencil stubs when she opened the second drawer though sues breath caught in her throat there laid out neatly in a row on a lining of faded rosepatterned wallpaper were six locks of hair each bound in the middle by a pink ribbon six victims six locks of hair sue felt dizzy she had to turn away and support herself by gripping the back of an armchair when she had fought back the vertigo and nausea she turned to look again at the sight she found so gruesome in its simplicity and ordinariness nothing too grotesque for this man no severed breasts ears or fingers just six locks of hair laid out neatly in a row on a lining of faded rosepatterned wallpaper and further back in the drawer a pair of scissors a roll of pink satin ribbon and a long knife with a worn bone handle and a gleaming stainlesssteel blade but it was the hair that really captured sues attention six locks one blonde three brunettes two redheads she reached out and touched them as she would stroke a cat she could even put names to them one of the red locks the darkest was kathleen shannons the blonde was margaret snells the curly brunette lock had belonged to kim waterford and the straight jetblack strand was jill sarsdens none of them was sues he must have been disturbed before he got around to taking it she realized no doubt it was the last thing he did take a souvenir and the police had never said anything about itwhich meant either that they didnt know or that they were keeping the knowledge up their sleeves to deter copycats and check against phoney confessions and of course to verify the true one if it ever came well sue thought here was an oversight she could rectify easily enough she pushed back her wig picked up the scissors and carefully snipped off a lock about two inches long exactly the same length as the others she then bound it neatly with a piece of ribbon and placed it in line with the rest now she thought pleased with herself just wait till he notices that she was convinced that he drooled over his trophies every day and what a bloody shock hed get when he found another lock of hair there not only would he know there was someone on to him he would probably know who it was and that was just what sue wanted the house was silent except for the sound of sues heart beating but she still felt uneasy it was time to get out before he came back she slid the drawer shut and hurried back to the kitchen window kirsten that summer kirsten took long brooding walks in the woods and reckless drives in the countryside close to the end of the university term about the same time she had been attacked a year ago the killer found his sixth victimthe fifth to diein a quiet halifax nursing student called jill sarsden kirsten pasted the photo and details in her scrapbook as usual at home she pretended all was well the dark cloud still troubled her bringing painful headaches and bouts of depression that were difficult to hide but she managed to convince dr craven that she was making excellent progress since discontinuing the analysis and the doctors opinion helped to reassure her parents if she was occasionally quiet and withdrawn well that was only to be expected her parents knew that she had always valued her solitude and privacy anyway in her room each night she kept at the selfhypnosis but got no further the directions she had read in the book were simple enough roll your eyeballs up as far as you can close your eyes and take a deep breath then let your eyes relax breathe out and feel yourself floating she had even delved back into earlier memories of pain as practicethe time her finger got trapped in a door when she was six the day she fell off her bicycle and needed stitches in her armbut still she couldnt get beyond the odor of fish without feeling overcome by a sense of choking panic one hot bright day in late july she stopped in a cotswold village for a cold drink walking back to the car she noticed a craft center in an old stone cottage and decided to have a look inside the cottage had been extended at the back and part of it converted into a glassblowing studio kirsten watched entranced as the delicate and fragile pieces took shape from molten glass at the end of the tube afterward as she browsed around the shop she noticed a row of solid glass paperweights like the one in lauras office with colorful abstract designs trapped inside them the rose pattern appealed to her most and she bought it feeling great satisfaction at the smooth slippery weight in her palm and it gave her an idea that evening in her room she prepared for selfhypnosis again doing breathing exercises and relaxing each muscle in turn when she was ready she sat before her desk where the paperweight lay between two candles drawing and twisting their light into its curved scarlet petals her book had mentioned that there were many ways of selfhypnosis and she had chosen the method said to be the most effective but whether there was something about the connection with her early sessions with laura or something special about the paperweight itself kirsten found she had much more success this way though the first attempt led to no great breakthrough she got a strong feeling that she would soon find what she wanted if she persisted it happened a week later she had been taking herself further and further back from the attack and moving forward slowly this time she started with her preparations for the evening a long bath the lemonfresh scent of her clean comfortable clothes the pleasant walk to the ring obells with sarah as usual she drew back at the oily rag and the fishy smell but this time she heard his voice not all the wordsjust fragments about a dark one and a song of destructionbut it was enough with her training in linguistics and dialect kirsten could place the accent easily enough when she came out of the light trance her heart was thumping and she felt as if she had just been dropped into an icy bath she breathed deeply fully alert now and poured herself a glass of water the raspy voice still sounded clear in her mind he was from yorkshire she couldnt be certain but she didnt think he had a city accent or the broad speech of the dales and the pennine moorlands when she added this new knowledge to the salt smell of raw fish that had covered his fingers and palms then she knew he was from the yorkshire coasta holiday resort or a fishing village perhaps the more she thought about it replayed the voice and remembered her lessons the more sure she became she jumped up and pulled down the old school atlas from her bookshelf from what she could see the coastline stretched from around bridlington bay in the south to near redcar in the north county boundaries were no sure guide though especially as they had been changed in the seventies she didnt think he was from as far north as middlesbrough where a northumbrian strain subtly infused the local speech but she would have to include the humberside area as far south as the humber estuary that left more than a hundred miles of rugged coastline it was useless she thought even if she was right she would never be able to find him in such a large area she dropped the atlas on the floor and threw herself onto the bed the next day she tried the same selfhypnosis technique again and again she heard the voice the flat vowels and clipped consonants she felt something about the words this time something that rang a bell deep inside her mind try as she might though she couldnt identify them he had been reciting a poem or a song of some kind she had read somewhere that such killers sometimes do that talk while they work often quoting fragments of the bible but she didnt think it was from the bible he had said something about leaving a feast because someone had asked him to sing a song and he couldnt she knew the words she had heard them before at some time in her studies but she couldnt for the life of her remember where she slept badly that night haunted by the fragmented speech and the raspy tone of his voice but in the morning she felt no closer to her goal she didnt know how it could help but she needed to know exactly what he had said she had to think to work at it the source was oldcertainly prerenaissance by the sound of itand that probably meant something from medieval literature people were always singing and attending feasts then there was only one thing to do read and so she set to reading medieval literature on warm days in the garden sir gawain chaucer piers plowman anthologies full of religious lyrics she read them all to no avail all she got for her pains was that awful feeling of trying to find a quotation you have on the tip of your tongue but cant pin down or the frustration of looking for a phrase in shakespeare when you cant even remember what play it comes from outwardly kirsten seemed fine preparing to go back to university optimistic about her future she even told her parents that she was considering the restorative surgery that the doctor had mentioned might be possible but inside she was seething with anger and frustration one golden day in late august she sat out on the back lawn under the copper beech with hardly a breeze to stir her hair from her brow she had given up on medieval literature as a source and gone back even further to anglosaxon which she had studied in her first year so far she had read translations of beowulf and the seafarer and was now working her way through bedes an ecclesiastical history of the english people it was an old translation that she had bought in a secondhand bookshop attracted by the worn blue binding the gilded page edges and a pleasantly musty smell that reminded her of the local library inside the flyleaf in faded coppercolored ink was written to reginald with love from elizabeth october may god go with you despite the translators flowery language the venerable bede came through as far more human to her than many of his austere colleagues in the early church and she could picture him out on the lonely island of lindisfarne poring over illuminated manuscripts as he suffered through a wild northumbrian winter about twothirds of the way through the book she came to the passage about england s first poet caedmon who had been unable to sing whenever the harp was passed around at dinners and everyone was expected to contribute a song caedmon always stole away one evening after he left a feast to care for the horses in the stables he had a vision in which a man came and spoke his name and asked him to sing caedmon protested but the stranger paid no attention to his excuses yet shall ye sing to me he insisted when caedmon asked what he should sing about the man replied praise ye creation and caedmon found his inspiration there was no blinding flash of light but as kirsten read the dark cloud that had lodged itself in her mind since the attack seemed to disperse in addition to her own silent voice she could hear another voice reading along with her a perversion of bedes words and lo i asked of what shall i sing and the dark one told me sing of destruction it was the story he had told her as he beat her and slashed at her in the park that night the summer garden turned to mist around her like a place filmed through a greasy lens and her book slipped onto the grass she took a deep breath and closed her eyes afterimages of light and leaves danced before her eyelids then the memories flowed back unbidden she could see his face now in shadow with the moon over his shoulder catching one lined cheek as he smeared the smell of fish all over her lips and nostrils he stuffed a piece of oily rag in her mouth and it made her feel sick then he started slapping her back and forth across her face and talking in that raspy singsong voice about how he had left the feast of whores one night and had a vision of the dark one to whom he confessed his impotence the dark one he said gave him the power to sing to women thats what he was doing with his knife he was singing to her just like that old poet from his town who had suddenly been blessed with the gift of poetry late in life the images went on she could easily recall every painful moment of consciousness now but she held herself back and pulled out with a sharp gasp when the unbearable image of the knife blade flashing in moonlight took shape when she had breathed in the warm air and run her fingers over the trees smooth bark to bring herself back to earth she remembered that he had actually said just like the old poet from my town she could play the words back now as if they were on a tape inside her mind she picked up the book and found that according to bede caedmon came from a place called streanaeshalch of course that would be the anglosaxon name bede often used the roman or saxon names flipping through the index kirsten found it in no time streanaeshalch see whitby so he came from whitby it made perfect sense it all added up the fishy smell the accent and now the reference to caedmon poet of his town he had had no reason to assume that kirsten would survive the attack her continued existence had not been his intention hadnt superintendent elswick said something about his trying to get to her at the hospital too that must have been because he was worried that she might remember what he had said in his ritual chant and as time went by and nothing happened he must have realized that she had lost her memory and that he had nothing more to worry about then he had continued blithely with his mission singing his song with a knife on a womans body so now she knew what was she to do next first she hurried inside to find one of her fathers old aa members handbooks he usually kept a couple along with the telephone directory in the bureau drawer in the hall she turned to the maps at the back and found whitby it was on the coast between scarborough and redcar and it didnt look too big she ran her finger down the w s in the gazetteer whimple whippingham whistonthere it was whitby population bigger than she thought still if the man she was after had such rough hands and smelled of fish then she would probably find him around the docks or on the boats she thought she would be able to recognize him and now the voice would confirm it and she had guidance in her missionmargaret kathleen kim and the restthey wouldnt let her fail not now she had come so far there was a holiness about what she had to do a reason that she out of all of them had been saved she had been chosen as his nemesis it was her destiny to find him and face him she couldnt picture the actual occasion of their meeting what would happen it would be in the open and it would take place at night that was all she knew as for the outcome one of them would die but even a nemesis she thought wryly has to plan and deal with practical realities the aa handbook also gave information about distances from london york and scarborough and listed market days there followed a selection of hotels most of which would probably be too expensive for kirsten no matter she could go into bath and buy a local travel guide that would probably list bed and breakfast accommodation excited and nervous at the prospect of the hunt kirsten settled down to make preparations she would visit sarah first and go to whitby from there she wouldnt take much with her just the handy holdall jeans a couple of shirts and whatever she needed to do the job it would have to be something small something she could conceal in her hand as she knew she might have to act quickly kirsten shuddered at the thought and began to doubt herself then she reminded herself again of all that she had suffered and survived and the reason for that she had to be strong she had to concentrate on practical matters as far as she could and trust to instinct and fate to take care of the rest two days later after she had bought a whitby guide and written to sarah she informed her parents that she had decided to go back up north to university they both expressed concern and displeasure but that was balanced by relief that she seemed to have come out of her long depression and decided to get on with her life i wont say im happy youre going away her father said with a sad smile but i will say im happy that youve decided to go do you know what i mean kirsten nodded i suppose i must have been a bit of a pest i havent been very good company have i her father shook his head quickly as if to dismiss her apology you know youre welcome here he said for as long as you want to stay all the time her mother sat stiffly twisting her hands in her lap shell be glad to see the back of me kirsten thought but shell never admit such a horrible thought to herself her mothers life kirsten realized was dominated by the need to keep all unpleasantness at a distance look good in the eyes of her neighbors and savagely maintain the borders of her closed and narrow world i thought id go up before term just to get my bearings again i think itd do me good to get out and about a bit sarah and i might do some walking in the dales the yorkshire dales her mother said yes why well dear im just not sure its a very suitable environment for a wellbroughtup girl such as yourself thats all its so verywell so very bleak and muddy i hear and so uncivilized im not sure you even have the proper clothes for such an excursion oh mother kirsten said dont be such a snob her mother sniffed i was only thinking of your comfort darling of course i dare say your friend is used to such aa rough life but not you mother sarahs family owns half of herefordshire shes not quite the bit of rough you seem to think she is her mother looked at her blankly i dont know what you mean kirsten breeding shows thats all im saying well im going anyway and thats that of course you must go her father said patting her knee your mothers only concerned about your health thats all make sure you take plenty of warm clothes and some sensible hiking boots and stick to the pathways kirsten laughed youre almost as bad she said anyone would think i was off to the north pole or somewhere its only a couple of hundred miles north you know not a couple of thousand all the same her father said the landscape can be quite treacherous in those parts and it does rain an awful lot just be careful thats all im asking of you dont worry i will when are you planning on going he asked well ill have to wait till i hear from sarah first and make sure she can put me up and get some time off but i thought id go as soon as i can and youll be coming back before term starts oh yes thats not until the beginning of october ill come back and pick up my books and stuff im hoping i can find a flat up there first too perhaps sarah and i can share do you think thats wise her mother asked itll be better than being on my own wont it her mother could offer no argument against that so her father said youre off on an adventure well good for you you must have known there were times when your mother and iwewe didnt know what the future was going to bring im all right daddy kirsten said really i am yes of course will you be seeing dr masterson at all while youre up there about theyou know kirsten nodded probably she said it wont do any harm to ask about it will it no i dont suppose it will im afraid i wont be able to give you a lift up there weve got a very important project on at the moment and i just cant take time off perhaps you could rent thats all right kirsten said i was planning on taking the train i have to learn to get around on my own well thats fine as long as you feel comfortable with the idea youll be needing some money wont you he said and went over to the top righthand drawer of the sideboard to fetch his checkbook susan sue got out of the house easily enough without anyone seeing her and went to celebrate her first housebreaking with veal scaloppine garlic bread and a bottle of chianti at the expensive restaurant on new quay road after that she stopped off at her room then walked about a mile along the coast and threw her holdall weighted down with heavy pebbles into the sea she stood and watched as the tide first threw it back then sucked it out again and swallowed it even if it did turn up somewhere she thought it wouldnt be of any interest to anyone now it was time to put the final stage of her plan into operation first let him sweat for a while and sweat he did the first time sue saw him on the day after she had broken into his cottage he looked harried and preoccupied as he walked in to work it was raining and he kept his hands deep in his pockets and his head down but his glittering eyes swept the street and the windows of the houses all around him he must have noticed her sitting in the front of roses café sue thought but his eyes just flicked over her as they did everything and everyone else he was nervous on edge as if he was expecting an ambush at any moment after he had gone by sue turned back to the local newspaper there was no change reported in keiths condition and the police seemed to have got nowhere in their search for jack grimleys killer so far so good it would soon be over now near lunchtime on the second day from the same vantage point sue saw him slip into the newsagents quickly she left her tea and crossed the street to go in after him he wouldnt recognize her this time she was dressed differently also she wore glasses and her hair was tied back in a ponytail he glanced around with a start at the bell when she entered her head lowered then turned his gaze back to the newsagent all right today love the woman asked you look a bit peaky not enough sleep thats all he mumbled well you take good care of yourself you never know what germs is going round these days im all right he said a little testily just tired thats all then he paid for his tobacco and left without even glancing at sue who bent over the newspaper and magazine section as before she picked up the local paper and the independent when she took them over to the counter to pay the woman clucked her tongue and said i dont know whats the matter with him show a bit of polite interest and he damn near bites your head off some people cant even be bothered to be civil these days maybe hes worried about something sue suggested the woman sighed aye she said weve all got plenty to worry about havent we what with nuclear war and pollution all over tplace but i still manage to find a smile and a good morning for my customers she went on almost to herself as she counted out sues change not like greg eastcote that isnt usually such a pleasant chap then she shrugged ah well maybe he is just tired i could do with a bit of a liedown myself im sure thats it said sue folding the newspapers under her arm and walking over to the door hes just tired aye no rest for the wicked is there love bye now as sue walked along the street eastcotes van passed her by and took the same route out of town as it had before another delivery whether he would be back later or would be staying out overnight she had no idea she could imagine though that he would be loath to leave his cottage empty for very long in fact if she were in his shoes she would make sure she was back before dark after all he didnt know that she had broken in during daylight she wondered what he had made of the extra lock of hair did he know it was hers surely he must suspect or perhaps he thought he was being haunted that the supernatural was responsible for the sudden appearance of a seventh lock like the seventh daughter of a seventh son was supposed to be powerful in magic one thing she did know he had seen her as one would notice any stranger in the street but he didnt know who she was maybe when he got over the shock he would start to think clearly again and count the times hed glimpsed her from the corner of his eye perhaps he would connect the girl in the navyblue raincoat with the girl in glasses and a ponytail but by then it would be too late sue walked by the river toward town the good weather seemed to have made a return it was a beautiful day with plenty of that intense blue sky you sometimes get at the seaside and just enough plump white clouds drifting over to give a sense of depth and perspective beyond the greenish shallows the sea reflected the skys bright ultramarine sue stood on the swing bridge and looked around at the harbor it was like another world to her now after so long spent in the other dingier part of town the tide was well out and some of the light boats rested almost on their sides with their masts at fortyfivedegree angles to the slick mud to sues left beyond the high harbor wall stood the buildings of st anns staith a mixture of architectural styles and materials red brick gables chimneys blackandwhite tudorstyle fronting even millstone grit further along toward the sheds where the fish were auctioned the jumble of buildings rose all the way up the hillside to the elegant white terrace of hotels that formed east terrace people walked by carefree and smiling a courting couple the man with his arm so low around the girl that it was practically in the back pocket of her tight jeans two elderly ladies overdressed in checked tweeds and laceup shoes one carrying a walking stick a pregnant woman glowing with health her husband walking proudly beside her all this normality sue thought all these ordinary people going about their business enjoying themselves eating icecream cones and bouncing garish beachballs in the street and they have no idea about the monster walking among them they have no idea that greg eastcote murdered six women and maimed one that he slashed at their sexual organs with a sharp bonehandled knife and just to make sure they were dead he strangled them when hed done that when hed finished his crude surgery he carefully cut off a single lock of hair from each bruised and bleeding body took it home with him tied it up in a pink ribbon and placed it neatly in his sideboard drawer six of them all in a row seven now according to the press clippings that sue had saved he hadnt raped any of his victims clearly he was incapable of that and the rage he felt toward women for causing his condition partly explained his actions but only partly there was an enormous chasm between his motives and his deeds that nobody could fathom in a vision the dark one had appeared to him in a perversion of the caedmon story and told him to sing his own song and so he had only his accompanying instrument wasnt a lute it was a knife and the tune it played was death sue wanted to jump up on the bridge rail and shout all this out to the complacent holidaymakers heading for the beach or the amusement arcades they would shove their coins into slots listen to the bingo caller or sit on the beach in the sun on striped deck chairs newspapers shielding their faces edging back every so often as the tide came in closer then late in the afternoon they would go to one of the many fish and chip restaurants and eat none of them knew about the man with the oily smell of fish on his fingersprobably the last thing his victims smelledthe ancient mariner eyes and the raspy voice she wanted to tell them all about greg eastcote and the atrocities he had committed against women all about the blood the pain the utter degradation and humiliation and the way she had been imperfectly sewn back together again all the kings horses and all the kings menthat man there the balding one with the crying toddler in his arms she wanted to assure him that she was here to restore the balance but she wasnt crazy she knew she couldnt say anything instead she just watched them passing back and forth over the bridge for a while wondering whether they were truly innocent or just indifferent then she went to find a quiet pub she soon found a place on baxtergate three boredlooking punks with greenandyellow hair sat in the lounge playing the jukebox but through a corridor by the side of the bar separated from the lounge by swing doors was a much quieter room all dark varnished panels hard chairs and benches sue realized that not only hadnt she looked at the papers yet she hadnt even eaten since her meager and greasy breakfast at mrs cummingss the tea was so bad at roses that she hadnt felt inclined to find out what the food was like all the pub served was cold snacks so she ordered a crab sandwich and a half of lager and lime when she had eaten she sat back with her drink and lit a cigarette turning to the local paper first to see if there was any news of keith a brief report told her that police were continuing their inquiries into the suspicious death of jack grimley and the brutal assault on a young australian tourist who was still in critical condition at st marys hospital scarborough apparently keith had not yet regained consciousness then under the heading have you seen this girl she suddenly noticed an artists impression of her she hadnt spotted it at first because it looked nothing like her perhaps there was a faint resemblance to martha browne but even that would be pushing it a bit the shape of the head was all wrong far too round and the eyes were too close together the lips too thick still it was enough to make her pulse race it meant they were on the right track and they were getting closer all the caption said was that police were anxious to talk to this girl who had been seen with the australian in hinderwell as she may have been the last person to see him before the attack sue folded the paper and turned to the crossword but she found herself too preoccupied to concentrate on the clues she knew that the police in general told little of what they knew to the papers if she read between the lines it seemed likely that they had also found the bus driver who had picked her up near staithes but all he could tell them was that she had got off at whitby bus station after that martha browne had disappeared forever could they also track her to the lodgings on abbey terrace certainly if they traced keiths movements as they would surely be doing then the odds were that they would check the register there get a better description of her from the owner or his wife and mount a fullscale search for martha browne why she wondered were they taking so long they must have found out where keith had been staying in staithes quickly enough from there it surely wouldnt have taken them long to work their way back to whitby unless there was no evidence among his belongings to say where hed beenno journal no brochures no postcards unsent what if they did know and every policeman in whitby was on the lookout for her already nervously she glanced over at a young couple by the bar but they were only interested in one another still she told herself she had no real cause to worry martha browne no longer existed she could have gone anywhere from whitby bus stationscarborough york leedsand why not on to london paris or rome surely nobody would expect her to hang around in the area after she had attacked keith mclaren even if they did know who they were after they wouldnt center their search in whitby she had told keith that she came from exeter but she couldnt remember what she had written if anything in the register at the guesthouse she wondered how long it would take the police to discover that martha browne had never existed in the first place and what would they do then of course she knew that all this was nothing but speculation even if they could link her to keith via abbey terrace the lucky fisherman and hinderwell they still couldnt prove that she had done anything wrong she could say that keith had wanted to lead her into the woods but she had refused and left him taking the bus back to whitby it probably wouldnt come to that but if it did she knew they couldnt prove anything if the worst came to the worst she could say he had tried to rape her and she had defended herself then got scared and run away the only real problem was that it would look very odd indeed if they found her and discovered that martha browne and sue bridehead were the same person and whats more that she was really kirsten the only surviving victim of the student slasher that would certainly look incriminating especially when they found his body but would it be enough to convict her of anything perhaps still she had known from the start that the whole business was fraught with risks though she hadnt expected it to turn into such a mess there was also a chance that the police might find out about the wig and clothes she had bought in scarborough but that was very unlikely she had purposely chosen large busy department stores and none of the shop assistants had paid her very much attention since she had been in they would have served hundreds of other customers then she remembered the scrawny woman with the large head the smoker she had startled in the ladies toilet she might remember but so what all she knew was that sue had gone to the toilet in a scarborough department store nothing unusual in that there had been another woman who had spoken to her too that day she remembered putting on makeup next to a woman who joked about her husband saying she always took so long to go to the toilet but none of it mattered she had spoken to lots of people during her time in whitby as anybody would no there was nothing to worry about besides she had divine protection at least until she had fulfilled her destiny her spirit guides would hardly allow her to fail after she had got so far nonetheless it was wise to be cautious get it done quickly and leave town there was no sense in jeopardizing the main reason for her visit just for the pleasure of toying with her prey a bit longer and watching greg eastcote grow more paranoid day by day she wasnt in this for cruelty for pleasure besides he would be growing more and more cautious best get it done tonight then if she could the student slasher seemed to have disappeared completely from the pages of the independent as sue had suspected he soon would and he wouldnt appear there alive again with luck when she had killed him the police would search his house and find the seven locks of hair they would check the dates and places of his overnight deliveries and they would find out who he was and what he had done also with luck they would probably assume that a victim had got the better of him this time and they wouldnt employ all their resources trying to find out exactly who she was after lunch sue returned to the factory area eastcote could be on a short local run and might come back at any time she watched from the woods lying on her stomach then at evening openingtime she went to the merry monk and took her usual table by the window by pulling back the curtain just a little when nobody was looking she could see straight down the convex slope of waste ground to eastcotes cottage she would wait for him to come home then she would somehow lure him away he hadnt struck in his own town before perhaps due to caution but this time he wouldnt be able to resist shortly after seven sue saw him arrive home the lights went on behind the pale blue curtains in the cottage uncertain how to draw him out she finished her drink and left the pub instead of returning to the lane walking downhill and turning right onto eastcotes street she walked straight across the waste ground from where she could easily be seen sunset was almost over now and the western sky glowed in even striations of deep violet scarlet and purple a jets trail snaked right across the western horizon losing shape quickly and one or two clouds blushed in the last light nettles and thistles stung sues legs as she brushed her way through the weeds but the pain felt distant unreal she could knock on his door or telephone perhaps but she hadnt seen a phone when she had been inside his house knocking on the door was too risky he might react quickly and drag her inside instead she just walked slowly down to the street and paused when she got to the end of the low garden wall the curtains were still drawn she thought she could see a shadow move behind them she stood for a few moments certain that they were looking at one another with only the thin blue curtains between them then moved on taking the dirt path across the scrub land that led down to the main road as she walked she felt a strange drifting sensation as if she were floating an inch or two above the grass sue stopped and just stood there about a hundred yards from his house it was uncanny the certainty she felt that he had been aware of her standing outside his cottage and that he would open his door and look and he did she stood there in the middle of a piece of waste land nettles weeds and thistles all around silhouetted by the sunset he walked to the end of his garden path turned his head in her direction and slowly opened the gate kirsten kirsten stared out of the window at the landscape beyond her reflection the rounded green hills of the cotswolds soon gave way to the fertile vale of evesham where barley and wheat looked ready for harvest in the fields and apples pears and plums hung heavy on their trees in the hillside orchards then came the builtup landscape of the midlands cooling towers the sprawling monotony of council estates allotments greenhouses a redbrick school a football field with white goalposts when the train crept into birmingham and she could feel the huge city pressing in on all sides she began to feel nervous this was after all her longest journey in ages and she was making it alone for over a year she had been living in a soft comfortable familiar world shuttling between the georgian elegance of bath and the bucolic indifference of brierley coombe now it was gray and raining and she was in birmingham a big rough city with slums skinheads race riots and all the rest luckily she didnt have to get off the train there she hoped sarah would be at the station to meet her when she arrived at her destination after a twentyminute stop the train pulled out and lumbered past twisting concrete overpasses into another builtup area the derelict warehouses with rusty zigzag fire escapes and the messy factory yards stacked high with crates and pallets that always seemed to back onto train tracks in cities it ran alongside a busy commuter road a dirty brown canal and a dark brick embankment wall scrawled with graffiti next came a few green fields with grazing cows and then the train settled into a steady lulling clicketyclick through derbyshire into south yorkshire with its slag heaps and idle pit wheels a landscape in which all the green seemed to have been smudged by an inky finger that was now running in the rain kirsten closed her eyes and let the rhythm carry her she would stay with sarah a day or two perhaps until she felt it was time to go despite what she had told her parents she had not suggested that sarah take time off work kirsten would say she was going to the dales walking for a few days alone if that sounded oddafter all she had spent the last year in the countryside much of the time alonethen it was too bad but sarah would take her word it was surprising how eager people were to believe her about anything after what had happened to her the rain had stopped when sarah met her at the station later that evening they allowed themselves the luxury of a taxi to take them back to the bedsit all the way sarah chatted about how glad she was that kirsten had decided to come back and how they would look for a flat together as soon as kirsten had got her bearings again kirsten listened and made the right responses glancing left and right out of the window like a nervous bird as familiar sights unfolded around her the tall white university tower the terraces of sooty redbrick student housing the park washed and glistening after the rain it all took her breath away with its combination of familiarity and strangeness for fifteen months it had been simply a landscape of the mind a closedoff world in which certain things had happened and been filed away now that she was actually riding through it again in a taxi she felt as if she had somehow drawn her surroundings from deep inside herself from her imagination she was no longer in the real world at all she was in a painting an imagined landscape it was getting dark outside when they arrived at the flat kirsten followed sarah up the stairs remembering with her body rather than in her mind how often she had made this journey before her feet remembered in their cells the cracked linoleum they trod and her fingertip seemed to hold within it the memory of the light switch she pressed when she entered her room itself she had that sensation however mistaken of being at a journeys end it was something she had felt so often before arriving home after lectures or tiring exams she remembered the occasional day spent ill in bed with a cold or a sore throat when she would read and watch the shadows of the houses opposite slowly crawl up the far wall and over the ceiling until the room grew so dark that she had to put the reading lamp on she dropped her holdall in the corner and looked around some of her belongings were still in their original places a few books and cassettes in the main room and mugs and jars in the little kitchen alcove all sarah had done was clear space for her own things there was no problem with clothes of course as kirsten had emptied the cupboard of most of hers but sarah had filled one cardboard box with some of kirstens books and papers to make room for her own on the shelves and the desk well sarah said watching her not changed much has it no it hasnt im surprised does it upset you being back here again no said kirsten i dont think so im not sure its just a very odd feeling hard to explain well dont worry about it just sit down for now do you want some tea or theres wine i got a bottle of plonk thought you might like that better than going out on the first night yes thats great i dont much fancy going out im a bit tired and shaky but some wine would be nice sarah took the bottle from the small refrigerator and held it up it was a pale gold color aussie stuff she said a chardonnay supposed to be good she picked up two glasses from the dish rack and searched for the corkscrew in the kitchen drawer finally everything in hand she filled their glasses and brought them through cheese ive got a wedge of brie and some wensleydale yes please sarah brought in the cheese with a selection of biscuits on a tetleys tray liberated from the ring obells they toasted the future and drank kirsten helped herself to some food then picked up a book she noticed lying on the floor by the armchair it was a thick biography of thomas hardy is this what youre reading right now she asked sarah nodded im thinking about doing my phd in victorian fiction and you know how i love biographies it seemed a pleasurable enough way of getting back into academic gear and is it i mean hardys hardly a light cheerful read is he sarah laughed i dont know about a pessimist but he was certainly a bloody pervert how asked kirsten ive only read far from the madding crowd for that novel course in first year i dont even remember much about that except some soldier showing off his fancy swordplay i suppose that was meant to be phallic sarah laughed yes but thats not what i meant all writers do that kind of symbolism thing to some extent dont they what do you mean well for one thing sarah went on do you know he used to like attending public executions when he was in his teens especially when women were being hanged she reached for the book and turned the pages slowly as she talked there was one in dorchester and he told someone about it when he was much olderah here it is martha browne was the womans name and she was hanged for murdering her husband she caught him with another woman and they got into a fight he attacked her with a whip and she stabbed him hanging her was the victorians idea of justice anyway hardy went along and wrote about it she pushed the book under kirstens nose just look at that kirsten read what a fine figure she showed against the sky as she hung in the misty rain and how the tight black silk gown set off her shape as she wheeled half round and back i mean really sarah went on the poor woman was swinging at the end of a bloody rope and hardy makes out as if she was entering some kind of wet tshirt contest would you credit it kirsten read over the description it was certainly tinged with eroticism am i right sarah asked pouring more wine dont you get the feeling that hardy got some kind of kinky sexual pleasure from watching the woman get snuffed she put a hand to her mouth quickly oh im sorry love ii put my foot in it must be the wine going to my head i mean i wasnt thinking i didnt mean toyou know kirsten waved her hand its all right id rather you say what you like than walk around handling me with kid gloves i can take it and anyway youre right it is sexual yes and whats more did you notice how he turns her into some sort of convenient image for a poem as if her life was only important because he got a charge from watching her get hanged she wasnt even a person an individual to him i wonder what she was like kirsten said abstractedly well never know will we i suppose not but its not as odd as all that is it the way hardy uses her i mean we all tend to see other people as bit players in our own dramas dont we i mean were all selfcentered i dont think so not to that extent maybe not but you might be surprised she held her glass out and sarah emptied the bottle kirsten was beginning to feel a little tipsy after the journey and the disorienting effect of coming back to her old room the wine was affecting her more than it usually would still it wasnt an unpleasant sensation she helped herself to another chunk of wensleydale sarah shook the wine bottle grinned and jumped up ruffling kirstens short hair as she passed by fear not she said i suspected we might need more than the usual amount of alcoholic sustenance how about some music all right kirsten shrugged fine sarah turned on the cassette player and disappeared behind the curtain into the kitchen she must have been playing the tape earlier because one song was just fading out and then simple twist of fate began to play it was the second track on bob dylans blood on the tracks kirsten remembered and it used to be one of her favorites now as she listened to dylans hoarse plaintive voice while sarah was busy opening the second bottle she realized that the strange lyrics didnt mean what she used to think they did nothing did anymore sarah returned with a larger bottle lifting it up with a flourish dada more your cheaper kind of plonk really but im sure at this stage itll do kirsten smiled oh itll do fine what did you mean sarah asked when she had filled the glasses and sat down when you said id be surprised what would i be surprised by kirsten frowned i was thinking of the man who attacked me she said i wasnt a person an individual to him was i i was just a convenient symbol of what he hated or feared would it have made any difference i dont know would it have made any difference if it had been someone i knew i can think of one way it would have id know who it was and id bloody well kill him kirsten lifted her glass of wine too quickly and spilled some down the front of her shirt she patted herself on the chest doesnt matter she said itll dry an eye for an eye something like that sarah shook her head slowly im not crazy you know kirsten went on i mean it oh thereve been timessometimes i think its some sort of contagious disease he gave me like aids only in the mind or like vampirism can you imagine all those rippedup women coming back from the grave to prey on men of course i didnt die but maybe a part of me did maybe i have a little bit of the undead in me thats cuckoo talk kirstie or drunk talk youre not going to convince me youre turning into some sort of vampire version of joan of arc kirsten looked hard at her and felt the focus blurring my god she thought im losing it i almost told her she laughed and reached for a cigarette youre right she said im not its all academic anyway isnt it thank god for that sarah said the music stopped and she got up and turned over the tape as the two of them chatted kirsten glanced out now and then at the windows of the bedsits and flats over the street just as she had in years past at some point she noticed shelter from the storm another of her favorites was playing and her eyes burned with tears she held them back around midnight kirsten began to yawn in the middle of one of sarahs stories about a retired brigadiergeneral who had strayed into harridan by mistake boring you am i sarah asked no im just tired thats all it must be the wine and the travel how about sleeping arrangements sarah yawned too look now youve got me at it how about i take the chair and you have the bed oh no i couldnt do that it is your room after all ive just been caretaking it was my room no ill put a couple of cushions on the floor and sleep there but thats stupid youll be so uncomfortable hell its a threequarter bed lets share it kirsten said nothing for a moment the suggestion made her feel nervous and shy she knew that sarah wasnt offering any kind of sexual invitation but the thought of her own patchedup body next to sarahs smooth whole skin made her cheeks burn i havent brought a nightie she said not to worry ive got a spare pair of pajamas okay all right kirsten was too tired to argue and the idea of sleeping in what had once been her own bed was inviting when she stood up she felt herself sway a little she really had drunk too much they prepared themselves for bed and drew the curtains kirsten watched sarah pull her tshirt over her head and struggle with her tight jeans then stand there naked and unselfconsciously brush her blond hair in front of the mirror her breasts bounced lightly with the motion of her arm and below her flat stomach the spungold hair between her legs caught the light kirsten undressed last in the dark so that sarah couldnt see her scars and when she slipped between the crisp sheets she found herself staying as close to the edge of the bed as possible to avoid any unconscious contact but she neednt have worried sarah lay with her face turned to the wall below the window and soon her breathing settled into a slow regular pattern kirsten listened for a while feeling slightly dizzy and nauseated and cursing herself for almost telling sarah everything she knew not to mention what she intended to do about it eventually she drifted off to sleep and dreamed of martha browne that unknown woman in black swinging back and forth at the end of a rope in the misty dorchester rain over a hundred years ago the next day sarah went into the bookshop and kirsten spent the morning revisiting her old campus haunts the coffee lounge where she had met friends between lectures the library where she had worked so hard for the final exams she even wandered into an empty lecture theater and imagined professor simpkins droning on about milton s areopagitica though she had avoided it on her way over taking the roads instead kirsten walked back through the park as her feet followed the familiar tarmac path through the trees she felt nothing at all but when she reached the lion its head still spraypainted blue and the red graffiti still scrawled all over its body her hands started shaking unable to stop herself she walked over to the sculpture it was a little after twelve children played on the swings and seesaw nearby the clack of bowls came from the green behind the low hedge and one or two people sprawled out on the grass listening to portable cassettes or reading but kirsten still felt extreme unease as if she had somehow stumbled on a taboo place an evil spot shunned by natives she couldnt help herself when she sat astride the lion drawing amused glances from two students playing cards on the grass nearby it all happened so quickly the fishy smell began to suffocate her and the world darkened at the corners of her vision then she saw him and heard his raspy voice and saw the blade flash in the moonlight she leaped off and hurried on her way trembling as she walked on down the avenue of trees she cursed herself for giving in to fear she would need all the courage and strength she could get for what she had to do and jumping at shadows was a poor start still she told herself somehow shadows were more frightening to her now than substance that must be a good sign it was time to go first she went back to the flat and left a note for sarah then she went into town after shopping for one or two essentials she needed for her trip she headed for the bus station about three hours later martha browne arrived in whitby on a clear afternoon in early september convinced of her destiny susan like some shadowy female figure out of hardy standing on a blasted heath waiting for her lover sue stood on the waste land in the thickening darkness and watched greg eastcote shut his garden gate and take the path toward her before he had got far while sue was still about sixty yards ahead she turned her back to him and started walking along the rough path when she got to the main road there were few people about but the street was well lit sensing him behind her rather than seeing him sue continued along until she had passed the intersection with bridge street where the road narrowed this was the tourist area again the cobbled street of gift shops the monks haven the black horse at this time of evening though all the shops were closed polished jet gleamed in its goldandsilver settings in the windows and the enamel trays that had been covered with coffee or mintflavored fudge all day lay empty all the happy holiday families were back at the guesthouses watching television or they had managed to put the kids to bed and gone out to the pub for a quiet pint alone only lovers and vampires walked the streets hands in the pockets of her windbreaker sue walked on purposefully she had known where she was heading all along she realized but she had known it in her instinct and her muscles not in her conscious mind he was still behind her moving more cautiously now not hurrying to catch up with her perhaps he was getting worried when she got to the steps she turned and started climbing counting by habit as she went it was dark and deserted up the hill with no streetlights to light her way but st marys was floodlit like a beacon and high above the church a waning threequarter moon shone in the clear sky surrounded by stars at the top of the hundred and ninetyninth step where caedmons cross stood silhouetted against the bright sandcolored church sue turned through the graveyard of nameless stones she could tell he was following her that he would soon appear at the top and look around to see which way she had gone she slowed down she didnt want to disappoint him in the light of st marys she followed the path through the graves around the seaward side of the church and across the deserted car park where the world turned dark again she found the coast path and stopped for a moment by the gate yes he was there just coming out of the cemetery and looking in her direction she turned back to the path and hurried on she was high on the cliff now the sheer part known as the scar walking in the general direction of robin hoods bay the raised boardwalk underfoot creaked in places and she had to slow down in case of missing boards a barbedwire fence came between the path and the drop but it had collapsed here and there where erosion had eaten the rock away now that she was further away from the churchs interfering floodlights the moonlight shone more clearly dusting the grass on one side and the sea on the other with its ghostly silver light sue thought she might lead him as far as saltwick nab and down the steps out toward the knuckled rocks that pointed to the sea but he was getting closer she could hear his footsteps on the boardwalk and when she half turned her head she could see him outlined faintly by the moonlight he was walking faster she would never make it that far before he caught up with her and she didnt intend him to attack her from behind as she walked she reached her hand into her shoulder bag and felt for the paperweight there it was smooth and heavy against her sweating palm he was almost so close now that she could hear his labored breathing the climb up the steps must have tired him when she could bear it no longer sue stopped abruptly and turned to face him in the moonlight she could just about make out his features the low dark brow wide grimset mouth and the eyes glittering like stars reflected on the waters surface he had stopped too only about five yards lay between them and at first nobody said a word neither of them even seemed to be breathing sue found that she was shaking suddenly she remembered with perfect clarity all the pain she had suffered the last time she had seen this ghostly face in the moonlight finally she found the courage to speak do you remember me you he said in that familiar raspy whisper you were in my house yes she said gaining strength as they talked feeling the hardness of the solid glass in her hand why what are you trying to do to me sue didnt answer now that she had found him she had said all she wanted to why he repeated she noticed that he was moving toward her very slowly closing the gap as he talked you know what you are she said bringing her hand out of the shoulder bag then she took a sudden step toward him and shouted come on then here i am come on do it finish me she could see the confusion and horror on his face as she continued moving toward him come on whats wrong with you do it but he kept on backing away as sue edged closer paperweight out in her hand now he stretched out his arms before him as if to ward her off and immediately she knew she knew that he needed surprise to succeed he was a coward and what must she look like she wondered coming toward him with a fist of thick glass held out and all the rage of a ruined life in her face and voice it didnt bear thinking about the miserable bastard was terrified and his fear unnerved her for a moment he must have sensed her confusion like an animal scents its prey for he began to smile as he slowed his retreat in a moment he would start walking toward her again but he had already gone too far on his next slow step backward one of the rotten boards shifted under him and he wobbled at the edge he waved his arms like a semaphorist a look of terror on his face and sue almost reached forward to help him almost but he regained his balance and again she saw that other face the one his human mask barely hid she took a pace forward and kicked out hard at him her foot connected with his groin and he tottered back toward the edge of the cliff with a scream the fence was low there only about a foot or so off the ground and the post stood at an odd angle crooked pointing out to sea as he fell backward his clothing snagged on the rusted barbed wire and he managed to turn himself around he was half over the edge but his hands clawed at the thick tufts of grass the more he struggled the more the wire seemed to wrap him up and when she moved closer sue could see blood seeping through his clothes he grunted and snatched at the sods as he tried to stop himself from slowly sliding over sue knelt down and smashed at his hands with the paperweight the fence post twitched like a dowsing rod as he howled and struggled snatching at the barbed wire now anything to get a grip his hands coming away crushed ripped and bloody only his head and shoulders showed above the edge now the wire had torn one sleeve right off his jacket and its barbs stuck in the skin beneath the post was almost out of the ground pointing out to sea and the more he struggled the more he slipped at last he managed to find a foothold in the cliff face just below the edge but his hands were so badly damaged that all he could do was push himself up with his feet and flail his arms about the barbed wire tied him to the edge but his feet pushed him away sue stood up raised the paperweight and hit him on the side of his head the jolt ran all the way up her arm blood filled his eye she hit out again this time catching him over the ear he screamed and put one hand to the wound the post broke free of its shallow pit and shot over the cliff side taking him with it sue knelt right at the edge and saw him twist around in the wire like an animal in a trap before he tore free and plunged far below the sea lapped and spumed around the rocks at the base of the cliff and the body arms and legs whirling hit them with a thud louder than the breaking waves themselves sue could see him down there slumped and broken over the sharp dark rocks where the foaming waves licked at him like the tongues of madmen it was done sue looked back toward the distant church and thought of the normal daytoday world that lay below it in the town what would she do now that it was over should she follow him it would be so easy just to relax and let herself slide over the edge to oblivion but no suicide wasnt part of her destiny her own death had been her stake what she had risked but it was not part of the bargain if she won she had to accept her fate whatever it might be live with the guilt if such she felt or pay for her crimes if she was caught but there was no giving in to suicide she was free of her burden now come what may she had no idea if the police were close to discovering her identity perhaps they were already waiting back at mrs cummingss to arrest her and then there was keith mclaren still in a coma what if he woke up and remembered everything on the other hand he might have brain damage or amnesia if so was it possible that he would spend his days trying to piece together the fragments of his memory by himself and if he succeeded would he hunt down the woman who had so suddenly and without provocation wrecked his life she didnt know she might have created another like herself someone with a bit of the undead in him but no matter how bleak some of the possibilities seemed she felt free at last more than that she was kirsten again even imprisonment would be a kind of freedom now it didnt really matter what happened because she had done what had to be done now she was free certainly her best bet would be to get out of town and back to sarah first thing in the morning and destroy anything that might link her to the place thats what she would do perhaps she could also tint her hair and make sure she looked like none of the girls who had been in whitby all kirsten really wanted to do at the moment she realized looking toward the church was crawl into one of those box pews marked for strangers only kneel and offer a prayer of sorts then curl up on the green baize and sleep but the place would be locked up for the night as she got to her feet the paperweight slipped out of her sweaty palm bounced on the springy grass and fell over the edge she leaned forward to watch and saw the glass shatter against a rock in a shower of white powder like a wave breaking free of its cage the rose seemed to drift up on a current of warm air its crimson petals opened pale in the moonlight then slowly it floated back down and a departing wave carried it out to sea afterword th september coast road whitbystaithes rolling farmland patchwork of hedged fields cows grazing light

hollows cluster of village houses light stone red pantile roofsarrived at the small coastal town at am in early september her mind made up such were the humble origins of the first cut i discover looking back over my notebook for august to march i wrote the book in the late eighties then after my first four inspector banks novels i remember i needed a change a novel in which the police played a subsidiary role ever since reading about the yorkshire ripper id had an idea for a story about someone who had survived a serial killers attack setting out for revenge the idea lay fallow as these things often do until one september day in when we crested the hill into whitby shortly before the abovedescribed trip to staithes when the original opening revealed itself there lay whitby spread out below the colors seemed somehow brighter and more vibrant than i remembered the greens and blues of the north sea the red pantile roofs then there was the dramatic setting of the lobsterclaw harbor and the two opposing hills one capped with a church and a ruined abbey the other with captain cooks statue and the massive jawbone of a whale i knew immediately that this was where the story had to take place and that it began with a woman getting off a bus feeling a little travelsick trying the place on for size when i found out that the novel was getting another life i toyed with the idea of rewriting it and updating it after all isnt it every writers dream to get another chance years later at improving something one wrote in ones early days but the more i thought about it the more i realized that it just wouldnt work that the world has changed so much since and that the events in the first cut couldnt happen in a world with mobile phones email a mcdonalds or pizza hut on every corner and the current techniques of dna testing genetic fingerprinting existed back then as joseph wambaughs the blooding demonstrates very well but it was still in its infancy besides i was supposed to be leaving the police behind given the advances in forensic science since it seemed that if i were to update the book for it would be almost impossible to keep them in the background whitby has changed too especially the footpath along the top of the cliffs which plays such an important role in the book in the end i settled for correcting a few minor points changing a characters name getting rid of an obtrusive comment about margaret thatcher that sort of thing in all other respects its the original novel now a period piece of sorts a slice of latetwentiethcentury history set in a time when you could smoke anywhere get bed and breakfast for a night and crocodile dundee was all the rage about the author peter robinson grew up in yorkshire england his previous inspector banks novels
