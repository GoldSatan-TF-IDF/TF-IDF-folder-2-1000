john connolly the black angel the fifth book in the charlie parker series for sue fletcher with gratitude and affection i no one can know the origin of evil who has not grasped the truth about the socalled devil and his angels origen prologue the rebel angels fell garlanded with fire and as they descended tumbling through the void they were cursed as the newly blind are cursed for just as the darkness is more terrible for those who have known the light so the absence of grace is felt more acutely by those who once dwelt in its warmth the angels screamed in their torment and their burning brought brightness to the shadows for the first time the lowest of them cowered in the depths and there they created their own world in which to dwell as the last angel fell he looked to heaven and saw all that was to be denied him for eternity and the vision was so terrible to him that it burned itself upon his eyes and so as the skies closed above him it was given to him to witness the face of god disappear among gray clouds and the beauty and sorrow of the image was imprinted forever in his memory and upon his sight he was cursed to walk forever as an outcast shunned even by his own kind for what could be more agonizing for them than to see each time they looked in his eyes the ghost of god flickering in the blackness of his pupils and so alone was he that he tore himself in two that he might have company in his long exile and together these twin parts of the same being wandered the stillforming earth in time they were joined by a handful of the fallen who were weary of cowering in that bleak kingdom of their own creation after all what is hell but the eternal absence of god to exist in a hellish state is to be denied forever the promise of hope of redemption of love to those who have been forsaken hell has no geography but these angels at last grew weary of roaming throughout the desolate world without an outlet for their rage and their despair they found a deep dark place in which to sleep and there they secreted themselves away and waited and after many years mines were dug and tunnels lit and the deepest and greatest of these excavations was among the bohemian silver mines at kutna hora and it was called kank and it was said that when the mine reached its final depth the lights carried by the miners flickered as though troubled by a breeze where no breeze could exist and a great sighing was heard as of souls released from their bondage a stench of burning arose and tunnels collapsed trapping and killing those beneath a storm of filth and dirt emerged sweeping through the mine choking and blinding all in its path those who survived spoke of voices in the abyss and the beating of wings in the midst of the clouds the storm ascended toward the main shaft bursting forth into the night sky and the men who saw it glimpsed a redness at its heart as though it were all aflame and the rebel angels took upon themselves the appearance of men and set about creating a kingdom that they might rule through stealth and the corrupted will of others they were led by the twin demons the greatest of their number the black angels the first called ashmael immersed himself in the fires of battle and whispered empty promises of glory into the ears of ambitious rulers the other called immael waged his own war upon the church and its leaders the representatives upon the earth of the one who had banished his brother he gloried in fire and rape and his shadow fell upon the sacking of monasteries and the burning of chapels each half of this twin being bore the mark of god as a white mote in his eye ashmael in his right eye and immael in his left but in his arrogance and wrath immael allowed himself to be glimpsed for a moment in his true blighted form he was confronted by a cistercian monk named erdric from the monastery at sedlec and they fought above vats of molten silver in a great foundry at last immael was cast down caught in the moment of transformation from human to other and he fell into the hot ore erdric called for the metal to be slowly cooled and immael was trapped in silver powerless to free himself from this purest of prisons and ashmael felt his pain and sought to free him but the monks hid immael well and kept him from those who would release him from his bonds yet ashmael never stopped seeking his brother and in time he was joined in his search by those who shared his nature and by men corrupted by his promises they marked themselves so that they might be known to one another and their mark was a grapnel a forked hook for in the old lore this was the first weapon of the fallen angels and they called themselves believers chapter one the woman stepped carefully from the greyhound bus her right hand holding firmly on to the bar as she eased herself down a relieved sigh escaped from her lips once both feet were on level ground the relief that she always felt when a simple task was negotiated without incident she was not oldshe was barely into her fiftiesbut she looked and felt much older she had endured a great deal and accumulated sorrows had intensified the predations of the years her hair was silvergray and she had long since ceased making the monthly trek to the salon to have its color altered there were horizontal lines stretching from the corner of each eye like healed wounds paralleled by similar lines on her forehead she knew how she had come by them for occasionally she caught herself wincing as if in pain while she looked in the mirror or saw herself reflected in the window of a store and the depth of those lines increased with the transformation in her expression it was always the same thoughts the same memories that caused the change and always the same faces that she recalled the boy now a man her daughter as she once was and as she now might be and the one who had made her little girl upon her his face sometimes contorted as it was at the moment of her daughters conception and at other times tattered and destroyed as it was before they closed the coffin lid upon him erasing at last his physical presence from the world nothing she had come to realize will age a woman faster than a troubled child in recent years she had become prone to the kind of accidents that bedeviled the lives of women two or three decades older than she and took longer to recover from them than once she had it was the little things that she had to look out for unanticipated curbs neglected cracks in the sidewalk the unexpected jolting of a bus as she rose from her seat the forgotten water spilled upon the kitchen floor she feared these things more than she feared the young men who congregated in the parking lot of the strip mall near her home watching for the vulnerable for those whom they considered easy prey she knew that she would never be one of their victims as they were more afraid of her than they were of the police or of their more vicious peers for they knew of the man who waited in the shadows of her life a small part of her hated the fact that they feared her even as she enjoyed the protection that it brought her protection was hard bought purchased she believed with the loss of a soul she prayed for him sometimes while the others wailed hallelujah to the preacher beating their breasts and shaking their heads she remained silent her chin to her chest and pleaded softly in the past a long time ago she would ask the lord that her nephew might turn again to his radiant light and embrace the salvation that lay only in relinquishing violent ways now she no longer wished for miracles instead as she thought about him she begged god that when this lost sheep at last stood before him for the final judgment he would be merciful and forgive him his trespasses that he would look closely at the life he had lived and find within it those little acts of decency that might enable him to offer succor to this sinner but perhaps there were some lives that could never be redeemed and some sins so terrible that they were beyond forgiveness the preacher said that the lord forgives all but only if the sinner truly acknowledges his fault and seeks another path if this was true then she feared that her prayers would count for nothing and he was damned to eternity she showed her ticket to the man unloading the baggage from the bus he was gruff and unfriendly to her but he appeared to be that way to everyone young men and women hovered watchfully at the periphery of the light from the buss windows like wild animals fearful of the fire yet hungry for those who lay within the circle of its warmth her handbag gripped to her chest she took her case by its handle and wheeled it toward the escalator she watched those around her heedful of the warnings of her neighbors back home dont accept no offers of help dont be talking to nobody seems like he just offerin to assist a lady with her bag dont matter how well he dressed or how sweetly he sings but there were no offers of help and she ascended without incident to the busy streets of this alien city as foreign to her as cairo or rome might have been dirty and crowded and unforgiving she had scribbled an address on a piece of paper along with the directions she had painstakingly transcribed over the phone from the man at the hotel hearing the impatience in his voice as he was forced to repeat the address the name of the hotel near incomprehensible to her when spoken in his thick immigrant accent she walked the streets pulling her bag behind her she carefully noted the numbers at the intersections trying to take as few turns as possible until she came to the big police building there she waited for another hour until at last a policeman came to talk to her he had a thin file in front of him but she could add nothing to what she had told him over the phone and he could tell her only that they were doing what they could still she filled out more papers in the hope that some small detail she provided might lead them to her daughter then left and hailed a cab on the street she passed the piece of paper with the address of her hotel through a small hole in the plexiglas screen she asked the driver how much it would cost to go there and he shrugged he was an asian man and he did not look pleased to see the scribbled destination traffic who knows he waved a hand at the slowmoving streams of cars and trucks and buses horns honked loudly and drivers shouted angrily at one another all was impatience and frustration overshadowed by buildings that were too high out of scale with those who were expected to live and work inside and outside them she could not understand how anyone would choose to remain in such a place twenty maybe said the cabdriver she hoped it would be less than twenty twenty dollars was a lot and she did not know how long she would have to stay here she had booked the hotel room for three days and had sufficient funds to cover another three days after that as long as she ate cheaply and could master the intricacies of the subway she had read about it but had never seen it in reality and had no concept of its operations she knew only that she did not like the thought of descending beneath the earth into the darkness but she could not afford to take cabs all the time buses might be better at least they stayed above ground slowly though they seemed to move in this city he might offer her money of course once she found him but she would refuse any such offer just as she had always refused it carefully returning the checks that he sent to the only contact address that she had for him his money was tainted just as he was tainted but she needed his help now not his money but his knowledge something terrible had happened to her daughter of that she was certain even if she could not explain how she knew alice oh alice why did you have to come to this place her own mother had been blessed or cursed with the gift she knew when someone was suffering and could sense when harm had come to anyone who was dear to her the dead talked to her they told her things her life was filled with whispers the gift had not been passed on and for that the woman was grateful but she wondered sometimes if a faint trace of it had not found its way into her a mere spark of the great power that had dwelt in her mother or perhaps all mothers were cursed with the ability to sense their childrens deepest sufferings even when they were far far from them all that she could say for sure was that she had not known a moments peace in recent days and that she heard her daughters voice calling to her when sleep fleetingly came she would tell that to him when she met him in the hope that he would understand even if he did not she knew that he would help for the girl was blood to him and if there is one thing that he understood it was blood i parked in an alleyway about fifty feet from the house then covered the rest of the distance on foot i could see jackie garner hunched behind the wall bordering the property he wore a black wool hat a black jacket and black jeans his hands were uncovered and his breath formed phantoms in the air beneath his jacket i made out the word sylvia written on his tshirt new girlfriend i said jackie pulled open his jacket so i could see the tshirt more clearly it read tim the maineiac sylvia a reference to one of our localboysmadegood and featured a poor caricature of the great man himself in september tim sylvia all sixeight and pounds of him became the first mainer to compete in the ultimate fighting championship eventually going on to take the heavyweight championship title in las vegas in knocking down the undefeated champion ricco rodriguez with a right cross in the first round i hit him hahd sylvia told a postmatch interviewer making every downeaster with flattened vowel sounds feel instantly proud unfortunately sylvia tested positive for anabolic steroids after his first defense against the sixeleven gan the giant mcgee and voluntarily surrendered his belt and title i remembered jackie telling me once that hed attended the fight some of mcgees blood had landed on his jeans and he now saved them for special wear nice i said i got a friend who makes them i can let you have some cheap i wouldnt take them any other way in fact i wouldnt take them at all jackie was offended for a guy who might have passed for tim sylvias outofcondition older brother he was pretty sensitive how many are there in the house i asked but his attention had already wandered onto another subject hey were dressed the same he said what were dressed the same look you got the hat the same jacket the jeans except you got gloves and i got this tshirt we could be twins jackie garner was a good guy but i thought that he might be a little crazy someone once told me that a shell accidentally went off close to him when he was serving with the us army in berlin just before the wall came down he was unconscious for a week and for six months after he awoke he couldnt remember anything that happened later than even though he was mostly recovered there were still gaps in his memory and he occasionally confused the guys at bull moose music by asking for new cds that were actually fifteen years old the army pensioned him off and since then he had become a body for hire he knew about guns and surveillance and he was strong id seen him put down three guys in a bar fight but that shell had definitely rattled something loose inside jackie garners head sometimes he was almost childlike like now jackie this isnt a dance it doesnt matter that were dressed the same he shrugged and looked away i could tell he was hurt again i just thought it was funny thats all he said all feigned indifference yeah next time ill call you first ask you to help me pick out my wardrobe come on jackie its freezing lets get this over with its your call he said and it was i didnt usually take on bail skips the smarter ones tended to head out of state making for canada or points south like most pis i had contacts at the banks and the phone companies but i still didnt much care for the idea of tracking some lowlife over half the country in return for a percentage of his bond waiting for him to give himself away by accessing an automated teller or using his credit card to check into a motel this one was different his name was david torrans and he had tried to steal my car to make his getaway from an attempted robbery at a gas station on congress my mustang was parked in the lot beside the station and torrans had wrecked the ignition in a doomed effort to get it started after someone boxed in his own chevy the cops caught him two blocks away as he made his getaway on foot torrans had a string of minor convictions but with the help of a quickmouthed lawyer and a drowsy judge he made bail although the judge to his small credit did set bail at twenty thousand dollars to ensure torrans made it to trial and ordered him to report daily to police headquarters in portland a bondsman named lester peets provided the coverage for the bond then torrans skipped out on him the reason for the skip was that a woman who had taken a knock on the head from torrans during the attempted robbery had subsequently lapsed into a coma in some kind of delayed reaction to the blow she had received and now torrans was facing some heavy felony charges and maybe even life in jail if the woman died peets was about to go in the hole for the twenty if torrans didnt show as well as sullying his good name and seriously irritating local law enforcement i took on the torrans skip because i was aware of something about him that nobody else seemed to know he was seeing a woman named olivia morales who worked as a waitress in a mexican restaurant in town and had a jealous exhusband with a fuse so short he made old nitrol look stable i had spotted her with torrans after she finished her shift two or three days before the robbery went down torrans was a face in the way that such men sometimes were in small cities like portland he had a reputation for violence but until the robbery bust he had never actually been charged with a serious crime more through good fortune than any great intelligence on his part he was the kind of guy to whom other lowlifes deferred on the grounds that he had smarts but i had never subscribed to the theory of comparative intelligence where petty criminals were concerned so the fact that torranss peers considered him a sharp operator didnt impress me much most criminals are kind of dumb which is why theyre criminals if they werent criminals theyd be doing something else to screw up peoples lives like running elections in florida the fact that torrans had tried to hold up a gas station armed with only a pool ball in a sock indicated that he wasnt about to step up to the majors just yet id heard rumors that hed developed a taste for smack and oxycontin in recent months and nothing will scramble a mans intelligence faster than the old hillbilly heroin i figured that torrans would get in touch with his girlfriend when he found himself in trouble men on the run tend to turn to the women who love them whether mothers wives or girlfriends if they have money theyll then try to put some ground between themselves and those who are looking for them unfortunately the kind of people who went to lester peets for their bond tended to be pretty desperate and torrans had probably used all of his available funds just rustling up his share of the money for the moment torrans would be forced to stick close to home keeping a low profile until another option presented itself olivia morales seemed like the best bet jackie garner had good local knowledge and i brought him in to stay close to olivia morales while i was taking care of other business he watched her buying her food for the week and noticed her including a carton of luckys in her buy even though she didnt appear to smoke he followed her home to her rented house in deering and saw two men arrive a little later in a red dodge van when he described them to me over the phone i recognized one as torranss half brother garry which was how less than fortyeight hours after david torrans had first gone off the radar we found ourselves hunched behind a garden wall about to make a decision on how best to deal with him we could call the cops said jackie more for forms sake than anything else i thought of lester peets he was the kind of guy who got beaten up by his imaginary friends as a child for cheating at games if he could wheedle his way out of paying me my share of the bond he would which meant that id end up paying jackie out of my own pocket calling the cops would give lester just the excuse that he needed anyway i wanted torrans frankly i didnt like him and hed screwed around with my car but i was also forced to admit that i was anticipating the surge of adrenaline that taking him down would bring i had been leading a quiet life these past few weeks it was time for a little excitement no we need to do this ourselves i said you figure they have guns i dont know torrans has never used one in the past hes smalltime his brother has no jacket so hes an unknown quantity as for the other guy he could be machine gun kelly and we wouldnt find out until we hit the door jackie considered our situation for a time wait here he said then scuttled away i heard the trunk of his car opening somewhere in the gloom when he returned he was clutching four cylinders each about a foot in length and with the curved hook of a coat hanger attached to one end what are they i asked he held up the two cylinders in his right handsmoke grenadesthen the two in his leftand tear gas ten parts glycerine to two parts sodium bisulfate the smokes have ammonia added they stink bad all home made i looked at the coat hanger the mismatched tape the scuffed pipes wow and they seem so well put together whod have thought jackies brow furrowed and he considered the cylinders he lifted his right hand or maybe these are gas and these are smoke the trunks a mess so theyve been rolling around some i looked at him your mom must be so proud of you hey shes never wanted for anything least of all munitions so which should we use calling on jackie garner was looking less and less like a good idea but the prospect of not having to hang around in the dark waiting for torrans to show his face or trying to gain access to the house and facing down three men and one woman possibly armed was certainly attractive smoke i said at last i think gassing them may be illegal i think smoking them is illegal too jackie pointed out okay but its probably less illegal than gas just give me one of those things he handed a cylinder over you sure this is smoke i asked yeah they weigh different i was just kidding you pull the pin then toss it as fast as you can oh and dont jiggle it around too much its kind of volatile far from portland as her mother made her way through the streets of an unfamiliar city alice emerged from a deep sleep she felt feverish and nauseous and her limbs and joints ached she had begged again and again for a little stuff just to keep her steady but instead they had injected her with something that gave her terrible frightening hallucinations in which inhuman creatures crowded around her trying to carry her off into the darkness they didnt last long but their effect was draining and after the third or fourth dose she found that the hallucinations continued even after the drug should have worn off so that the line between nightmare and reality became blurred in the end she pleaded with them to stop and in return she told them all that she knew after that they changed the drug and she slept dreamlessly since then the hours had passed in a blur of needles and drugs and periodic sleep her hands had been tied to the frame of the bed and her eyes had remained covered ever since she was brought to this place wherever it was she knew that there was more than one person responsible for keeping her here for different voices had questioned her over the period of her captivity a door opened and footsteps approached the bed how are you feeling asked a male voice it was one that she had heard before it sounded almost tender from his accent she guessed that he was mexican alice tried to speak but her throat was so terribly dry a cup was placed to her lips and the visitor trickled water into her mouth supporting the back of her head with his hand so that she did not spill any upon herself his hand felt very cool against her scalp im sick she said the drugs had taken away some of the hunger but her own addictions still gnawed at her yes but soon you will not be so sick why are you doing this to me did he pay you to do this alice sensed puzzlement maybe even alarm who do you mean my cousin did he pay you to take me away to clean me up a breath was released no but why am i here what do you want me to do she remembered again being asked questions but she had trouble recalling their substance or the answers that she gave in reply she feared though that she had said something bad something that would get a friend into trouble but she couldnt recall her friends name or even her face she was so confused so tired so thirsty so hungry the cool hand passed across her brow brushing the damp hair from her skin and she almost wept in gratitude for this brief moment of solicitude then the hand touched her cheek and she felt fingers exploring the ridges of her eye sockets testing her jaw pressing into her bones alice was reminded of the actions of a surgeon examining the patient before the cutting began and she was afraid you have nothing more to do he said its nearly over now as the taxi neared its destination the woman understood the reasons for the drivers unhappiness they had progressed uptown the area growing less and less hospitable until at last even the streetlights grew dark their bulbs shot out and glass scattered on the sidewalk beneath some of the buildings looked like they might have been beautiful once and it pained her to see them reduced to such squalor almost as much as it hurt her to see young people reduced to living in such conditions prowling the streets and preying on their own the taxi pulled up in front of a narrow doorway marked with the name of a hotel and she paid the driver twentytwo dollars if he was expecting a tip he was now a disappointed man she didnt have money to be giving people tips just for doing what they were supposed to do but she did thank him he didnt help her to get her bag from the trunk he just popped it and let her do it herself all the time looking uneasily at the young men who watched him from the street corners the hotels sign promised tv ac and baths a black clerk in a d tshirt sat behind a plexiglas screen inside reading a college textbook he handed her a registration card took her cash for three nights then gave her a key attached to half a brick by a length of thick chain got to leave the key with me when you go out he told her the woman looked at the brick sure she said ill try to remember youre on the fourth floor elevators on the left the elevator smelled of fried food and human waste the odor in her room was only marginally better there were scorch marks on the thin carpet big circular black burns that could not have come from cigarettes a single iron bed stood against one wall with a space between it and the other wall just large enough for a person to squeeze through a radiator sulked coldly beneath a grimy window a single battered chair beside it there was a sink on the wall and a tiny mirror above it a tv was bolted to the upper righthand corner of the room she opened what appeared to be a closet and discovered instead a small toilet and a hole in the center of the floor to allow water from a showerhead to drain away in total the bathroom was about nine feet square as far as she could see the only way to shower was to sit on the toilet or to straddle it she set out her clothes on the bed and placed her toothbrush and toiletries by the sink she checked her watch it was a little early all that she knew about where she was going she had learned from a single cable tv show but she guessed that things didnt start to get busy there until after dark she turned on the tv lay on her bed and watched game shows and comedies until the night drew in then she pulled on her overcoat put some money in her pocket and descended to the streets two men came to alice and injected her again within minutes her head began to cloud her limbs felt heavy and her head lolled to the right her blindfold was removed and she knew that it was coming to an end once her vision had recovered she could see that one of the men was small and wiry with a pointed gray beard and thinning gray hair his skin was tanned and she guessed that this was the mexican who had spoken to her in the past the other was an enormously fat man with a belly that wobbled pendulously between his thighs obscuring his groin his green eyes were lost in folds of flesh and there was dirt lodged in the pores of his skin his neck was purple and swollen and when he touched her her skin prickled and burned they lifted her from her bed and placed her in a wheelchair then wheeled her down a decaying hallway until she was brought at last to a whitetiled room with a drain in the floor they transferred her to a wooden chair with leather straps to secure her hands and feet and there they left her facing her reflection in the long mirror on the wall she barely recognized herself a gray pallor hung behind her dark skin as though her own features had been thinly overlaid on those of a white person her eyes were bloodshot and there was dried blood at the corners of her mouth and upon her chin she was wearing a white surgical gown beneath which she was naked the room was startlingly clean and bright and the fluorescent lights above were merciless in their exposition of her features worn down by years of drugs and the demands of men for a second she believed that she was looking at her mother in the glass and the resemblance made her eyes water im sorry momma she said i didnt mean no harm by it her hearing became acute a consequence of the drugs pumping through her system before her her features began to swim mutating transforming there were voices whispering around her she tried to turn her head to follow them but was unable to do so her paranoia grew then the lights died and she was in total darkness the woman hailed a cab and told the driver where she wished to be taken she had briefly considered using public transportation but had made the decision that she would use it only during daylight hours by night she would travel by taxi despite the expense after all if something were to happen to her on the subway or while waiting for a bus before she spoke to him then who would look for her daughter the cabdriver was a young man and white most of the others were not white from what she had seen earlier that evening few were even black the races that drove the cabs here could be found only in big cities and foreign lands maam the young man said are you sure thats where you want to go yes she said take me to the point thats a rough area you going to be long youre not going to be long and i can wait for you take you back here she didnt look like any hooker that he had ever seen although he knew that the point catered to all tastes the cabdriver didnt like to think about what might happen to a nice grayhaired lady moving among the bottom dwellers of the point i will be some time she said i dont know when ill be coming back but thank you for asking feeling that he could do nothing more the driver pulled into traffic and headed for hunts point he called himself gmack and he was a playa he dressed like a playa because that was part of what being a playa was all about he had the gold chains and the leather coat beneath which he wore a tailored black vest over his bare upper body his pants were cut wide at the thigh narrowing down to cuffs so small he had trouble getting his feet through them his cornrows were hidden beneath a widebrimmed leather hat and he kept a pair of cell phones on his belt he carried no weapons but there were guns close to hand this was his patch and these were his women he watched them now their asses barely hidden beneath short black imitationleather skirts their titties busting out of their cheap bustier tops he liked his women to dress alike felt like it was kind of his brand msayin anything worthwhile in this country had its own recognizable look didnt matter you was buying it in buttfreeze montana or asswipe arkansas gmack didnt have as many girls as some but then he was just beginning he had big plans he watched chantal this tall black hooker with legs so thin he marveled at how they could support her body teeter on her heels as she headed over to him whatchu got baby he asked hunnerd hunnerd you fuckin with me its slow baby i aint had but some blow jobs and a nigga try to stiff me in the lot makin like he goan pay me soon as im done wastin my time its hard baby gmack

them dark places aint i you think im goan be gentle with you huh when i go lookin inside you want me to do that she shook her head in his grip he released her and watched as she reached under her skirt seconds later her hand emerged with a plastic baggie he could see the notes inside im goan let you get away with it this once yhear he said as he took the baggie from her holding it carefully with his fingernails so as not to sully his hands with the smell of her she gave him the hundred from her handbag too he raised his hand as if to strike her then let it drop slowly to his side and smiled his best most reassuring smile thats just cause you new with me but you fuck with me again bitch and i will fuck your shit up so bad you be bleeding for a week now get yo ass back out there chantal nodded and sniffed she stroked his coat with her right hand rubbing at the lapel sorry baby i just its done said gmack we clear she nodded again then turned away and headed back onto the street gmack watched her go she had maybe another five hours before things got quieter hed take her back to the crib then and show her what happened to bitches who fucked with the mack who tried to embarrass him by holding back on him he wasnt about to discipline her on the street because that would make him look bad no hed deal with her in private that was the thing with these hos you let one get away with something and the next thing they were all holding out on you and then you werent nothing better than a bitch yourself they needed to be taught that lesson early on else they werent worth having around funny thing was you fucked them up and they still stayed with you you worked it right and they felt needed like they was part of a family theyd never had like a good father you disciplined them because you loved them you could screw around on the ones who were sweet on you and they wouldnt say boo because at least they knew the other whores you were seeing in that sense a pimp beat a square any day it was all okay as long as you kept it in the family they were your women and you could do with them what you pleased once you gave them a sense of belonging of being wanted you had to get psychological with these bitches had to know how to play the game excuse me said a voice to his right he looked down to see a small black woman in an overcoat her hand inside her bag her hair was gray and she looked like she might break in two if the wind was strong enough what you want grandma he said you a little old to be trickin if the woman understood the insult she didnt let it show im looking for somebody she said taking a photograph from her wallet and gmack felt his heart sink the door to alices left opened then closed again but the lights in the corridor beyond had also been extinguished and she was unable to see who had entered a stench assailed her nostrils and she found herself retching she could hear no footsteps yet she was aware of a figure circling her appraising her please she said and it took all of her strength just to speak please whatever i done im sorry for it i wont tell nobody what happened i dont even know where i am let me go and ill be a good girl i promise the whispering grew louder now and there was laughter intermingled with the voices then something touched her face and her skin prickled and her mind was bombarded with images she felt as though her memories were being ransacked the details of her life briefly held up to the light then discarded by the presence beside her she saw her mother her aunt her grandmother a houseful of women set on a patch of land by the edge of a forest a dead man lying in a casket the women standing around him none of them weeping one of them reaches for the cotton sheet covering his head and when it is removed he is revealed to be near faceless his features destroyed by some terrible vengeance wrought upon him by another in a corner stands a boy tall for his age dressed in a cheap hired suit and she knows his name louis louis she whispered and her voice seemed to echo around the tiled room the presence beside her withdrew but she could still hear its breathing its breath smelt of earth earth and burning louis she repeated closer than brother to me blood to me help me her hand was clasped in the hand of another and she felt it being raised it came to rest upon something ragged and ruined she traced the lineaments of what once was a face the eye sockets now empty the fragments of cartilage where once was a nose a lipless gap for a mouth the mouth opened taking her fingers inside then closed softly upon them and she saw once again the figure in the casket the man without a face his head torn apart by the actions of louis she was crying now crying for them both the mouth upon her fingers was no longer soft teeth were erupting from the gums flat yet sharp and they tore into her hand this is not real this is not real but the pain was real and the presence was real and she called his name in her head once againlouisas she began to die gmack kept his face turned from her taking in his women the cars the streets anything to divert his attention and force her to go elsewhere cant help you he said go call fiveo they be dealin with missin persons she worked here said the woman the girl im looking for she worked for you like i said cant help you you need to be movin on now else you goan get into trouble nobody want to be answering yo questions people here want to make money this is a business this like mickey ds its all about the dollar i can pay you said the old woman she raised a pathetic handful of ragged bills i dont want yo money he said get out of my face please she said just look at this picture she held up the picture of the young black woman gmack glanced at the photograph then tried to look away as casually as he could the sick feeling in his stomach growing suddenly stronger dont know her said gmack maybe i said i aint never seen her but you didnt even look prop and in his fear gmack made his biggest mistake he lashed out at her catching her on the left cheek she staggered back against the wall a pale spot against her skin where his open hand had struck her get the fuck out of here he said dont you be comin round here no more the woman swallowed and he could see the tears starting but she tried to hold them back old bitch had some balls hed give her that she replaced the photograph in her bag then walked away across the street gmack could see chantal staring at him the fuck you lookin at he shouted to her he made a move toward her and she backed away her body eventually obscured by a green taurus that pulled up alongside her the middleaged business type inside easing down the window as he negotiated with her when theyd agreed on a price chantal climbed in alongside him and they pulled off headed for one of the lots off the main drag that was another thing hed have to talk about with the bitch curiosity jackie garner was at one side of the window and i was at the other using a little dentists mirror id picked up id seen two men watching tv in the living room one of them was torranss brother garry the drapes on what i took to be a bedroom nearby were drawn and i thought i could hear a man and a woman talking inside i signaled to jackie that he should stay where he was then i moved to the bedroom window using the raised fingers of my right hand i counted three two one then hurled the smoke canister through the window of the room jackie tossed his through the glass of the living room then followed it with a second instantly noxious green fumes began to pour from the holes we backed away taking up positions in the shadows across from the front and back doors to the house i could hear coughing and shouting inside but i could see nothing already the smoke had entirely filled the living room the stench was incredible and even at a distance my eyes were stinging it wasnt just smoke it was gas too the front door opened and two men spilled out into the yard one of them had a gun in his hand he fell to his knees on the grass and began to retch jackie came at him from out of nowhere put one big foot on the gun hand and kicked him hard with the other the other man garry torrans just lay on the ground the heels of his hands pressed to his eyes seconds later the back door opened and olivia morales stumbled out david torrans was close behind her he was shirtless and a wet towel was pressed to his face once he was away from the house he discarded it and made a break for the next yard his eyes were red and streaming but he wasnt suffering as badly as the others he had almost made it to the wall when i emerged from the darkness and swept his feet from under him he landed hard on his back the wind abruptly knocked out of him by the impact he lay there staring up at me tears rolling down his cheeks who are you he said my names parker i said you gassed us he vomited the words out you tried to steal my car yeah butyou gassed us what kind of sonofabitch gasses someone jackie garner shambled across the lawn behind him i could see garry and the other man lying on the ground their hands and legs bound with plastic ties torranss head turned to take in the new arrival this kind i told him jackie shrugged sorry he said to torrans at least i know it works gmack lit a cigarette and noticed that his hands were shaking he didnt want to think about the girl in the picture she was gone and gmack didnt never want to see the men who took her again they found out someone was asking after her and then another pimp would be taking care of the macks team because the mack would be dead the mack didnt know it but he had only days left to live he should never have hit the woman and in the whitetiled room alice now torn and ruined prepared to breathe her last the mouth of another touched her lips waiting he could sense it coming could taste its sweetness the woman shuddered then grew limp he felt her spirit enter him and a new voice was added to the great chorus within chapter two the days are like leaves waiting to fall the past lies in the shadows of our lives it is endlessly patient secure in the knowledge that all we have done and all that we have failed to do must surely return to haunt us in the end when i was young i cast each day aside unthinkingly like dandelion seeds committed to the wind floating harmlessly from the hands of a boy and vanishing over his shoulder as he moved onward along the path toward the sunset and home nothing was to be regretted for there were more days to come slights and injuries would be forgotten hurts would be forgiven and there was radiance enough in the world to light the days that followed now as i look back over my shoulder at the path that i have taken i can see that it has become tangled and obscured by undergrowth where the seeds of past actions and halfacknowledged sins have taken root another shadows me along the path she has no name but she looks like susan my dead wife and jennifer my first daughter who was killed beside her in our little house in new york walks with her for a time i wished that i had died with them sometimes that regret returns i move more slowly through life now and the growth is catching up with me there are briars around my ankles weeds brush my fingertips as i walk and the ground beneath my feet crackles with the fallen leaves of halfdead days the past is waiting for me a monster of my own creation the past is waiting for us all i awoke to darkness with dawn impending beside me rachel slept unknowing in a small room next to ours our infant daughter rested we had made this place together it was supposed to be a safe haven but what i saw around me was no longer our home it was some composite a collision of remembered places this was the bed that rachel and i chose yet it stood now not in a bedroom overlooking the scarborough marshes but in an urban landscape i could hear street voices raised and sirens crying in the distance there was a dresser from my parents house and on it lay my dead wifes cosmetics i could see a brush on the cabinet to my left over rachels sleeping head her hair was red the hairs caught in the brush were blond i rose i entered a hallway in maine and descended stairs in new york in the living room she waited beyond the window the marshes shone with silver incandescent with moonlight shadows moved across the waters although there was a cloudless night sky above the shapes drifted endlessly east until at last they were swallowed up by the waiting ocean beyond there was no traffic now and no sounds of the city broke the fragile quiet of the night all was stillness but for the shadows on the marsh susan sat by the window her back to me her hair tied with an aquamarine bow she stared through the glass at a little girl who skipped on the lawn her hair was like her mothers her head was down as she counted her steps and then my dead wife spoke you have forgotten us no i have not forgotten then who is that who sleeps beside you now in the place where i once slept who is it that holds you in the night who is it that has borne you a child how can you say that you have not forgotten when the scent of her is upon you i am here you are here i cannot forget you cannot love two women with all of your heart one of us must be lost to you is it not true that you no longer think of us in the silences between every heartbeat are there not times when we are absent from your thoughts while you twine yourself in her arms she spit the words and the power of her anger sprayed blood upon the glass outside the child stopped her skipping and stared at me through the pane the darkness obscured her face and i was grateful she was your child she will always be my child in this world or the next she will always be mine we will not go away we will not disappear we refuse to leave you you will remember us you will not forget and she turned and once again i saw her ruined face and the empty sockets of her eyes and the memory of the agonies that she endured in my name were brought back to me with such force that i spasmed my limbs extending my back arching with such force that i heard the vertebrae crack i woke suddenly with my arms curled around my chest hands upon my skin and hair my mouth open in agony and rachel was holding me and whisperinghush hushand my new daughter was crying in the voice of the old and the world was a place that the dead chose not to leave for to leave was to be forgotten and they would not be forgotten rachel stroked my hair calming me then went to attend to our child i listened to her cooing to the infant walking with her in her arms until the tears ceased she so rarely cried this little girl our samantha she was so quiet she was not like the one that was lost and yet i sometimes saw a little of jennifer in her face even in her first months sometimes too i thought i caught the ghost of susan in her features but that could not be i closed my eyes i would not forget their names were written upon my heart along with those of so many others those who once were lost and those whom i had failed to find those who trusted me and those who stood against me those who died at my hand and those who died at the hands of others each name was written carved with a blade upon my flesh name upon name tangled one unto another yet each clearly legible each subtly engraved upon this great palimpsest of the heart i would not forget they would not let me forget the visiting priest at saint maximilian kolbe catholic church struggled to articulate his dismay at what he was seeing whatwhat is he wearing the object of his dismay was a diminutive exburglar dressed in a suit that appeared to be made from some form of nasaendorsed synthetic material to say that it shimmered as its wearer moved was to underestimate its capacity for distorting light this suit shone like a bright new star embracing every available color in the spectrum and a couple more that the creator himself had presumably passed over on the grounds of good taste if the tin man from the wizard of oz had opted for a makeover at a carvaleting service he would have emerged looking something like angel it seems to be made of some kind of metal said the priest he was squinting slightly its also reflective i added it is said the priest he sounded almost impressed in a confused way i dont think ive ever seen anything quite like it before is he er a friend of yours i tried to keep the vague sense of embarrassment out of my voice hes one of the godparents there was a noticeable pause the visiting priest was a missionary home on leave from southeast asia he had probably seen a great deal in his time it was flattering in a way to think that it had taken a baptism in southern maine to render him speechless perhaps we should keep him away from naked flames said the priest once he had given the implications some thought that might be wise he will have to hold a candle of course but ill ask him to keep it outstretched that should be all right and the godmother now it was my turn to pause before continuing thats where things get complicated see the gentleman standing close by him beside angel and towering at least a foot above him was his partner louis one might have described louis as a log cabin republican except that any selfrespecting log cabin republican would have bolted the doors pulled the shutters and waited for the cavalry to arrive rather than admit this man to his company he was wearing a dark blue suit and sunglasses but even with the shades on he seemed to be trying hard not to look directly at his significant other in fact he was doing a pretty good impression of a man without a significant other at all hampered only by the fact that angel insisted on following him around and talking to him occasionally the tall gentleman he seems a little out of place it was an astute observation louis was fastidiously turned out as always and apart from his height and his color there was little about his physical appearance that would seem to invite such a comment yet somehow he radiated difference and a vague sense of potential threat well i guess he would be a godfather too two godfathers and a godmother my partners sister shes outside somewhere the priest did a little softshoe shuffle to emphasize his discomfort its most unusual i know i said but then theyre unusual people it was late january and there was still snow on sheltered ground two days earlier i had driven down to new hampshire to buy cheap booze in the state liquor store in preparation for the celebrations after the christening when i was done i walked for a time by the piscataqua river the ice still a foot thick by the shore but webbed by cracks the center was free of encumbrance though and the water flowed slowly and steadily toward the sea i walked against the current following a wooded berm thick with fir that the river had created over time cutting off a patch of bog land where earlybudding blueberry and blackberry and grayblack winterberry and tan winter maleberry coexisted with spruce and larch and rhodora at last i came to the floating area of the bog all green and purple where the sphagnum moss was interwoven with cranberry vines i plucked a berry sweetened by the frost and placed it between my teeth when i bit down the taste of the juice filled my mouth i found a tree trunk long fallen and now gray and rotted and sat upon it spring was coming and with it the long slow thaw there would be new leaves and new life but i have always been a winter person now more than ever before i desired to remain frozen amid snow and ice cocooned and unchanging i thought of rachel and my daughter sam and those others who had gone before them life slows in winter but now i wanted it to cease its forward momentum entirely except for us three if i could hold us here wrapped all in white then perhaps everything would be fine if the days advanced only for us then no ill could come no strangers would arrive at our door and no demands would be made upon us other than those elemental things that we required from one another and that we freely gave in return yet even here amid the silence of the winter woods and the mosscovered water life went on a hidden teeming existence masked by snow and ice the stillness was a ruse an illusion fooling only those who were unwilling or unable to look closer and see what lay beneath time and life moved inexorably forward already it was growing dark around me soon it would be night and they would come again they were visiting more frequently the little girl who was almost my daughter and her mother who was not quite my wife their voices were growing more insistent the memory of them in this life becoming increasingly polluted by the forms that they had taken in the next in the beginning when first they came i could not tell what they were i thought them phantasms of grief a product of my troubled guilty mind but gradually they assumed a kind of reality i did not grow used to their presence but i learned to accept it whether real or imagined they still symbolized a love that i once felt and continued to feel but now they were becoming something different and their love was whispered through bared teeth we will not be forgotten all was coming apart around me and i did not know what to do so i sat instead among snow and ice on a rotted tree trunk and willed clocks to stop it was warmer than it had been in many days rachel was standing outside the church holding sam in her arms her mother joan was beside her our daughter was wrapped in white her eyes tightly closed as though she were troubled in her sleep the sky was clear blue and the winter sunlight shone coldly upon black point our friends and neighbors were scattered before us some talking smoking most had dressed up for the occasion happy for an excuse to break out some colorful clothes in winter i nodded greetings to a few people then joined rachel and joan as i approached sam woke and waved her arms she yawned looked blearily about then decided there was nothing important enough to keep her from another nap joan tucked the white shawl under sams chin to keep out the cold she was a small stout woman who wore minimal makeup and kept her silver hair cut short against her skull after meeting her for the first time that morning louis had suggested that she was trying to get in touch with her inner lesbian i advised him to keep those opinions to himself or else joan wolfe would try to get in touch with louiss inner gay man by reaching into his chest and tearing his heart out she and i got on okay most of the time but i knew that she worried about the safety of her daughter and her new grandchild and this translated into a distance between us for me it was like being within sight of a warm friendly place that could be reached only by traversing a frozen lake i accepted that joan had cause to feel concerned because of things that had happened in the past but that didnt make her implicit disapproval of me any easier to bear still compared to my relations with rachels father joan and i were bosom buddies frank wolfe once he had a couple of drinks inside him felt compelled to end most of our encounters with the words you know if anything ever happens to my daughter rachel was wearing a light blue dress plain and unadorned there were wrinkles on the back of the dress and a thread hung loose from the seam she looked tired and distracted i can take her if you like i said no shes fine the words came out too quickly i felt like id been pushed hard in the chest and forced to take a step back i looked at joan after a couple of seconds she moved away and went to join rachels younger sister pam who was smoking a cigarette and flirting with a group of admiring locals i know she is i said quietly its you im concerned about rachel leaned against me for a moment then almost as if she were counting the seconds until she could put space between us once more broke the contact i just want this to be done she said i want all of these people to be gone we hadnt invited very many people to the christening angel and louis were present of course and walter and lee cole had come up from new york apart from them the bulk of the little group was made up of rachels immediate family and some of our friends from portland and scarborough all told there were twentyfive or thirty people present no more and most would come back to our house after the ceremony usually rachel would have reveled in such company but since sams birth she had grown increasingly insular withdrawing even from me i tried to recall the early days of jennifers life before she and her mother were taken from me and although jennifer had been as raucous as sam was quiet i could not remember encountering the kind of difficulties that now troubled rachel and me true it was natural that sam should be the focus of rachels energy and attention i tried to help her in every way that i could and had cut back on my work so that i could take on some of the burden of caring for her and give rachel a little time to herself if she chose instead she seemed almost to resent my presence and with the arrival of angel and louis that morning it appeared that the tension between us had increased exponentially i can tell them youre feeling ill i said you could just take sam upstairs to our room later and get away from everyone theyll understand she shook her head its not that i want them gone do you understand and in truth i did not not then the woman arrived at the auto shop early that morning it stood on the verge of an area that if it was not quite gentrified then at least was no longer mugging the gentry she had taken the subway to queens and been forced to change trains twice having mistaken the number of the subway line the streets were quieter today although she still could see little beauty in this place there was bruising to her face and her left eye hurt every time she blinked after the young man had struck her she had taken a moment to recover her composure against the wall of an alleyway it was not the first time that a man had raised his hand to her but never before had she endured a blow from a stranger and one half her age the experience left her humiliated and angry and in the minutes that followed she wished perhaps for the first time ever that louis were near at that moment that she could reach out and tell him what had occurred and watch as he humiliated the pimp in turn in the darkness of the alleyway she placed her hands on her knees and lowered her head she felt like she was about to vomit her hands were shaking and there was a sheen of sweat upon her face she closed her eyes and began to pray until the feelings of rage went away and as they departed her hands grew still and her skin became cool once again she heard a woman moan close by and a man spoke harsh words to her she looked to her right and saw shapes moving rhythmically beside some discarded trash bags cars drifted slowly by their windows lowered the drivers faces rendered cruel and hungry by streetlights and headlamps a tall white girl teetered on pink heels her body barely concealed by white lingerie beside her a black woman leaned against the hood of a car her hands splayed upon the metal her buttocks raised to attract the attention of passing men close by the rhythmic thrusting grew faster and the womans moans increased in pitch false and empty before finally fading entirely seconds later she heard footsteps the man emerged from the shadows first he was young and white and well dressed his tie was askew and he was running his hands through his hair to tidy it after his exertions she smelled alcohol and a trace of cheap perfume he barely glanced at the woman against the wall as he turned onto the street he was followed after a time by a little white girl she looked barely old enough to drive a car yet here she was dressed in a black miniskirt and a cutoff top her heels adding two inches to her diminutive stature her dark hair cut in a bob and her delicate features obscured by crudely applied cosmetics she seemed to be having trouble walking as though she were in some pain she had almost passed the black woman by when a hand reached out not touching her merely imploring her to stop excuse me miss she said the young girl paused her eyes were very large and blue but already the older woman could see the light dying inside i cant give you money she said i dont want money i have a picture id like you to take a look at it maybe tell me if you know the girl she reached into her bag and removed the photograph of her daughter after some hesitation the girl took it she looked at it for a time then handed it back shes gone she said the older woman stepped slowly forward she didnt want to alarm the girl you know her not really i saw her around some but she went away a day or two after i started i heard her street name was lashan but i dont think that was her real name no her name is alice are you her mother yes she seemed nice she is she had a friend her name was sereta do you know where i can find her friend the girl shook her head she left too i wish i could tell you more but i cant i got to go before the woman could stop her she had stepped out into the stream and was taken up by the flow she followed her watching her go she saw the girl cross the street and hand some money over to the young black man who had hit her then take up position once again with the other women lining the street where were the police she wondered how could they let this continue on their doorsteps this exploitation this suffering how could they allow a little girl like that to be used to be killed slowly from the inside out and if they could permit this to happen how much could they care about a lost black girl who had fallen into this river of human misery and was dragged down by its currents she was a fool to believe that she could come to this strange city and find her daughter alone she had called the police first of course before she had even decided to come north and had given them what details she could over the phone they had advised her to file a report in person once she came to the city and she had done so the previous day she had watched the policemans expression alter slightly as she spoke to him of her childs circumstances to him her daughter was another addict drifting through a dangerous life perhaps he meant what he said when he told her he would do his best for her but she knew that the disappearance of her little girl was not as important as a missing white girl maybe one with money or influence or simply one without puncture holes in the flesh between her fingers and toes she had considered returning to the police that morning and describing the man who had struck her and the young prostitute with whom she had spoken but she believed that it would make little difference if she did the time for the police was gone now she needed someone for whom her daughter would be a priority not merely another name on an evergrowing list of the disappeared although it was sunday the main door to the auto shop was halfraised and music was playing inside the woman crouched down and edged her way into the dimly lit interior a thin man in coveralls was bent over the interior of a big foreign car his name was arno beside him tony bennetts voice came from the cheap speakers of a small battered radio hello said the woman arno turned his head although his hands remained hidden in the workings of the engine im sorry lady were closed he said he knew he should have pulled the shutter down fully but he liked to let a little air in and anyway he didnt expect to be here for too long the audi was due to be picked up first thing monday morning and another hour or two would see it done im looking for someone she said the boss aint around as the woman approached he saw the swelling on her face he wiped his hands on a rag and abandoned the car for the time being hey you okay what happened to your face the woman was close to him now she was hiding her distress and her fear but the mechanic could see it in her eyes like a scared child peering out of twin windows im looking for someone she repeated he gave me this she removed her wallet from her bag and carefully extracted a card from its folds the card was slightly yellowed at the edges but apart from this natural ageing it was in pristine condition the mechanic reckoned that it had been kept safe for a long time just in case it was ever needed arno took the card there was no name upon it only an illustration it depicted a serpent being trampled beneath the feet of an armored angel the angel had a lance in his right hand and its point had pierced the reptile dark blood flowed from the wound on the back of the card was the number of a discreet answering service beside it was a single letter l written in black ink along with the handwritten address of the auto shop in which they now stood few people had such cards in their possession and the mechanic had never seen a card with the address of the shop added by hand the letter l was the clincher in effect this was an access all areas pass a requestno an orderto extend any and all help to the person who possessed it did you call the number he asked i dont want to talk to him through no service i want to see him hes not here hes out of town where the mechanic hesitated before answering maine id be grateful to you if youd give me the address of where hes at arno walked to the cluttered office that stood to the left of the main work area he flicked through the address book until he came to the entry he needed then took a piece of paper and transferred the relevant details to it he folded the paper and gave it to the woman you want me to call him for you let him know youre on your way thank you but no you got a car she shook her head i took the subway out here you know how youre going to get up to maine not yet bus i guess arno put on his jacket and removed a set of keys from his pocket ill give you a ride to port authority see you safely onto the bus for the first time the woman smiled thank you id appreciate that arno looked at her gently he touched her face examining the bruise i got something for that if its hurting you ill be fine she said he nodded the man who did this to you is in a lot of trouble the man who did this to you wont live out the week lets go then we got time ill buy you a cup of coffee and a muffin for the trip dead man hes a dead man we were gathered around the font in a small group the other guests standing in the pews a little distance away the priest had made his introductions and now we were approaching the meat of the ceremony do you reject satan and all his empty promises asked the priest he waited there was no reply rachel coughed discreetly angel appeared to have found something interesting to look at down on the floor louis remained impassive he had removed his shades and was focused on a point just above my left shoulder youre speaking for sam i whispered to angel he doesnt mean you realization dawned like morning light on an arid desert oh okay then said angel enthusiastically sure absolutely rejected amen said louis the priest looked confused that would be a yes i told him right he said as if to reassure himself good rachel shot daggers at angel what he asked he raised his hands in a what did i do gesture some wax from the candle dripped onto the sleeve of his jacket a faintly acrid smell arose awwww said angel first time ive worn it too rachel moved from daggers to swords you open your mouth again and youll be buried in that suit she said angel went quiet all things considered it was the smartest move the woman was seated by a window on the right side of the bus in one day she was passing through more states than she had previously visited in her entire life the bus pulled into south station in boston now with thirty minutes to spare she wandered down to the amtrak concourse and bought herself a cup of coffee and a danish both were expensive and she looked with dismay at the little wad of bills in her purse adorned by a smattering of change but she was hungry even after the muffin the man from the garage had so kindly bought for her she took a seat and watched the people go by the businessmen in their suits the harried mothers with their children she watched the arrivals and departures change the names clicking rapidly across the big board above her head the trains on the platform were silver and sleek a young black woman took a seat beside her and opened a newspaper her suit was neatly tailored and her hair was cut very short a brown leather attaché case stood at her feet and she wore a small matching purse upon her shoulder a diamond engagement ring gleamed upon her left hand i have a daughter your age thought the old woman but she will never be like you she will never wear a tailored suit or read what you read and no man will ever give her a ring like the one that you wear she is a lost soul a troubled soul but i love her and she is mine the man who had her upon me is gone now he is dead and he is no loss to the world they would call what he did to me rape i suppose for i surrendered to him out of fear we were all afraid of him and of what he could do we believed that he had killed my older sister for she went away with him and did not return home alive and when he came back to us he took me in her place but he died for what he did and he died badly they asked us if we wanted them to rebuild his face if we wanted to have the casket open for a viewing we told them to leave him as he was found and to bury him in a pine box with ropes for handles they marked his grave with a wooden cross but on the night he was buried i went to the place where he lay and i took the cross away and i burned it in the hope that he would be forgotten but i gave birth to his child and i loved her even though there was something of him in her perhaps she never had a chance cursed with a father like that he tainted her polluting her from the moment she was born the seed of her own destruction contained within his own she was always a sad child an angry child yet how could she leave us for that other life how could she find peace in such a city among men who would use her for money who would feed her drugs and alcohol to keep her pliant how could we have let that happen to her and the boyno the man for that is what he is nowtried to look out for her but he gave up on her and now she is gone my daughter is gone and nobody yet cares enough about her to seek her out nobody except me but i will make them care she is mine and i will bring her back he will help me for she is blood to him and he owes her a blood debt he killed her father now he will bring her back to this life and to me the guests were scattered through the living room and the kitchen some had found their way outside and were sitting beneath the bare trees in our yard wearing their coats and enjoying the open air as they drank beer and wine and ate hot food from paper plates angel and louis as always were slightly apart from the rest occupying a stone bench that looked out over the marshes our lab retriever walter lay at their feet angels fingers gently stroking his head i went over to join them checking as i went that nobody lacked for food and drink you want to hear a joke said angel theres this duck on a pond and hes getting really pissed at this other duck whos coming on to his girl so he decides to hire an assassin duck to bump him off louis breathed out loudly through his nose with a sound like gas leaking under nearunendurable pressure angel ignored him so the assassin arrives and the duck meets him in some reeds the assassin tells him that it will cost five pieces of bread to kill the target payable after the deed is done the duck tells him thats fine and the assassin says so do you want me to send you the body and the duck says no just send me the bill there was silence bill said angel again you know its i got a joke said louis we both looked at him in surprise you hear the one about the dead irritating guy in the cheap suit we waited thats it said louis thats not funny said angel makes me laugh said louis a man touched me on the arm and i found walter cole standing beside me he was retired now but he had taught me much of what i knew when i was a cop our bad days were behind us and he had come to an accommodation with what i was and with what i was capable of doing i left angel and louis to bicker and walked back to the house with walter about that dog he said hes a good dog i said not smart but loyal im not looking to give him a job you called him walter i like the name you named your dog after me i thought youd be flattered anyway nobody needs to know its not as if he looks like you he has more hair for a start oh thats very funny even the dog is funnier than you we entered the kitchen and walter retrieved a bottle of sebago ale from the fridge i didnt offer him a glass i knew that he preferred to drink it by the neck when he could which meant anytime he was out of his wifes sight outside i saw rachel talking with pam her sister was smaller than rachel and spikier which was saying something whenever i hugged her i expected to be pierced by spines sam was asleep in an upstairs room rachels mother was keeping an eye on her walter saw me follow rachels progress through the garden how are you two doing asked walter three of us i reminded him were doing okay i guess its hard when theres a new baby in a house i know i remember walters hand rose slightly he seemed on the verge of touching my shoulder until his hand slowly fell away im sorry he said instead its not that i forget them i dont know what it is exactly sometimes it seems like another life another time does that make sense yes i said i know just what you mean there was a breeze blowing and it caused the rope swing on the oak tree to move in a slow arc as though an unseen child were playing upon it i could see the channels shining in the marshes beyond intersecting in places as they carved their paths through the reeds the waters of one intermingling with those of another each changed irrevocably by the meeting lives were like that when their paths crossed they emerged altered forever by the encounter sometimes in small almost invisible ways and other times so profoundly that nothing that followed could ever be the same again the residue of other lives infects us and we in turn pass it on to those whom we later meet i think she worries i said about what about us about me shes risked so much and shes been hurt for it she doesnt want to be scared anymore but she is shes afraid for us and shes afraid for sam youve talked about it no not really maybe its time before things get worse right then i found it hard to imagine how much worse circumstances could get i hated these unspoken tensions between rachel and me i loved her and i needed her but i was angry too the burden of blame slipped too easily onto my shoulders these days i was tired of carrying it doing much work asked walter changing the subject some i said anything interesting i dont think so you never can tell but ive tried to be selective its pretty straightforward stuff ive been offered morecomplicated matters but ive turned them down i wont bring harm upon them but i stopped walter waited go on i shook my head lee walters wife entered the kitchen she scowled as she saw him drinking from the bottle i turn my back for five minutes and you abandon all civilized behavior she said but she was smiling as she spoke youll be drinking out of the toilet bowl next walter hugged her to him you know she said they named the dog after you maybe thats why anyway lots of people want to meet you because of it the dog wants to meet you walter scowled as she grabbed him by the hand and pulled him toward the garden are you coming outside she asked me in a moment i said i watched them cross the lawn rachel waved to them and they went to join her her eyes met mine and she gave me a small smile i raised my hand then touched it to the glass my fingers dwarfing her face i wont bring harm upon you and our daughter not by my choosing yet still it comes thats what im afraid of it has found me before and it will find me again i am a danger to you and to our child and i think you know that we are coming apart i love you but we are coming apart the day drew on people left and others who were unable to make the ceremony took their places as the light faded angel and louis were no longer speaking and were more obviously maintaining their distance from all that was taking place around them than before both kept their eyes fixed on the road that wound from route to the coast between them lay a cell phone arno had called them earlier that day as soon as he had seen the woman safely onto the greyhound bus from new york she didnt leave a name he told louis his voice crackling slightly over the connection i know who she is said louis you did right to call now there were lights on the road i joined them where they sat leaning slightly on the back of the bench together we watched the cab cross the bridge over the marsh the sunlight gleaming on the waters the cars progress reflected in their depths there was a tugging at my stomach and my head felt as though hands were pressed hard against my temples i could see rachel standing unmoving among the guests she too was watching the approaching car louis rose as it turned into the driveway of the house this isnt about you he said you got no reason to be concerned and i wondered at what he had brought to my house i followed them through the open gate at the end of the yard angel stayed back as louis walked to the cab and opened the door a woman emerged a large multicolored bag clasped in her hands she was smaller than louis by perhaps eighteen inches and probably no more than a decade or so older than he although her face bore the marks of a difficult life and she wore her worries like a veil across her features i imagined that she had been beautiful when she was younger there was little of that physical beauty left now but there was an inner strength to her that shone brightly from her eyes i could see some bruising to her face it looked very recent she stood close to louis and gazed up at him with something almost like love then slapped him hard across the left cheek with her right hand shes gone she said you were supposed to look out for her but now shes gone and she began to cry as he took her in his arms and his body shook with the force of her sobs this is the story of alice who fell down a rabbit hole and never came back martha was louiss aunt a man named deeber now dead had fathered a child upon her a girl they called her alice and they loved her but she was never a happy child she rebelled against the company of women and turned instead to men they told her that she was beautiful for she was but she was young and angry something gnawed deep inside her its hunger exacerbated by the actions of the women who had loved her and cared for her they had told her that her father was dead but it was only through others that she learned of the kind of man he was and the manner in which he had left this world nobody knew who was responsible for his death but there were rumors hints that the neatly dressed black women in the house with the pretty garden had colluded in his killing along with her cousin the boy called louis alice rebelled against them and all that they represented love security the bonds of family she was drawn to a bad crowd and left the safety of her mothers home she drank smoked some dope became a casual user of harder drugs then an addict she drifted from the places that she knew and went to live in a tinroofed shack at the edge of a dark forest where men paid to take turns with her she was paid in narcotics although their value was far less than what the johns had paid to sleep with her and so the bonds around her tightened slowly she began to lose herself the combination of sex and drugs acting like a cancer eating away at all that she truly was so that she became at last their creature even as she tried to convince herself that this was only a temporary aberration a fleeting thing to help her deal with the sense of hurt and betrayal that she felt it was early one sunday morning and she was lying on a bare cot naked but for a pair of cheap plastic shoes she stank of men and the hunger was upon her her head hurt and the bones in her arms and legs ached two other women slept nearby the doorways to their quarters blocked by blankets hung over ropes a small window allowed the morning light to seep into her room sullied by the dirt upon its pane and the cobwebs freckled with leaves and dead bugs that hung at its corners she pulled the blanket aside and saw that the door of the hut was open lowe stood in its frame his giant shoulders almost brushing either side of the doorway he was shirtless his feet bare and sweat glistened upon his shaved head and trickled slowly down between his shoulder blades his back was pale and hairy he had a cigarette in his right hand and was talking to another man who stood outside alice figured it was wallace the little high yellow man who ran his hookers and his smalltime narcotics trade from out of this hut in the woods with a little illicit whiskey for those of more conservative tastes a laugh came and then she saw wallace as he moved across the large window at the front of the hut zipping up his fly and rubbing his fingers upon his jeans his shirt was open and hung loose upon his pigeon chest and his little belly he was an ugly man and rarely bathed sometimes he asked her to do things for him and it was all that she could manage not to choke on the taste of him but she needed him now she needed what he had even if it meant adding to her debt a debt that would never be paid she put on a tshirt and skirt to cover her nakedness then lit a cigarette and prepared to pull the blanket fully across sundays were quiet some of the men who used this place would already be preparing for church and they would sit in the pews and pretend to listen to the sermon even as they thought of her there were others who had not darkened a church door in many years but even for them sundays were different if she could work up the energy she might go to the mall pick up some new clothes with the little money that she had maybe some cosmetics too she had been meaning to do it for a couple of weeks but there were other distractions here still even wallace had recently commented on the state of her dresses and her underwear although the men who came here werent too particular some even liked the squalor of it for it added a certain spice to their sense of transgression but wallace generally preferred to pretend that his women were clean even if their surroundings were not if she went out early she could get her business done then come back and relax for the afternoon there might be some work for her in the evening but it would not be as demanding as the night before not by any means fridays and saturdays were always the worst with the threat of alcoholfueled violence ever present true lowe and wallace protected the women but they couldnt stay with them behind that curtain while the men were being serviced and it didnt take more than a split second for a mans fist to reach a womans face there came the sound of a car approaching she could see it through the doorway as it turned unlike most of the cars that came to this place this one was new it looked like one of those german cars and the chrome on its wheels was spotless the engine growled briefly as it came to a stop she saw doors opening front and back wallace said something that she could not hear and lowe tossed his cigarette on the ground his other hand already reaching behind his back to where the butt of the big colt emerged from his jeans before he could grasp it his shoulders exploded in a red cloud that billowed briefly in the sunlight then fell wetly to the floor somehow he remained standing and she saw his hands clutch at the doorframe holding himself upright footsteps crunched on the gravel outside then the second shot came and part of lowes head disappeared his hands relinquished their grip and he fell to the ground alice stood frozen rooted to the spot outside she could hear wallace pleading for his life he was backing toward the hut and she could see his body grow larger and larger as he neared the window there were more shots and the glass shattered into hundreds of pieces the remaining shards in the frames edged with blood now she could hear the other girls responding to her right rowlene was screaming repeatedly she was a big girl and alice could almost picture her on her bed her sheet pulled up to her chest her eyes drowsy and flecked with red as she tried to make herself small in the corner of her bunk to her left she could hear pria who was halfasian strike the wall as she struggled to clear her head and find her clothes pria had partied with two johns the night before and they had shared some of their buy with her she was probably still high the figure of a man appeared in the doorframe alice briefly glimpsed his face as he entered and the sight gave her the impetus she needed she allowed the blanket to fall gently then climbed on her bunk and pushed at the window at first it would not move even as she heard the man moving through the hut coming closer to the whores quarters she hit the frame with the base of her palm and it swung out with barely a sound alice pulled herself up and squeezed herself through the gap even as the next shot came from the stall beside her own and splinters burst from the wall rowena was gone she would be next behind her a hand grasped the blanket and pulled it to the floor as gravity took hold and alice tumbled to the ground she felt something snap in her hand as she fell awkwardly then she was running for the cover of the trees fallen branches snapping beneath her feet as she ducked and weaved into the forest the shotgun roared again and an alder disintegrated barely inches from her right foot she kept running even though her feet were cut by stones and her clothing torn by briars and thorns she did not stop until the pain in her side was so great that she felt as though she were being ripped in half she lay against a tree and thought that she heard distantly the sounds of men she knew the face of the man at the door he was one of those who had taken pria the night before she did not know why he had returned or what had led him to do what he did all that she knew was that she had to get away from this place for they knew who she was they had seen her and they would find her alice called her mother from a phone at a gas station the pumps locked and the station closed for it was still early on sunday morning her mother came with clothing and what money she had and alice left that afternoon and did not ever return to the state in which she was born she called in the years that followed mostly with requests for money she called twice each week and sometimes more often than that it was alices one unfailing concession to her mother and even at her lowest she always tried to keep the older woman from worrying more than she already did there were other small kindnesses too birthday gifts that arrived early or more often late but arrived nonetheless cards at christmas a little cash included in the early years but later only a signature and a scrawled greeting and very occasionally a letter the quality of the script and the color of the ink varying in accordance with the lengthy process of the missives completion her mother cherished them all but mostly she was grateful for the calls they let her know that her daughter was still alive then the calls ceased martha sat on the couch in my office louis standing to one side of her angel seated quietly in my chair i was by the fireplace rachel had looked in on us briefly then left you should have looked out for her martha again told louis i tried he said he looked old and tired she didnt want help not the kind i could offer her marthas eyes ignited how can you say that she was lost she was a lost soul she needed someone to bring her back that should have been you this time louis said nothing you went to hunts point i asked last time we spoke she said that was where she was at so that was where i went is that where you got hurt she lowered her head a man hit me what was his name asked louis why she said you gonna do for him like you done for others you think that will find your cousin you just want to feel like a big man now its too late to do what a good man would have done well that dont wash with me i intervened the recriminations would get us nowhere why did you go to him because alice done told me she was working for him now the other one the one she was with before he died she said this new one was gonna take care of her that he was going to find wealthy men for her wealthy men what man would want her after all shed done what man she started to cry again i went to her and handed her a clean tissue then slowly knelt before her well need his name if were to start looking for her i said quietly gmack she said at last he calls himself gmack there was a young white girl too she said she remembered alice but she was calling herself lashan on the street she didnt know where shed gone to gmack said louis ring any bells no last i heard she was with a pimp called free billy looks like things changed louis stood and helped martha from her chair we need to get you something to eat you need to rest up now she took his hand and gripped it tightly in her own you find her for me shes in trouble i can feel it you find her and bring her back to me the fat man stood at the lip of the bathtub his name was brightwell and he was very very old far older than he seemed sometimes he acted like a man who had recently woken from a deep sleep but the mexican whose name was garcia knew better than to question him about his origins he recognized only that brightwell was a thing to be obeyed and to be feared he had seen what the man had done to the woman had watched through the glass as brightwells mouth closed on hers it had seemed to him that some grave knowledge had shown itself in the womans eyes at that moment even as she weakened and died as though she realized what was about to occur as her body failed her at last how many others had he taken in this way garcia wondered his lips against theirs as he waited for their essence to pass from them and even if what garcia suspected of brightwell was not true what kind of man would believe such a thing of himself the stench was terrible as the chemicals worked on the remains but brightwell made no attempt to cover his face the mexican stood behind him the lower half of his face concealed by a white mask what will you do now said garcia brightwell spit into the tub then turned his back on the disintegrating body i will find the other one and i will kill her before she died this one spoke of a man she thought he might come for her i know i heard her call his name she was supposed to be alone nobody cared we were misinformed but perhaps nobody cares anyway brightwell swept by him leaving him with the decaying body of the girl garcia did not follow him brightwell was wrong but garcia did not have the courage to confront him further on the issue no woman as death approached would cry out over and over again a name that meant nothing to her someone did care and he would come ii he that hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune francis bacon essays chapter three the celebration of sams christening continued around us i could hear people laughing and the startled hiss of bottles opening somewhere a voice began singing a song it sounded like rachels father who tended to sing when he was in his cups frank was a lawyer one of those hearty hailfellowwellmet types who liked to be the center of attention wherever he went the kind who thought that he brightened up peoples lives by being loud and unintentionally intimidating i had watched him in action at a wedding forcing shy women to dance on the grounds that he was trying to take them out of their shells even as they trembled awkwardly across the dance floor like newborn giraffes casting longing glances back at their chairs i supposed it could be said of him that he had a good heart but unfortunately he didnt have a sensitivity toward others to go with it aside from any concerns he might have had about his daughter frank seemed to regard my presence at such convivial events as a personal affront as though at any moment i were going to burst into tears or beat someone up or otherwise rain on the parade that frank was trying so hard to organize we tried not to be alone together to be honest it wasnt too difficult as we both put our hearts into the effort joan was the strong one in the marriage and a soft word from her could usually make frank take things down a notch she was a kindergarten teacher and an oldstyle liberal democrat who took very personally the way the country had changed in recent years under both republicans and democrats unlike frank she rarely spoke about her worries for her daughter directly at least not to me only occasionally usually when we were leaving them at the end of another sometimes awkward sometimes mildly pleasant visit would she take me lightly by the hand and whisper look after her wont you and i would assure her that i would take care of her daughter even as i looked into her eyes and saw her desire to believe me collide with her fear that i would be unable to fulfill that promise i wondered if like the missing alice there was a taint upon me a wound left by the past that would somehow always find a way to infect the present and the future i had tried in recent months to discover a means of neutralizing the threat mainly by declining offers of work that sounded like they could involve any serious form of risk my recent evening with jackie garner being the honorable exception the trouble was that any job that was worth doing necessitated risk of some kind and so i was spending time on cases that were progressively sapping my will to live i had tried to walk this path before but i was not living with rachel when i followed it and i did not last long upon it before i found the lure of the dark woods impossible to ignore now a woman had come to my door and she had brought with her her own pain and the misery of another it was possible that a simple explanation would arise for her daughters disappearance there was little merit in ignoring the realities of alices existence her life at the point was dangerous in the extreme and her habit made her more vulnerable still the women who worked those streets disappeared regularly some were fleeing their pimps or other violent men some tried to leave the life before it consumed them entirely sick of robbery and rape but few of those women succeeded and most trudged back to the alleys and the parking lots with their hopes of escape entirely gone the women tried to look out for one another and the pimps monitored their movements too if only to protect their investments but these were gestures and little more if someone was determined to hurt one of these women then he would succeed we brought louiss aunt into the kitchen and entrusted her to the care of one of rachels relatives soon she was eating chicken and pasta and sipping lemonade in a comfortable chair in the living room when louis went to check on her a little later he found her asleep exhausted by all that she had tried to achieve for her daughter walter cole joined us he knew something of louiss past and suspected more he was more knowledgeable about angel as angel had the kind of criminal record that merited a sizable file all to itself although its details pertained to the relatively distant past i had asked louis if we could involve walter and he acquiesced albeit reluctantly louis wasnt the trusting kind and he most certainly did not like involving the police in his affairs nevertheless walter although retired had connections with the nypd that i no longer had and was on better terms with serving officers than i was admittedly that wasnt difficult there were those in the department who suspected that i had blood on my hands and would dearly have liked to call me to account for it cops on the street were less problematical for me but walter still had the respect of those higher up who might be in a position to offer assistance if it was needed youll go back to the city tonight i asked louis he nodded i want to find me that gmack i hesitated before i spoke i think you should wait louiss head tilted slightly and his right hand slapped lightly against the arm of his chair he was a man of few unnecessary movements and this pretty much qualified as an explosion of emotion why would you think that he said evenly this is what i do i reminded him you go in there all fired up with your guns blazing and everybody with even a passing concern for their own personal safety will disappear whether they know you or not if he gets away from you well need to tear the city apart to find him and well waste valuable time doing it we know nothing about this guy we need to change that before we go after him youre thinking about revenge for what he did to the woman in there that can come later what concerns us is her daughter i want you to hold off there was a risk involved in doing this gmack now knew that someone was asking questions about alice assuming that martha was right and something bad had befallen her then the pimp had two options he could sit tight plead ignorance and tell the women under him to do the same or he could run i just hoped that his nerve held until we got to him my guess was that it would he was new since louis knew nothing of him and young which meant that he was probably arrogant enough to consider himself a playa on the street he had managed to establish some kind of operation at the point he would be reluctant to abandon it until it became absolutely necessary to do so there was a long silence as louis considered his options how long he said i looked to walter twentyfour hours he said by then i should have what you need then well move on him tomorrow night i said we asked louis we i said he locked eyes with me this is personal he said i understand we need to be clear on that you got your way of doing things and i respect that but your conscience got no part to play in this you start doubting i want you to walk away that goes for everyone his eyes flicked momentarily toward walter i could sense that walter was about to respond so i reached out and touched his arm and he relaxed slightly walter would not involve himself in anything that violated his own strict moral code even without the badge walter was still a cop and a good one he had no need to justify himself to louis nothing more was said we were done i told walter to use the office phone and he began making some calls louis went to wake martha so that he could bring her back to new york with him angel joined me at the front door does she know about you two i asked ive never met her before said angel tell you the truth i wasnt even sure that the family existed i figured someone bred him in a cage then released him into the wild but i think shes smart if she doesnt know now shell guess soon enough then well see we watched as rachel walked two of her friends to their car she was beautiful i loved the way that she carried herself her poise her grace i felt something tear inside me like a weakness in a wall that slowly begins to expand threatening the strength and stability of the whole she wont like it said angel i owe louis i replied angel almost laughed you got no debt to him or to me maybe you feel like you do but we dont see it that way you have a family now you have a woman who loves you and a daughter who depends on you dont screw it up i dont intend to i know what i have then why are you doing this what could i tell him that i wanted to do this that i needed to do this it was part of the reason i knew maybe also in some low hidden part of myself i wanted to force them away to hasten what i saw as an inevitable end but there was one more element one that i could not explain to angel or to rachel or even to myself i felt it as soon as i saw the cab moving along the road drawing slowly closer and closer to the house i felt it as i watched the woman step onto the gravel in our drive i felt it as she told her story trying to hold back the tears but desperate not to show weakness in front of strangers she was gone alice was gone and wherever she now was she would never walk through this world as she once did i couldnt say how i knew it any more than martha could explain her sense that her daughter was at risk to begin with this woman filled with courage and love was brought here for a reason there was a connection and it would not be denied i had learned this from bitter experience the troubles of others that found their way to my door were meant for my intervention and could not be ignored i dont know i said i just know that it has to be done gradually most of the guests slipped away they seemed to take with them whatever gaiety they had brought leaving none behind in our house rachels parents as well as her sister were staying the night with us walter and lee were due to spend a couple of days with us too but marthas visit had caused the abandonment of that plan and they were already on their way home so that walter could talk to cops in person if necessary i was clearing up outside when frank wolfe cornered me he was taller than i and bulkier hed played football in high school and there were colleges sufficiently impressed by him to consider offering him a scholarship but vietnam intervened frank didnt even wait for the draft he was a man who believed in duty and responsibility joan was already pregnant when he left although neither of them knew it at the time his son curtis was born while he was in country and a daughter followed two years later frank won some medals but he never spoke about how he came by them when curtis who had become a deputy with the county sheriff s office was killed during a bank raid he didnt disintegrate or descend into selfpity the way some men might have done but instead held his family close to him binding them to him so that they would have him to lean upon so that they would not fall there was much that was admirable about frank wolfe but we were too dissimilar ever to manage more than a few civil words to each other frank had a beer in his hand but he wasnt drunk i had heard him talking to his wife earlier and they had witnessed marthas arrival and the conclave that resulted i figured frank had subsequently slowed down on the booze either of his own volition or at his wifes instigation i picked up some paper plates and threw them into the garbage bag still amazed that the weather was mild enough to allow guests to find their way outside and relieved that i had cleared the lawn of snow a day earlier frank watched me but didnt move to lend a hand everything okay frank i said i was going to ask you the same thing there was no point in brushing him off he hadnt become a good lawyer by lacking persistence i finished clearing the plates from the garden table tied up the garbage bag and went to work on the empty bottles with a new bag they made a satisfying clink as they hit the bottom im doing my best frank i said softly i didnt want to have this discussion with him not now and not ever but it was upon us with respect i dont think you are you got duties now responsibilities i smiled despite myself there were those two words again they defined frank wolfe he would probably have them inscribed on his gravestone i know that so you got to live up to them he tried to emphasize his point by waggling the beer bottle at me it diminished him somehow making him appear less like a concerned father and more like a garrulous drunk listen this thing you do its got rachel worried its always got her worried and its put her at risk you dont put the people you love at risk a man just doesnt do that frank was trying his best to be reasonable with me but he was already getting under my skin maybe because all that he was saying was true look there are other ways that you can use the skills you have he said im not saying give up on it entirely i got contacts i do a lot of work with insurance companies and theyre always looking for good investigators it pays well better than what you earn now thats for sure i can ask around make some calls i found myself hurling the bottles into the bag with more force i took a deep breath to rein myself in and tried to drop the next one as gently as i could i appreciate the offer frank but i dont want to work as an insurance investigator frank had run out of reasonable so he was forced to uncork something a little more potent his voice rose well you sure as hell cant keep doing what you do now what the hell is wrong with you cant you see whats happening you want the same thing to happen a he stopped abruptly but it was too late it was out now it lay black and bloody on the grass between us i was suddenly very very tired the energy drained from my body and i dropped the sack of bottles on the ground i leaned against the table and lowered my head there was a shard of sharp wood against the palm of my right hand i pressed down steadily upon it and felt skin and flesh give way beneath the pressure frank shook his head his mouth opened then closed again without uttering a word he was not a man given to apologies anyway why should a man apologize for telling the truth he was right everything that he had said was right and the terrible thing was that frank and i were closer in spirit than he realized we had both buried children and both of us feared more than anything else a repetition of that act had i chosen to do so i could have spoken at that moment i could have told him about jennifer about the sight of the small white coffin disappearing beneath the first clods of earth about organizing her clothes and her shoes so that they could be passed on to children still living about the appalling sense of absence that followed of the gaping holes in my being that could never be filled of how i could not walk down a street without being reminded of her by every passing child and frank would have understood because in every young man fulfilling his duty he saw his absent son and in that brief truce some of the tension between us might have been erased forever but i did not speak i was retreating from them all and the old resentments were coming to the fore a guilty man confronted by the selfrighteousness of others will plead bitter innocence or find a way to turn his guilt upon his accusers go to your family frank i told him were done here and i gathered up the garbage and left him in the evening darkness rachel was in the kitchen when i returned making coffee for her parents and trying to clean up some of the mess left on the table i started to help her it was the first time we had been alone since we had returned from the church rachels mother came in to offer help but rachel told her that we could take care of it her mother tried to insist mom were fine said rachel and there was an edge to her voice that caused joan to beat a hasty retreat pausing only to give me a look that was equal parts sympathy and blame rachel used the blade of a knife to begin scraping the food from a plate into the trash can the plate had a dark blue pattern upon its rim although it wouldnt have it for much longer if rachel continued to scratch at it so whats going on she asked she didnt look at me as she spoke i could ask you the same thing what does that mean you were kind of hard on angel and louis today werent you you hardly spoke a word to them while they were here in fact youve hardly spoken a word to me maybe if you hadnt spent the afternoon cloistered in your office we might have found time to speak it was a fair criticism although we had been in the office for less than an hour im sorry something came up rachel slammed the plate down on the edge of the sink a small blue chip flew from the rim and was lost on the floor what do you mean something came up its your daughters fucking christening the voices in the living room went quiet when the conversation picked up again it sounded muted and strained i moved toward her rach i began she raised her hands and backed away dont just dont i couldnt move my hands felt awkward and useless i didnt know what to do with them i settled for putting them behind my back and leaning against the wall it was as close as i could come to a gesture of surrender without raising them above my head or exposing my neck to the blade i didnt want to fight with rachel it was all too fragile the slightest misstep and we would be surrounded by the fragments and shards of our relationship i felt my right hand stick to the wall when i looked down there was blood upon it left by the splinter cut what did that woman want said rachel her head was down loose strands of hair falling over her cheeks and eyes i wanted to see her face clearly i wanted to push back her hair and touch her warm skin like this her features hidden she reminded me too much of another shes louiss aunt her daughter has gone missing in new york i think she came to louis as a last resort did he ask you for help no i offered to help what does she do her daughter she was a street prostitute and an addict her disappearance wont be a priority for the cops so someone else will have to look for her rachel ran her hands through her hair in frustration this time she did not try to stop me as i moved to hold her instead she allowed me to press her head gently to my chest it will just take a couple of days i said walter has made some calls we have a lead on her pimp it may be that shes safe somewhere or in hiding sometimes women in the life drop out for a time you know that slowly her arms reached around my back and held me was she whispered what you said was she was a prostitute its just the way that i phrased it her head moved against me in denial of the lie no its not you know dont you i dont understand how you can tell but i think you just know when theres no hope how can you carry that with you how can you take the strain of that knowledge i said nothing im frightened she said thats why i didnt talk to angel and louis after the christening im frightened of what they represent when we spoke about them being godfathers to sam before she was born it was like well it was like it was a joke not that i didnt want them to do it or that i didnt mean it when i agreed but it seemed like no harm could come of it but today when i saw them there i didnt want them to have anything to do with her not in that way and at the same time i know that each of them without a second thought would lay down his life to save sam theyd do the same for you or for me its justi feel that they bring trouble i said yes she whispered they dont mean to but they do it follows them then i asked the question that i had been afraid to ask and do you think that it follows me too i loved her for her answer even as another fissure appeared in all that we had yes she said i think those in need find you but with them come those who cause misery and hurt her arms gripped me tighter and her nails dug sharply into my back and i love you for the fact that it pains you to turn away i love you for wanting to help them and ive seen the way youve been these last weeks ive seen you after you walked away from someone you thought you could help she was talking about ellis chambers from camden who had approached me a week earlier about his son neil chambers was involved with some men in kansas city and they had their hooks pretty deep in him ellis couldnt afford to buy him out of his trouble so somebody was going to have to intervene on neils behalf it was a muscle job but taking it would have separated me from sam and rachel and would also have involved a degree of risk neil chamberss creditors were not the kind of individuals who took kindly to being told how to run their affairs and they were not sophisticated in their methods of intimidation and punishment in addition kansas city was way off my turf and i told ellis that he might find the men involved were more amenable to some local intervention than the involvement of a stranger i made some inquiries and passed on some names to him but i could see that he was disappointed for better or worse id gained a reputation as a goto guy ellis had expected more than a referral somewhere inside i also believed that he deserved more you did it for me and for sam said rachel but i could tell the effort that it caused you you see thats the thing of it whichever way you turn there will be pain for you i just didnt know how much longer you could keep turning away from those who reached out to you i guess now i know it ended today rachel shes family to louis what else could i do she smiled sadly if it hadnt been her it would have been someone else you know that i kissed the top of her head she smelled of our child your dad tried to talk to me outside i bet you both enjoyed that it was great were considering going on vacation together i kissed her again what about us i asked are we okay i dont know she said i love you but i dont know with that she released me and left me alone in the kitchen i heard her climb the stairs and there came the creak of the door to the bedroom where sam lay sleeping i knew that she was looking down upon her listening to her breathe watching over her so that no harm would come to her that night i heard the voice of the other calling from beneath our window but i did not go to the glass and behind her words i discerned a chorus of voices whispering and weeping i covered my ears against them and squeezed my eyes tightly closed in time sleep came and i dreamed of a leafless gray tree its sharp branches curving inward thick with thorns and within the prison that they formed brown mourning doves fluttered and cried a low whistling rising from their wings as they struggled and blood upon their feathers where the thorns had pierced their flesh and i slept as a new name was carved upon my heart chapter four the spyhole motel was an unlikely oasis a resting place for travelers who had almost entirely despaired of ever finding respite before the mexican border perhaps they had skirted yuma tired of lights and people longing to see the desert stars in all their glory and had instead found themselves facing mile upon mile of stone and sand and cactus bordered by high mountains they could not name even to stop briefly by the roadside was to invite thirst and discomfort and maybe the attentions of the border patrol for the coyotes ran their illegals along these routes and the migras were always on the lookout for those who might be colluding with them in the hope of making some easy money no it was better not to stop here wiser to keep moving in the hope of finding comfort elsewhere and that was what the spyhole promised a sign on the highway pointed south advising the weary of the proximity of a soft bed cold sodas and functioning airconditioning the motel was simple and unadorned apart from a vintage illuminated sign that buzzed in the night like a great neon bug the spyhole consisted of fifteen rooms set in a wide n shape with the office at the end of the left arm the walls were a light yellow although without closer examination it was difficult to say whether this was their original color or if constant exposure to the sands had resulted in their transformation to that hue as though the desert would tolerate the motels presence only if it could lay some claim to it by absorbing it into the landscape it lay in a natural alcove a gap between mountains known as the devils spyhole the mountains gave the motel a little shade although barely steps from its office the heat of the desert winds blew through the devils spyhole itself like the blast from the open door of an incinerator a sign outside the office warned visitors not to wander from the motels property it was illustrated with snakes and spiders and scorpions and a drawing of a cloud puffing superheated air toward the black stick figure of a man the drawing might almost have been comical were it not for the fact that blackened figures were regularly found on the sands not far from the motel illegals mostly tempted by the deceptive promise of great wealth the motel derived as much of its custom from referrals as from those who saw its sign in passing on the highway there was a truck stop ten miles west harrys best rest with an allnight diner a convenience store showers and bathrooms and space for up to fifty rigs there was also a noisy cantina frequented by specimens of human life that were barely one step up from the predatory desert creatures outside the truck stop with its lights and noise and promise of food and company sometimes attracted those who had no business being there travelers who were merely tired and lost and seeking a place to rest harrys best rest was not meant for them and its staff had learned that it was prudent to send them on their way with a suggestion that they seek some comfort at the spyhole harrys best rest was owned by a man named harry dean who occupied a role that would have been familiar to his predecessors on the border a century before harry walked a thin line doing just enough to satisfy the law and keep the migras and smokies from his door which in turn usually enabled him to stay on the right side of those individuals mired in criminality who frequented the shadier corners of his establishment harry paid some people off and was in turn paid off he turned a blind eye to the whores who serviced the truckers in their rigs or in the little cabanas to the rear and to the dealers who supplied the drivers with uppers and other narcotics to keep them awake or bring them down as the need arose as long as they kept their supply off the premises and safely stored amid the tangles of junk in the back of their assorted pickups and automobiles the smaller vehicles interspersed among the huge rigs like bottomfeeders following the big predators it was am on monday and the best rest had quietened down some as harry helped miguel his bar manager to clean up behind the counter and restock the beer and liquor technically the cantina was no longer open for business although anyone who wanted a drink at that time of night could still be served at the diner next door nevertheless men continued to sit in the shadows nursing their shots some talking together some alone they were not the kind of men who could be told to leave they would fade into the night in their own time and of their own accord until then harry would not trouble them a connecting doorway led from the cantina into the diner a sign on the diner side announced that the bar was now closed but the main door to the cantina remained unlocked for the present harry heard it open and looked up to see a pair of men enter both were white one was tall and in his early forties with graying hair and some scarring to his right eye he wore a blue shirt a blue jacket and jeans that were a little long at the ends but was otherwise largely unremarkable in appearance the other man was almost as tall as his companion but obscenely fat his enormous belly hanging pendulously between his thighs like a great tongue lolling from an open mouth his body appeared out of proportion to his legs which were short and slightly bowed as though they had struggled for many years to support the load they were required to bear and were at last buckling under the strain the fat mans face was perfectly round and quite pale but his features were very delicate green eyes enclosed by long dark lashes a thin unbroken nose and a long mouth with full dark lips that were almost feminine but any passing resemblance to traditional notions of facial beauty were undone by his chin and the tumorous distended neck in which it lost itself it rolled over his shirt collar purple and red like an intimation of the gut that lay farther down harry was reminded of an old walrus that he had once seen in a zoo a great beast of blubber and distended flesh on the verge of collapse this man by contrast was far from the grave despite his bulk he walked with a strange lightness seemingly gliding across the sticky shellstrewn floor of the cantina harrys shirt was streaked with sweat even though the ac was blasting yet the fat mans face was entirely dry and his white shirt and gray jacket appeared untouched by perspiration he was balding but his remaining hair was very black and cut short against his skull harry found himself mesmerized by the mans appearance the mix of terrible ugliness and near beauty of obscene bulk and irreconcilable grace then the spell was broken and harry spoke hey said harry were closed the fat man paused the sole of his right foot poised just above the floor harry could see an unbroken peanut just beneath his shoe leather the foot began to complete its descent the shell started to flatten beneath the weight and harry was suddenly confronted by the face of the fat man inches from his own staring straight at him then before he could even begin to take in his presence the fat man was to his left then to his right all the time whispering in a language harry couldnt understand the words an unintelligible mass of sibilance and occasional harsh consonants their precise meaning lost to him but their intimation clear stay out of my way stay out of my way or youll be sorry the fat mans face was a blur his body zipping from side to side his voice an insistent throbbing inside harrys head harry felt nauseous he wanted it to stop why wasnt anyone intervening on his behalf where was miguel harry reached out a hand in an effort to support himself against the bar and the movement around him suddenly ceased harry heard the peanut shell crack the fat man was where he had previously been fifteen or twenty feet from the bar his colleague behind him both were looking at harry and the fat man was smiling slightly privy to a secret that only he and harry now shared stay out of my way in a far corner harry saw a hand raised octavio who took care of the whores absorbing a cut of their income in return for protection and passing on a little of it to harry in turn this was none of harrys business he nodded once and returned to cleaning off the overspill from the beer taps he managed to complete his task then slipped quietly into the little bathroom behind the bar where he sat on the toilet seat for a time his hands trembling before he vomited violently into the sink when he returned to the cantina the fat man and his partner were gone only octavio was waiting for him he didnt look much better than harry felt you okay he asked harry swallowed he could still taste bile in his mouth better we forget you understand said octavio yeah i get you octavio gestured to the bar pointing out the bottle of brandy on the top shelf harry took the bottle and poured the alcohol into a highball glass he figured that octavio didnt need a snifter not this time the mexican put a twenty on the bar you need one too he said harry poured himself a glass keeping his hand heavy there was a girl said octavio not local black mexican i remember said harry she was here tonight shes new figured her for one of yours she wont be back said octavio harry lifted the glass to his lips but found that he couldnt drink the taste of bile was returning vera that was the girls name or the name she had given when harry had asked few of these women used their real name for business hed spoken to her once or twice just in passing hed seen her maybe three times in all but no more than that shed seemed pretty nice for a whore okay said harry okay said octavio and like that the girl was gone there were only three rooms occupied at the spyhole motel in the first room a young couple on a road trip to mexico were bickering still argumentative after a long uncomfortable journey soon they would descend into uneasy prickly silence until the boy made the first move toward reconciliation heading out into the desert night and returning with sodas from the machine by the office he would place one of the cans against the small of the girls back and she would react with a shiver he would kiss her and tell her that he was sorry she would kiss him back they would drink and soon the heat and the arguments would appear to be forgotten in the next room a man sat in his vest upon a bed watching a mexican game show he had paid for his room in cash he could have stayed in yuma for he had business there in the morning but his face was known and he disliked staying in the city for longer than he had to instead he sat in the remote motel and watched couples hug each other as they won prizes worth less than the money in his wallet the last room on this block of the motel was taken by another solo traveler she was young barely into her twenties and she was running they called her vera in harrys best rest but those who were seeking her knew her as sereta neither name was real but it no longer mattered to her what she was called she had no family now or none that cared in the beginning she had sent money home to her mother in ciudad juarez supplementing the meager income she gleaned from her work in one of the big maquiladoras on avenida tecnologico sereta and her older sister josefina had worked there too until that november day when everything changed for them when she called home sereta would tell lilia her mother that she was working as a waitress in new york lilia did not question her even though she knew that her daughter before she left for the north had frequently been seen leaving the gated communities of the campestre juarez where the wealthy americans lived and the only local women admitted to such places were servants and whores then in november the body of seretas sister josefina was one of eight found in an overgrown cotton field near the sitio colosio valle mall the bodies were badly mutilated and the protests of the poor increased in volume for these were not the first young women to die in this place and there were stories told of wealthy men behind barred gates who had now added killing for pleasure to their list of recreations seretas mother told her to leave and not to come back she never mentioned the campestre juarez to her daughter and the rich men in their black cars but she knew one year later lilia too was dead taken by a cancer that her daughter believed was a physical manifestation of pain and grief and now sereta was alone in new york she had found a kindred spirit in alice but that friendship too had been sundered alice should have stayed with her but the grip of the sickness was tight upon her and she had made her own choice to remain in the big city sereta instead had headed south she knew these desert places and how they worked she wanted those who were pursuing her to think that she had crossed into mexico instead she planned to skirt the border making for the west coast where she hoped to disappear for a time until she could figure out her next move she knew that what she had was valuable after all she had listened to a man die for it sereta too was watching television but the volume was down low she found the glow comforting but did not wish the babble to disturb her thoughts money was the problem money was always the problem she had been forced to run so suddenly that there was no time to plan no time to assemble what few funds she had to her name she had a friend bring her car to her then drove away putting as much space between herself and the city as possible shed heard about the best rest in the past it was a place where nobody asked too many questions and where a girl could make some money quickly then move on without any further obligation as long as she paid her cut to the right people she took a room at the spyhole negotiating a pretty good deal and had nearly two thousand dollars put away after just a few days thanks in part to a particularly generous tip from a truck driver whose sexual tastes messy but harmless she had indulged the night before soon she would move along maybe just one more night though she thought even as unbeknownst to her her existence had already bound itself to the lives of those who had taken her sister for far to the north the mexican named garcia might have smiled familiarly at the mention of josefinas name recalling her final moments as he busied himself with the remains of another young woman there was only one other person on the motel property he was a slim young man of mexican descent and he was seated behind the reception desk in the office reading a book the book was entitled the devils highway and it told of the deaths of fourteen mexicans who had attempted to cross the border illegally not many miles from where the motel lay the book made the young man angry even as he felt a sense of relief that his parents had made a good life here and that such a death was not destined to be his it was almost am and he was about to lock the door and retire to the back room for some sleep when he saw the two white men approach the office he had not heard their car pull up and supposed that they must have deliberately parked some way off already he was on his guard for that made no sense to him there was a gun beneath the counter but he had never had cause even to show it now that most people paid by credit card motels provided poor pickings for thieves one of the men was tall and dressed in blue the heels of his cowboy boots clicked upon the tiles as he entered the office his companion was absurdly corpulent the clerk whose name was ruiz believed that he had never before seen a man who looked quite so unhealthy and he had seen many fat americans in his young life the fat mans belly hung so far between his thighs that ruiz guessed that he must have been obliged to lift it up each time he made water he carried in his hand a tan straw hat with a white band and wore a light jacket over a white shirt and tan pants his shoes were brown and polished to a high sheen how you doing tonight asked ruiz the thin man answered were doing well you full up nah when were full we turn on the no vacancies sign out on the road to save folks a trip you can do that from here asked the thin man he sounded genuinely interested sure said ruiz he pointed to a box upon the wall lined with switches each was carefully labeled with a handwritten sticker i just flick a switch amazing said the thin man fascinating said his colleague speaking for the first time unlike the other man he did not sound interested his voice was soft and slightly higher in pitch than a mans voice should have been so would you like a room asked ruiz he was tired and wanted to get the two men booked in and their cards processed so that he could catch up on his sleep he also he realized wanted to get them out of the office the fat man smelled peculiar he hadnt noticed any stench from the one in blue but the tubby guy had an unusual body odor he smelled earthy and ruiz involuntarily found himself picturing pale worms breaking through damp clods of dirt and black beetles scurrying for the shelter of stones we may need more than one replied blue two how many rooms do you have fifteen altogether but three are occupied three guests four ruiz stopped talking there was something wrong here blue was no longer even listening instead he had picked up ruizs book and was looking at the cover luis urrea he read the devils highway he turned to his companion look he said displaying the book to him maybe we should buy a copy the fat man glanced at the cover i know the route he said drily if you want it just take that one and save some money ruiz was about to say something when the fat man struck him in the throat slamming him back against the wall ruiz experienced a sense of pain and constriction as small delicate parts of himself were crushed by the blow he was having trouble breathing he tried to form words but they would not come he fell against the wall and a second blow came he slid slowly to the floor his face was turning dark as he suffocated his windpipe entirely ruined ruiz began to claw at his mouth and throat he could hear a clicking noise like the ticking of a clock counting down his final moments the two men did not appear particularly interested in his sufferings the fat man walked around the desk stepping carefully over ruiz the dying man again caught the smell of him as he switched on the no vacancies sign out on the highway his companion meanwhile flicked through that nights guest registration cards one couple in two he told the fat man one male in three the name sounds mexican one woman in twelve registered under the name vera gooding the fat man didnt acknowledge him he was now standing over ruiz watching blood and spittle trail from the corners of his mouth ill take the couple he said you take the mexican he squatted down beside ruiz it was a surprisingly graceful movement like the dipping of a swans head he extended his right hand and brushed the hair from the young mans brow there was a mark on the underside of the fat mans forearm it looked like a twinpronged fork recently burned into the flesh the fat man turned ruizs head from left to right do you think we should bring it back for our mexican friend asked blue he works well with bone too much trouble said the fat man his tone was dismissive the fat man gripped ruizs hair turning his head slightly then leaned in close to him his mouth opened slightly and ruiz saw a pink tongue and teeth that tapered to blunt ends ruizs eyes were bulging and his face was purple he spit red fluid and as he did so the fat mans lips touched his his mouth closing entirely upon ruizs his hand clasping the young mans face and chin keeping his jaws apart the mexican tried to struggle but he could not fight both the fat man and the end that was coming a word flashed in his head and he thought brightwell what is brightwell his grip upon the fat mans shoulder loosened his legs relaxed and the fat man drew away from him and stood you have blood on your shirt blue told brightwell he sounded bored danny quinn watched his girlfriend as she carefully applied the small brush to her toenails the polish was a mix of purple and red it made her look as though her toes were bruised but danny decided to keep this opinion to himself he was content to bask for a time in the afterglow of their lovemaking taking in her concentration and her poise at times like these danny loved melanie deeply he had cheated on her and would probably cheat on her again although he prayed each night for the strength to remain faithful he wondered sometimes at what would happen if she found out about his other life danny liked women but he distinguished between sex and lovemaking sex meant little to him apart from the satiation of an urge it was like scratching an itch if his right hand was broken and his back was itchy then hed use his left to deal with it all things being equal he would prefer to use his right hand but an itch was an itch right if melanie wasnt aroundand her work with the bank sometimes required her to be away from home for two or three daysthen danny would go elsewhere for his pleasure mostly he told the women involved that he was single some of them didnt even ask one or two had fallen for him a little and that had created problems but he had worked them out danny had even used hookers on occasion the sex was different with them but he did not consider sex with hookers as cheating on melanie there was no emotion involved at all and danny reasoned that without emotion there was no real betrayal of his feelings for melanie it was clinical and he always practiced safe sex even with the ones who offered a little extra deep down danny wanted to be the person that melanie thought he was he tried to tell himself each time he strayed that this would be the last sometimes he could go for weeks even months without being with another woman but eventually he would find himself alone for a time or in a strange city and the urge to trawl would take him but he did love melanie and if he could have turned back the clock of his life and made his choices againhis first hooker and the shame he felt afterward the first time he cheated on someone and the guilt that came with ithe believed that he would live his life differently and that he would be a better happier man as a result i will start again he lied to himself it was like alcoholism or any other addiction you had to take things one day at a time and when you fell off the wagon well you just got right back up again and started counting from one he reached out to stroke melanies back and heard a knock at the door melanie gardner was afraid that danny was cheating on her she didnt know why she thought it for none of her friends had ever seen him with another woman and she had never found any telltale signs on his clothes or in his pockets once while he was sleeping she had tried to read his emails but he was scrupulous about deleting both sent and received mail apart from those that had to do with his business there were a lot of women in his address book but she did not recognize any of the names anyway danny was regarded as one of the best electricians in town and in her experience it was women who tended to make most of the business calls to danny probably because their husbands were too ashamed to admit that there was something around the house that they could not repair themselves now as she sat on the bed the warmth of him gradually fading she felt the urge to confront him she wanted to ask him if he was seeing someone else if he had ever been with another woman in the time that they had been together she wanted to look in his eyes as he answered because she believed that she would be able to tell if he was lying she loved him she loved him so much that she was afraid to ask for if he lied she would know and it would break her heart and if he told her what she feared was the truth then that would also break her heart the tension she had been feeling had broken through at last in a dumb argument about music earlier in the evening and then they had made love even though melanie did not really want to it had allowed her to delay the confrontation nothing more just as painting her toenails had suddenly seemed a matter of great urgency melanie painstakingly filled in the last patch of clear nail upon her little toe then placed the brush back in the polish turning slightly as she did so she saw danny reaching out for her she opened her mouth to speak at last and heard a knock at the door edgar certaz thumbed idly at the remote control flashing through the channels there were so many that by the time he had finished flicking through them all he had forgotten if there were any of the earlier ones that merited his attention he settled at last upon a western he thought it very slow three men were waiting for a train the train came a man with a harmonica got off he killed the three men an italian played an irishman and an american actor whose face was familiar to him appeared as the villain which threw certaz a little as he had only ever seen the american play good guys there were few mexicans that he could see which was good certaz was tired of seeing peasants in white clutching sombreros as they appealed for help against bandits from gunmen in black as though all mexicans were either victims or cannibals who fed on their own certaz was a middleman an intermediary like the woman in the next room he had connections with juarez and he and his fellow narcotraficantes had been responsible for many deaths in the city his was a dangerous business but he was paid well for his troubles tomorrow he would meet two men and arrange for the delivery of million worth of cocaine for which he and his associates would receive a percent commission if the delivery proceeded without a hitch the next consignment would be considerably larger and his reward commensurately greater certaz would make all of the arrangements but at no point would either drugs or money be in his possession edgar certaz had learned to insulate himself from risk the colombians still controlled the manufacture of cocaine but it was the mexicans who were now the biggest traffickers of the drug in the world the colombians had given them their start in the trade albeit unintentionally by paying mexican smugglers in cocaine instead of cash sometimes up to half of every shipment into the united states went to the mexicans certaz was one of the original mules and had quickly worked his way up to a position of prominence in the juarez cartel controlled by amado carrillo fuentes nicknamed lord of the skies after he pioneered the use of jumbo jets to transport huge shipments of drugs between territories in november a joint raid by mexican and us law enforcement unearthed a mass grave at a desert ranch named la campana near juarez the grave contained two hundred bodies maybe more la campana was once the property of fuentes and his lieutenant alfonso corral olaguez carrillo had died in the summer of following an overdose of anesthesia administered in the course of plastic surgery intended to change his appearance it was rumored that his colombian suppliers envious of his influence had paid off the medics two months later corral was shot and killed at the maxfim restaurant in juarez leading to a bloody turf war headed by carrillos brother vicente the bodies at la campana stored in the narcobunkers that riddled the land included the remains of those who had crossed carrillo among them members of the rival tijuana cartel as well as unfortunate peasants who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time certaz knew this because he had helped to put some of them there the discovery of the bodies had increased the pressure on the mexican dealers forcing them to be ever more careful in their operations and so the need for men with certazs expertise had grown considerably he had survived the investigations and the recriminations and had emerged stronger and more secure than ever before in the movie a woman arrived on a train she was expecting someone to meet her but there was nobody waiting she took a ride out to a homestead where the irishman lay dead on a picnic table alongside his children certaz was bored he pressed his thumb against the remote to kill the picture and heard a knock at the door danny quinn draped a towel around his waist and went to the door who is it he asked police it was a mistake but brightwell was distracted it had been a long trip and he was tired the heat of the day had made him weary and now the comparative cool of the desert night had taken him by surprise danny looked at melanie she took her purse and headed for the bathroom closing the door behind her they had a little weed in a ziploc bag but melanie would just flush it down the john it was a shame to lose it but danny could always get more you got some id said danny he still had not opened the door he looked through the spy hole and saw a fat man with a round face and a weird neck holding up a badge and a laminated identification card come on said the man open up this is just routine were searching for illegals i just need to take a look inside ask you some questions then ill be gone danny swore but relaxed a little he wondered if melanie had already flushed their stash he hoped not he opened the door and smelled something unpleasant he tried to hide his shock at the mans appearance but failed already he knew that he had made a mistake this was no cop you alone asks the fat man my girlfriend is in the bathroom tell her to come out this is all wrong thought danny all wrong hey he said let me have another look at that badge the fat man reached into his jacket pocket when his hand reemerged it was not holding a wallet danny quinn saw a flash of silver and then felt the blade enter his chest the fat man grabbed dannys hair and pushed the blade up and to the left he heard the girls voice calling from the bathroom danny said melanie is everything okay brightwell released his grip on dannys hair and yanked the blade free the boy collapsed onto the floor his body spasmed and the fat man placed his foot upon his stomach to still him had he more time brightwell might have kissed him as he had ruiz but there were more pressing matters to which to attend from the bathroom came the flushing of a toilet but it was being used to mask another sound there was the creak of a window sliding open and a screen being forced brightwell walked to the bathroom and raised his right foot then shattered the lock with the impact edgar certaz heard the knock on the adjoining room seconds after someone commenced knocking on his own door he then discerned a male voice identify himself as a cop claiming to be hunting illegals certaz was not dumb he knew that when the cops came hunting they didnt do it so politely they came hard and fast and in force he also knew that this motel was not on their shit list because it was relatively expensive and well run the sheets were clean and the towels in the bathroom were changed every day it was also far from the main routes used by the illegals any mexican who got this far was not going to check into the spyhole motel for a bath and a porno movie he was going to be sitting in the back of a van headed north or west congratulating himself and his buddies on making it across the desert certaz did not reply to the knock on his door the knock came again open up said a voice this is the police certaz carried a lightweight smith amp wesson mountain gun with a short fourinch barrel he did not possess a license for it while he did not have a criminal record he knew that if he was taken in and fingerprinted his prints would set off alarm bells in local and federal agencies and that he would be a very old man by the time he was released assuming that they did not find an excuse to execute him first so two thoughts crossed edgars mind the first was that if this really was a police raid then he was in trouble the second thought was that if these men were not police then they were still trouble but trouble that could be dealt with he heard a muffled scream from the room next door as brightwell dealt with danny quinns girlfriend you want me to open up decided edgar then ill open up he drew the smith amp wesson walked to the wooden door and began firing blue bucked as the first of the shots hit him in the chest its force diminished slightly by its passage through the door the second took him in the right shoulder as he spun and he grunted loudly as he hit the sand there was no use for silence now he drew his own double eagle and fired from the ground as the door to the motel room opened there was nobody in the gap then certazs gun appeared low down from the left where the mexican was hunched beneath the window blue saw the dark finger tense upon the trigger and prepared for the end shots came but not from the mexican brightwell was at the window firing down at an angle through the glass he shot edgar certaz in the top of the head and the mexican tumbled forward even as two more bullets entered his back blue rose to his feet there was now blood on his shirt too he swayed a little from the back of the motel they heard the sound of someone running the door to the last motel room remained closed but they knew that their quarry was no longer inside go said blue brightwell moved quickly he ran less gracefully than he walked rocking from side to side on his stubby legs but he was still fast he heard a car starting then the engine being gunned seconds later a yellow buick shot around the corner of the motel there was a young woman behind the wheel brightwell fired aiming to the right of the drivers head the windshield was hit but the car kept coming forcing him to throw himself to one side to avoid being struck his next shots took out the tires and blew out the rear window he watched with satisfaction as the buick hit the late edgar certazs truck and came to a sudden halt brightwell got to his feet and approached the ruined car the young woman inside lay dazed in the drivers seat there was blood on her face but otherwise she appeared uninjured good thought brightwell he opened the door and pulled her from the car no sereta whispered please where is it sereta i dont know what brightwell punched her in the nose it broke under the impact i said where is it sereta fell to her knees her hands against her face he could barely understand her when she told him that it was in her purse the fat man reached into the car and retrieved the purse he began tossing the contents onto the ground until he found the small silver box carefully he opened it and examined the piece of yellowed vellum within he looked at it and seemingly content replaced it in the box why did you take it he asked he was genuinely curious sereta was crying she said something but it was muffled by her tears and the hands that she had cupped over her ruined nose brightwell leaned down i cant hear you he said it was pretty said sereta and i didnt have any pretty things brightwell stroked her hair almost tenderly blue was approaching he staggered a little but remained on his feet sereta crawled back against the car trying to stem the bleeding from her nose she looked at blue and he seemed to shimmer for a moment she saw a black emaciated body tattered wings hanging from nodes upon its back and long taloned fingers that clutched feebly at the air the figures eyes were yellow shining in a face that was almost without features apart from a mouth filled with small sharp teeth then the shape before her was once again a man dying upon his feet jesus help me she said jesus lord god help me brightwell kicked her hard in the side of the head and her words ceased he dragged her limp body to the trunk of her car opened it then dumped her inside before walking to his own mercedes and returning with two plastic cans of gas blue leaned against the buick as his colleague approached his eyes lingered for a moment on the gasoline then shifted away dont you want her he said i would taste her words in my mouth said brightwell strange though what is asked blue that she should believe in god and not in us perhaps it is easier to believe in god says blue god promises so much but delivers so little finished brightwell we make fewer promises but we keep them all had sereta been able to see him then blue would have shimmered again before her eyes his companion did not notice he saw blue as he had always seen blue i am fading said blue i know we were careless i was careless it does not matter perhaps i will wander for a time perhaps said brightwell in time we will find you again he sprayed gasoline upon his companion dousing his clothes his hair his skin then poured the remainder upon the interior of the buick he tossed the empty containers onto the backseat then stood before blue goodbye he said goodbye said blue he was almost blinded by the gasoline but he found the open door of the buick and eased himself into the drivers seat brightwell regarded him for a moment then took a zippo from his pocket and watched the flame take life he tossed the lighter into the car and walked away he did not look back not even when the gas tank exploded and the darkness behind him was lit by a new fire as blue passed from this world and was transformed chapter five each of us lives two lives our real life and our secret life in our real life we are what we appear to be we love our husbands or our wives we care for our children each morning we pick up a bag or a briefcase and we do what we must to oil the wheels of our existence we sell bonds we clean hotel rooms we serve beer to the kind of men with whom we would not share our air if we had a choice in the matter we eat our lunch in a diner or on a bench in a park where people walk their dogs and children play in the sunlight we feel a sentimental urge to smile at the animals because of the joy they take in the simplicity of a stroll through green grass or at the children paddling in pools and racing through sprinklers but still we return to our desks or our mops or our bars feeling less happy than we formerly were unable to shake off the creeping sense that we are missing something that there is supposed to be more than this to our lives our real lifeanchored by those twin weights and here they come again our careworn friends duty and responsibility their edges considerately curved the better to fit upon our shoulderspermits us our small pleasures for which we are inordinately grateful come take a walk in the countryside the earth spongy and warm beneath your feet but be aware always of the ticking clock summoning you back to the cares of the city look your husband has made dinner for you lighting the candle that his mother gave you for a christmas gift the one that now makes the dining room smell of mull and spices although it is already midjuly see your wife has been reading cosmo again and in an effort to add a little spice to your waning sex life has for once gone farther than jcpenney for her lingerie and has learned a new trick from the pages of her magazine she had to read it twice just to understand some of the terminology and had to rely on ancient memory to summon up a picture of the sad semitumescent organ that she now proposes to service in this manner so long has it been since any such matters passed between the two of you without the cover of blankets and smothered lights the easier to fantasize about j lo or brad perhaps the girl who takes your order at the sandwich bar or lizas kid from two doors down the one who is just back from college and is now transformed from a geeky little kid with railroad braces into a veritable adonis with white even teeth and tanned muscular legs and in the darkness one upon the other the real life blurs at its margins and the secret life intrudes with a rush and a moan and the flicking tongue of desire for in our secret life we are truly ourselves we look at the pretty woman in marketing the new arrival the one with the dress that falls open when she crosses her legs revealing a pristine expanse of pale thigh and in our secret life we do not see the veins about to break beneath her skin or the birthmark shaped like an old bruise that muddies the beauty of her whiteness she is flawless unlike the one we have left behind that morning thoughts of her new bedroom trick already forgotten for it will be put away as surely as will be the christmas candle and neither trick nor light will see use for many months to come and so we take instead the hand of the new fantasy unsullied by reality and we lead her away and she sees us as we truly are as she takes us inside her and for an instant we live and die within her for she needs no magazine to teach her arcane things in our secret life we are brave and strong and know no loneliness for others take the place of onceloved and oncedesired partners in our secret life we take the other path the one that was offered to us once but from which we shied away we live the existence we were meant to lead the one denied us by husbands and wives by the demands of children by the requirements of petty office tyrants we become all that we were meant to be in our secret life we dream of striking back we point a gun and we pull the trigger and it costs us nothing there is no regret at the wound inflicted the body slumping backward already crumpling as the spirit leaves it and perhaps there is another waiting at that moment the one who tempted us the one who promised us that this is as it was meant to be that this is our destiny and he asks only this one small indulgence that he may place his lips against those of the dying man the fading woman and taste the sweetness of what passes from them so that it flutters briefly like a butterfly in his mouth before he swallows trapping it deep inside him this is all that he asks and who are we to deny him in our secret life our fists pummel and the face that blurs with blood beneath them is the face of everyone who has ever crossed us every individual who has prevented us from becoming all that we might have been and he is beside us as we punish the flesh his ugliness forgiven in return for the great gift that he has given us the freedom that he has offered he is so convincing this blighted man with his distended neck his great sagging stomach his tooshort legs and his toolong arms his delicate features almost lost in his pale puckered skin that to gaze on him from afar is like looking at a full clear moon as a child and believing that one can almost see the face of the man who dwells within it he is brightwell and with sugared words he has fed us the story of our past of how he has wandered for so long searching for those who were lost we did not believe him at first but he has a way of convincing us oh yes those words dissolve inside us their essence coursing through our system their constituent elements in turn becoming part of us we begin to remember we look deep into those green eyes and the truth is at last revealed in our secret life we once were angels we adored and we were adored and when we fell the last great punishment was to mark us forever with all that we had lost and to torment us with the memory of all that once was ours for we are not like the others all has been revealed to us and in that revelation lies freedom now we live our secret life i awoke to find myself alone in our bed sams cradle was empty and silent and the mattress was cold to the touch as though no child had ever been laid upon it i walked to the door and heard noises coming from the kitchen below i pulled on a pair of sweatpants and went downstairs there were shadows moving in the kitchen visible through the halfajar door and i could hear closets being opened and closed a womans voice spoke rachel i thought she has taken sam downstairs to feed her and she is talking to her as she always talks to her sharing her thoughts and hopes with her as she does whatever she must do i saw my hand stretch out and push the door and the kitchen was revealed to me a little girl sat at the end of the kitchen table her head slightly bowed and her long blond hair brushing the wood and the empty plate that sat before her its blue pattern now slightly chipped she was not moving something dripped from her face and fell to the plate expanding redly upon it who are you looking for the voice did not emerge from the girl it seemed to be coming to me both from some distant shadowy place and also from close by whispering coldly in my ear they are back i want them to go i want them to let me be answer me not you i loved you and i will always love you but you are gone no we are here wherever you are so will we be too please i need to put you to rest at last everything is coming to pieces you are tearing me apart she will not stay she will leave you i love her i love her as i once loved you no dont say that soon she will be gone and when she leaves we will still be here we will stay with you and we will lie by you in the darkness a crack appeared in the wall to my right and a fissure opened in the floor the window shattered and fragments of glass exploded inward each shard reflecting trees and stars and moonlight as though the whole world were disintegrating around me i heard my daughter upstairs and i ran taking the stairs two at a time i opened the bedroom door and rachel was standing by the crib sam in her arms where were you i asked i woke up and you werent there she looked at me she was tired and there were stains on her nightshirt i had to change her i took her into the bathroom so she wouldnt wake you rachel laid sam in her cot once she was happy that our daughter was comfortable and settled she prepared to return to bed i stood over sam then leaned down and kissed her lightly on the forehead a small drop of blood fell upon her face i dabbed it away with my thumb then walked to the mirror in the corner there was a small cut below my left eye when i touched it it stung me sharply i stretched the abrasion with my fingers and explored it until i had removed the tiny fragment of glass from within a single tear of blood wept down my cheek are you okay asked rachel i cut myself is it bad i wiped my arm across my face smearing the blood no i lied no its not bad at all i left for new york early the next morning rachel was sitting at the kitchen table in the seat where the night before a young girl had sat blood slowly pooling on the plate before her sam had been awake for two hours and was now crying furiously usually once she was awake and fed she was content simply to watch the world go by walter was a source of particular fascination for her his presence causing sams face to light up whenever he appeared in his turn the dog always remained close to the child i knew that dogs sometimes became disconcerted by the arrival of a new child in a house confused by how this might affect the pecking order some became actively hostile as a result but not walter although he was a young dog he seemed to recognize some duty of protection toward the little being that had entered his territory even the day before during the fuss following the christening it had taken him time to separate himself from sam it was only when he was assured of the presence of rachels mother close by that he appeared to relax and attached himself instead to angel and louis rachels mother was not yet awake while frank had returned to work that morning managing to avoid me entirely before leaving joan had offered to stay with rachel while i was gone rachel had accepted the offer without question and i was grateful to her for that the house was well protected prompted by events in the recent past we had installed a system of motion sensors that alerted us to the presence of anything larger than a fox on our property and cameras kept vigil both on the main gate and the yard and on the marshland behind feeding images to twin monitors in my office the investment was considerable but it was worth it for peace of mind i kissed rachel goodbye its just for a couple of days i said i know i understand ill call you okay she was holding sam against her shoulder trying to comfort her but she would not be comforted i kissed sam too and i felt rachels warmth her breast pressed against my arm i recalled that we had not made love since sam was born and the distance between us seemed even greater as a result then i left them and drove away in silence the pimp named gmack sat in the darkened apartment on coney island avenue that he shared with some of his women he had a place in the bronx closer to the point but he had been using it less and less frequently of late ever since the men came looking for his two whores the arrival of the old black woman had spooked him even more and so he had retreated to his private crib venturing out to the point only at night and keeping a distance from the main streets whenever possible gmack wasnt too sure about the wisdom of living on coney island avenue it was once a dangerous stretch of road even back in the nineteenth century when gang members preyed on the tourists returning from the beaches in the s hookers and pushers colonized the area around foster avenue their presence made clearer by the bright lights of the nearby gas station now there were still whores and dealers but they were a little less obvious and they fought for sidewalk space alongside jews and pakistanis and russians and people from countries of which gmack had never even heard the pakistanis had been having a hard time of it in the aftermath of and gmack had heard that a lot of them were arrested by the feds while others had left for canada or gone back home entirely some of them had even changed their names so it sometimes seemed like there had been a sudden influx of pakistanis named eddie and steve into gmacks world like the plumber hed been forced to call a week or two back after one of the bitches managed to clog up the bowl by flushing something down there about which gmack didnt even want to know the plumber used to be called amir that was what it said on his old card the one gmack had pinned to the refrigerator door with a sinbad magnet but on his new card he was now frank frank shah like that was going to fool anyone even the three numerals the that amir once told him stood for in the name of allah were now gone from beside his address gmack didnt much care either way amir was a good plumber as far as he could tell and he wasnt about to hold a grudge against a man who could do his job especially since he might need his services again sometime but gmack didnt like the smell of the pakistani stores or the food that they sold in their restaurants or the way that they dressed either too neat or too casual he distrusted their ambition and their manic insistence that their kids better themselves gmack suspected that good old frankwhowasreallyamir bored the ass off his kids with his sermons on the american dream maybe pointing to black people like gmack as a negative example even if gmack was a better businessman than amir would ever be and even if gmacks people werent the ones who steered two jets into new yorks tallest buildings gmack had no personal beef with the pakistanis who lived around him food and clothing aside but shit like was everybodys business and frankieamir and his people needed to make it clear just whose side they were on gmacks place was on the top floor of a threestory brownstone with brightly painted cornices between avenues r and s close to the thayba islamic center the thayba was separated from the keshet jewish daycare center by a kids play group which some people might have called progress but which bothered the hell out of gmack these two opposing sides being so close to each other although maybe not as much as the fucking hasidim farther down the avenue in their threadbare black coats their kids all pale with their fag curls it didnt surprise gmack that they always hung around in groups because there wasnt one of them strange jews could handle himself if it came to a fight he listened to two of his whores babbling in the bathroom there were nine in his stable now and three of them slept here in cots that he rented to them as part of their arrangement a couple of the others still lived with their mommas because they had children and needed someone to take care of the kids while they were on the streets and he had rented floor space to the rest in the place over by the point gmack rolled a joint and watched as the youngest of the three women the little white bitch who called herself ellen strolled through the kitchen in her bare feet eating toast with peanut butter smeared untidily across it said she was nineteen but he didnt believe that didnt care none either there were a lot of men liked them younger and she was taking top dollar on the streets gmack had even considered setting her up somewhere private maybe placing an ad in the voice or the press and charging four or five hundred an hour for her hed been about to do it too when all the shit had broken around him and hed been forced to watch his back still he liked to take a little of her honey for himself sometimes so it was good to have her near gmack was twentythree younger than most of his own women he had started out selling weed to schoolkids but he was ambitious and saw himself expanding his business to take in stockbrokers and lawyers and the hungry young white guys who frequented the bars and clubs on weekends looking for something to give them a kick for the long nights to come gmack saw himself in slick threads driving a hookedup car for a long time he dreamed of owning a cutlass supreme with cream leather interior and chrome spokes although the cutlass carried bullshit eighteeninch wheels as standard and gmack knew that a ride was nothing unless it was sitting on twentytwos at the least lexani alloys maybe even jordans if he wanted to rub the other brothers noses in it but a man who was planning on driving a cutlass supreme with twentytwoinch wheels was going to have to do more than push weed on pimplefaced fifteenyearolds so gmack invested in some e along with a little coke and slowly the dough started coming in swift and sweet the problem for gmack was that he didnt have the backbone to enter the big time gmack didnt want to go back to jail he had served six months in otisville on an assault beef when he was barely nineteen and he still woke up at night screaming at the memory gmack was a goodlooking young brother and theyd had a time with him those first days until he tied himself up with the nation of islam who had some big sonsofbitches on their side and who didnt take kindly to those who would try to punk out one of their potential converts gmack spent the rest of his six clinging to the nation like it was driftwood after a shipwreck but when he left he dropped that shit like it was damaged goods they came looking for him asking him questions and shit but gmack was all done with them sure there were threats but gmack was braver on the outside and eventually the nation cut him loose as a bad deal he still occasionally paid lip service to the nation if the need arose when he was around folks who didnt know no better but mostly he just liked the fact that minister farrakhan didnt take shit from whites and that the presence of his followers in their sharp suits and shades scared the hell out of all those middleclass doughboys but if gmack was to raise the money to finance the lifestyle he wanted so badly then it meant trying to score big and he didnt like the idea of holding that much supply if he was caught in possession he was looking at a class a felony and that was fifteen to life right there even if he got lucky and the prosecutor wasnt having troubles at home or suffering from prostate problems and allowed him to plead down to a class b then gmack would spend the rest of his twenties behind bars and fuck anyone who said that you were still a young man when you got out because six months inside had aged gmack more than he liked to think about and he didnt believe that he could survive five to ten years inside didnt matter whether it was no class b class c or even class fucking z what finally confirmed him in the belief that the pushers life was not for him was a raid on his crib by a couple of real badass narcs seemed like theyd turned someone who was even more scared of prison than gmack and gmacks name had come up in the course of the conversation the cops hadnt found nothing though gmack always took the same shortcut onto the streets slipping through the burnedout shell of another threestory behind his own that in turn backed onto a vacant lot there was an old fireplace in there and gmack hid his stash inside it behind a loose brick the cops took him in even though theyd got fresh air in return for their warrant gmack knew they didnt have nothing on him so he kept quiet and waited for them to let him walk it took him three days to work up the courage to go back to his stash and he offloaded it five minutes later for half of what it was worth on the street since then hed kept his distance from drugs and instead found another potential source of income because if gmack didnt know shit about the drug trade he did know about pussy hed had his share and hed never paid for it at least not up front and in cash but he knew there were men out there who would hell he even knew a couple of bitches who were selling it already but they didnt have nobody to look out for them and women like that were in a vulnerable position they needed a man to take care of them and it didnt take long for gmack to convince them that he was just the man to do it he only had to hit one every so often and even then he didnt have to hit her hard and the others just fell in line behind her then that old pimp free billy had died and some of his women had come gmacks way expanding his stable still further looking back he couldnt remember why hed taken on the junkie whore alice most of free billys other girls just used grass maybe a little coke if a john offered it or they struck lucky and managed to hold something back from gmack not that he didnt search them regularly to keep that kind of theft to a minimum junkies were unpredictable and just the look of them could put the johns off but this one she had something aint nobody could deny that she was just on the verge the drugs had taken some of the fat off her leaving her with a body that was just about perfect and a face that gave her the look of one of those ethiopian bitches the ones that the modeling agencies liked on account of their features didnt look so negro what with their slim noses and their coffee complexions plus she was close to sereta the mexican with the touch of black to her and that was one finelooking woman there sereta and alice were free billys girls and they made it clear to him that they came as a pair so gmack had been content to live with the arrangement at least alice or lashan as she called herself on the streets was smart enough to realize that johns didnt like track marks she kept a stash of liquid vitamin e capsules among her possessions and squeezed the contents onto her arm after she shot up to hide the evidence he guessed she shot up in other parts of her body too secret parts but that was her business all gmack cared about was that the marks didnt show and that she kept herself together while she was hooking that was one good thing about heroin users they got the nod for fifteen maybe twenty minutes once the drug kicked in but thirty minutes later they were ready to go they could almost pass for normal then until the drug started wearing off and they got sick again all itchy and antsy mostly alice seemed to have her habit under that kind of control but gmack still figured when he took her on that the junkie didnt have more than a couple of months in her he could see it in her eyes the way the hunger was biting more deeply now the way her hair was slowly turning white but with her looks he could still get good money on her for a time and that was how it was for a couple of weeks but then she started holding back on him and her looks began fading more rapidly than even he had expected as her addiction deepened people sometimes forgot that the shit sold in new york was stronger than just about anywhere else even heroin was about percent pure as against three to five in places like chicago and gmack had heard of at least one junkie who arrived in the city from the sticks scored within an hour of getting there and was dead of an od one hour after that again alice still had that great bone structure but it had become just a little too obvious without a decent cushion of flesh over it and her skin was growing increasingly sallow in complexion as the junk took its toll she was willing to do just about anything for her supply so he sent her out with the worst kinds and she went to them smiling didnt even ask most of them if theyd put a rubber on before she went down she ran out of vitamin e as it cost her money that she needed for junk so she started injecting between her toes and fingers soon gmack realized he would have to cut her loose and shed end up living on the streets toothless and killing herself for tendollar baggies down by the hunts point market then the old guy had come cruising in his car his bigass driver calling the women over as he slowed hed spotted sereta shed offered him alice as well and the two whores had climbed in the back with the withered old freak and headed off once gmack had taken note of his plate didnt make no sense to be taking chances hed talked to the driver too just so that they were all clear on how much this was going to cost and so the whores couldnt lie to him about the take the driver brought them back three hours later and gmack got his money he searched the girls bags and found another hundred in each he let them keep fifty of it told them hed look after the rest seemed like the old guy liked what theyd shown him too because he came back again a week later same girls same arrangement sereta and alice enjoyed it because it got them off the streets and the old man treated them nice he fed them booze and chocolates in his place in queens let them fool around in his big old tub gave them a little extra which gmack very occasionally let slide after all he wasnt no monster it was all nice and easy until the girls disappeared they didnt return from the old mans like they were supposed to gmack didnt worry about them until he got back to his place then an hour or two later he took a call from sereta she was crying and he had trouble calming her down enough to understand what had happened but gradually she managed to tell him that some men had come to the house and started arguing with the old guy the girls were in the upstairs bathroom fixing their hair and reapplying their makeup before heading back to the point the new arrivals started shouting asking him about a silver box they told him they werent leaving without it then luke the old mans driver came in and there was more shouting followed by what sounded like a bag bursting except alice and sereta had spent enough time on the streets to know a gunshot when they heard one after that the men downstairs went to work on the old man and in the course of their efforts he died they started tearing the house apart downstairs first the women heard drawers being opened pottery breaking glass shattering soon they would make their way upstairs and then there would be no hope but suddenly they heard the sound of a car pulling up outside sereta risked a glance out of the window and saw lights flashing private security she whispered to alice they must have set off an alarm somehow it was one man alone he shined a flashlight on the front of the house then tried the doorbell he returned to his vehicle and spoke into the radio somewhere in the house a telephone rang it was the only sound in the house the men downstairs were now silent after a couple of seconds alice and sereta heard the noise of the back door in the kitchen opening as the men left when they were certain that all was okay the women followed but not before they had erased all traces of themselves from the upper rooms wiping wood and faucets even retrieving the rubbers and tissues from the trash alice ripped her stockings climbing a wall and sereta cut her side but they got away now they were scared afraid that someone might come after them but gmack told them to be cool neither of them had ever been printed by the cops so even if any prints were found there was no way to link them to anything unless they got into big trouble with the law they just needed to stay calm he told them to come back to him but sereta refused gmack started shouting and the bitch hung up on him that was the last he heard of her but he figured shed head south back to her own people if she was scared she was always threatening to do that anyhow once she had enough money saved even if gmack figured it was just the empty posturing and pipedreaming that most of these whores went in for at some time or another the death of the old manhis name was winstonand his driver made the news bigtime he wasnt real wealthy not like trump or one of those guys but he was a pretty wellknown collector and dealer in antiques the cops figured it for a robbery gone wrong until they found some cosmetics in the bathroom left by the women in their panic to flee the house and they announced that they were looking for one maybe two women to help them with their inquiries the cops came trawling the point after it emerged that old man winston liked to take a ride around its streets looking for women they asked gmack what he knew once they tracked him down but gmack told them he knew nothing about it when the cops said that someone had seen gmack talking to winstons driver and maybe it was his women who were with him that night gmack told them that he talked to a lot of people and sometimes their drivers but that didnt mean he made no deals with them he didnt even bother denying that he was a playa better to give them a little truth to hide the taste of the lie he had already warned the other whores to keep quiet about what they knew and they did as they were told both out of fear of him and out of concern for their friends because gmack had made it clear to them that alice and sereta were safe only as long as the men who did the killings didnt know a thing about them but this wasnt any botched robbery and the men involved tracked down gmack just as the police had done before them except they werent about to be fooled by any show of innocence gmack didnt like to think about them the fat man with the swollen neck and the smell of freshly turned earth from him and his quiet bored friend in blue he didnt like to remember how they had forced him against a wall how the fat man had placed his fingers in gmacks mouth gripping his tongue when he uttered the first of the lies gmack had almost puked then on the taste of him but there was worse to come the voices that gmack heard in his head the nausea that came with them the sense that the longer he allowed this man to touch him the more corrupted and polluted he would become until his insides began to rot from the contact he admitted that they were his girls but he hadnt heard from them since that night they were gone he said but theyd seen nothing they had been upstairs the whole time they didnt know anything that could help the cops then it had come out and gmack cursed the moment he had agreed to take sereta and her junkie bitch friend into his stable the fat man told him that it wasnt what they knew that concerned him it was what they had taken winston had shown sereta the box on the second night happy and sated from his hours of mild pleasure while alice was cleaning herself up he liked displaying his collection to the lovely darkhaired girl smarter and more alert than her friend as she was explaining the origins of some of the objects and pointing out little details about them sereta guessed that apart from the sex he just wanted someone to talk to she didnt mind he was a nice old man generous and harmless maybe it wasnt very smart of him to be trusting a pair of women he barely knew with the secrets of his treasures but sereta at least could be relied upon and she was careful to watch alice just in case her friend might be tempted to take something in the hope of fencing it later the box he was holding was less interesting to her than some of the other items in his possession the jewelry the paintings the tiny ivory statuettes it was a dull silver and very plain in appearance winston told her that it was very old and very valuable to those who understood what it represented he opened it carefully inside she saw a folded piece of what looked like paper not paper winston corrected vellum taking a clean handkerchief he removed it and unfolded it for her she saw words symbols letters the shapes of buildings and right in the center the edge of what looked like a wing what is it she asked its a map he said or part of one wheres the rest of it winston shrugged who knows lost perhaps this is one of a number of pieces the rest have been scattered for a very long time i once hoped that i might find them all but now i doubt that i ever will i have lately begun to consider selling it i have already made some inquiries we shall see he replaced the fragment then closed the box and restored it to its place on a small shelf by his dressing table shouldnt it be in a vault or something she asked why said winston if you were a thief would you steal it sereta looked at the shelf the box was lost amid the curios and little ornaments that seemed to fill every corner of winstons house i was a thief i wouldnt even be able to find it she said winston nodded happily then shrugged off his robe time for one more i think he said viagra thought sereta sometimes that damn blue pill was a curse when the men offered him money for any information that might lead to the whereabouts of the whores it didnt take gmack more than a couple of moments to think about it and accept he figured he didnt have much choice since the fat man had made it clear that if he tried to screw them over he would suffer for it and someone else would be running his whores as a result he put out some feelers but nobody had heard from either sereta or alice sereta was the smart one he knew if alice stayed close by her and did as she was told maybe cut down on her habit and tried to get straight they might be able to stay hidden for a long time and then alice had come back she rang the doorbell on the coney island crib and asked to come up it was late at night and only letitia was there because shed come down with some kind of puking bug letitia was puerto rican and new but she had been warned about what to do if either sereta or alice made an appearance she allowed alice to come up told her to lie down on one of the cots then called gmack on his cell gmack told her to keep alice there not to let her go but when letitia went back to the bedroom alice was gone and so was letitias bag with two hundred dollars in cash when she ran down to the street there was no sign of the thin black girl gmack went apeshit when he got back he hit letitia called her every damn name he could think of then got in his car and trawled the streets of brooklyn hoping to catch sight of alice he guessed that shed try to score using letitias money so he cruised the dealers some of them known to him by name he was almost at kings highway when at last he saw her her hands were cuffed and she was being placed in the back of a cop car he followed the car to the precinct house he could bail her out himself but if anyone connected her to what had happened to winston then gmack would be in a world of trouble and he didnt want that instead he called the number that the fat man had given him and told the man who answered where alice was the man said theyd take care of it a day later boy blue came back and paid gmack some money not as much as hed been promised but combined with the implicit threat of harm if he complained enough to keep him from objecting and more than sufficient to make a considerable down payment on a ride they told him to keep his mouth shut and he did he assured them that she had nobody that no one would come asking after her he said that he knew this for sure swore upon it told them he knew her from way back that her momma was dead from the virus and her poppa was a hound who got himself killed in an argument over another woman a couple of years after his daughter was born a daughter hed never cared to see one of many if the truth be told hed made it all upaccidentally touching on the truth about her father along the waybut it didnt matter he put what they gave him for her toward the cutlass supreme and it now sat on chrome jordans number in a secure garage gmack was in the life now and he had to look the part if he was going to build up his stable although he had driven the cutlass only on a handful of occasions preferring to keep it carefully garaged and visiting it occasionally like he would a favorite woman true the cops might come asking about alice again once they found out that shed skipped bail but then again they had other things to occupy them in this big bad city without worrying about some junkie hooker who took a skip to get away from the life then the black woman had come around asking questions and gmack hadnt liked the look on her face one little bit he had grown up around women like that and if you didnt show them you meant business right from the start then theyd be on you like dogs so gmack had hit her because that was how he always dealt with women who got out of line with him maybe shed go away he thought maybe shed just forget about it he hoped so because if she started asking questions and convinced some other people to ask questions too then the men who paid him might hear about it and gmack didnt doubt for one minute that to safeguard themselves they would bind him shoot him and bury him in the trunk of his car all twentythree inches off the ground it was a strange situation in which louis and i found ourselves i wasnt working for him but i was working with him for once i wasnt the one calling the shots and this time what was occurring was personal to him not to me to salve his conscience a littleassuming as angel remarked that he had a conscience to begin withlouis was picking up the tab for whatever expenses arose he was putting me up in the parker meridien which was a lot nicer than the places in which i usually stayed the elevators played vintage cartoons on little screens and the tv in my room was bigger than some new york hotel beds id known the room was a little minimalist but i didnt mention that to louis i didnt want to seem to be carping the hotel had a great gym and a good thai restaurant a couple of doors up from it there was also a rooftop pool with a dizzying view over central park i met walter cole at a coffee shop down on second avenue police cadets passed back and forth by our window hauling black knapsacks and looking more like soldiers than cops i tried to remember when i was like them and found that i couldnt it was as though some parts of my past had been closed off to me while others continued to leach into the present like toxic runoff poisoning what might once have been fertile soil the city had changed so much since the attacks and the cadets with their military appearance now seemed more suited to its streets than i did new yorkers had been reminded of their own mortality their susceptibility to harm from outside agencies with the consequence that they and the streets that they loved had been altered irrevocably i was reminded of women i had seen in the course of my work women whose husbands had lashed out at them once and would lash out at them again they seemed always to be braced for another blow even as they hoped that it would not come that something might have altered in the demeanor of the one who had hurt them before my father once hit my mother i was young no more than seven or eight and she had started a small fire in the kitchen while she was frying some pork chops for his dinner there was a phone call for her and she left the kitchen to take it a friends son had won a scholarship to some big university a particular cause for celebration as her husband had died suddenly some years before and she had struggled to bring up their three children in the years that followed my mother stayed on the phone just a little too long the oil in the pan began to hiss and smoke and the flames from the gas ring rose higher a dish towel began to smolder and suddenly there was smoke pouring from the kitchen my father got there just in time to stop the curtains from igniting and used a damp cloth to smother the oil in the pan burning his hand slightly in the process by that point my mother had abandoned her call and i followed her into the kitchen where my father was running cold water over his hand oh no she said i was just and my father hit her he was frightened and angry he didnt hit her hard it was an openhanded slap and he tried to pull the blow as he realized what he was doing but it was too late he struck her on the cheek and she staggered slightly then touched her hand gently to her skin as though to confirm to herself that she had been hit i looked at my father and the blood was already leaving his face i thought he was about to fall over for he seemed to teeter on his feet lord im sorry he said he tried to go to her but she pushed him away she couldnt look at him in all their years together he had never once laid a hand upon her in anger he rarely even raised his voice to her now the man she knew as her husband was suddenly gone and a stranger revealed in his place at that moment the world was no longer the place that she had once thought it to be it was alien and dangerous and her vulnerability was exposed to her looking back i dont know if she ever truly forgave him i dont believe that she did for i dont think that any woman can ever really forgive a man who raises his hand to her especially not one whom she loves and trusts the love suffers a little but the trust suffers more and somewhere deep inside herself she will always be wary of another strike the next time she tells herself i will leave him i will never let myself be hit again mostly though they stay in my fathers case there would never be a next time but my mother was not to know that and nothing he could ever do in the years that followed would ever convince her otherwise and as strangers passed by dwarfed by the immensity of the buildings around them i thought what have they done to this city walter tapped the tabletop with his finger you still with us he asked i was just reminiscing getting nostalgic only for our order by the time it arrives inflation will have kicked in somewhere in the distance i could see our waitress idly spinning a mint on the counter we should have made her commit to a price before she left said walter heads up theyre here two men weaved through the tables making their way toward us both wore casual jackets one with a tie one without the taller of the two men was probably nudging sixtwo while the smaller was about my height short of having blue lights strapped to their heads and crown vicshaped shoes they couldnt have screamed cops any louder not that it mattered in this place a few years back two guys fresh off the boat from puerto ricoliterally as they hadnt been in the city more than a day or twotried to take down the diner home to cops since time immemorial at around midnight armed with a hammer and a carving knife they got as far as this is a before they were looking down the barrels of about thirty assorted weapons a framed front page from the post now hung on the wall behind the register it showed a photograph of the two geniuses below the block headline dumb and dumber walter rose to shake hands with the two detectives and i did the same as he introduced me the tall one was named mackey the short one was dunne anybody hoping to use them as proof that the irish still dominated the nypd was likely to be confused by the fact that dunne was black and mackey looked asian although they pretty much made the case that the celts could charm the pants off just about any race how you doin dunne said to me as he sat down i could see that he was sizing me up i hadnt met him before but like most of his kind who had been around for longer than a few years he knew my history hed probably heard the stories as well i didnt care if he believed them or not as long as it didnt get in the way of what we were trying to do mackey seemed more interested in the waitress than he was in me i wished him luck if she treated her suitors like she treated her customers then mackey would be a very old and very frustrated man by the time he got anywhere with this woman nice pins he said admiringly whats she like from the front cant remember said walter its been so long since weve seen her face mackey and dunne were part of the nypds vice division and had been for the past five years the city spent million each year on prostitution control but control was the operative term prostitution wasnt going to disappear no matter how much money the city threw at the problem and so it was a matter of prioritizing mackey and dunne worked with the sexual exploitation of children squad which worked all five boroughs tackling child porn prostitution and child sex rings they had their work cut out children were subjected to sexual exploitation every year of whom over half were runaways or kids who had been thrown out of their homes by their parents or guardians new york acted like a magnet for them there were over five thousand children working as prostitutes in the city at any time and no shortage of men willing to pay for them the squad used younglooking female cops some incredibly capable of passing for thirteen or fourteen to lure chickenhawks as pedophile johns liked to term themselves most if caught patronizing would avoid jail time if they had no previous history but at least they would be mandated to register as sex offenders and could then be monitored for the rest of their lives the pimps were harder to catch and their methods were becoming more sophisticated some of the pimps had gang affiliations which made them even more dangerous to both the girls and the cops then there were those who were actively engaged in trafficking young girls across state lines in january a sixteenyearold vermont girl named christal jones was found smothered in an apartment on zerega avenue in hunts point one of a number of vermont girls lured to new york in an apparently wellorganized burlingtontothebronx sex ring with deaths like christals suddenly million didnt seem like nearly enough mackey and dunne were over on the east side to talk to the cadets about their work but it appeared to have done little for their confidence in the future of the force all these kids want to do is catch terrorists said dunne they had their way this city would be bought and sold ten times over while they were interrogating muslims about their diet our waitress returned from faroff places bearing coffee and bagels sorry boys she said i got distracted mackey saw an opening and rushed to take advantage of it what happened gorgeous you catch sight of yourself in a mirror the waitress whose name was mylene whatever kind of name that was favored him with the same look she might have given a mosquito that had the temerity to land on her during the height of the west nile virus scare nope caught sight of you and had to wait for my beating heart to be still she said thought i was gonna die youre so goodlooking menus are on the table ill be back with coffee dont count on it said walter as she vanished think you got some sarcasm on you there dunne remarked to his partner yeah it burns still that lady looks like a million dollars walter and i exchanged glances if that waitress looked like a million dollars then it was all in used bills the pleasantries over walter brought us down to business you got anything for us he asked gmack real name tyrone baylee said dunne he pretty much expectorated the name this guy was made to be a pimp you catch my drift i knew what he meant men who pimp women tend to be smarter than the average criminal their social skills are relatively good which enables them to handle the prostitutes in their charge they try to shy away from extreme violence although most consider it their duty and their right to keep their women in place with a wellplaced slap when circumstances require it in short theyre cowards but cowards gifted with a degree of cunning a capacity for emotional and psychological manipulation and sometimes a selfdeluding belief that theirs is a victimless crime since they are merely providing a service to both the whores and the men who patronize them hes got a prior for assault he only served six months but he did them in otisville and it wasnt a happy time for him his name came up during a narcotics investigation a year or two back but he was pretty low down on the food chain and a search of his place turned up nothing seems that experience encouraged him to find an alternative outlet for his talents he got himself a small stable of women but hes been trying to build it up over the last couple of months a pimp called free billy died awhile backthey called him free billy on account of the fact that he claimed his rates were so low he was practically giving his whores away for nothingand his girls were divided up by the rest of the sharks out on the point gmack had to wait his turn and by all accounts there wasnt much left for him once the others had taken their pick the girl youre asking afteralice temple street name lashanshe was one of free billys said mackey taking up the baton according to the cops who work the point she was a goodlooking woman once but she was using and using hard she didnt look like she was going to last much longer even on the point gmacks been telling people that he let her go cause she wasnt worth anything to him said nobody was going to pay good money for a woman looked like she might be dying of the virus seems she was friendly with a whore named sereta black mexican they came as a twofer looks like she dropped off the map about the same time as your girl but unlike her friend she didnt appear again i leaned forward what do you mean by that this alice was picked up close by kings highway about a week or so ago possession of a controlled substance looked like shed just come out to score beat cops found her with the needle in her arm she didnt even have time to inject she was arrested it was a quiet night so her bail was set before the sun came up she made it within the hour who paid it bail bondsman named eddie tager her court date was set for the nineteenth so she still has a couple of days left is eddie tager gmacks bondsman dunne shrugged hes pretty lowend so its possible but most pimps tend to pay bail for their whores themselves its mostly set low and it allows them to get their hooks deeper into the girl in manhattan firsttimers usually just get compulsory health and safesex education maybe community service if the judge is having a bad day but the other boroughs dont have courtbased programs to meet the needs of prostitutes so it goes harder on them over there the cops who spoke to gmack say he denied just about everything except his birth why were they talking to him he was questioned in connection with the murder of an antiques dealer named winston allen along with most of the pimps over there allen had a taste for whores from the point and there was a rumor that maybe two of gmacks girls might have been among them gmack claimed that they had it all wrong but the date would tie in with the disappearance of alice and her friend from the streets we didnt know that when she was picked up though and her prints didnt match the partials we got from allens house when she was processed everything since has been a dead end anyone talk with tager hes proving hard to find and nobody has the time it takes to go looking under rocks for him lets be straight here if you and walter hadnt come along asking questions alice temple would be struggling for attention even with the death of winston allen women disappear from the point it happens something passed between dunne and mackey neither was about to put it into words though not without some pushing lately more than usual i asked it was a blind throw but it hit home maybe its just rumors and talk from programs like gems and ecpat but theres no pattern which presents a problem and the ones who are going missing are mostly homeless or dont have anyone to report them and its not just women either basically what we got is a spike in the bronx figures over the past six months it might be meaningless or it might not but unless we start turning up bodies its going to stay a blip it didnt help us much but it was good to know so back to business said mackey we figure that maybe if we feed you this information youll help us by taking some of the pressure off and maybe find out something we can use on gmack along the way such as hes got a young girl working for him he keeps her pretty close but her name is ellen weve tried talking to her but weve got nothing on her to justify pulling her in and gmack has his women schooled halfway to christmas on entrapment juvenile crime hasnt had any luck with her either if you find out anything about her maybe youll tell us we hear gmack called your girl a skank a junkie skank said mackey thought you might like to know that just in case you were planning on talking with him ill remember that i said whats his territory his girls tend to work the lower end of lafayette he likes to keep an eye on them so he usually parks on the street close by i hear hes driving a cutlass supreme on bigass tires now maybe like hes some kind of millionaire rapper how long has he been driving the cutlass not long must be doing okay if he can afford a car like that i guess we didnt see no tax return so i cant say for sure but he seems to have come into money recently mackey kept his eyes fixed on me as i spoke i nodded once letting him know that i understood what he was intimating someone had paid him to keep quiet about the women does he have a place he lives over on quimby couple of his women live with him seems he has a crib over in brooklyn as well down on coney island avenue he moves between them weapons none of these guys are dumb enough to carry the more established ones they maybe keep one or two knuckle grazers that they can call on in case of trouble but gmack aint in that league yet the waitress returned she looked a whole lot less happy to be coming back than she did when she came over the first time and she hadnt exactly been ecstatic then dunne and mackey ordered a tuna on rye and a turkey club dunne asked for a side of sunshine with his tuna you had to admire his perseverance salad or fries said the waitress sunshine is extra and youll have to eat it outside how about fries and a smile said dunne how about you have an accident then ill smile she left the world breathed easier you got a death wish man said mackey i could die in her arms said dunne you dying on your sorry ass right now and you aint even near her arms he sighed and poured so much sugar into his coffee his spoon pretty much stood up straight in it so you think gmack knows where this woman is at asked mackey i shrugged were going to ask him that you think hes going to tell you i thought of louis and what he would do to gmack for hitting martha eventually i said chapter six jackie o was one of the oldtime macks the kind who believed that a man should dress the part he typically wore a canary yellow suit for business set off by a white shirt with a pink tie and yellowandwhite patent leather shoes a fulllength white leather coat with yellow trim was draped across his shoulders in cold weather and the ensemble was completed by a white fedora with a pink feather he carried an antique black cane topped with a silver horses head the head could be removed with a twist freeing the eighteeninch blade that was concealed inside the cops knew that jackie o carried a sword stick but jackie o was never questioned or searched he was occasionally a good source of information and as one of the senior figures at the point he was accorded a modicum of respect he kept a close eye on the women who worked for him and tried to treat them right he paid for their rubbers which was more than most pimps did and made sure each was equipped with a pen loaded with pepper spray before she hit the streets jackie o was was also smart enough to know that wearing fine clothes and driving a nice car didnt mean that what he did had any class but it was all that he knew how to do he used his earnings to buy modern art but he sometimes thought that even the most beautiful of his paintings and sculptures were sullied by the manner in which he had funded their purchase for that reason he liked to trade up in the hope that by doing so he might slowly erase the stain upon his collection jackie o didnt entertain many visitors in his tribeca apartment purchased on the advice of his accountant many years before and now the most valuable possession that he had after all he spent most of his time surrounded by hookers and pimps and they werent the kind of people to appreciate the art upon his walls real connoisseurs of art tended not to socialize with pimps they might avail themselves of the services offered by them but they sure werent going to be stopping by for wine and cheese for that reason jackie o enjoyed a fleeting moment of pleasure when he looked through the spy hole in his steel door and saw louis standing outside here was somebody who might appreciate his collection he thought until he quickly realized the probable reason for the visit he knew that he had two choices he could refuse to let louis in in which case he was likely to make the situation worse or he could simply admit him and hope that the situation wasnt already so bad that it couldnt possibly get much worse neither option was particularly appealing to him but the longer jackie o procrastinated the more likely he was to try the patience of his visitor before opening the door he put the safety back on the h ampk that he held in his right hand then returned it to the holster that lay taped beneath a small table near the door he composed his features into an expression as close to joy and surprise as his fear would allow unlocked and opened the door and got as far as the words my man welcome before louiss hand closed around his throat the barrel of a glock was pressed hard into the hollow below jackie os left cheekbone a hollow whose size was increased by jackie os gaping mouth louis kicked the door shut with his heel then forced the pimp back into the living room of the apartment before sending him sprawling across his couch it was two oclock in the afternoon so jackie o was still wearing his red japanese silk robe and a pair of lilac pajamas he found it hard to muster his dignity dressed as he was but he gave it a good try hey man what is this he protested i invite you into my home and this is how you treat me lookhe fingered the collar of his gown revealing a sixinch rip in the materialyou done tore my gown and this shits silk shut up said louis you know why im here how would i know that it wasnt a question it was a statement you know jackie o gave up the act this man was not someone to play the fool with jackie o could recall the first time he ever set eyes on him almost a decade before even then he had heard stories but he had not encountered the one about whom they were told louis was different in those days there was a fire burning coldly inside him clear for all to see although the ferocity of it was slowly diminishing even then the flames flickering confusedly in a series of crosswinds jackie o figured that a man couldnt just go on killing and hurting without paying a high price for it over time the worst of themthe sociopaths and the psychosthey just didnt realize it was happening or maybe some were just so damaged to start with that there wasnt much room for further deterioration louis wasnt like that though and when jackie o first knew him the consequences of his actions were gradually beginning to take their toll upon him a honey trap was being set for a man who preyed on young women after a girl was killed by him in a country far from this one some very powerful people had decreed that this man was to die and he was drowned in a bathtub in his hotel room lured there with the promise of a girl and a guarantee that no questions would be asked if she suffered a little for he was a man with the money to indulge his tastes it wasnt an expensive hotel room and the man had no possessions with him when he died other than his wallet and his watch he was still wearing the watch when he died in fact he was fully clothed when he was found because the people who had ordered his death didnt want there to be even the slightest possibility that it might be mistaken for suicide or natural causes his killing would serve as a warning to others of his kind it was jackie os bad luck to be coming out of a hotel room on the same floor when the killer emerged after jackie had set up one of his marginally more expensive women for a days work he didnt know the man was a killer not then or certainly not for sure although he sensed something circling beneath the seemingly placid surface like the pale ghost of a shark glimpsed moving through the deep blue depths their eyes locked but jackie kept walking making for the security of crowds and people he didnt know where the man was going or what he had been doing in that hotel room and he didnt want to know he didnt even look back until he was at the corner of the hallway the stairs in view and by then the man was gone but jackie o read the papers and he didnt need to be a mathematician to put two and two together at that moment he cursed his high profile among his kind and his love of fine clothes he knew he would be easy to find and he was right so this was not the first time that the killer louis had invaded his space nor was it the first time that his gun had pressed itself to jackies flesh on that first occasion jackie had been sure that he was going to die but there had been a steadiness to his voice when he said you got nothing to fear from me son i was younger and i had the nerve i might have done the same myself the gun had slowly disengaged itself from his face and louis had left him without another word but jackie knew that he owed him a debt for his life in time jackie learned more about him and the stories he had heard started to make sense after some years louis returned to him now changed somehow and gave jackie o his name and asked him to look out for a young woman with a soft southern accent and a growing love for the needle and jackie had done his best for her he tried to encourage her to seek another path as she drifted from pimp to pimp he helped louis to trace her on those repeated occasions when he was determined to force her to seek help he intervened with others where necessary reminding those who had her in their charge that she was different that questions would be asked if she was harmed yet it was an unsatisfactory arrangement and he had seen the pain in the younger mans face as this woman who was blood to him was passed from man to man and died a little in every hand slowly jackie began to care less about her as she started to care less about herself now she was gone and her failed guardian was seeking a reckoning with those responsible she was gmacks girl said jackie o i tried talking to him but he dont listen to no old men i got girls of my own to look out for i couldnt be watching her all the time louis sat down on a chair opposite the couch the gun remained pointing at jackie o it made jackie o nervous louis was calm the anger had disappeared as suddenly as it had manifested itself and that made jackie more afraid than ever at least anger and rage were human emotions what he was witnessing now was a man disengaging from all such feelings as he prepared to visit harm on another now i got a problem with what you just told me said louis first of all you said was as in she was gmacks girl thats the past tense and it has a ring of permanence about it that i dont like second last i heard she was with free billy you were supposed to tell me if that situation changed free billy died said jackie o you werent around his girls were divided up did you take any of them one yeah she was asian i knew shed bring in good money but not alice jackie o realized his mistake i had too many girls already but not so many that you couldnt find room for the asian she was special man louis leaned forward slightly alice was special too to me dont you think i know that but i told you a long time ago that i wouldnt take her i wasnt going to have you look in my eyes and see the man who was handing her over to others i made that clear to you louiss eyes flickered you did i thought shed be okay with gmack honest man said jackie o hes starting out he wants to make his rep i heard nothing bad about him so i had no reason to be concerned for her he didnt want to hear anything from me but that dont make him no different from any of the other young bloods slowly jackie o was beginning to recover his courage this wasnt right this was his place and he was being disrespected and over something that wasnt his concern jackie o had been in the game too long to take this kind of shit even from a man like louis anyway the fuck you blaming me for she wasnt my concern she was yours you wanted someone to look out for her all the time then that someone should have been you the words came out in such a rush that once he had started speaking jackie o found himself unable to stop the accusation now lay between the two men and jackie o didnt know if it was going to just disappear or explode in his face in the end it did neither louis flinched and jackie o saw the guilt wash like rain across his face i tried he said softly jackie o nodded and looked to the floor he had seen the woman return to the streets after each intervention by the man before him she had checked out of public hospitals and virtually escaped from private clinics once on the last occasion when louis had tried to take her back she pulled a blade on him after that louis had asked jackie o to continue doing what he could for her except there wasnt much that jackie o could do because this woman was sliding and sliding fast maybe there were better men than free billy for her to be with but free billy wasnt the kind of man who gave up his property easily hed received a warning through jackie o about what would happen to him if he didnt do right by alice but it wasnt like they were man and wife and louis was the father of the bride this was a pimp and one of his whores we were talking about even with the best will in the worldand free billy was a long way from having any kind of goodwillthere was a limit to the amount that a pimp could or would do for a woman who was forced to make her money from whoring then free billy died and alice ended up with gmack jackie o knew that he should have taken her into his stable but he just didnt want her even aside from anything else he had told louis she was trouble and in daylight she was soon going to look like the walking dead because of all the shit she was pouring into her system jackie o didnt hold with junkies in his stable they were unpredictable and they spread disease jackie o always tried to make sure that his girls practiced safe sex didnt matter how much the john offered for something extra a woman like alice well hell there was no predicting what she might do if the need was on her other pimps werent as particular as jackie o they didnt have any social conscience like he said hed figured shed be okay with gmack except it turned out that gmack wasnt smart enough to do the right thing jackie o had survived for a long time in his chosen profession he grew up on these streets and he was a wild young man in those days he stole sold weed boosted cars there wasnt much that jackie o wouldnt do to turn a buck although he always drew the line at inflicting harm on his victims he carried a gun then but he never had call to use it most of the time those he stole from never even saw his face because he kept contact to a minimum now junkies busted into peoples cribs while they were asleep and when those folks woke up they usually werent best pleased to see some wiredup brother trying to steal their dvd player and a confrontation ensued more often than not people got hurt when there was no necessity for it and jackie o didnt hold with that kind of behavior jackie o had entered into pimping kind of accidentally turned out he was a pimp without even knowing it on account of the first woman that he fell for in a serious way he was down on his luck when he met her due to some noaccount negroes who had ripped him off on a supply buy that would have kept him in weed for the rest of the year this left him with some serious cash flow problems and he found himself out on the street once hed used up all the favors he could call in in the end there was barely a couch in the neighborhood that he hadnt called his bed at some point then he met a woman in a basement bar and one thing led to another the way it sometimes will between a man and a woman she was older than he by five years and she gave him a bed for one night then a second then a third she told him she had a job that kept her out late but it wasnt until the fourth night that he saw her getting ready for the streets and he figured out what that job might be but he stayed with her while he waited for his situation to improve and some nights he would accompany her as she made her way to the little warren of streets upon which she plied her trade discreetly following her and the johns to vacant lots just to make sure that no harm came to her in return for which she would give him ten bucks once on a rainy thursday night he heard her cry out from the cab of a delivery truck and he came running to find the guy had slapped her over some imagined slight jackie o took care of him catching him by surprise and hitting him over the back of the head with a blackjack that he kept in his coat pocket for just such an eventuality after that he became her shadow and pretty soon he became the shadow for a bunch of other women too jackie o never looked back he tried not to think too deeply about what he did jackie o was a godfearing man and gave generously to his local church seeing it as an investment in his future if nothing else he knew that what he was doing was wrong in the eyes of the lord but if he didnt do it then someone else would and that someone might not care about the women the way jackie did that would be his argument if it came down to it and the good lord was looking dubious about admitting jackie to his eternal reward so jackie o watched his women and his streets and encouraged his peers to do likewise it made good business sense they werent looking out only for their whores but for the cops too jackie didnt like to see his women halfnaked and dressed in high heels trying to run from vice in the event of a descent on the point if they fell in those heels then likely as not theyd do themselves an injury given enough notice they could just slink away into the shadows and wait for the heat to disperse that was how the rumors came back to jackie shortly after alice and her friend had disappeared from the streets the women started to tell of a black van its plates beaten and obscured it was a given on the streets that vans and suvs were to be avoided anyway because they were tailormade for abduction and rape it didnt help that his women were already a little paranoid because stories were circulating about people who had gone missing in recent months girls and younger men in the main most of them homeless or junkies jackie o had seriously considered putting some of his women on temporary medication to calm them down so at first he was skeptical about the mythical van no approaches were ever made to them from the men inside they said and jackie suggested that it might simply be the cops in another guise but then lula one of his best girls came to him just as she was about to take to the streets you need to watch out for that black transit she told him i hear they been asking after some girls used to service some old guy out in queens jackie o always listened to lula she was the oldest of his whores and she knew the streets and the other women she was the den mother and jackie had learned to trust her instincts you think theyre cops they aint no cops plates are all torn up and they feel bad the men inside what do they look like theyre white one of thems fat real fat i didnt get a good look at the other uhhuh well you just tell the girls to walk away if they see that van tell them to come to me yhear lula nodded and went to take up her place at the nearest corner jackie o did some walking that night talking to the other pimps but it was hard with some as they were men of low breeding and lower intelligence yo bitch spookin you jackie said one a porcine man who liked to be called havana slim on account of the cigars that he smoked didnt matter that the cigars were cheap dominicans you gettin old man streets no place for you now jackie ignored the taunt he had been here long before havana and he would be here long after havana was gone eventually he found gmack but gmack just blew jackie o right off jackie o could see that he was rattled though and the older man began filling in the blanks for himself one night later jackie o glimpsed the black van for the first time he had slipped down an alleyway to take a leak when he saw something gleaming behind a big dumpster he zipped himself up as gradually the lines of the van were revealed to him the rear plate was no longer battered or obscured and jackie o figured there and then that they were changing the plates on a regular basis the tires were new and although some damage had been done to the side panels it looked purely cosmetic an attempt to divert attention from the van and its occupants by making it appear older and less well maintained than it really was jackie reached the drivers door the windows were smoked glass but jackie thought that he could see one figure maybe two moving inside he knocked on the glass but there was no response hey said jackie open up maybe i can help you with somethin you lookin for a woman there was only silence then jackie o did something dumb he tried to open the door looking back jackie o couldnt figure out why hed done it at best he was going to make whoever was inside the van seriously pissed and at worst he could end up with a gun in his face at least jackie o thought that a gun in the face was the worst that could happen he grasped the handle and pulled the door opened a stench assailed jackie o as if someone had taken the bloated carcass of a dead animal buried in shallow ground and suddenly pierced its hide releasing all the pentup gas from within the smell must have made jackie nauseous because there was no other way of explaining what he thought he saw inside the cab of the van before the door was yanked closed and the van pulled away even now in the comfort of his own apartment and with the benefit of hindsight jackie could only recall fragmented images it was like it was filled with meat he told louis not hanging meat but like the inside of a body all purple and red it was on the panels and on the floor and i could see blood dripping from it and pooling in places there was a bench seat in the front and two figures sitting on it but they were all black except for their faces one was huge and fat he was closest to me and the smell came mostly from him they must have been wearing masks because their faces looked ruined ruined asked louis i didnt get a good look at the passenger hell i didnt get much of a look at anything but the fat one his face was like a skull the skin was all wrinkled and black and the nose looked like it had been broken off with only a piece left near his forehead his eyes were kind of green and black with no whites to them i saw his teeth too because he said something when the door opened his teeth were long and yellow it must have been a mask right i mean what else could it be he was almost talking to himself carrying on an argument in his head that had been going on since the night he had opened the door of the van what else could it be walter and i separated after our lunch with mackey and dunne they offered to meet up with us again if we needed any more help no witnesses said mackey and there was a sly look in his eye that i didnt like i didnt care about what they might have heard but i wasnt going to let someone like mackey throw my past back in my face if you have something you want to say then say it now i said dunne stepped between us just so were clear he said quietly you handle gmack how you want to but he better be breathing and walking when youre done and if he expires then you be sure to have a good alibi are we clear on that otherwise well have to come after you he didnt look at walter when he spoke his eyes remained fixed on me only as he turned away did he speak directly to walter he said you better be careful too walter walter didnt reply and i did not react after all dunne had a point you dont have to come along tonight i said once the two cops were out of sight bullshit im there but you heard what dunne said theyll fall on you if something happens to this gmack im not going to touch the pimp if he had anything to do with alices disappearance then well get it out of him and later ill try to bring him in so he can tell the cops what he knows but i can only speak for myself i cant speak for anyone else i saw a cab on the horizon i flagged it and watched with satisfaction as it weaved through two lanes of traffic to get to me those guys are going to bring you down with them someday said walter he wasnt smiling maybe im dragging them down with me i replied thanks for this walter ill be in touch i climbed in the cab and left him far away the black angel stirred you made a mistake it said you were supposed to check her background you assured me that no one would come after her she was just a common whore said brightwell he had returned from arizona with the weight of blues loss heavy upon him he would be found again but time was pressing and they needed all of the bodies they could muster now with the death of the girls still fresh in his memory he was being criticized for his carelessness and he did not like it he had been alone for so long without having to answer to anyone and the exercise of authority chafed upon him in a way that it had not previously done he also found the atmosphere in the sparsely furnished office oppressive there was the great desk ornately carved and topped with green leather and the expensive antique lamps that shed a dim light on the walls the wooden floor and the worn rug upon which he now stood but there were too many empty spaces waiting to be filled in a way it was a metaphor for the existence of the one before whom he now stood no said the black angel she was a most uncommon whore there are questions being asked about her a report has been filed two great blue veins pulsed at each of brightwells temples extending their reach across either side of his skull their ambit clearly visible beneath the mans corona of dark hair he resented the reprimand and felt his impatience growing if those you had sent to kill winston had done their job properly and discreetly then we would not be having this conversation he said you should have consulted me you were not to be found i have no idea where you go when you disappear into the shadows thats none of your concern the black angel stood leaning its hands upon the burnished desk you forget yourself mr brightwell it said brightwells eyes glittered with new anger no he said i have never forgotten myself i remained true i searched and i found i discovered you and i reminded you of all that you once were it was you who forgot i remembered i remembered it all brightwell was right the black angel recalled their first encounter the revulsion it had felt then slowly the dawning understanding and the final acceptance the black angel retreated from the confrontation and turned instead to the window beneath its gaze people enjoyed the sunshine and traffic moved slowly along the congested streets kill the pimp said the black angel discover all that you can about those who are asking questions and then the black angel cast brightwell a bone use your judgment it said there was no point in reminding him of the necessity of attracting no further attention to themselves they were growing closer to their goal and furthermore it realized that brightwell was moving increasingly beyond its control if he had ever truly been under its control brightwell left but the black angel remained lost in remembrance strange the forms that we take it thought it walked to the gilt mirror upon the wall gently it touched its right hand to its face examining its reflection as though it were another version of itself then slowly it removed the contact lens from its right eye it had been forced to wear the lens for hours that day as there were people to be met and papers to be signed and now its eye felt as though it were burning the mark did not react well to concealment the black angel leaned closer tugging at the skin beneath its eye a white sheen lay across the blue of the iris like the ruined sail of a ship at sea or a face briefly glimpsed through parting clouds that night gmack took to the streets with a gun tucked into the waistband of his jeans it was a hipoint ninemillimeter alloyframed and loaded up with corbonp ammunition for maximum stopping power the gun had cost gmack very littlehell even new the hipoint retailed for about percent of what a similar walther p would go forand he figured that if the cops came around and he had to let it go then he wouldnt be out of pocket by too much he had fired the gun only a couple of times out in the new jersey woods and he knew that the hipoint didnt respond well to the corbon ammo it affected the accuracy and the recoil was just plain nasty but gmack knew that if it came down to it hed be using the hipoint right up close and anyone who took one from the gun at that range was going to stay down he left the cutlass supreme in the garage and instead drove over to the point in the dodge that he used for backup gmack didnt care if one of the other brothers saw him driving the oldlady car the ones that mattered knew he had the cutlass could take it out anytime he damn well pleased if they needed some reminding but the dodge was less likely to attract attention and it had enough under the hood to get him out of trouble quickly if the need arose he parked up in an alleywaythe same alleyway in which jackie o had seen fit to try to confront the occupants of the black van although gmack didnt know thatthen slipped out onto the streets of the point he kept his head down doing the rounds of his whores from the shadows then retreated back to the dodge he had instructed the young bitch ellen to act as an intermediary bringing the money from the others to him instead of forcing him to return to the streets again he was scared and he wasnt ashamed to admit it he reached beneath the drivers seat and removed a glock from its slot the hipoint under his arm would do if he ran into trouble on the street but the was his baby hed been put onto it by a guy who got drummed out of the south carolina state police for corruption and now did a thriving business in firearms for the more discerning customer the staties down in sc had adopted the sight unseen and had never had cause to complain loaded up with caliber s ampw cartridges it was one mean killing machine gmack removed the hipoint from his holster and balanced both weapons in his hands next to the glock it was clear what a piece of shit the hipoint really was but gmack wasnt too concerned this wasnt a fashion show this was life or death and anyway two guns were always better than one we descended on hunts point shortly before midnight in the nineteenth century hunts point was home to wealthy landowning families their numbers gradually swelled by city dwellers envious of the luxurious lifestyles available to the points residents after world war i a train line was built along southern boulevard and the mansions gave way to apartments city businesses began to relocate attracted by the space available for development and ease of access to the tristate region the poor and workingclass families nearly sixty thousand residents or twothirds of the population in the s alone were forced out as hunts points reputation grew in business circles leading to the opening of the produce market in and the meat market in there were recycling stores warehouses commercial waste depots auto glass sellers scrap dealersand of course the big markets to and from which the trucks trundled sometimes providing the hookers with a little business along the way nearly ten thousand people still lived in the district and to their credit they had campaigned for traffic signals modified truck routes new trees and a waterfront park slowly improving this sliver of the south bronx to create a better home for themselves and for future generations but they were living in an area that was a crossroads for all the garbage the city of new york could provide there were two dozen waste transfer stations on this little peninsula alone and half of all its putrescible garbage and most of its sewage sludge ended up there the whole area stank in summer and asthma was rife garbage clung to fences and filled the gutters and the noise of two million trucks a year provided a sound track of squealing brakes tooting horns and beeping reverse signals hunts point was a miniature city of industry and among the most visible of those industries was prostitution the streets were already crammed with cars as i arrived and women tottered between them on absurdly high heels most of them wearing little more than lingerie there were all shapes all ages all colors in its way the point was the most egalitarian of places some of the women shuffled like they were in the final stages of parkinsons jerking and shifting from one foot to the other while trying to keep their spines straight in what was known locally as the crack dance their pipes tucked into their bras or the waistbands of their skirts two girls on lafayette were eating sandwiches provided by the nightworks outreach initiative which tried to provide the working girls with health care condoms clean needles even food when necessary the womens heads moved constantly watching for pimps johns cops the cops liked to swoop occasionally backing up the paddy wagons to street corners and simply sweeping any hookers within reach into the back or pinkslipping them for disorderly conduct or obstructing traffic even loitering anything to break up their business a fine was a lot for these women to pay if they didnt have a pimp to back them up and many routinely spent thirty to sixty days in the can for nonpayment rather than hand over to the courts money that they could ill afford to lose if the poorer ones had to begin with i went into the green mill to wait for the others the green mill was a legendary hunts point diner it had been around for decades and was now the main resting place for cold pimps and tired whores it was relatively quiet when i got there since business was good on the streets a couple of pimps wearing philadelphia phillies shirts sat at one of the windows flicking through a copy of rides magazine and arguing the relative merits of assorted hookups i took a seat near the door and waited there was a young girl seated at one of the booths her hair was dark and she was dressed in a short black dress that was little more than a slip three times i saw older women enter the diner give her money then leave again after the third had departed the girl closed the little purse containing the money and left the diner she was back again maybe five minutes later and the cycle resumed again angel joined me shortly after the girl had returned he had dressed down for the occasion if such a thing were actually possible his jeans were even more worn than usual and his denim jacket looked like it had been stolen from the corpse of a particularly unhygienic biker we have him he said where an alley two blocks away hes sitting in a dodge listening to the radio he alone looks like it the girl over at the window seems to be bringing him his money a couple of times an hour but shes the only one whos been near him since ten you figure hes armed i would be if i was him he doesnt know were coming he knows somebodys coming louis talked to jackie o the oldtimer right he just gave us the lead he figures gmack made a big mistake and hes known it since the night martha confronted him hes edgy im surprised hes stayed around this long jackie o thinks hed run if he could hes low on funds seeing as how he spent all his money on a fancy ride and he has no friends thats heartbreaking i thought you might see it that way pay at the register you leave it on the table and someone will steal it i paid for my coffee and followed angel from the diner we intercepted the girl just as she entered the alley the pimps dodge was parked around a corner in a lot behind a big brownstone with an exit behind him onto the street and one before him that connected perpendicularly with an alley for the moment we were out of his sight hi i said im not interested tonight she replied she tried to walk around me i gripped her arm my hand entirely enclosed it with so much room to spare that i had to tighten my fist considerably just to hold on to her she opened her mouth to scream and louiss hand closed around it as we moved her into the shadows take it easy i said were not going to hurt you i showed her my license but didnt give her enough time to take in the details im an investigator i said understand i just need a few words i nodded to louis and he carefully removed his hand from her mouth she didnt try to scream again but he kept his hand close just in case whats your name ellen youre one of gmacks girls so where are you from aberdeen you and a million other kurt cobain fans seriously where are you from detroit she said her shoulders sagging she was probably still lying how old are you i dont have to answer any of your questions i know you dont im just asking you dont want to tell me you dont have to im nineteen bullshit said louis thats how old youll be in fuck you okay listen to me ellen gmack is in a lot of trouble after tonight hes not going to be in business anymore i want you to take whatever money is in that purse and walk away go back to the green mill first our friend will stay with you to make sure you dont talk to anyone ellen looked torn i saw her tense but louis immediately brought his hand closer to her mouth ellen just do it walter cole appeared beside us its okay honey he said come on ill walk back with you buy you a cup of coffee whatever you want ellen had no choice walter wrapped an arm around her shoulder it looked almost protective but he kept a tight grip on her in case she tried to run she looked back at us dont hurt him she said i got nobody else walter walked her across the road she took her old seat and he sat beside her so that he could hear all that she said to the other women and could stop her if she made a break for the door shes just a child i said to louis yeah he said save her later gmack had promised to slip ellen percent of whatever the other women made if she acted as his gobetween for the night a deal to which ellen was happy to agree because it meant that she got to spend a few hours drinking coffee and reading magazines instead of freezing her ass off in her underwear while she tried to entice sleazebags into vacant lots but it didnt do for gmack to be away from his women for too long the bitches were already ripping him off without his physical presence to keep them in line hed be lucky to come out with nickels and dimes by close of business he knew that ellen would also take a little extra before she handed over the cash to him so all things considered this wasnt going to be a profitable night for him he didnt know how much longer he could stay in the shadows trying to avoid a confrontation that must inevitably come unless he got together enough cash to run he had considered selling the cutlass but only for about five seconds he loved that car buying it had been his dream and disposing of it would be like admitting that he was a failure a figure moved in his rearview mirror the hipoint was back in the waistband of his jeans but the glock was warm in his right hand held low down by his thigh he tightened his grip on it it felt slick upon the sweat of his palm a man stood wavering close to the wall gmack could see that he was a nocount dressed in tattered denims and anonymous sneakers that looked like they came from a thrift store the man fumbled in his pants then turned to one side and leaned his forehead against the wall waiting for the flow to start gmack relaxed his grip on the glock the drivers side window of the dodge exploded inward showering him with glass he tried to raise his gun as the passenger window also disintegrated but he received a blow to the side of the head that stunned him then a strong hand was upon his right arm and the muzzle of a gun much bigger than his own was pressed painfully into his temple he caught a glimpse of a black man with closecropped graying hair and a vaguely satanic beard the man did not look happy to see him gmacks left hand began to drift casually toward the hipoint concealed beneath his jacket but the passenger door opened and another voice said i wouldnt gmack didnt and the hipoint was slipped from his jeans let the glock go said louis gmack allowed the gun to drop to the floor of the car slowly louis eased the gun away from gmacks temple and opened the car door get out said louis keep your hands raised gmack glanced to his left where i knelt outside the passenger door the hipoint in my left hand was dwarfed by my colt it was big gun night but nobody had told gmack he stepped carefully from the car falling glass tinkling to the ground as he did so louis turned him pushing him against the side of the car and forcing his legs apart gmack felt hands upon him and saw the little man in denim who had previously seemed on the verge of taking a drunken leak he couldnt believe that he had been fooled so easily louis tapped him with the barrel of his own h ampk you see how dumb you are he said now we going to give you a chance to show how smart you are instead turn around slowly gmack did as he was told he was now facing louis and angel angel was holding gmacks glock gmack wasnt going to be getting it back in fact although gmack probably didnt know it he was now as close as he had ever come to being killed what do you want asked gmack information we want to know about a woman named alice shes one of your girls shes gone i dont where shes at louis raked his gun across gmacks face the younger man curled up his hands cupped around his ruined nose blood flowing freely between his fingers you remember a woman said louis came to you a couple of nights back asked you the same question that i just asked you remember what you did to her after a moments pause gmack nodded his head still down and drops of blood sprinkling the pitted ground beneath his feet falling on the weeds that had sprouted between the cracks well i aint even started hurting you enough for what happened to her so if you dont answer my questions right then you wont be walking out of this alley do you understand louiss voice dropped until it was barely a whisper the worst thing about what will happen to you is that i wont kill you he said ill leave you a cripple with hands that wont grip ears that wont hear and eyes that wont see are we clear again gmack nodded he had no doubt that this man would carry out his threats to the letter look at me said louis gmack lowered his hands and raised his head his lower jaw hung open in shock and his teeth were red what happened to the girl a guy came to me said gmack his voice was distorted by the damage to his nose he told me that hed give me good money if i could trace her why did he want her she was in a house with a john a guy named winston and a raid went down the guy got killed his driver too alice and another girl sereta were there they ran but sereta took something from the house before she left the guys who did the killing they wanted it back gmack tried to sniff back some of the blood that had now slowed to an ooze over his lips and chin the pain made him wince she was a junkie man he said he was pleading but his voice remained monotonic as though he himself did not believe what he was telling louis she was on the long slide she wasnt earning no more than a hundred dollars out there and that was on a good night i was gonna cut her loose anyway he said nothing bad would happen to her once she told them what they wanted to know and youre telling me that you believed him gmack stared louis straight in the face what did it matter he said for the first time in all the years that i had known him louis seemed about to lose control i saw the gun rising and his finger tightening on the trigger i reached out my hand and stopped it before it could point at gmack if you kill him we learn nothing more i said the gun continued its upward pressure against my hand for a couple of seconds then stopped tell me his name said louis he didnt give me a name said gmack he was fat and ugly and he smelled bad i didnt see him but once he give you a number a place to contact him the guy with him did slim dressed in blue he came to me after i told him where she was at he brought me my money told me to keep my mouth shut how much asked louis how much did you sell her out for gmack swallowed ten gs they promised ten more if she gave them sereta i stepped away from them if louis wanted to kill him then let it be done she was blood to me said louis i didnt know said gmack i didnt know she was a junkie i didnt think it would matter louis gripped him by the throat and forced the gun against gmacks chest louiss face contorted and a wail forced itself from somewhere deep within him issuing forth from the place where all of his love and loyalty existed walled off from any of the evil that he had done dont said the pimp and now he was crying please dont i know more i can give you more louiss face was close to him now so close that blood from gmacks mouth had spattered his features tell me i followed the guy after he paid me off i wanted to know where i could find him if i had to you mean in case the cops came along and you had to sell him out to save your skin whatever man whatever and let me go said gmack i tell you you let me walk away you got to be fuckin with me listen man i did wrong but i didnt hurt her you need to talk to someone else about what happened to her ill tell you where you can find them but you got to let me walk ill leave town and youll never see me again i swear you tryin to bargain with a man got a gun pushed into your chest it was angel who intervened we dont know that shes dead he said there may still be a chance of finding her alive louis looked to me if angel was playing good cop and louis bad cop then my role was somewhere in between but if louis killed gmack it would go bad for me i didnt doubt that mackey and dunne would come looking for me and i would have no alibi at the very least it would involve some awkward questions and might even reopen old wounds that would be better off left unexplored i say listen to him i said we go looking for this guy if it turns out that our friend here is lying then you can do what you want with him louis took his time deciding and all the while gmacks life hung from a thread and he knew it at last louis took a step back and lowered the gun where is he i followed him to a place off bedford louis nodded looks like you bought yourself a few more hours of life he said garcia watched the four men from his hiding place behind the dumpster garcia believed all that brightwell had told him and was certain of the rewards that he had been promised he now bore the brand upon his wrist so that he might be recognized by others like him but unlike brightwell he was merely a foot soldier a conscript in the great war being waged brightwell also bore a brand upon his wrist but although it was far older than garcias it appeared never to have properly healed in fact when garcia stood close to brightwell he could sometimes detect the smell of scorched flesh from him if a diminution of the fat mans own stench permitted it garcia did not know if the fat mans name was really brightwell in truth garcia did not care he trusted brightwells judgment and was grateful to him for finding him for bringing him to this great city once garcia had honed his abilities to brightwells satisfaction and for giving him a place in which to work and to pursue his obsessions brightwell in turn had found in garcia a willing convert to his convictions garcia had merely absorbed them into his own belief system relegating other deities where necessary or dispensing with them entirely if they conflicted utterly with the new compelling vision of the worldboth this world and the world belowpresented to him by brightwell garcia was concerned at the wisdom of not intervening once they saw the three men approach the pimp gmack but he would make no move unless brightwell moved first they had just been a little too late minutes earlier and the pimp would have been dead by the time these strangers had found him as garcia watched two of the men took gmack by the arms and led him from his car the third man seemed about to follow then stopped he scanned the alleyway his gaze resting for a moment on the shadows that obscured garcia then moved on his head tilting back as he took in the buildings that surrounded him with their filthy windows and their battered fire escapes after a minute had elapsed he followed his companions from the alley but he kept his back to them retreating from the lot his eyes scanning the dirty windows as though aware of the hostile presence concealed behind them brightwell had decided to kill them he would follow the four men then he and garcia would slaughter them and dispose of them he did not fear them even the black man who moved so quickly and had an air of lethality about him if it were done swiftly and cleanly then the consequences would be limited brightwell was standing in the grimy hallway of an apartment block close by the entrance to the fire escape where a single yellowed window looked down upon the alley below he had taken the precaution of removing the starter from the fluorescent light behind him so that he might not be seen if for any reason the lights were switched on he was about to turn away from the window when the white man in the dark jacket whose back had been to brightwell for the duration of their confrontation with gmack turned and scanned the windows as his gaze fell upon brightwells hiding place brightwell felt something constrict in his throat he took a step closer to the window his right hand instinctively reaching out and touching the glass his fingertips resting against the figure of the man below memories surged through his brain memories of falling fire despair wrath memories of betrayal now the man in the alley was backing away as though he too sensed something hostile a presence that was both unknown yet familiar to him his eyes continued to search the windows above seeking any sign of movement any indication of the source of what he sensed within himself then he disappeared at last from brightwells sight but the fat man did not move instead he closed his eyes and released a trembling breath all thoughts of killing banished from his mind what had so long evaded him was now unexpectedly joyously revealed we have found you at last he thought you are discovered chapter seven as i retreated down the alleyway i tried to put a name on what i had felt as i stared at the window the sense of being watched was strong from the moment that we confronted gmack but i was unable to detect any obvious signs of surveillance we were surrounded by brownstones and warehouses and any one of them could have concealed a watcher maybe just a curious neighbor or even a whore and her john on their way to a slightly pricier assignation in a rundown apartment pausing briefly to take in the men in the alleyway before proceeding on their way conscious always that time was money and the demands of the flesh were pressing it was only when angel and louis began moving gmack and i had a moment to scan the windows one last time that the prickling began at the base of my neck i was conscious of a disturbance in the night as though a silent explosion had occurred somewhere in the distance and the shock waves were approaching the place in which i stood a great force seemed to rush toward me and i half expected to see a shimmering in the air as the circle widened churning garbage and scattering discarded newspapers as it came my attention focused on one particular window on the fourth floor of an old brownstone a fire door close by leading to a rusted fire escape the window was dark but i thought for a moment that i saw a shifting against the glass black momentarily giving way to gray at the center buried memories both alien to me yet almost familiar tried to emerge from my unconscious i sensed them there moving like worms beneath frozen earth or like parasites under the skin desperately seeking to break through and expose themselves to the light i heard a terrible howling and it was as if voices were raised in rage and despair descending from some great height twisting and tumbling through the air their cries distorting and fading as they fell i was among them jostled by the flailing of my brothers hands striking me nails tearing in a desperate attempt to arrest the descent there was fear in me and regret but more than anything else i was filled with a dreadful sense of loss something indescribably precious had been taken from me and i would never see it again and we were burning we were all burning then this halfremembered halfcreated past this phantasm from my mind found itself bound up with real loss for the pain brought back the deaths of my wife and my daughter and the emptiness that their passing had left inside and yet the torment that i had endured on the night that they were taken from me and the awful debilitating pain that followed seemed somehow less than what i now felt in the alleyway the footsteps of my friends slowly growing distant the protestations of the doomed man between them fading away there was only the howling and the emptiness and the figure lost behind yellowed glass reaching out to me something cold touched my cheek like the unwanted caress of a lover once cherished and now rejected i drew back from it and thought that my response had somehow generated a reaction in the hidden figure at the window i sensed its surprise at my presence mutate into manifest hostility and i thought that i had never before been in proximity to such rage any impulse i had to ascend to the upper floor of the building immediately disappeared i wanted to flee to run and hide and reinvent myself somewhere far away to cloak myself in a new identity and lie low in the hope that they would not track me down they he it how did i know this and as i moved slowly away following angel and louis to the busy streets beyond a voice that was once like mine spoke words that i did not understand it said you are discovered we have found you again louis was sitting in the drivers seat of his lexus when i reached them angel was in the back beside gmack who sat sullen and hunched sniffing gently through his ruined nose before i got in beside louis i took a pair of cuffs from my jacket pocket and told gmack to attach one cuff to his right wrist and the other to the armrest of the door when he had done so and his right arm was crossed awkwardly over his body i got in the car and we drove toward brooklyn louis stole a glance at me everything okay back there i looked over my shoulder at gmack but he appeared lost in his own misery and hurt i felt like we were being watched i said quietly there was someone in one of the upper stories if thats true then there was someone on the ground as well you think they were coming for this piece of shit in the back maybe but we got to him first they know about us now i think they knew about us already otherwise why start tidying up the loose ends louis checked the rearview mirror but the nature of the night traffic made it hard to tell if we were being followed it didnt matter we would have to assume that we were and wait to see what developed i think you have more to tell us i said to gmack my man in blue came to me paid me then told me not to ask no questions thats all i know about him how were they going to get to her he said it wasnt none of my business you use a bail bondsman named eddie tager for your girls hell no most of the time they just get pinkslipped anyways they get themselves in some serious shit im gonna have me a talk with them see if we can work something out i aint no charity givin it away to no bondsman i bet youre real understanding about how they pay it back too this is a business nobody gets nothing for free so when alice was arrested what did you do he didnt reply i slapped him once hard on his wounded face answer me i called the number they gave me cell phone yeah you still have the number i remember it bitch blood had dripped onto his lips he spit it onto the floor of the car then recited the number by heart i took out my cell and entered the number then just to be safe wrote it in my notebook i guessed that it wouldnt lead to much if they were smart theyd have disposed of the phone as soon as they had the girl where did alice keep her personal things i said i let her leave some stuff at my place makeup and shit but she stayed with sereta most of the time sereta had her a room up on westchester i wasnt gonna have no junkie whore in my crib when he said the word whore he looked at louis we had learned all that we would from gmack as for louis he did not respond to the pimps goads instead he pulled over to drop me at my car and i followed them to brooklyn williamsburg like the point was once home to some of the wealthiest men in the country there were mansions here and beer gardens and private clubs the whitneys rubbed shoulders with the vanderbilts and lavish buildings were erected all close enough to the sugar refineries and distilleries the shipyards and the foundries for the smell to reach the rich if the wind was blowing the right way williamsburgs status as the playground of the wealthy changed at the beginning of the last century with the opening of the williamsburg bridge european immigrantspoles russians lithuanians italiansfled the crowded slums of the lower east side taking up occupancy of the tenements and the brownstones they were followed by the jews in the thirties and forties who settled mainly in southside among them satmar hasidim from hungary and romania who still congregated in the section northeast of the brooklyn navy yard northside was a little different it was now trendy and bohemian and the fact that bedford avenue was the first stop made by the l train from manhattan meant that it was an easy commute so property prices were going up nevertheless the area had some way to go before it achieved true desirability for those with money in their pockets and it was not about to abandon its old identity without a fight the northside pharmacy on bedford still took care to call itself additionally a farmacia and an apteka edwins fruit and veg store sold zywiec beer from poland advertised with a small neon sign in the window and the meat market remained the polskamasarna there were delis and beauty salons and mikes northstar hardware continued in business but there was also a little coffee shop called reads that sold used books and alternative magazines and the lampposts were dotted with flyers hawking loft spaces for artists studios i hung a right on tenth at raymunds diner with its wooden bierkeller sign illustrated by a beer and a joint of meat one block down at berry stood a warehouse building that still bore the faint traces of its previous existence as a brewery for this area was once the heart of new yorks brewing industry the warehouse was five stories tall and badly scarred by graffiti a fire escape ran down the center of its eastern façade and a banner had been strung across the top floor it read if you lived here youd be home by now someone had crossed out the word home and spray painted the word polish in its place underneath was a telephone number no lights burned in any of the windows i watched louis drive around the block once then park on eleventh i pulled up behind him and walked to his car he was leaning back in his seat talking to gmack you sure this is the place louis asked him yeah im sure if youre lying ill hurt you again gmack tried to hold louiss gaze but failed i know that louis turned his attention to angel and me get out keep an eye on the place im gonna dump my boy here there was nothing that i could say gmack looked worried he had every reason to hey i done told you everythin i know he protested his voice broke slightly louis ignored him im not gonna kill him he said to me i nodded angel got out of the car and we faded into the shadows as louis drove gmack away the present is very fragile and the ground beneath our feet is thin and treacherous beneath it lies the maze of the past a honeycomb network created by the strata of days and years where memories lie buried waiting for the moment when the thin crust above cracks and what was and what is can become one again there is life down there in the honeycomb world and brightwell was now alerting it to his discovery everything had changed for him and new plans would have to be made he called the most private of numbers and saw as the sleepy voice answered that white mote flickering in the darkness they were too quick for us he said they have him and theyre moving but something interesting has emerged louis parked the car in the delivery bay of a chinese food store close by the woodhull medical center on broadway he tossed gmack the key to the cuffs watched silently as he freed his hand then stood back to let him step from the car lie down on your belly please man lie down gmack sank to his knees then stretched flat on the ground spread your arms and your legs im sorry said gmack his face was contorted with fear you got to believe me his head was turned to one side so that he could see louis he began to cry as the suppressor was mounted on the muzzle of the little that louis always carried as backup i do believe youre sorry now i can hear it in your voice please said gmack blood and snot mixed on his lips please this is your last chance have you told us everything yeah i got nothing else i swear to you man you righthanded what i said are you righthanded yeah so i figure you hit the woman with that hand i dont louis took one look around to make sure nobody was near then fired a single shot into the back of gmacks right hand gmack screamed louis took two steps back and fired a second shot into the pimps right ankle gmack gritted his teeth and pressed his forehead against the ground but the pain was too much he raised his damaged right hand and used his left to push himself up and look at his wounded foot now you cant go far if i need to find you again said louis he raised the gun and leveled it at gmacks face youre a lucky man dont forget that but you better pray that i find alice alive he lowered the gun and walked back to the car hospitals across the street he said then drove away apart from the fire escape there appeared to be only one way into or out of the building and that was a single steel door on berry there were no bells or buzzers and no names of residents you think he was lying asked angel louis had rejoined us i didnt ask him about gmack no said louis he wasnt lying open it louis and i took up positions at opposite corners of the building watching the streets while angel worked on the lock it took him five minutes which was a long time for him old locks are good locks he said by way of explanation we slipped inside and pulled the door closed behind us the first floor was an entirely open space that had once been used to house the vats with storage space for barrels and sliding doors to admit trucks the doors were long gone and the entrances bricked up to the right beside what had once been a small office a flight of stairs led up to the next floor there was no elevator the next three floors were similar to the first largely openplan with no signs of habitation the top story was different someone had commenced a halfhearted division of the space into apartments although it looked like the work had been done sometime before then abandoned walls had been erected but most had no doors added so that it was possible to see the empty areas within there appeared to be five or six apartments planned in total but only one seemed to be finished the green entrance door was unmarked and closed i took the left side while angel and louis moved to the right i knocked twice then drew back quickly there was no reply i tried again but with the same result we now had a couple of options neither of which appealed to me either we could try to break down the door or angel could pick the two locks and risk getting his head blown off if someone was inside and listening angel made the choice he got down on one knee spread his little set of tools on the floor then handed one to louis simultaneously they worked the locks both of them trying to shield themselves as best they could by keeping as much of their bodies as possible against the wall it seemed to take a long time but was probably less than a minute eventually both locks turned and they pushed the door open to the left was a galleystyle kitchen with the remains of some fast food on the counter there was cream in the refrigerator with three days remaining before it expired and a paper bag filled with pita bread also apparently fresh apart from some cans of beans and franks and a couple of containers of macaroni and cheese this was the sum total of food in the apartment the entrance hall then led into a lounge area consisting only of a couch an easy chair and a tv and vcr again to the left was the smaller of the apartments two bedrooms the single bed casually made and with a pair of boots and one or two items of clothing visible on a chair by the window with angel covering me i checked the closet but it contained only cheap trousers and shirts we heard a low whistle and followed it to where louis stood in the doorway of a second bedroom to the right his body blocking our view he stepped to one side and we saw what lay within it was a shrine and its inspiration lay in a place far distant from this one and in a past far stranger than any we could imagine iii but thee and me he never can destroy change us he may but not oerwhelm we are of as eternal essence and must war with him if he will war with us lord byron heaven and earth a mystery chapter eight the town of sedlec lies some forty miles from the city of prague an incurious traveler perhaps deterred by the dull suburbs might not even deign to stop here instead opting to press on to the nearby and better known town of kutná hora which has now virtually absorbed sedlec into itself yet it was not always thus for this part of the old kingdom of bohemia was one of the medieval worlds largest sources of silver by the late thirteenth century one third of all europes silver came from this district but silver coins were being minted here as early as the tenth century the silver lured many to this place making it a serious rival to the economic and political supremacy of prague intriguers came and adventurers merchants and craftsmen and where there was power so too there were the representatives of the one power that stands above all where there was wealth there was the church the first cistercian monastery was founded in sedlec by miroslav of cimburk in its monks came from valdsassen abbey in the upper palatinate attracted by the promise of silver ore for valdsassen was one of the morimon line of monasteries associated with mining the cistercians to their credit might charitably be said to have employed a pragmatic attitude toward wealth and its accumulation clearly god himself was smiling upon their endeavors for deposits of silver ore were found on the monasterys lands in the late thirteenth century and the influence of the cistercians grew as a result unfortunately gods attentions quickly turned elsewhere and by the end of the century the monastery suffered the first of its numerous destructions at the hands of hostile men a process that reached its peak in the attack of which left it in smoldering ruins the attack that marked the first coming of the believers sedlec bohemia april the noise of battle had ceased it no longer shook the monastery walls and no more were the monks troubled by fine scatterings of gray dust that descended upon their white garb accumulating in their tonsures so that the young looked old and the old looked older still distant flames still rose to the south and the bodies of the slain were accumulating inside the nearby cemetery gates with more being added to their number every day but the great armies were now silent and watchful the stench was foul but the monks were almost used to it after all these years of dealing with the dead for bones were forever stacked like kindling around the ossuary piled high against the walls as graves were emptied of their occupants and new remains interred in their place in a great cycle of burial decay and display when the wind blew from the east poisonous smoke from the smelting of ore was added to the mix and those forced to work in the open coughed until their robes were dotted with blood the abbot of sedlec stood at the gate of his lodge in the shadow of the monasterys conventual church he was the heir of the great abbot heidenreich diplomat and adviser to kings who had died a century earlier but who had transformed the monastery into a center of influence power and wealthaided by the discovery of great deposits of silver beneath the orders landswhile never forgetting the monks duty toward the less fortunate of gods children thus a cathedral grew alongside a hospital makeshift chapels were constructed among the mining settlements sanctioned by heidenreich and the monks buried great numbers of the dead without stricture or complaint how ironic it was thought the abbot that in heidenrichs successes lay the very seeds that had now grown to doom the community for it had provided a magnet of sorts for the catholic forces and their leader the holy roman emperor sigismund pretender to the bohemian crown his armies were camped around kutná hora and the abbots efforts to keep some distance between the monastery and the emperors forces had proved fruitless sedlecs reputed wealth was a temptation to all and he was already giving shelter to carthusian monks from prague whose monastery had been destroyed some years earlier during the ravages that followed the death of wenceslas iv those who would loot sedlec needed no further incentive to attack yet sigismund by his presence had now made its destruction inevitable it was the killing of the reformer jan hus that had brought these events to pass the abbot had once met hus an ordained priest at the university of prague where he was dean of the faculty of arts and later rector and had been impressed by his zeal nevertheless huss reformist instincts were dangerous the church was in crisis three different popes were making conflicting claims on the papacy john xxiii of the italians who had been forced to flee rome and had taken refuge in germany gregory xxii of the french and benedict xiii for the spaniards the latter pair had already been deposed once but refused to accept their fate in such times huss demands for a bible in czech and his continued insistence on conducting the mass in czech rather than latin inevitably led to his being branded a heretic a charge that was exacerbated by his espousal of the beliefs of the earlier heretic john wycliffe and his branding of the foul john xxiii as the antichrist a view with which the abbot at least in his own soul was reluctant to take issue it was hardly a surprise then when hus was excommunicated summoned to the council of constance in by sigismund to air his grievances hus was imprisoned and tried for heresy he refused to recant and in was taken to the devils place the site of execution in a nearby meadow he was stripped naked his hands and feet were tied to a stake with wet ropes and his neck was chained to a wooden post oil was dumped on his head and kindling and straw piled up to his chin it took half an hour for the flames to catch and hus eventually suffocated from the thick black smoke his body was ripped to pieces his bones were broken and his heart was roasted over an open fire his remains were then cremated the ashes shoveled into the carcass of a steer and the whole lot cast into the rhine huss followers in bohemia were outraged at his death and vowed to defend his teachings to the last drop of blood a crusade was declared against them and sigismund sent an army of twenty thousand into bohemia to quell the uprising but the hussites annihilated them led by jan ziska a oneeyed knight who turned carts into war chariots and called his men warriors of god now sigismund was licking his wounds and planning his next move a peace treaty had been agreed sparing those who would accede to the hussites four articles of prague including the clergys renunciation of all worldly goods and secular authority an article to which the abbot of sedlec was clearly unable to accede earlier that day the citizens of kutná hora had marched to the sedlec monastery around which were gathered the hussite troops to plead for mercy and forgiveness for it was wellknown that huss followers in the town had been thrown alive into the mine shafts and the citizens feared the consequences if they did not bend the knee to the attacking troops the abbot listened while the two sides sang the te deum in acknowledgment of their truce and he felt ill at the hypocrisy involved the hussites would not sack kutná hora for its mining and minting industries were too valuable but they wanted to secure it for themselves nonetheless all of this was mere pretense and the abbot knew that before long both sides would again be at each others throats over the great wealth of the town the hussites had withdrawn some distance from the monastery but he could still see their fires soon they would come and they would spare no one found within its walls he was consumed by anger and regret he loved the monastery he had been party to its most recent constructions and the very raising of its places of worship had in itself been as much an act of contemplation and meditation as the services carried out within them their every stone imbued with spirituality the stern asceticism of the lines a precaution against any distraction from prayer and contemplation its church the greatest of its kind in the land was patterned on a latin cross achieving a harmony with the natural formation of the regions river valley by featuring a central axis that oriented the choir down the rivers stream rather than toward the east yet the conventual church was also a complex variant on the original plans drawn up by the orders chief propagator bernard of clairvaux and so it was imbued with his love of music which manifested itself in his faith in the mysticism of numbers based on augustines theory of music and its application to the proportions of buildings purity and balance were expressions of divine harmony and thus the conventual church of the assumption of our lady and saint john the baptist was a beautiful silent hymn to god every column a note every perfect arch a te deum now this wondrous structure was at risk of total destruction even though in its simplicity and absence of unnecessary adornment it symbolized the very qualities that the reformists should have prized the most almost without realizing he was doing so the abbot reached into the folds of his garment and removed a small stone embedded in it was a tiny creature unlike anything the abbot had ever seen walk crawl or swim now turned to stone itself petrified as though caught in a basilisks stare it resembled a snail except its shell was larger its spirals closer together one of the laborers had found it while quarrying by the river and had given it to the abbot as a gift it was said that this place had once been covered by a great sea now long since gone and the abbot wondered if this little animal had lived by the oceans gift before it found itself marooned as the sea retreated and was slowly absorbed by the land perhaps it was a relic of the great flood if so then its twin must yet exist elsewhere on the earth but secretly the abbot hoped that such a thing was not true he prized it because it was unique and he thought it both sad and beautiful in the transience of its nature its time had passed just as the abbots time was now drawing to a close he feared the hussites but he knew too that there were others who threatened the survival of the monastery and it was simply a matter of which enemy breached its gates first rumors had reached the abbots ears stories meant for him and him alone tales of mercenaries marked with a twinpronged brand their number led by a captain with a blemished eye his footsteps forever shadowed by a fat imp of a man ugly and tumerous it was unclear to which side the captains soldiers offered their allegiance according to his sources but the abbot supposed that it did not matter such men assumed flags of convenience to hide their true aims and their loyalty was a fire that burned cold and fast leaving only ash in its wake he knew what they were seeking despite the beliefs of ignorant men there was little true wealth left at sedlec the monasterys most famed treasure a monstrance made from goldplated silver had been entrusted to the augustinians at klosterneuburg six years earlier those who sacked this place would find little in the way of ecclesiastical riches to divide among themselves but the captain was not interested in such trifles and so the abbot had set about preparing for what was to come even as the threat of destruction drew closer sometimes the monks heard distant orders shouted at other times they listened to the screaming of the injured and the dying at the gates still they did not pause in their work horses were saddled and a huge covered cart one of two specially constructed for the abbots purposes lay waiting by the hidden entrance to the monastery garden its wheels were sunk deep into the mud driven down by the weight of the cargo that it carried the horses were wideeyed and foamflecked as though aware of the nature of the burden that was being placed upon them it was almost time a great sentence is gone forth against thee he shall bind thee heresy thought the abbot as the words came unbidden to him even possession of the book of enoch condemned as false scripture would be enough to draw the charge down upon his head and thus he had taken great pains to ensure that the work remained hidden nevertheless in its contents he had found answers to many of the questions that had troubled him among them the nature of the terrible beautiful creation entrusted to his care and the duty of concealment that now lay upon him cast him into darkness throw upon him hurled and pointed stones covering him with darkness there shall he remain for ever cover his face that he may not see the light and in the great day of judgment let him be cast into the fire the abbots lodge lay at the heart of the monasterys concentric fortifications the first circle in which he now stood housed the conventual church reserved for the use of the orders initiated members the convent building and the cloister gallery on the side of the churchs transept opposite the river lay the gate of the deceased which led into the churchyard it was the most important portal in the monastery its intricate sculpture standing in sharp contrast to the starkness of the architecture surrounding it this was the gateway between earthly life and the eternal between this world and the next the abbot had hoped to be carried through it one day and buried alongside his brothers those who had already fled upon his instructions had been requested to return when it was safe and to seek out his remains if the gate still stood he was to be brought through it if it did not a place was still to be found for him so that he might rest beside the ruins of the chapel that he so loved the second circle belonged to the initiated members and also contained the granary and a sacred plot of land at the entrance portal to the church used to grow grain for the baking of the host within the third circle was the monastery gate a church for lay members of the order outside worshippers and pilgrims living quarters and gardens and the main cemetery the abbot stared out upon these walls that protected the monastery their lines clear even in the darkness thanks to the false dawn of the fires on the hillsides it looked like a vision of hell he thought the abbot did not believe that christian men should fight over god but more than those who killed in the name of a forgiving god he hated those who used the name of god as an excuse to extend their own power he sometimes thought that he could almost understand the anger of the hussites although he kept such opinions to himself those who did not might quickly find themselves broken upon a wheel or burning on a pyre for their temerity he heard footsteps approach and a young novice appeared by his side he wore a sword and his robes were filthy from his exertions all is ready said the novice the servants ask if they may muffle the horses hooves and wrap cloth around the bridles they are concerned that the noise will bring the soldiers down upon them the abbot did not answer immediately to the younger man it seemed that the abbot had just been offered a final possibility of escape and was tempted to accept it at last he sighed and like the beasts bound to the cart accepted his inevitable burden no he said let there be no silencing of hooves no wrapping of bridles they must make haste and they must create noise as they do so but then they will be found and they will be killed the abbot turned to his novice and laid his hand gently upon the boys cheek as god wills it so it shall be done he said now you must go and take as many with you as it is safe to allow what about you i but the abbots words were cut off by the barking of dogs in the outer circles the monastery had been abandoned by many of those who might otherwise have come to its defense and now only animals roamed behind the second and third walls the sound the dogs made was panicked almost hysterical their fear was palpable as though a wolf were about to enter into their presence and they knew that they would die fighting it the young novice drew his sword come he urged there are soldiers approaching the abbot found that he was unable to move his feet would not respond to the urgings of his brain and his hands were trembling no soldiers could make the dogs respond in such a way that was why he had ordered their release the dogs would smell them and alert the monks to their approach then the twin gates of the inner wall were blown apart one flying free of its hinges and landing amid a copse of trees the other left hanging like a sot at nights end the fleeing dogs leaped through the gap those that were too slow killed by arrows that shot from the shadows beyond the gate go said the abbot make sure the cart reaches the road with one last frightened glance at the gates and with sorrow in his eyes the novice fled in his place a pair of servants joined the abbot they bore halberds and were very old they had remained at the monastery as much out of their inability to flee far as out of any loyalty to the abbot slowly a group of horsemen emerged from beyond the wall and entered the inner circle most wore plain formfitting breastplates with mail at the groin armpits and elbows three had cylindrical italian sallet helmets on their heads their features barely distinguishable through the tshaped frontal gap the rest had long hair that hung about their faces concealing them almost as well as the helmets of their fellows from their saddles dangled human remains scalps and hands and garlands of ears the flanks of their horses were white with spit and foam and the animals looked close to madness only one man was on foot he was huge and fat and his neck was swollen with some dreadful purple goiter on his upper body he wore a long brigandine for armor constructed from small metal plates riveted to a textile covering for his build was too deformed for the fitted protection worn by his allies there were plates made in a similar manner on his thighs and shins but his head was bare he was very pale with almost feminine features and large green eyes in his hand he grasped a womans head his long fingers entwined in her hair the abbot recognized her face even twisted in the torments of death an idiot who sat outside the monastery gates begging for alms too foolish to flee her post even in wartime as he and his fellows drew closer the abbot could see a crudely drawn symbol upon their saddles a red grapnel newly created with the blood of their victims and then their leader emerged from the heart of his men he rode a black horse a spiked half shaffron protecting its head and a peytral guarding its chest all intricately carved in black and silver he was clad almost entirely in black armor apart from the hood upon his head pauldrons extending over his chest and shoulder blades gauntlets with long protective cuffs and tassets to cover the vulnerable spot at the top of his cuisses where his breastplate ended and his thigh armor began his only weapon was a long sword which remained in its scabbard the abbot began to pray silently who are they whispered one of the servants jans men the abbot found enough spittle to moisten his mouth and to free his tongue to speak no he said not jans and not men from the rear of the monastery he thought he discerned the sound of the cart moving forward urged on by its driver hooves beat a slow cadence upon grass then upon earth as they moved onto the road the speed of their timpani slowly increased as they tried to put some distance between themselves and the monastery the leader of the horsemen raised his hand and six men split from the main party and galloped around the chapel to cut off those who were fleeing six more dismounted but remained with their leader slowly moving in on the abbot and his men all bore crossbows already spanned with the bolt ready to be fired they were smaller and lighter than any the abbot had seen before with a crannequin for pulling back the bow steel that was portable enough to be worn on their belts they fired the bolts and the abbots servants fell the captain dug his spurs into his horses flanks the animal advanced and the captains shadow fell across the old monk the horse stopped so close to the abbot that moisture from its nose sprayed his face the captain kept his head low and slightly turned away from the monk so that his face could not be seen where is it he said his voice was cracked and hoarse from the screams of battle we have nothing of value here said the abbot a sound came from beneath the folds of the captains hood it might almost have been a laugh had a snake found a way to convey humor in its hiss he commenced freeing his hands from the gauntlets your mines made you wealthy he said you could not have spent it all on trinkets it may be that you yet have much of value to some but not to me i seek one thing only and you know what it is the abbot stepped forward with his right hand he gripped the cross around his neck it is gone he said in the distance he heard horses neighing wildly and the impact of metal upon metal as his men fought to protect the cart and its cargo they should have left sooner he realized his act of concealment might not have been revealed so quickly had they done so the captain leaned over his horses neck the gauntlets were now gone his fingers revealed to the moonlight were scored by white scars he raised his head and listened to the cries of the monks as they were slaughtered by his men they died for nothing he said their blood is on your hands the abbot grasped his cross more tightly its edges tore his skin and blood leaked through his fingers as though giving substance to the captains words go back to hell said the abbot the captain lifted his hands to his hood and threw back the rough material from around his face dark hair surrounded his beautiful features and his skin seemed almost to glow in the cool night air he extended his right hand and a crossbow was placed in his grasp by the grinning imp at his side the abbot saw a white mote flicker in the blackness of the captains right eye and in his final moments it was given unto him to see the face of god never said the captain and the abbot heard the dull report of the crossbow at the instant the bolt penetrated his chest he stumbled back against the doorway and slid slowly down the wall at a signal from the captain his men began entering the buildings of the inner circle their footsteps echoing on the slabs as they ran a small group of armed servants emerged from behind the conventual church rushing forward to engage the intruders in the confined space more time the abbot thought we need more time his monks and servants what few remained were putting up fierce resistance preventing the captains soldiers from entering the church and the inner buildings just a little longer my lord he prayed just a little the captain looked down upon the abbot listening to his words the abbot felt his heart slow just as the captains men flanked the monks on the steps and entered the chapel ascending the walls and crawling like lizards across the stones one moved upside down across the ceiling then dropped behind the defenders and impaled the rearmost man upon the end of a sword the abbot wept for them even as the cool tip of a bolt touched his forehead the captains lieutenant bloated and poisonous was now kneeling by his side his mouth open and his head tilted as though preparing to deliver a last kiss to a lover i know what you are the abbot whispered and you will never find the one that you seek a pale finger tightened on the trigger this time the abbot did not hear the shot it was not until the eighteenth century that the cistercians of sedlec were able to commence their reconstruction in earnest including the restoration of the church of the assumption left roofless and vaultless after the hussite wars seven chapels now form a ring around its presbytery and its baroque interiors are decorated with art although these interiors are hidden from the sight of the public as its restoration continues and yet this stunning structure perhaps the most impressive of its type in the czech republic is not the most interesting aspect of sedlec a rotary stands near the church and at this rotary there is a sign that reads kosnice pointing to the right those who follow it will come to a small relatively modest house of worship seated at the center of a muddy graveyard this is all saints church built in revaulted in the seventeenth century and reconstructed in the eighteenth century by the architect santiniaichel who was also responsible for much of the restoration work on the chapel of the assumption it can be entered through an extension added by santiniaichel after it was discovered that the front of the church had begun to tilt a staircase to the right leads up to all saints chapel where once candles were lit for the dead in the two towerlets behind the chapel itself even in the spring sunlight there is little about all saints that might attract more than a casual second glance from the windows of an airconditioned bus after all there are the wonders of kutná hora to be seen with its narrow little streets its perfectly preserved buildings and the great mass of saint barbaras dominating all but all saints is not as it might seem from the outside for it is in fact two structures the first the chapel is aboveground the second known as jesus christ on the mount of olives lies below while what is above is a monument to the prospect of a better life beyond this one what lies beneath is a testament to the transience of all things mortal it is a strange place a buried place and none who spend time among its wonders can ever forget it legend tells that jindrich an abbot of sedlec brought back with him from the holy land a sack of soil that he scattered over the cemetery it came to be regarded as an outpost of the holy land itself and people from all across europe were buried there alongside plague victims and those who had fallen in the many conflicts waged in its surrounding fields these bones at last became so plenteous that something had to be done with them and in the task of disposing of them was reputedly entrusted to a halfblind monk he arranged an accumulation of skulls into pyramids and so began the great work that would become the ossuary at sedlec in the aftermath of emperor joseph iis reforms the monastery was purchased by the orlik line of the schwarzenberg family but development of the ossuary continued a woodcarver named františek rint was brought in and his imagination was allowed free rein from the remains of forty thousand people rint created a monument to death a great chandelier of skulls hangs from the ossuary ceiling skulls form the base for its candleholders each resting on pelvic arches with a humerus clasped beneath its upper jaw where delicate crystals should hang bones dangle vertically connecting the skulls to the central support via a system of vertebrae there are more bones here small and large forming the support itself and adorning the chains that anchor the skulls to the ceiling great lines of skulls each clasping a bone beneath its jaw line the arches of the ossuary at each side of the chandelier they hang in loops and form four narrow pyramids in the center of the floor creating a square beneath the chandelier each skull capable of holding a single candle in the center of the cranium there are other wonders too a monstrance made of bone with a skull at its center where the host should be six femurs radiating from behind smaller bones and vertebrae interwoven with them bones mask the wooden support around which the monstrance has been constructed and its base is a u ending at either side in another skull even the schwarzenberg family coat of arms is formed of bone with a crown of skulls and pelvises at its peak those bones that have not found a practical use are stored in great piles beneath stone arches here the dead sleep here are treasures seen and unseen here is temptation and here is evil chapter nine the windows in the room were covered with sheets of metal riveted to the walls preventing any natural light from entering there were pieces of bone on a workbench ribs a radius and ulnae sections of skull a smell of urine added a sharp unpleasant character to the stale air in the room beneath the bench were four or five wooden packing crates containing straw and paper against the far wall to the right of the blackedout windows was a console table at each end rested more skulls all missing their lower jaw with what appeared to be a bone from the upper arm clasped beneath the upper mandible a hole had been made in the tops of the skulls into which candles had been inserted they flickered illuminating the figure that hovered behind them it was black about two feet in height and appeared to be made from a combination of human and animal remains the wing of a large bird had been carefully stripped of its skin and feathers and the bones skillfully fixed in place so that the wing stood outstretched as though the creature to which it belonged were about to take flight the wing was fixed to a section of spine from which a small rib cage also curled it might have belonged to a child or a monkey but i couldnt tell which to the left of the spine there was instead of a second wing a skeletal arm with all of the bones in place down to the tiny fingers the arm was raised the fingers grasping they ended in small sharp nails the right leg looked like the back leg of a cat or dog judging by the angle of the joint the left was clearly closer to that of a human but was unfinished the wire frame visible from the ankle down the fusion of animal and man was clearest though in the head which was slightly out of proportion to the rest of the figure whoever had crafted it possessed an artistry to match his disturbed vision a multiplicity of different creatures had been used to create it and i had to look closely to find the lines where one ended and another began half of a primates jaw was carefully attached to that of a child while the upper part of the facial area between jaws and forehead had been formed using sections of white bone and bird heads finally horns emerged from the top of a human skull one barely visible and resembling the node on the head of an immature deer the other ramlike and curling around the back of the skull almost touching the statues small clavicle if this guy is subletting hes in a shitload of trouble said angel louis was examining one of the skulls upon the workbench his face barely inches from its empty sockets they look old i said answering a question that had not been asked he nodded then left the room i heard him moving boxes around searching for some clue as to the whereabouts of alice i followed the smell of urine to the bathroom the tub contained more bones all soaking in yellow liquid the stink of ammonia made my eyes water i made a cursory search of the cabinets a handkerchief pressed to my nose and mouth then closed the door behind me angel was still examining the bone statue apparently fascinated by it i wasnt surprised the creation looked like it belonged in an art gallery or a museum it was repugnant but breathtaking in its artistry and in the fluidity with which one creatures remains flowed into the next i just cant figure out what the hell this is supposed to be he asked it looks like a man changing into a bird or a bird changing into a man you see a lot of birds with horns i said angel reached out a finger to touch the protuberances on the skull then thought better of it i guess its not a bird then i guess not i took a piece of newspaper from the floor and used it to lift one of the skull candlesticks from the table then shined my mini maglite inside there were serial numbers of some kind etched into the bone i examined the others and all had similar markings except for one that was adorned with the symbol of a twopronged fork and rested on a pelvic bone i took one of the numbered skulls and placed it in a tea chest then carefully added the forked skull and the statue i took the box into the next room where louis was kneeling on the floor before him stood an open suitcase it contained tools among them scalpels files and small bone saws all carefully packed away in canvas pockets and a pair of videocassettes each was labeled along the side with a long line of initials and dates he was getting ready to leave said louis looks like it he gestured at the chest in my hands you found something maybe there are marks on these skulls id like someone to take a look at them perhaps at the statue too louis removed one of the cassettes from the case placed it in the vcr then turned on the tv there was nothing to be seen for a time except static then the picture cleared it showed an area of yellow sand and stone across which the camera panned jerkily before coming to rest upon the partially clothed body of a young woman she lay facedown upon the ground and there was blood upon her back her legs and the oncewhite shorts that she wore her dark hair was spread across the sand like tendrils of ink in dirty water the young woman stirred a male voice spoke in what sounded like spanish i think he said that shes still alive said louis a figure appeared in front of the camera the cameraman moved slightly to get a better shot a pair of expensive black boots came into view no said another voice in english the camera was pushed away preventing it from getting a clear view of the man or the girl it picked up a sound like a coconut cracking someone laughed the cameraman recovered himself and focused once again on the girl there was blood flowing across the sand around her head puta it was the first voice again whore the tape went blank for a moment then resumed this time the girl had yellow highlights in her dark hair but the surroundings were similar sand and rocks a bug stalked across a smear of blood close by her mouth the only part of her face that was visible beneath her hair a hand reached out sweeping the hair back so that the cameraman could get a better view of her then that section ended and a new one began with another dead girl this one naked on a rock louis fastforwarded the tape i lost track of the number of women when he was done he inserted the second cassette and did the same once or twice a girl with darker skin appeared and he stopped the image examining it closely before moving on all of the women were hispanic im going to call the cops i told him not yet this guy aint gonna leave this shit here for just anyone to find hell come back for it and soon if youre right about being watched in the alley then whoever lives here could be outside right now i say we wait i thought about what i was going to say to him before i opened my mouth rachel had she been present to witness it might have considered this progress on my part louis we dont have time to wait around the cops can do surveillance better than we can this guy is a link but maybe we can pick up the chain farther on the longer we stay still the more the chances diminish of finding alice before something bad happens to her ive seen people even experienced cops fall into the trap of using the past tense when talking about a missing person thats why sometimes it pays to work out in your head what youre planning to say before the words start spilling out of your mouth i gently lifted the box i was holding stay here for a while longer see what else you can find if i cant get back here first ill call you and give you time to get out before i talk to the cops garcia sat in his car a yellow toyota and watched the men enter his apartment he guessed that the pimp was smarter than he had appeared to be because there was no other way that they could have found his base so quickly the pimp had followed someone to garcia probably in an effort to gain some room for maneuver in case his betrayal of the girl rebounded on him garcia was furious a day or two later and the apartment would have been empty its occupant gone there was much in those rooms that was valuable to garcia he wanted it back yet brightwells instructions had been clear follow them and find out where they go but dont hurt them or attempt to engage them if they separated he was to stay with the man in the leather jacket the one who had lingered in the alleyway as though aware of their presence the fat man had appeared distracted as he left garcia but also strangely excited garcia knew better than to ask him why dont hurt them but that was before brightwell knew where they were going now they were in garcias place and close to what they were seeking although they might not recognize it if they saw it nevertheless if they called the police then garcia would become a marked man in this country just as he was back home and he might also be at risk from the very people who were sheltering him if his exposure threatened to bring down trouble on their heads garcia tried to recall if there was any way of connecting brightwell to him through whatever remained in the apartment he didnt believe so but he had watched some of the cop shows on tv and sometimes it seemed like they could perform miracles using only dust and dirt then he considered all of his hard work in recent months the great effort of construction for which he had been brought to the city this too was threatened by the presence of the visitors if they discovered it or decided to report whatever they found in garcias apartment then all would be undone garcia was proud of what had been built it was worthy to stand alongside the capuchin church in rome the church behind the farnese palace even sedlec itself garcia took out his cell brightwells number was to be called only in an emergency but garcia figured that this qualified he entered the digits and waited theyre at my place he said once the fat man answered what remains tools said garcia materials anything that i should be concerned about garcia considered his options then made his decision no he lied then walk away i will garcia lied again when im done he touched his fingers to the small relic that hung from a silver chain amid the hairs of his chest it was a shard of bone taken from the body of the woman for whom these men were searching these trespassers on garcias sacred place garcia had dedicated the relic to his guardian to santa muerte and now it was imbued with her spirit her essence muertecita he whispered as his anger grew reza por mi sarah yeates was one of those people you needed in your life apart from being smart and funny she was also a treasure trove of esoteric information a status that was due at least in part to her work in the library of the museum of natural history she was darkhaired looked about ten years younger than her age and had the kind of personality that scared off dumb men and forced the smart ones to think fast on their feet i wasnt sure what category i fell into where sarah was concerned i hoped i was in the second group but i sometimes suspected that i might be included by default and sarah was just waiting for a vacancy to open up in the first group so she could file me there instead i called her at home it took her a few rings to answer and when she did her voice was foggy with sleep huh she said hello to you too who is this charlie parker am i calling at a bad time you are if youre trying to be funny you do know what time it is right late yeah which is what youll be if you dont have a good reason for calling me its important i need to pick your brain about something i heard her sigh and sink back into her pillow go on i have some items that ive found in an apartment theyre human bones some have been made into candlesticks theres also a statue of some kind constructed from human and animal remains mixed together i found a bath of urine with bones in it so i think someone was treating them for some reason pretty soon im going to have to call the cops and tell them what ive found so i dont have long youre the first person ive woken over this but i expect to wake others before the night is through is there anyone in the museum or even outside it who might be able to tell me something i can use sarah was quiet for so long that i thought shed fallen asleep again sarah i said jeez youre impatient she said give a girl time to think there were noises from the other end of the line as she got out of bed told me to hold on then put the phone down i waited hearing drawers opening and closing in the background eventually she came back im not going to give you the names of anyone at the museum because id kind of like to keep my job it pays my rent you know and enables me to keep a telephone so dipshits who dont even remember to send a christmas card can call me in the dead of night asking for my help i didnt know you were religious thats not the point i like presents ill make it up to you this year youd better okay if this runs dry ill arrange for you to talk to some people in the morning but this is the guy you need to meet anyway you got a pen right well you also have a namesake his name is neddo charles neddo hes got a place down in cortlandt alley the plate beside his door says hes an antique dealer but the front of the store is full of junk he wouldnt make enough out of it to feed flies if it werent for his sidelines which are he deals in what collectors term esoterica occult stuff mainly but hes been known to sell artifacts that you dont generally find outside of museum basements he keeps that merchandise in a locked room behind a curtain at the back of the store ive been in there once or twice so i know what im talking about i seem to recall seeing items similar to the ones youre talking about although neddos equivalents would be pretty old hes the place to start though he lives above the store go wake him up and let me get back to sleep will he cooperate with a stranger he will if the stranger offers him something in return just be sure to bring along your finds if theyre interesting to him then youll learn something thanks sarah yeah whatever i hear you found a girlfriend howd that happen good luck yours i think not hers dont forget my present then she hung up louis moved through the unfinished floor framed by doorways and lit by moonlight until he came at last to the window the window did not look onto the street instead it showed louis the dimly lit interior of a whitetiled room in the center of the room over a drain in the sloped floor a chair had been fixed there were leather restraints on the arms and the legs louis opened the door and entered the white room a shape moved to his left and he almost fired at it before he saw his own reflection in the twoway glass he knelt down by the drain the floor the drain all were clean even the chair had been scrubbed the grain cleansed of any trace of those who had occupied it he smelled disinfectant and bleach his gloved fingers touched the wood of the armrest then gripped it tightly not here he thought dont let her life have ended here cortlandt alley was a monkey puzzle of fire escapes and hanging wires neddos storefront was black and the only clue to his business was a small brass plate on the brickwork with the words neddo antiques a black castiron screen protected the glass but the interior was concealed by gray drapes that had not been moved in a very long time and the whole storefront looked like it had recently been sprayed with dust to the left of the glass was a black steel door with an intercom beside it inset with a camera lens the windows above were all dark i had seen no trace of anyone watching the apartment building when i left angel covered me from the door as i went to my car and i took the most circuitous route that i could to manhattan once or twice i thought i saw a beatup yellow toyota a couple of cars behind me but it was gone by the time i got to cortlandt alley i pressed the button on the intercom it was answered within seconds by a man and he didnt sound like hed just been woken up im looking for charles neddo i said who are you my name is parker im a private investigator its a little late to be calling isnt it its important how important the alley was empty and i could see no one on the street i took the statue from the bag and carefully holding it by its plinth displayed it before the lens this important i said show me some id i juggled the statue found my wallet and flipped it open nothing happened for a time then the voice said wait there he took his time any longer and i could have put down roots eventually i heard the sound of a key in the lock and bolts being drawn back the door opened and a man stood before me segmented by a series of strong security chains he was late middleaged with pointed tufts of gray hair sticking up from his skull that gave him the appearance of an ageing punk his eyes were very small and round and his mouth was set in a plump scowl he wore a bright green robe that seemed to have trouble stretching all the way around his body beneath it i could see black trousers and a white shirt wrinkled but clean your identification again please he said i want to be sure i handed him my license maine he said there are some good stores in maine you mean ll bean the scowl deepened i was talking about antiques well i suppose youd better come in we cant have you standing around in the dead of night he partially closed the door undid the chains then stepped aside to let me enter inside a flight of worn steps led up to what i assumed were neddos living quarters while to the right a door gave access to the store itself it was through this door that neddo led me past glass display cases filled with antique silver between rows of battered chairs and scuffed tables until we came to a small back room furnished with a telephone a huge gray filing cabinet that looked like it belonged in a soviet bureaucrats office and a desk lit by a lamp with an adjustable arm and a magnifying glass fitted halfway down its length a curtain at the rear of the office had been pulled across almost far enough to conceal the door behind it neddo sat down at the desk and removed a pair of glasses from the pocket of his dressing gown give it to me he said i placed the statue on a plinth then removed the skulls and laid them at either side of it neddo barely glanced at the skulls instead his attention was focused on the bone sculpture he didnt touch it directly instead using the plinth to turn it while employing a large magnifying glass to peruse it in great detail he did not speak throughout his examination at last he pushed it away and removed his glasses what made you think id be interested in this he said he was trying very hard to remain pokerfaced but his hands were trembling shouldnt you have asked me that before you invited me in the fact that im here in your office kind of answers your question for you neddo grunted let me rephrase it then who led you to believe that i might be interested in such an item sarah yeates she works at the museum of natural history the librarian a bright girl i greatly enjoyed her occasional visits the scowl on neddos face relaxed slightly and his little eyes grew animated judging by his words it was clear that sarah didnt come around so much anymore and from the expression on his faceone of mingled lust and regreti was pretty sure why sarah now kept her distance from him do you always work so late he said i could ask you the same question i dont sleep very much i am troubled by insomnia he slipped on a pair of plastic gloves and turned his attention to the skulls i noticed that he handled them delicately almost respectfully as though fearing to commit some desecration on the remains it was hard to think of anything worse than what had already been done but then i was no expert the pelvic bone upon which the skull rested jutted out slightly from beneath the jaw like an ossified tongue neddo laid it on a piece of black velvet and adjusted the lamp so that the skull shone where did you get these in an apartment there were others like this i didnt know how much to tell him my hesitation gave me away im guessing that there were since you seem reluctant to answer never mind tell me how exactly were these skulls placed when you found them im not sure what you mean were they arranged in a particular way were they resting on anything else i thought about the question there were four bones to one side of the statue and between the skulls piled one on top of the other they were curved they looked like sections of hip behind it was a length of vertebrae probably from the base of a spine neddo nodded it was incomplete youve seen something like this before neddo lifted the skull and gazed into the empty sockets of its eyes oh yes he said softly he turned to me dont you think that theres something beautiful about it mr parker dont you find edifying the idea that someone would take bones and use them to create a piece of art no i said with more force than i should have used neddo looked at me over the tops of his glasses and why is that ive met people before who tried to make art out of bone and blood i didnt much care for them neddo waved a hand in dismissal nonsense he said i dont know what manner of men youre speaking of but faulkner i said neddo stopped talking it was a guess nothing more but anyone who was interested in such matters could not help but know of the reverend faulkner and perhaps also of others whom i had encountered i needed neddos help and if that meant dangling the promise of revelations before him then i was content to do that yes he said after a time and now he seemed to be looking at me with renewed interest yes the reverend faulkner was such an individual you met him wait wait youre the one arent you youre the detective who found him yes i remember now faulkner vanished so they say neddo was now rigid with excitement then you saw it you saw the book i saw it there was no beauty to it he made it from skin and bone people died for its creation neddo shook his head still i would give a great deal to look upon it whatever you may say or feel about him he was a part of a tradition the book did not exist in isolation there were others like it not so ornate perhaps or so ambitious in their construction but the raw materials remain the same and such anthropodermic bindings are sought after items among collectors of a certain mien anthropodermic bindings made of human skin said neddo matteroffactly the library of congress holds a copy of the scrutinium scripturarum printed in strasbourg some time before it was presented to the library by one dr vollbehr who noted that its wooden boards had been covered in human skin during the nineteenth century it is claimed also that the harvard law librarys second volume of juan gutierrezs practicarum quaestionum circa leges regias hispaniae liber secundus from the seventeenth century is similarly bound with the skin of one jonas wright although the identity of the gentleman remains in question then there is the boston athenaeums copy of the highwayman by james allen or george walton as the scoundrel was also known a most unusual item upon allens death a section of his epidermis was removed and tanned to look like deerskin then used to bind a copy of his own book which was then presented to one john fenno jr who had narrowly escaped death at allens hands during a robbery that i have seen although i cant vouch for any of the others i seem to recall that it had a most unusual smell so you see that regardless of any feelings of disgust or animosity you may have for the reverend faulkner he was by no means unique in his efforts unpleasant perhaps and probably homicidal but an artist of sorts nevertheless which brings us to this item he placed it back upon the velvet once again the person who made this was also working in a tradition that of using human remains as ornamentation or memento mori if you prefer you know what mem he stopped he looked almost embarrassed of course you do im sorry now that youve mentioned faulkner i recall the rest and the other one terrible just terrible and yet beneath the veneer of sympathy i could see his fascination bubble and i knew that if he could he would have asked me about it all faulkner the book the traveling man the chance would never come his way again and his frustration was almost palpable where was i he said yes bones as ornamentation and so neddo began to speak and i listened and learned from him in medieval times the word church referred not merely to the building itself but to the area around it including the chimiter or cemetery processions and services were sometimes held within the courtyard or atrium of the church and similarly when it came to the disposal of the bodies of the dead people were buried within the main building against its walls even under the rain spouts or sub stillicidio as it was termed as the rainwater was adjudged to have received the sanctity of the church while running down its roof and walls cemetery usually meant the outer church area the atrium in latin or aitre in french but the french also had another word for aitre the charnier or charnel house it came to mean a particular part of the cemetery namely the galleries along the churchyard above which were placed ossuaries thus as neddo explained it a churchyard in the middle ages typically had four sides of which the church itself generally formed one with the three remaining walls decorated with arcades or porticoes in which the bodies of the dead were placed rather like the cloisters of a monastery which themselves served as cemeteries for the monks above the porticoes the skulls and limbs of the dead would be stored once they had dried out sufficiently frequently arranged in artistic compositions most of the bones came from the fosses aux pauvres the great common graves of the poor in the center of the atrium these were little more than ditches thirty feet deep and fifteen or twenty feet across into which the dead were cast sewn up in their shrouds sometimes as many as fifteen hundred in a single pit covered by a thin layer of dirt their remains easy prey for wolves and the grave robbers who supplied the anatomists the soil was so putrefying that bodies quickly rotted and it was said of some common graves such as les innocents in paris and alyscamps in the alps that they could consume a body in as few as nine days a quality regarded as miraculous as one ditch filled another older one was opened up and emptied of its bones which were then put to use in the ossuaries even the remains of the wealthy were pressed into service although they were first buried in the church building typically interred in the dirt beneath its flagstones up to the seventeenth century it mattered little to most people where their bones ended up just as long as they remained in the vicinity of the church so it was common to see human remains in the galleries of the charnels or the church porch even in small chapels specially designed for the purpose churches and crypts decorated in such a manner were thus not uncommon concluded neddo but the model for this construction is most particular i think sedlec in the czech republic his fingers traced the contours of the skull then inserted themselves into the gap at the base of the head so that he could touch the cavity within as i watched his body grew tense he stole a glance at me but i pretended not to notice i picked up a silver scalpel with a bone handle and proceeded to examine it watching in the blade as neddo turned the skull upside down and allowed the lamplight to illuminate what was inside while his attention was distracted i drew aside the curtain at the back of the office you have to go now i heard him say and his tone had changed interest and curiosity had been replaced by alarm the door behind the curtain was closed but not locked i opened it from behind me i heard neddo give a shout but he was too late i was already inside the room was tiny barely the size of a closet and lit by a pair of red bulbs inset into the wall four skulls sat in a neat line beside a sink that smelled strongly of cleaning products there were more bones on shelves lining the room sorted according to size and the area of the skeleton from which they had come i saw pieces of flesh suspended in glass jars hands feet lungs a heart seven containers of yellowing liquid stood in a small glass cabinet apparently specially constructed to hold them each held a fetus in varying stages of development the last jar exhibiting a child that appeared fully formed to my eye elsewhere there were picture frames made from femurs an array of flutes of different sizes constructed from hollowedout bones even a chair built from human remains with a red velvet cushion at its heart like a slab of raw meat i saw crude candlesticks and crosses and a deformed skull made monstrous by some terrible disorder of the body that had caused cauliflowerlike growths to explode from the forehead you must leave said neddo he was panicked although i didnt know whether that was due to the fact that i had entered his storeroom or because of what he had felt and seen in the interior of the skull you shouldnt be here theres nothing more that i can tell you you havent told me anything at all i said take everything to the museum in the morning take all of it to the police if you wish but i cant help you any further i picked up one of the skulls from beside the sink put that down said neddo i turned the skull in my hand it had a neat hole low down close to where the vertebrae would once have connected to it i could see similar holes in the other skulls they were execution shots you must do well when there are revivals of hamlet i said i let the skull rest on my palm alas poor yorick a fellow of infinite jest as long as you understood a little chinese i showed him the hole in the skull china is where these skulls came from right there arent too many other places where people get executed so neatly who do you think paid for the bullet mr neddo isnt that how it works in china you get driven in a truck to a football stadium then someone shoots you in the head and sends the bill to your relatives except these poor souls probably didnt have any relatives to claim them so some enterprising individuals took it upon themselves to sell their remains maybe they first harvested the liver the kidneys even the heart then stripped the flesh from the bones and offered the rest to you or someone like you there must be a law against trading in the remains of executed prisoners dont you think neddo took the skull from my hand and returned it to its place beside the others i dont know what youre talking about he said it sounded hollow tell me about what i brought or ill inform some people of what you have here i said your life will become very difficult as a result i guarantee it neddo stepped out of the closet doorway and returned to his desk you knew it was there didnt you the mark inside the skull he said i felt it with my fingertips just like you did what is it neddo appeared to be growing smaller as i watched deflating in his chair even his robe suddenly seemed to fit him less snugly the numbers inside the first skull indicate that its origins were recorded he said it may have come from a body donated to medical science or from an old museum display in any event it was originally legitimately acquired the second skull bears no such number only the mark there are others who can tell you more than i can about it i do know that it is very inadvisable to become involved with the individuals responsible for making it they call themselves believers why was it marked he answered my question with another how old do you think that skull is mr parker i drew closer to the desk the skull looked battered and slightly yellowed i dont know decades maybe neddo shook his head months perhaps even weeks it has been artificially aged run through dirt and sand then soaked in a preparation of urine you can probably smell it on your fingers i decided not to check where did it come from he shrugged it looks caucasian probably male there are no obvious signs of injury but that means little it could have come from a mortuary i suppose or a hospital except that as you seem to have surmised from the additions to my storeroom human remains are hard to acquire in this country most of them apart from the ones donated to medical science have to be purchased from elsewhere eastern europe was a good source for a time but it is now more difficult to obtain unregistered cadavers in such countries china as youve gathered is less particular but there are problems with the provenance of such remains and they are expensive to obtain there are few other options apart from the obvious such as supplying your own yes killing yes is that what that mark means i believe so i asked if he had a camera and he produced a dusty kodak instant from a drawer in his desk i took about five photographs of the outside of the skull and three or four of its interior adjusting the distance each time in the hope that the mark would come out clearly in at least one of them in the end i got two good images once the photographs had developed on the desk before us have you ever met any of these believers i said neddo squirmed in his seat i meet a great many distinctive people in the course of my business one might go so far as to say that some of them are sinister even actively unpleasant so yes i have met believers how do you know neddo pointed at the sleeve of his gown about an inch above his wrist they bear the grapnel mark here a tattoo no said neddo they burn it into their flesh did you get any names no dont they have names neddo looked positively ill oh they all have names the worst of them anyway his words seemed familiar to me i tried to remember where i had heard them before they all have names but neddo had already moved on others have asked about them though in the relatively recent past i was visited by an agent of the fbi perhaps a year ago he wanted to know if id received any suspicious or unusual orders relating to arcana particularly bones or bone sculpture or ornate vellum i told him that all such orders were unusual and he threatened me in much the same way that you have just done a raid upon my premises by government agents would have been both inconvenient and embarrassing to me and potentially ruinous if it led to criminal charges i told him what i told you he was unsatisfied but i remain in business do you remember the agents name bosworth philip bosworth to be honest had he not shown me his identification i would have taken him for an accountant or a clerk in a law office he looked a little fragile for an fbi man nevertheless the range of his knowledge was most impressive he returned to clarify some details on another occasion and i confess i enjoyed the process of mutual discovery that ensued once again i was aware of an undertone to neddos words an almost sexual pleasure in the exploration of such subjects and material the process of mutual discovery i just hoped that bosworth had bought him dinner first and that the encounters with neddo had brought him more satisfaction than my own neddo was as slippery as an eel in a bucket of vaseline and every useful word that he spoke came wrapped in layers of obfuscation it was clear that he knew more than he was telling but he would only answer a direct question and the replies came unadorned with any additional information tell me about the statue i said neddos hands began to tremble again an interesting construction i should like more time to study it you want me to leave it here i dont think thats going to happen neddo shrugged and sighed no matter it is worthless a copy of something far more ancient go on it is a version of a larger bone sculpture reputedly eight or nine feet in height the original has been lost for a very long time although it was created in sedlec in the fifteenth century crafted from bones contained in its ossuary you said that the bone candleholders were also replicas of originals from sedlec it sounds like someone has a fixation sedlec is an unusual place and the original bone statue is an unusual piece assuming it exists at all and is not simply a myth since no one has ever seen it its precise nature is open to speculation but most interested parties are in agreement on its appearance the statue you have brought with you is probably as accurate a representation as i have ever seen i have examined only sketches and illustrations before and a great deal of effort has gone into this piece i should like to meet whoever is responsible for its construction so would i i said what was the purpose of the original why was it made versions upon versions said neddo your sculpture is a miniature of another also made in bone that larger bone statue though is itself a representation although the model for its construction is made of silver and thus extremely valuable like this one it is a depiction of a metamorphosis it is known as the black angel a metamorphosis of what kind a transformation from man to angel or man to demon to be more accurate which brings us to the point upon which opinions differ clearly the black angel would be a considerable boon to any private collection simply for its intrinsic value but that is not why it has been so avidly sought there are those who believe that the silver original is in effect a kind of prison that it is not a depiction of a being transforming but the thing itself that a monk named erdric confronted immael a fallen angel in human form at sedlec and that in the course of the conflict between them immael fell into a vat of molten silver just as his true form was in the process of being revealed silver is supposedly the bane of such beings and immael was unable to free himself from it once he had become immersed erdric ordered that the silver be slowly cooled and the residue poured from the vat what remained was the black angel immaels form shrouded in silver the monks hid it unable to destroy what lay within but fearful of allowing the statue to fall into the hands of those who might wish to free the thing inside or use it to draw evil men to themselves since then it has remained hidden having been moved from sedlec shortly before the monasterys destruction in the fifteenth century its whereabouts were concealed in a series of coded references contained in a map the map was then torn into fragments and dispersed to cistercian monasteries throughout europe since then myth speculation superstition and perhaps even a grain of truth have all combined to create an object that has become increasingly fascinating over the space of half a millennium the bone version of the statue was created almost contemporaneously although why i cannot say it was perhaps merely a way of reminding the community of sedlec of what had occurred and of the reality of evil in this world it went missing at the same time as the silver statue presumably to save it from the depredations of war for sedlec was attacked and destroyed early in the fifteenth century the believers are they among those searching for it yes more than any others you seem to know a lot about it and i dont even consider myself to be an expert then who is there is an auction house in boston the house of stern run by a woman named claudia stern she specializes in the sale of arcana and has a particular knowledge of the black angel and the myths associated with it and why is that because she claims to be in possession of one of the map fragments and is due to auction it next week the object is controversial it is believed to have been uncovered by a treasure seeker named mordant who found it beneath a flagstone in sedlec some weeks ago mordant died in the church apparently while trying to flee with the fragment or more precisely i suspect while trying to flee from someone what if the words had haunted mordant for so long he was cleverer than many of his breed and warier too he was constantly seeking the greater glory the finer prize disdaining even to trouble himself with the search for meaner rewards laws meant little to him laws were for the living and mordant dealt exclusively with the dead to this end he had spent many years contemplating the mystery of sedlec poring again and again over myths of dark places and of what might once have been concealed within them as was so yet might be what if now he was within the ossuary itself its alarm system overridden using a pair of clips and a length of wire the air impossibly cold as he descended the stairs into the heart of the construct he was surrounded by bones by the partial remains of thousands of human beings but this did not trouble him as much as it might have disturbed a more sensitive soul mordant was not a superstitious man yet even he had to admit to a nagging sense of transgression in this place curiously it was the sight of his exhalations made visible that made him uneasy as though a presence were drawing his very life force from him draining him slowly breath by breath what if he walked between pyramids of skulls beneath great traceries of vertebrae and garlands of fibulae until he came to the small altar he dropped a black canvas bag onto the floor it jangled weightily when it landed he withdrew a heavy pointed hammer from within and set to work on the edges of a stone built into the floor the shadow of the crucifix above falling upon him as moonlight filtered through the window behind what if he broke through the mortar and saw that a few more taps would expose a gap large enough to accommodate the crowbar so lost was he is in his work that he did not hear the approach from behind and it was not until a faint musty smell came to his nostrils that he paused and turned still on his knees he looked up and he was no longer alone what if mordant raised himself slightly almost apologetically as though to indicate that there was a perfectly reasonable explanation for his presence in this place and for the desecration he was committing but as soon as he felt certain of his leverage he pushed himself forward and struck out with the flat of the hammer he missed his target but managed to clear himself a space through which he could see the steps hands grasped for him but he was slick and fast and determined to escape his blows were connecting now he was almost clear he reached the steps and ascended his sight fixed on the door mordant registered the presence to his right just a second too late it emerged from the shadows striking a blow that caught mordant on the adams apple and pushed him back to the very edge of the stairway for a moment he teetered on the edge of the top step his arms swaying in an effort to steady himself before he fell backward tumbling head over heels what if and mordants neck broke on the last step it was always cold in the ossuary at sedlec which was why the old woman had wrapped herself up warm a ring of keys dangled from her right hand as she followed the path to santiniaichels door the care of this place had been in her family for generations and its upkeep was supported by the books and cards sold from a small table by the door and by the admission charge levied on those visitors who made the effort to come there now as she approached she saw that the door was ajar there was a smear of blood upon the first of the stones within her hand rose to her mouth and she halted at the periphery such a thing as this had never been known before the ossuary was a sacred place and had been left untouched for centuries she entered slowly fearful of what she was about to see a mans body lay splayed before the altar his head tilted at an unnatural angle one of the stones beneath the crucifix had been entirely removed and something gleamed dully in the earlymorning light the shards of one of the beautiful skull candleholders congregated at the dead mans feet curiously her first concern was not for him but for the damage that had been caused to the ossuary how could someone do this did they not realize that these were once people like them or that there was a beauty to what had been created from their remains she lifted a piece of the skull from the floor rubbing it gently between her fingers before her attention was distracted by another new addition to the ossuary she reached for the small silver box by the dead mans hand the box was unlocked carefully she raised the lid there was vellum contained within the rolled document apparently uncorrupted she touched it with her fingers it felt smooth almost slick she lifted it out and began to unroll it in the corner was a coat of arms it depicted a battleax against the backdrop of an open book she did not recognize it she saw symbols and architectural drawings then horns and part of an inhuman face contorted in agony the drawing was immensely detailed although it ended at the neck but the old woman wanted to see no more than she had been given to witness it was already too horrific for her eyes she replaced the vellum in the box and rushed to get help barely noticing that the ossuary was slightly warmer than it should have been and that the heat was coming from the stones beneath her feet and in the darkness far to the west two eyes opened suddenly in an opulent room twin fires ignited in the night and at the heart of one pupil a white mote flickered with the memory of the divine neddo was almost finished sometime between the discovery of the body and its removal following the arrival of the police the fragment which was contained in a silver box disappeared he said now a similar fragment has been offered for sale through claudia stern theres no way of telling if it is the sedlec fragment but the cistercian order has made clear its objections to the sale nevertheless it appears to be going ahead there will be a great deal of interest although the auction itself will be a very private affair collectors of such material tend to be um reclusive and somewhat secretive their fascinations can be open to misunderstanding i looked at the ephemera gathered in neddos dingy store human remains reduced to the status of ornaments i felt an overpowering urge to be gone from this place i may have more questions for you i said i took a business card from my wallet and laid it on the desk neddo glanced at it but didnt pick it up im always here he replied naturally im curious to see where your inquiries lead you feel free to contact me day or night he smiled thinly in fact night is probably best garcia watched the building growing increasingly uneasy as one hour rolled by then another he had tried to follow the man who was of such concern to brightwell but he was not yet familiar with the streets of this huge city and had lost him within minutes he believed that the man would return to his friends and they were now garcias most pressing concern as they were still in his apartment he had expected the police to come but they had not at first it gave him hope but now he was not so sure they must have seen what was there perhaps they had even watched some of the tapes in his collection what kind of men did not call the police in such a situation garcia wanted his possessions back and one in particular it was important to him but it was also one of the few items that could connect him and the others to the girl without it the trail would be almost impossible to find a car pulled up and the man got out and rang the bell to garcias building garcia was relieved to see that he had the large wooden box in his hands he only hoped that whatever he had removed from the apartment was still contained within it minutes later the door opened and the negro and his smaller companion left now there was only one man in the apartment alone garcia uncloaked himself from the shadows and moved toward the doorway i made one last search of the rooms louis and angel had been through the apartment again but i wanted to be sure that nothing had been missed when i was done with the occupied areas i went to the whitetiled room that louis had discovered its purpose was clear while it had been thoroughly cleaned i wondered how much work had gone into removing evidence from the pipes they were probably new since the room was a recent addition if someone had bled into the drain traces might remain tins of paint and old paintbrushes their bristles now entirely hardened stood on a trestle table by the far wall alongside a pile of old paintspattered sheets i pulled at the pile raising a little cloud of red dust i examined the residue then swept the sheets from the table there was more brick dust on the wood and on the floor below i tested the wall with my hand and felt brick scrape against brick i looked more closely and saw the brickwork was not quite even around the edges of a section perhaps eighteen inches in height using my fingers i gripped the exposed edge and began moving it from left to right shifting it until i was able to pull it forward entirely it fell to the table still in one piece leaving a hole exposed i could make out a shape inside i knelt down and shined the flashlight upon it it was a human skull mounted upon a pillar of bones around which a red velvet cloth had been partially tied a goldsequinned scarf covered the head leaving only the eye sockets the nasal cavity and the mouth exposed at the base of the pillar finger bones had been placed in an approximation of the pattern of two hands the bones adorned with cheap rings beside them offerings had been placed chocolate and cigarettes and a shot glass containing an amber liquid that smelled like whiskey a locket gleamed in the flashlights beam silver against the white of the bone pillar i used a rag to take it in my hand then flipped open the catch inside there were pictures of two women the first i did not recognize the second was the woman named martha who had come to my house in search of hope for her child suddenly there was an explosion of light and sound wood and stone splintered close to my right arm shards of it striking my face and blinding me in my right eye i dropped the flashlight and fell to the floor as a small bulky figure was briefly silhouetted in the doorless entrance before ducking back out of sight i heard the terrible twin clicks as another round was jacked into the shotguns chamber and the mans voice uttering the same words over and over again it sounded like a prayer santa muerte reza por mi santa muerte reza por mi faintly just above his words i caught the sound of footsteps on the stairs below as angel and louis ascended closing the trap the gunman heard them too because the volume of his prayers increased i heard louiss voice shout dont kill him and then the gunman appeared again and the shotgun roared i was already moving when the trestle table disintegrated one of its legs collapsing as the shooter entered the room screaming his prayer over and over again as he came jacking firing jacking firing the noise and the dust filling the room clouding my nose and my eyes creating a filthy mist that obscured details leaving only indistinct shapes through my blurred vision i saw a squat dark form a cloud of light and metal ignited before it and i fired chapter ten the mexican lay amid the ruins of the trestle table the discarded sheets tangled around his feet like the remains of a shroud one of the paint cans had opened showering his lower body with white blood pumped rhythmically from the hole in his chest and into the paint propelled by the beating of his slowly failing heart his right hand clutched at the wall crawling spiderlike across the brickwork as he tried to touch the skull on the altar muertecita he said once more but now the words were whispered reza por mi louis and angel appeared in the doorway shit said louis i told you not to kill him dust still clouded the room and the contents of the hole in the wall were not yet visible to him he knelt beside the dying man his right hand clasped the mexicans face turning it toward him tell me he said tell me where she is the mexicans eyes remained fixed upon a distant spot his lips continued to move repeating his mantra he smiled as though he had glimpsed something that was invisible to the rest of us a rip in the fabric of existence that permitted him to see at last the reward or the punishment that was his and his alone i thought i saw wonder in his gaze and fear even as his eyes began to lose their brightness his eyelids drooping louis slapped him hard on the cheek he held a small photograph of alice in his right hand i had not seen it before i wondered if his aunt had given it to him or if it were his own possession a relic of a life left behind but not forgotten where is she said louis the dying man coughed up blood his teeth were red as his lips tried to form the imprecation one final time then he shuddered and his hand fell and splashed in the paint as he died louis lowered his head and covered his face with his hand the picture of alice now pressed to his skin louis i said he looked up and for a second i didnt know how to continue i think ive found her the emergency service unit was the first on the scene responding to the shots fired alert from the dispatcher soon i was looking down the barrels of ruger minis and h ampk ninemillimeter submachine guns trying to identify surnames and serial numbers in the confusion of lights and shouts that accompanied their arrival the esu cops took in the killing room the dead mexican the bones arrayed in the apartment then once they realized that the action was over for the evening retreated and let their colleagues from the ninesix take control i tried to answer their questions as best i could at the start but soon lapsed into silence it was in part to protect both me and my friendsi did not want to give away too much until i had a chance to compose my thoughts and get my story straightbut it was also a consequence of the image that i could not shake i saw over and over louis standing before the gap in the bricks staring into the skeletal face of a girl that he had once known his hands poised before her wanting to touch all that remained but unable to do so i watched him as he drifted back to another time and another place a houseful of women his days among them drawing to a close even as another was added to their number i remember her i remember her as a little baby watching her when the women were cooking or cleaning i was the only man who held her because her daddy deeber was dead i killed him he was the first he took my momma from me and so i erased him from the world in retaliation i didnt know then that my mommas sister was pregnant by him i just knew although there was no proof that he had hurt my momma so badly that she had died and that he would hurt me in the same way when his chance came so i killed him and his daughter grew up without a father he was a base man with base appetites hungers that he might have sated on her as the years went on but she never got to see him or to understand the kind of man that he was there were always questions for her lingering doubts and once she began to guess the truth of what had happened i was far from her i disappeared into the forest one day when she was still a child and chose my own path i drifted away from her and from the others and i did not know of what had befallen her until it was too late that is what i tell myself i did not know then our paths crossed in this city and i tried to make up for my failings but i could not they were too grievous and they could not be undone and now she is dead and i find myself wondering did i do this did i set this in motion by quietly calmly deciding to take the life of her father before she was born in a sense were we not both father to the woman she became do i not bear responsibility for her life and for her death she was blood to me and she is gone and i am lessened by her passing from this world i am sorry i am so sorry and i turned away from him as he lowered his head because i did not want to see him this way i spent the rest of the night and a good part of the morning being interviewed by the nypd in the ninesix over on meserole avenue as an excop even one with some unanswered questions surrounding him my stock had some value i told them that i was given a lead on the mexicans apartment by a source and had found the door to the warehouse open i entered saw what the apartment contained and was about to call the police when i was attacked in defending myself i had killed my attacker two detectives interviewed me a blond woman named bayard and her partner a big redhaired cop named entwistle they were scrupulously polite to start with due in no small part to the fact that seated to my right was frances neagley before i arrived in new york louis had arranged for a nominal fee to be paid into my account by the firm of early chaplin amp cohen with whom frances was a senior partner officially i was in her employ and therefore could claim privilege if any awkward questions were asked frances was tall impeccably groomed even after my early call and superficially charming but she hung out in the kinds of bars where blood dried on the floor at weekends and had a reputation for stonewalling so hard that she made titanium seem pliable by comparison she had already done a good job of simultaneously distracting and frightening most of the cops with whom she was coming into contact who tipped you off on garcia asked entwistle was that his name seems so hes not in a position to confirm it right now id prefer not to say bayard glanced at her notes it wouldnt be a pimp named tyrone baylee would it aka gmack i didnt reply the woman you were hired to find was part of his stable right i assume you spoke to him i mean it would make no sense not to speak to him if you were looking for her right i spoke to a lot of people i said frances intervened where are you going with this detective id just like to know when mr parker here last spoke to tyrone baylee mr parker has neither confirmed nor denied that he ever spoke to this man so the question is irrelevant not to mr baylee said entwistle he had yellowed fingers and his voice rumbled with catarrh he was admitted to woodhull early this morning with gunshot wounds to his right hand and right foot he had to crawl to get there any hopes he ever had of pitching for the yankees are pretty much gone i closed my eyes louis hadnt seen fit to mention the fact that he had visited a little retribution on gmack i spoke to baylee around midnight am i said he gave me the address in williamsburg did you shoot him did he tell you that i shot him hes all doped up were waiting to hear what he has to say i didnt shoot him you wouldnt know who did no i wouldnt again frances interjected detective can we move on sorry but your client or your employee or whatever you choose to call him seems to be bad for the health of the people he meets so said frances her tone one of perfect reasonableness either slap a health warning on him and let him go or charge him i had to admire francess fighting talk but goading these cops didnt seem like a great idea with garcias body still cooling gmack recovering from bullet wounds and the shadow of the brooklyn metropolitan detention center looming over my future sleeping arrangements mr parker killed a man said entwistle a man who was trying to kill him so he says come on detective were going around in circles here lets be adult about this you have a room torn up by shotgun blasts a crumbling warehouse filled with bones some of which may prove to be the remains of the woman mr parker was hired to find and two vcr tapes that appear to contain images of at least one woman being killed and probably others my client has indicated that he will cooperate with the investigation in any way that he can and youre spending your time trying to trip him up with questions about an individual who suffered injuries subsequent to his meeting with my client mr parker is available for further questions at any time or to answer any charges that may be pressed at a future date so whats it going to be entwistle and bayard exchanged a look then excused themselves they were gone for a long time frances and i sat in silence until they returned you can go said entwistle for now if its not too much trouble wed appreciate it if you let us know if you plan on leaving the state frances began gathering her notes oh added entwistle and try not to shoot anyone for a while huh see how you like it it might even take frances dropped me back at my car she didnt ask me anything further about the events of the night before and i didnt offer we both seemed happier that way i think youre okay she said as we pulled up close by the warehouse there were still cops outside and curious onlookers kept vigil with the tv crews and assorted other reporters the man you killed got off three or four rounds for your one and if the bones in the warehouse are tied in to him then nobody is going to come chasing you in connection with his death especially if the remains you found in the wall turn out to be those of alice they may decide to go after you for discharging a weapon but when it comes to pis thats a judgment call well just have to wait and see i had retained a license to carry concealed in new york ever since i left the force and it was probably the best i spent every two years the license was issued at the discretion of the commissioner and in theory he could have denied my application for renewal but nobody had ever raised an objection i suppose that it was a lot to ask for them to let me go around shooting the gun as well i thanked frances and got out of the car tell louis im sorry she said i called rachel once i was back at my hotel she answered on the fourth ring everything okay i asked everythings fine she said her voice was flat is sam all right shes good she slept through till seven ive just fed her ill put her down again for an hour or two now the line went quiet for about five seconds how are you doing she said there was some trouble earlier i said a man died again there was only silence and i think we found alice i said or something of her tell me she sounded suddenly weary there were human remains in a tub bones mostly i found more behind a wall her locket was with them and the man who died was he responsible i dont know for sure it looks like it i waited for the next question knowing that it had to come did you kill him yes she sighed i could hear sam starting to cry rachel hushed her i have to go she said ill be back soon its over right she said you know what happened to alice and the man who killed her is dead what more can you do come home justcome home okay i will i love you rachel i know i thought i could hear something catch in her voice as she prepared to hang up the phone i know you do i slept until past midday when i was awoken by the ringing of the telephone it was walter cole seems like you had a busy night he said how much do you know a little you can fill me in on the rest theres a starbucks over by daffys ill see you there in thirty minutes i made it in fortyfive and even then i was pushing it on my way across town i thought about what i had done and about what rachel had said when we spoke in one sense it was over i felt certain that dental records and dna tests if necessary using marthas dna for comparison would confirm that the remains found in garcias apartment were those of alice so garcia was involved and may even have been directly responsible for her death but that didnt explain why alice had gone missing to begin with or why eddie tager had paid her bond then there was the antique dealer neddo and his talk of believers and the fbi agent philip bosworth who appeared to be engaged in an investigation that mirrored at least in some way my own finally i was aware of a deep unease the sense that there was something else moving beneath the surface details of the case weaving through the hidden hollow caverns of the past my hair was still wet from a hasty shower when i sat down across from walter at a corner table he wasnt alone dunne the detective from the coffee shop was with him your partner know youre seeing other people i asked him we have an open relationship as long as he doesnt have to hear about it hes cool he thinks you shot gmack though so do the cops over at the ninesix for what its worth i didnt pull the trigger on him hey its not like we really care so much mackey just doesnt want it coming back to haunt him someone hears we sicced you on him a couple of people pointed us in his direction you can tell your partner he doesnt have anything to worry about us said dunne damn i was tired walter and me right sure i didnt want to get into this with dunne i didnt even know why he was here so i said what are we doing here testing muffins dunne looked to walter for an ally hes a hard guy to help he said hes very selfsufficient said walter its a strongman pose i think it hides a conflicted sexuality walter with all due respect im not in the mood for this walter raised a placating hand easy like dunne said were trying to help sereta the other girlit looks like theyve found her too said dunne where motel just outside of yuma the spyhole killings i had watched some of the news reports on tv yeah theyve identified her for certain as the girl found in the trunk of the car they kind of figured that anyway since the car was registered to her and a section of her license survived the fire but they were waiting for confirmation it looks like she was still alive and conscious when the flames got to her she managed to kick in the backseat before she died i tried to remember the details wasnt there a second body in the car male hes a john doe no id no wallet theyre still trying to chase him down with what they have but its not like they can put a picture on milk cartons maybe on barbecue charcoal come the summer but not until then hed been shot in the shoulder and chest fatal bullet was still in him it came from a thirtyeight same gun as they found on the mexican who died in one of the motel rooms they were operating on the assumption that he might have been the target of a botched hit guy was tied up with some pretty bad people and the federales down in mexico were real anxious to speak to him now with this alice thing up here maybe theres another angle according to gmack alice and sereta had been present when winston and his assistant were killed but they hadnt seen anything they had taken something though and apparently this item was sufficiently valuable that the individuals involved were prepared to kill to get it back they found alice and perhaps from her they gained some knowledge of where sereta was hiding i didnt like to think of how they had acquired that information your friend gmack should be released from the hospital in a couple of days said dunne from what i hear he says he still doesnt know anything about what happened to his hookers and he didnt get a look at the guy who shot him whoever put the bullet in his leg knew what he was doing the ankle joint and the heel were shattered to pieces guy is gonna be a gimp for the rest of his life i thought of alices skull resting in the alcove in garcias apartment i imagined seretas final minutes of life as the heat grew in intensity slowly roasting her before the flames took hold by selling alice out gmack had condemned them both to death thats tough i said dunne shrugged its a tough world speaking of that walter says he tried to talk to ellen the young hooker i remembered the young girl in the dark clothing you get anywhere with her walter shook his head hard outside and getting harder inside im going to talk to safe horizon about her and i have a buddy in the juvenile crime special projects squad ill keep trying dunne stood and picked up his jacket look he said to me if i can help you out i will i owe walter and if he wants to call in that debt for you then im okay with that but i like my job and i plan on keeping it i dont know who put those fucking bullets in that piece of shit but if you happen to meet him you tell him to take it to jersey next time we clear clear i said oh and one last thing they did find something else unusual in the spyhole the desk clerks blood was smeared on his face and they pulled foreign dna from the samples weird thing was it was all degraded degraded old and debased they think the samples might have been corrupted somehow they contained toxins and theyre still trying to identify most of them its like somebody rubbed a piece of dead meat across the kids face we gave him a fiveminute start then left so what now asked walter as we tried to avoid getting run over by a bus i need to talk to some people you think you can find out who owns that warehouse in williamsburg shouldnt be too hard the ninesix is probably on top of it already but ill see what i can get from the city assessors office the cops at the ninesix have a name on the man i killed i dont imagine theyre going to share much information with me so keep your ear to the ground see what filters through no problem you planning on staying at the meridien for another night i thought of rachel maybe one more after that i need to go home you talk to her this morning did you tell her what happened most of it that sound you hear in the back of your mind thats thin ice cracking you need to be with her now hormones everything gets screwed up you know that even little things can seem like the end of the world and big things well they just really might be the end i shook his hand thanks for the advice no the advice sucked thanks is for stepping up to the plate on this one hey once a cop he said i miss it sometimes but this helps it reminds me of why im better off out of it my next call was to louis i met him at a coffee shop on broadway up in the gay nineties he didnt look like hed slept much and although he was cleanshaven and his shirt was neatly pressed he appeared uncomfortable in his clothes marthas cousin is flying up today he said shes bringing dental records medical stuff anything she can find martha was staying in some shit hole in harlem i made her move so theyre both booked into the pierre now how is she she hasnt given up hope says it may not be alice the locket doesnt mean nothing except that the guy took it from her and you what do you think its her like you i just knew i felt it as soon as i saw the locket the cops should have a positive id by tomorrow then theyll probably release her in a day or two once the me has made his report will you go back with the remains louis shook his head i dont think so i wont be welcome anyway theres history down there better to let it rest i got other things to be doing like like finding the ones who killed her i sipped my coffee it was already going cold i raised the cup to the waitress then watched quietly as she warmed it up you should have told me what you did to gmack i said as soon as she was out of earshot i had other things on my mind well in future if were going to do this youll have to share your thoughts some two detectives down over in the ninesix liked me for the shooting the fact that id left another man dead on their patch didnt help my case they say how that pimp asshole is doing he was still woozy when i was at the ninesix but since then hes come around he told the cops that he didnt see a thing he wont talk he knows better than to say anything thats not the point look said louis i aint asking you to get involved in this i didnt ask you to begin with i waited for him to say something more he didnt you finished i said yeah im done he raised his right hand in apology im sorry theres nothing to be sorry for if you shoot someone just let me know thats all i want to be sure i can say i was somewhere else especially if for once i was somewhere else the men who killed alice are gonna find out that the pimp talked said louis the mans dead well when they come he wont be able to run away thats for sure so what now i told him about the death of alices friend sereta near yuma and the body found in the car with her he wasnt shot in the car i said mackey told me that the cops followed a blood trail from outside the room to the door of the buick this guy walked to the car then he sat in the drivers seat with the door wideopen while he burned alive could be someone was holding a gun on him it would have to be a pretty big gun even then getting shot would be a whole lot more attractive than burning plus he wasnt one of the guests registered theyre all accounted for one of seretas johns if he was he left no trace in her room even if that were true what was he doing outside the mexicans hotel room getting shot through the door so he was one of the killers it looks that way he screws up gets shot then instead of taking him with them his buddies leave him in the car and set him on fire and he doesnt object he doesnt even get up from his seat so someone found out where sereta was and came looking for her and killed her when she was found he made the connections just as i had earlier alice told them maybe if she did they forced it from her he thought about it some more its hard for me to say this but if i was sereta i wouldnt have told alice more than she needed to know maybe general things a safe number to contact her at but no more that way if they came for alice there wouldnt be too much she could give away so somebody down there ratted her out probably based on whatever alices killers got out of her which means somebody down there knows somebody up here garcia might have been the contact given how close the spyhole was to the border the mexican connection would make sense it could be worth finding out some more this wouldnt just be a way of getting me out of the city so you can pursue a uh more diplomatic line of inquiry that would assume that im cleverer than i am not cleverer just slicker like i said someone down there may have information that could help us whoever it is he or she is unlikely to give it up easily if i were you id be looking to strike out at someone right about now im just giving you a focus for your anger louis raised his spoon and pointed it at me he managed to rustle up what might almost have been a smile you been spending too long sleeping with psychologists not lately but thanks for the thought louis was right though i wanted him gone for a couple of days it would save me having to keep my movements from him i was afraid that if i gave him too much information he would take it upon himself to try to force answers from the people involved i wanted the first shot at the bail bondsman i wanted to speak to whoever had rented the warehouse space to garcia and i wanted to track down the fbi agent bosworth after all i thought i could always set louis on them later i went back to my hotel but with one extra item in my trunk i had entrusted the bone sculpture to angel before he left the warehouse and now louis had returned it to me if the cops found out that i had withheld it i would be in serious trouble but the sight of it had allowed me to gain access to neddo and i had a feeling that it would open other doors if necessary waving a photograph or a crayola drawing wouldnt have quite the same impact angel and louis were due to fly down to tucson that evening via houston in the meantime walter got back to me with a name the warehouse was part of an estate that had become tied up in some endless legal squabble and the only contact the cops could find was a lawyer named david sekula with an office on riverside drive the telephone number on the banner at the warehouse went straight to an automatic answering service for a leasing company called ambassade realty except ambassade realty appeared to be a dead end its ceo was deceased and all callers were directed to contact the lawyers office i took down sekulas address and telephone number i would call him in the morning when i was fresh and alert i left three messages for tager the bail bondsman but he didnt return my calls his office was up in the bronx close by yankee stadium tager too would be tomorrows work someone had asked him to post bail for alice if i found out who that person was i would be one step closer to discovering those responsible for her death as angel and louis made their way to the delta terminal at jfk a man who might have been able to answer some of their most pressing questions passed through immigration collected his baggage and entered the arrivals hall the cleric had arrived in new york on a ba flight from london he was tall and in his late forties with the build of a man who enjoyed his food his unruly beard was lighter and redder than his head hair and gave him a vaguely piratical aspect as though he had only recently ceased tying firecrackers to its ends in order to frighten his enemies he carried a small black suitcase in one hand and a copy of that days guardian in the other a second man slightly younger than the visitor was waiting for him as the doors hissed closed behind him he shook the clerics hand and offered to carry his case but the offer was declined instead the visitor handed the newspaper to the younger man i brought you a guardian and le monde he said i know you like european newspapers and theyre expensive over here you couldnt have brought a telegraph instead the younger man spoke with a faint eastern european accent its a little conservative for my liking id only be encouraging them his companion took the guardian and examined the front page as he walked what he saw there seemed to disappoint him were not all as liberal as you are you know i dont know what happened to you paul you used to be on the side of the good guys theyll have you buying shares in halliburton next this is no longer a country for heedless liberals martin its changed since last we were here i can tell that there was a chap back there in immigration who just stopped short of bending me over a table and poking me in the arse with his finger he would be a braver man than i still its good to have you here they walked to the parking lot and didnt speak of the matters that concerned them until they were out of the airport any progress said martin rumors nothing more but the auction is in a matter of days it will be like putting blood in the water to see what it attracts but fragments are no good to them they need it all if theyre as close as we think theyll bite its a risky business youve involved us in we were involved anyway whether we wanted it or not mordants death ensured that if he could find his way to sedlec then others could too better to retain a little control over what transpires than none at all it was a guess mordant was lucky not that lucky said martin he broke his neck at least it looked like it was an accident now you said there were rumors two women disappeared from the point it seems that they were present when the collector winston was killed our friends tell us that both have since been found dead one in brooklyn the other in arizona its reasonable to suppose that whatever they took from winstons collection has now been secured the bearded man closed his eyes briefly and his lips moved in a silent prayer more killings he said when he was finished thats too bad thats not the worst of it tell me there have been sightings an obese man hes calling himself brightwell if he has come out of hiding it means that they believe theyre close jesus paul dont you have any good news for me paul bartek smiled it was a grim smile but he was still worried that the next piece of news was affording him a degree of pleasure he would have to confess it at some point nevertheless it was worth a few hail marys to pass it on to his colleague one of their people has been killed a mexican the police believe he was responsible for the death of one of the prostitutes they think her remains are among those found in his apartment killed shot to death somebody did the world a favor but hell pay for it they wont like that who is he his name is parker hes a private detective and it seems that he makes quite a habit of things like this brightwell sat at the computer screen and waited for the printer to finish spewing out the final pages of the job when it was done he took the sheaf of papers and sorted through them ordering them according to date starting with the oldest of the cuttings he read through the details of those first killings once again there were pictures of the woman and child as they had been in life but brightwell barely glanced at them neither did he linger on the description of the crime although he was aware that there was a great deal that remained unsaid in the articles he guessed that the injuries inflicted on the mans wife and daughter were too horrific to print or that the police had hoped at the time to hold back such details in case they encouraged copycats no what interested brightwell was the information on the husband and he marked with a yellow highlighter those parts that were particularly noteworthy he performed a similar exercise on each of the subsequent pages following the mans trail recreating the history of the preceding five years noting with interest the way past and present intersected in his life how some old ghosts were raised while others were laid to rest parker such sadness such pain and all as penance for an offense against him that you cannot even recall committing your faith was misplaced there is no redemption not for you you were damned and there is no salvation you were lost to us for so long but now you are found chapter eleven david sekula occupied a suite of modest offices in a nice old brownstone on riverside a brass plate on the wall announced his status as an attorneyatlaw i pressed the button on the intercom by the door it gave out a reassuring twonote chime as if to convince those who might be tempted to run away in the interim that everything would be all right in the end seconds later the speaker spluttered into life and a female voice asked if she could help me i gave her my name she asked if i had an appointment i confessed that i didnt she told me mr sekula wasnt available i told her that i could sit on the steps and wait for him maybe open a mickeys big mouth to pass the time but if i had to take a leak then things might get messy i was buzzed in a little charm goes a long way sekulas secretary was spectacularly goodlooking albeit in a vaguely threatening way her hair was long and black and tied loosely at the back with a red ribbon her eyes were blue and her skin was pale enough to make the hints of red at her cheeks look like twin sunsets while her lips would have kept a whole freudian symposium going for a month she wore a dark blouse that wasnt quite transparent yet still managed to hint at what appeared to be very expensive black lace lingerie for a moment i wondered if she was scarred in some way because it seemed like there were irregular patterns visible on her skin where the blouse pressed against it her gray skirt ended just above the knee and her stockings were sheer and black she looked like the kind of woman who would promise a man a night of ecstasy unlike anything he had ever previously imagined but only as long as she could kill him slowly immediately afterward the right man might even consider that a good deal judging by the expression on her face i didnt think she was about to make me that kind of offer not unless she could bypass the ecstasy part and get straight to the slow torture i wondered if sekula was married if i had suggested to rachel that i needed a secretary who looked like this woman she would only have agreed if i signed up for temporary chemical castration beforehand with the threat of a more permanent solution always on the horizon if i ever felt tempted to stray the reception area carpeted in gray took up the entire front room with a black leather couch beneath the bay window and a very modern coffee table made from a single slab of black glass in front of it there were matching easy chairs at either side of the table and the walls were decorated if that was the right word with the kind of art that suggested someone suffering from severe depression had stood in front of a blank canvas for a very long time then made a random stroke with a black paintbrush before slapping a hefty price tag on the result and entering lifelong therapy all things considered minimalism seemed to be the order of the day even the secretarys desk was untroubled by anything resembling a file or a piece of stray paper maybe sekula wasnt very busy or perhaps he just spent his days staring dreamily at his secretary i showed her my license she didnt look impressed id like a few minutes of mr sekulas time mr sekula is busy i thought i could hear the low drone of one side of a telephone conversation coming from behind a pair of black doors to my right hard to imagine i said taking in the spotless reception area once again i hope hes firing his decorator in there what is this about said the secretary she didnt deign to use my name mr sekula appears to be responsible for a property in williamsburg i wanted to ask him about it mr sekula is involved with a lot of properties this one is pretty distinctive it seems to have a lot of dead people in it sekulas secretary didnt even blink at the mention of what had occurred in williamsburg mr sekula has been over that with the police she said then it should all be fresh in his mind ill just take a seat and wait until hes done in there i sat down in one of the chairs it was uncomfortable in the way that only very expensive furniture can be after two minutes the base of my spine was aching after five minutes the rest of my spine was aching too and other parts of my body were crying out in sympathy i was considering lying on the floor instead when the black doors opened and a man in a charcoal gray pinstripe suit stepped into the reception area his hair was light brown and trimmed as carefully as potentially prizewinning topiary so that not a single strand was out of place he had the bland good looks of a parttime model his features without a single flaw or hint of individuality that might have lent them character or distinction mr parker he said im david sekula im sorry you had to wait were busier than we might appear clearly sekula had heard everything that was said in the reception room perhaps the secretary had simply left the roomtoroom intercom open either way it made me curious as to whom sekula had been talking with on the phone it might have been nothing to do with me in which case i would have to face the possibility that the world didnt revolve around me i wasnt sure that i was ready to take that step yet i shook sekulas hand it was soft and dry like an unused sponge i hope youve recovered from your ordeal he said ushering me toward his office what happened in that place was terrible the cops had probably explained my involvement to sekula when they interviewed him clearly theyd forgotten to include his secretary in the loop or maybe theyd tried to tell her but she couldnt understand them through their drool sekula paused by his secretarys desk no calls please hope he told her hope it was hard to believe i understand mr sekula she replied nice name i told her it suits you i smiled at her we were all friends now maybe theyd invite me to go away with them on a trip we could drink laugh reminisce about how awkward that first encounter between us had been before we all got to know one another and realized how swell each of us truly was hope didnt smile back it looked like the trip was off sekula closed the doors behind us and waved me to an upright chair in front of his desk the chair faced the window but the drapes were drawn so i couldnt see what lay beyond them compared to the reception area his office looked like a bomb had hit it but it was still neater than any lawyers office i had ever been in before there were files on the desk but they were neatly stacked and housed in nice clean folders each marked with a printed label the trash can was empty and it looked like the filing cabinets were hidden behind the false oak fronts that lined two walls or simply didnt exist at all the art on sekulas walls was also a lot less disturbing than the paintings in the reception area there was a large picasso print of a faun playing a lute signed no less and a big canvas that resembled a cave drawing of horses rendered in layered oils the horses literally carved into the paint the past recreated in the present it too was signed by the artist alison rieder sekula saw me looking at it do you collect he said i wondered if he was being funny but he seemed serious sekula must have paid his investigators way above the going rate i dont know enough about it to collect i said but you have art on your walls i frowned i wasnt sure where this was going some i guess good he said a man should appreciate beauty in all its forms he inclined his chin toward the office door behind which lay the increasingly less enticing form of his secretary and grinned i was pretty certain that if he did that in front of the lady in question shed cut off his head and stick it on a railing in central park sekula offered me a drink from a cabinet against the wall or coffee if i preferred i told him i was fine as i was he took his seat at his desk steepled his fingers and looked grave youre unhurt after the incident he said apart from he touched his fingers to his left cheek i had some cuts on my face from the splinters and there was blood in my left eye you should see the other guy i said sekula tried to figure out if i was joking i didnt tell him that the image of garcia slumped against the wall was still fresh in my mind his blood soaking the dusty paintspattered sheets his lips moving in prayer to whatever deity permitted him to collude in the killing of women yet still offered hope and succor to those who prayed to it i didnt tell him of the metallic smell of the dying mans blood which had infected what little food i had consumed throughout the day i didnt tell him of the stench that rose from him as he died or the way his eyes glazed over with his last breath and i did not mention the sound of that final breath or the manner in which it was released from him a long slow exhalation both reluctant and relieved it had always seemed somehow apt that words connected with freedom and escape should be used to describe the moment when dullness replaced brightness and life became death to be close to another human being at that instant was enough to convince one however briefly that something beyond understanding passed from the body with that final sigh that some essence began its journey from this world to another i cant imagine what it must be like to kill a man said sekula as though all that i had just considered had been revealed to him through my eyes why would you even want to imagine it i said he seemed to give the question some thought i suppose there have been times when ive wanted to kill someone he said it was a fleeting thing but it was there i thought though that i could never live with the consequences not just the legal consequences but the moral and psychological ones then again i have never been placed in the situation where i was seriously forced to consider taking the life of another perhaps under such circumstances it would be within my capabilities to kill have you ever defended someone accused of a killing no i deal mainly in business affairs which brings us to the matter in hand i can only tell you what i told the police the warehouse was once a storehouse for the rheingold brewing company it closed in and the warehouse was sold it was acquired by a gentleman named august welsh who subsequently became one of my clients when he died some legal difficulties arose over the disposal of his estate take my advice mr parker make a will even if you have to write it on the back of a napkin do it mr welsh was not so farsighted despite repeated entreaties on my part he refused to commit his intentions to paper i think he felt that making a will would in some way be an acknowledgment of the imminence of his mortality wills in his view were for people who were dying i tried to tell him that everyone was dying him me even his children and his grandchildren it was to no avail he died intestate and his children began to bicker among themselves as is often the case in such situations i tried to manage his estate as best i could in the interim i ensured that his portfolio remained watertight that any funds accruing were immediately reinvested or lodged to an independent account and i endeavored to produce the best results from his various properties unfortunately the rheingold warehouse was not one of his better investments property values in the area are improving but i could find no one who was willing to commit sufficient funds to the redevelopment of the building i left the matter in the hands of ambassade realty and largely forgot about it until this week you are aware that ambassade is no longer in business im sure that i must have been informed but passing on responsibility for the leasing of the building was probably not a priority at the time so this man garcia had signed no lease with either ambassade or your firm not that i know of yet some work had been done on the top floor of the warehouse there was power and water someone was paying the utilities ambassade i assume there may be an arrangement in place and now theres nobody at ambassade left to ask no im afraid not i wish i could be of more help that makes two of us sekula composed his features into an expression of regret it didnt quite take though like most professionals he wasnt fond of those outside his field casting doubts upon any aspect of his business he stood making it clear to me that our meeting was over if i think of anything that might be of help to you ill try to let you know he said ill have to tell the police first of course but under the circumstances i would have no objection to keeping you informed as well as long as the police confirmed that to do so would not interfere with the progress of their investigation i tried to interpret what sekula had just said and came to the conclusion that i had learned all that i was going to from him i thanked him and left him with my card he walked me to the office door shook my hand once again then closed the door behind me i tried one last time to chip away at his secretarys permafrost exterior by expressing my gratitude for all that shed done but she was impervious to insincerity if sekula was keeping her company at night then i didnt envy him anyone sleeping with her would need to wrap up against the cold first and maybe wear a warm hat my next call was to sheridan avenue in the bronx where eddie tager had his office there was a lot of competition for business and the streets east of yankee stadium and near the courthouse were lined with bondsmen most were at least bilingual in their advertising and the ones that could afford neon usually made sure that the word fianzas was at least as conspicuous as bail in their windows there was a time when the bail industry was the preserve of pretty nasty characters they still existed but they were strictly minor players most of the bigger bail bondsmen were backed by the major insurance firms including hal buncombe according to louis he was the bondsman that alice was supposed to call if she ever found herself in trouble the fact that she hadnt called him indicated the animosity she felt for louis even when she was in the most desperate of situations i met buncombe in a little pizzeria on st where he was eating the first of two slices from a paper plate he was about to wipe his fingers on a napkin in order to shake hands but i told him not to worry about it i ordered a soda and a slice and joined him at his table buncombe was a small wiry man in his fifties he radiated the mixture of inner calm and absolute selfbelief that is the preserve of those who have seen it all and who have learned enough from their past mistakes to ensure that they no longer repeated them too often hows business i asked its okay he said could be better weve taken some skips already this month which isnt good we figure we gave up to the state last year which means were playing catchup from the start of this one ill have to stop being nice to people in fact ive already stopped he raised his right hand i noticed that his knuckles were bruised the skin broken in places i pulled a guy off the streets earlier today just had a bad feeling about him if he skipped hed cost us fifty thou and i wasnt prepared to take that chance i take it he objected he took a couple of swings buncombe conceded we hauled him out to rikers but they arent taking bodies and the judge who set bail is on the west coast until tomorrow so i have him in a room in back of the office he claims he has an outofstate asset that he can offer as collaterala house in some crack alley in chicagobut we cant take outofstate or outofcountry property so well just have to hold him overnight try to get him locked up safe in the morning he finished his first slice and started in on his second tough way to make money i said not really he shrugged were good at our job my partners and me like joe namath said its only bragging if you cant do it what can you tell me about eddie tager i asked is he good at his job too tagers bad news a scavenger hes so desperate he works mostly queens manhattan and theyre hard real hard the bronx and brooklyn are picnic boroughs by comparison but beggars cant be choosers tager deals with smalltime beefs not just bonds but fines too i hear most of the hookers dont like turning to him if theyre in troublehe likes them to give up a little extra as a show of thanks if you catch my driftwhich is why i was surprised when i heard that he supplied the cut slip for alice she would have been warned about him he stopped eating as though he had suddenly lost his appetite and dropped the remains of the slice onto the plate before dumping it in the trash i feel bad about what happened i was trying to deal with paperwork over here and doing what i could over the phone someone told me in passing that the cops had pulled alice in on a drug trawl but i figured i had a couple of hours and that she could just sit tight until i picked up a few more bonds to make it worth my while heading over there to check up on her its a pain in the ass waiting for corrections to release one inmate makes more sense to build up four or five then wait for them all to be cut loose by the time i got over there she was already gone i saw the slip and figured that she decided to go with tager i knew she had a problem with our mutual friend so i didnt take it personally you know she was a mess by the end last time i saw her she wasnt looking good but she didnt deserve what happened to her nobody deserves that have you seen tager lately our paths dont cross so much anymore but i asked around looks like hes gone to ground it could be that hes running scared maybe it got back to him that the girl had connections and that certain people were going to take a dim view of his involvement once she didnt reappear buncombe gave me directions to tagers office he even offered to come along with me but i declined i didnt believe that id need help making eddie tager talk right then words were the only currency he had with which to buy his life eddie tager was so lowrent that he lived and worked out of the back of a firedamaged bodega that had closed for renovations sometime during watergate and never reopened i found the place without too much trouble but there was no answer when i tried the bell i went around back and tried hammering on the rear door it came ajar slightly under the impact of my fist hello i said i opened the door wider and stepped inside i was in the kitchen area of a small apartment a counter separated it from a living room furnished with brown carpet a brown couch and a brown tv even the wallpaper was light brown there were newspapers and magazines scattered around the most recent was dated two days earlier straight ahead was a hallway with an open door leading into the main office to the right was a bedroom and beside that a small bathroom with mold growing on the shower curtain i checked each room before ending up in the office it wasnt exactly spotless but there was at least an attempt at order i went through the recent files but could find nothing relating to alice i sat down in tagers chair and searched the drawers of his desk but nothing struck me as important i found a box containing business cards in the top drawer but none of the names was familiar to me there was a small pile of mail behind the door it was all junk and bills including one from tagers cell phone company i opened it and flipped through the pages until i came to the date of alices arrest like most bondsmen tager used his cell phone a lot in the course of his business on that day alone he had made thirty or forty calls the frequency of them increasing as the night drew on i placed the bill back in its envelope and was about to put it in my jacket pocket so that i could take a closer look at it later when i saw a dark smear on the paper i looked at my fingers and saw blood i wiped them on the envelope then tried to find the source retracing my steps until i was back at tagers chair the blood was congealing on the underside and righthand corner of the desk there wasnt a lot of it but when i shined my flashlight on it i thought i could see some hairs mixed in and there were stains on the carpet the desk was big and heavy but when i checked the area around the legs i saw marks on the fabric where the desk had shifted slightly if the blood was tagers then someone had hit the bondsmans head pretty hard against the corner of the desk probably when he was already sprawled on the floor i went back to the kitchen and soaked my handkerchief under the faucet then cleaned down every surface that i had touched when i was done my handkerchief was covered in pink stains i left the same way that i had entered once i was certain that there was nobody around i didnt make any calls about the blood if i did id have to explain what i was doing there and id need my own bail bondsman i didnt think tager was coming back though someone had asked him to post bail for alice which meant that he was complicit in the sequence of events that had led to her death garcia had not been acting alone and now it looked like his confederates were taking care of the weak links in the chain i patted the cell phone bill in my pocket somewhere in that list of numbers was i hoped another link that they might have overlooked it was now late and dark i decided that there was nothing more that i could do until the morning when i would run the numbers from tagers cell phone bill i went back to my hotel room and called rachel her mother answered the phone and told me that rachel was already in bed sam had slept badly the night before and spent most of the day crying until exhausted at last she had succumbed to rest rachel had fallen asleep immediately after i told joan not to disturb her but to let her know that id called shes worried about you said joan im okay i said be sure to tell her that i promised that id try to return to maine by late the next day then hung up the phone and ate at the thai place beside the hotel just because it was something to do other than sitting alone in my room with the fear that my relationship was disintegrating in my hands i stuck to the vegetarian dishes after my visit to tagers office the coppery taste of spilled blood had returned to my mouth with a vengeance charles neddo sat in his office chair his desk scattered with illustrations all of them taken from books written after and most depicting variations on the black angel he had never quite understood why there were no depictions prior to that date no that wasnt true rather the drawings and paintings became more uniform in the last quarter of the nineteenth century less speculative and with a certain commonality to their lines especially those originating with bohemian artists depictions from earlier centuries were far more diverse so that without a written indication of the source imagined or otherwise it would be impossible to tell that all were renderings of the same subject there was music playing in the background a collection of satie piano pieces neddo liked their air of melancholy he removed his glasses leaned away from his desk and stretched the wrinkled cuffs of his shirt rolled back on his thin arms exposing a small mass of scar tissue above his left wrist as though a mark of some kind had been inexpertly obscured in the relatively recent past it was stinging slightly and neddo touched his left hand gently to the scarring the tips of his fingers following the lines of the grapnel once branded upon his skin one could turn away he thought and hide oneself among worthless antiques but the old obsessions lingered otherwise why would he have surrounded himself with bones he returned to the drawings aware of a rising sense of excitement and anticipation the private detectives visit had revealed a great deal to him and earlier that evening he had received another unexpected call the two monks had been nervous and impatient and neddo understood that their presence in the city was a sign that events were moving quickly and that a resolution of sorts would soon be achieved neddo told them all that he knew then received absolution from the older one for his sins satie came to an end and the room fell into silence as neddo put his papers away he believed that he knew what garcia had been creating and why it was being built they were close and now as never before neddo was aware of the conflict raging within himself it had taken him many years to break free of their influence but like an alcoholic he feared that he would never really be free of the urge to fall he touched his left hand to the cross around his neck and felt the scar on his wrist begin to burn rachel was deep in sleep when her mother woke her she was startled and tried to say something but her mothers fingers pressed themselves to her lips shhh whispered joan listen rachel remained quiet and still there was no sound for a moment then she heard the scuffling noises coming from the roof of the house theres someone up there said joan rachel nodded still listening there was something odd about the sounds they were not quite footsteps instead it seemed to her that whoever was up there was crawling across the slates and crawling quickly she was reminded unpleasantly of the movements of a lizard the noise came again but this time it was echoed by a vibration against the wall behind her head the bedroom occupied the entire width of the first floor so that the bed rested against the wall of the house a second heavy presence was now ascending the sheer wall toward the roof and once again it sounded like it was moving on four legs rachel got up and walked quickly to the closet she opened it quietly moved two shoe boxes aside and looked at the small gun safe behind them she resented the fact that it was even there and had insisted that it have a fivenumber combination lock to prevent sam from gaining access to it even though it was six feet off the ground on the topmost shelf she entered the code and heard the bolts slide inside were two guns she removed the smaller of the two the she hated firearms but in the aftermath of recent events she had reluctantly agreed to learn how to use this one she loaded it using the speed loader then went back to her bed and knelt there was a small white box on the wall with a red button on top she pressed it just as she heard the window shaking in the next room as though someone were trying to open it sam she shouted the alarm began to sound tearing apart the silence of the marshes as rachel ran to sams room joan close behind her she could hear the child crying terrified by the sudden burst of noise the door was open and faced the window sam was writhing in her cot her little hands beating against the air and her face almost purple with the force of her tears for a fleeting instant rachel thought she could see something pale move against the windowthen it was gone take her said rachel get her into the bathroom and lock the door joan grabbed the child and ran from the room slowly rachel approached the window the gun was a little unsteady in her grip but her finger no longer rested outside the guard and instead was gently touching the trigger nearer now ten feet five four three the sound of crawling again came from above her head this time moving away from sams room and toward the far side of the house the noise distracted rachel and she lifted her head to follow its progress as though the intensity of her gaze could penetrate the ceiling and slates and permit her to see what was above when she looked back to the window there was a face there hanging upside down in the night from the top of the glass dark hair dangling vertically from pale features it was a woman rachel fired shattering the window she kept firing even as the sound of the presences on the roof and wall came again growing fainter now as they fled she could see blue light scything through the darkness and heard sam crying even above the noise of the alarm and then she was crying with her daughter howling with fear and anger her finger still pulling the trigger over and over even as the hammer struck only the empty casings and the night air flooded the room bringing with it the smell of salt water and marsh grass and dead winter things chapter twelve few people would have described sandy and larry crane as happy individuals even larrys fellow vfw members upon whom time was inexorably taking its toll and who now boasted a rapidly dwindling platoon of world war ii survivors among their number tended at best to tolerate larry and his wife when they occasionally attended a veterans social event mark hall the only other member of their little band who was still alive often told his wife that in the aftermath of dday it was really just a question of who was going to kill larry first the germans or his own side larry crane could peel an orange in his pocket and open a candy bar with so little noise as to suggest that his time might have been better served in a special operations unit except that larry was a born coward and therefore of little use to his own unit never mind to an elite group of hardened soldiers forced to operate behind enemy lines in desperate conditions hell mark hall could have sworn that hed seen larry crouching behind better men during combat in the hope that they would take a bullet before he did and sure enough that was what happened larry crane might have been a cheap sonofabitch and yellow as a buttercups ass to boot but he was also lucky in the midst of carnage the only blood he ever got on him was other mens hall might not have admitted it to anyone later might even have been reluctant to admit it to himself but as the war wore on he found himself sticking close to larry crane in the hope that some of that luck might rub off on him he guessed that it had because hed lived when others had died it wasnt all good luck though hed paid a price by becoming larry cranes creature bound to him by the shared knowledge of what they had done in the cistercian monastery at fontfroide mark hall didnt talk about that with his wife no sir mark hall didnt talk about that with anyone except his god and then only in the ultimate secret confessional of his own mind he hadnt set foot in church since that day had even managed to convince their only daughter to have her wedding outdoors by offering her the most expensive hotel in savannah as a venue his wife assumed that hed suffered some crisis of faith over what hed endured during the war and he let her believe that supporting her assumptions by making occasional dark references to the things i saw over in europe he supposed that there was even a little kernel of truth hidden beneath the shell of the lie because he had seen some terrible things and done some terrible things too god they were only children when they went off to fight virgins and virgin children had no call to be holding guns and firing them at other children when he looked at his grandchildren and saw how cosseted and naive they were despite the pretence of knowingness that they maintained he found it impossible to visualize them as he had once been he recalled sitting on the bus to camp wolters his mommas tears still drying on his cheek listening while the driver told the negroes to sit at the back because the front seats were for the white folks didnt matter that they were all headed for the same conflict and that bullets were blind to race the blacks didnt object although he could see the resentment simmering in a couple of them and their fists tightened as some of the other recruits joined in wisecracking at them as they walked to their seats they knew better than to respond one word from them and the whole situation would have exploded and texas was tough back then any one of those negroes raised a hand to a white man and they wouldnt have to worry about the germans or the japanese because their own side would take care of them before they had time to break in their boots and nobody would ever be called to answer for what befell them later he heard that some of those black men the ones who could read and write were told to sign up for officer candidates school on account of the fact that the army was organizing a division of black soldiers the ninetysecond to be known as the buffalo division after the black soldiers who fought in the indian wars he was with larry crane by then the two of them sitting in some godawful raindrenched field in england when someone told them about it and crane started off bitching about how the niggers were getting the breaks while he was still a grunt the invasion was imminent and soon some of those black soldiers found their way to england too which made crane bitch even more it didnt matter to him that their officers werent allowed to enter headquarters by the front door like the white officers or that the black troops had crossed the atlantic without any escort because they werent considered as valuable to the war effort no all larry crane saw was uppity negroes even after the beach at omaha was secured their unit smoking cigarettes on the walls of a captured german emplacement and they looked down to see the black soldiers walking with sacks along the sand filling them with the body parts of the men who had died reduced to the level of collectors of human garbage no even then larry crane saw fit to complain calling them cowards who werent fit to touch the remains of better men although it was the army that dictated that they werent fit to fight not then not until men like general davis pushed for the integration of black gis into infantry combat units in the winter of and the buffalo division began fighting its way through italy hall had few problems with negro soldiers he didnt want to bunk with them and he sure as hell wasnt about to drink from the same bottle but it seemed to him that they could take a bullet as well as the next man and as long as they kept their guns pointed in the right direction he was happy to wear the same uniform as they by comparison with larry crane this made mark hall a bastion of liberalism but hall had sufficient selfknowledge to recognize that by making only a cursory effort to contradict crane or tell him to keep his damn mouth shut he was culpable too time and time again hall tried to put distance between himself and larry crane but he grew to realize that larry was a survivor and an uneasy bond developed between the two men until the events at fontfroide occurred and that bond became something deeper something unspeakable and so mark hall maintained a pretence of friendship with larry crane sharing a drink with him when there was no way to avoid doing otherwise even inviting him to that goddamned ruinous wedding though his wife had made it clear that she didnt want either larry or his slovenly wife sullying her daughters special day with their presence and sulked for a week when he informed her that he was paying for the whole fucking day and if she had a problem with his friends then maybe she should have put more money into her bank account so that she could have paid for the entire wedding herself yeah hed told her all right he was a big guy a great guy swearing at his wife to cover his own shame and guilt hall figured that he had something on larry crane too after all they had both been there together and both were complicit in what had occurred hed allowed larry to dispose of some of what they had found then had accepted his share of the money gratefully the cash had enabled hall to buy a piece of a used car dealership and he built upon that initial investment to make himself the auto king of northeast georgia that was how he was depicted in his newspaper ads and in the tv commercials he was the auto king the number one ruler on prices nobody beats the auto king nobody can steal his crown when it comes to value it was an empire built on good management low overheads and a little blood just a little in the context of all the blood spilled during the war it was hardly more than a spot he and larry never spoke about what happened after that day and hall hoped that he would never have to speak of it again until the day he died which curiously was kind of what happened in the end sandy crane sat on a stool by the kitchen window watching her husband wrestle a garden hose like he was tarzan trying to subdue a snake bored she puffed on her menthol cigarette and tipped some of the ash into the sink her husband always hated it when she did that he said it made the sink reek of old mints sandy thought the sink stank pretty bad already and a dab of ash wasnt going to make a whole lot of difference if he didnt have the smell of her cigarettes to whine about she had no doubt that he would find something else at least she got a little pleasure out of smoking which went some way toward helping her to put up with her husbands shit and it wasnt like those fucking cheap cartons that larry bought for himself smelled any better larry was squatting now trying to untangle the hose and failing it was his own fault she had told him often enough that if he rolled it up properly instead of throwing it halfassed into the garage then he wouldnt have these problems but then larry wasnt one to take advice from anyone least of all his wife in a way he spent his life trying to get out of messes that he created for himself and she spent her life telling him that shed told him so speaking of halfassed the cleft of larrys buttocks was clearly visible above the waistband of his pants she could hardly bear to see him naked now it pained her the way everything about him sagged his buttocks his belly his little shriveled organ now practically hairless like his little shriveled head not that she was any bargain herself but she was younger than her husband and knew how to make the best of what she had and how to hide her deficiencies a number of men had learned just a little too late how deficient sandy crane was once her clothes hit the floor but theyd screwed her anyway a lesser woman wouldnt have known whom to despise more the men or herself sandy crane didnt worry too much about it and as in most other areas of her life settled for despising everyone but herself equally she had met larry when he was already in his fifties and she was twenty years his junior he hadnt been much to look at even then but he was in a pretty good position financially he owned a bar and restaurant in atlanta but he sold out when the faggots started making the area their own that was her larry dumber than a busload of tongueless morons so prejudiced that he was incapable of seeing that the gays who were moving into the neigborhood were infinitely classier and wealthier than his existing clientele he sold the business for maybe a quarter of what it was now worth and he had seethed over it ever since if anything it had made him even more of a sexist racist bigot than he ever was before which was saying something because larry crane was already only a couple of holes in a pillowcase away from putting burning crosses in peoples backyards sometimes she wondered why she bothered staying with larry at all but the thought was quickly followed by the realization that snatched moments in motel rooms or in other womens bedrooms were unlikely to be translated into longterm relationships with a sound financial underpinning at least with larry she had a house and a car and a moderately comfortable lifestyle his demands were few and growing fewer now that his sex drive had deserted him entirely anyway he was so coiled up with piss and fury at the world that it was only a matter of time before he had a stroke or a heart attack that garden hose might yet do her a favor if she could learn to keep her mouth shut for long enough she finished her cigarette lit another from its dying embers then tossed the butt in the waste disposal the newspaper lay on the table waiting for larry to return from his labors so that he could have something else to complain about for the rest of the day she picked it up and flipped through it conscious that this simple act would be enough to get her husband pissed he liked to be the first to read the newspaper he hated the smell of perfume and menthol upon its pages and raged at the way she wrinkled and tore it as she read but if she didnt look at it now then it would be old news by the time she got to it old news whats more with larrys toilet stink upon it since her husband seemed to concentrate best when he was sitting on the can forcing his aged body to perform another racked dry evacuation there was nothing in the newspaper there never was sandy didnt know quite what she expected to find in there every time she opened it she just knew that she was always disappointed when she was done she turned her attention to the mail she opened all of it even the letters addressed to her husband he always bitched and moaned when she did that but most of the time he ended up passing them on to her to deal with anyway he just liked to pretend that he still had some say in the matter this morning though sandy wasnt in the humor for his bullshit so she just ripped into what was there in the hope that it might provide her with a little amusement most of it was trash although she laid aside the coupon offers just in case there were bills and offers of bum credit cards and invitations to subscribe to magazines that would never be read there was also one officiallooking manila envelope she opened it and read the letter within then reread it to be sure shed picked up all of the details attached to the letter were two color photocopies of pages from the catalog of an auction house in boston holy shit said sandy sweet holy shit some ash fell onto the page from her cigarette she brushed it off quickly larrys reading glasses lay on the shelf beside his vitamins and his angina medication sandy picked them up and gave them a quick clean with a kitchen towel her husband couldnt read for shit without his glasses larry was still struggling with the hose when her shadow fell across him he looked up at her get out of the light dammit he said then saw what she had done to his newspaper which in her distracted state she had tucked untidily under her arm the hell have you done with the paper he said it aint fit for nothin but the bottom of a birdcage now you been at it forget the damn newspaper she said read this she handed the letter to him he stood puffing a little and tugging his pants up over his meager paunch i cant read without my glasses she produced his glasses and watched impatiently while he examined the lenses and wiped them on the filthy edge of his shirt before putting them on what is this he asked whats so important you had to turn my newspaper into an asswipe to bring it to me her finger pointed to the piece in question holy shit said larry and for the first time in over a decade larry and sandy crane enjoyed a moment of shared pleasure larry crane had been keeping things from his wife it had always been his way early in their relationship for example larry hadnt bothered to mention the times that hed cheated on her for obvious reasons and thereafter tended to apply to most of his dealings with sandy the maxim that a little knowledge was a dangerous thing but one of larrys few remaining vices the horses had gotten a little out of hand and he currently owed money to the kind of people who didnt take a long view on such matters they had informed him of their position just two days before when larry made a big payment significant enough to allow him to hold on to all ten of his digits for another couple of weeks it was now at the point where his house was the only asset he could readily turn to cash because even disposing of the car wouldnt cover what he owed and he didnt see how sandy would approve of his selling their home and moving them into a doghouse in order to pay his gambling debts he could try turning to mark hall of course but that was a reservoir that had well and truly tapped out a couple of years back and only absolute desperation would take him back to it again in any case larry would be playing a dangerous game if he used the blackmail card on old king hall because hall might just call his bluff and larry crane had no desire to see out the remainder of his life in a jail cell he figured hall knew this old hallie might be a lot of things but stupid was not one of them and so larry crane had been wrestling with the garden hose wondering if there might not be a way to turn sandy to some use by strangling her with it dumping the body and claiming the insurance when the lady in question cast her shadow upon him larry knew then that he had about as much chance of successfully killing his wife as he had of looking after the playboy mansion on the days when hugh hefner was feeling a little under the weather she was big and strong and mean with it if he even tried to lay a hand on her shed break him like he was a swizzle stick in one of her cheap cocktails but as he read and reread the letter it quickly became apparent to him that he might not have to resort to such desperate measures after all larry had seen something like the item described in the photocopies but he had never suspected that it might be worth money and now here was a story informing him that it could bring in tens of thousands of dollars maybe more that could was an important caveat though what was being sought was not actually in the possession of larry crane instead it rested in the ownership of one marcus e hall the auto king while the face of the auto king remained that of mark hall the old man had become little more than a figurehead his sons craig and mark jr had taken over the daytoday running of the family business almost a decade ago jeanie his daughter had a percent share in the company based on the fact that it was craig and mark who did all the donkey work while jeanie just had to sit back and wait for the check to clear jeanie didnt see it that way though and had been raising quiet hell over it for the past five years the king saw the hand of her husband richard at work dick as his sons liked to call him both to his face and behind his back and always with a little added venom was a lawyer and if there was one species of rodent that would use the excuse of money to gnaw its way into a familys heart and consume all the goodness inside it was a lawyer the king suspected that as soon as he was dead dick would start producing pieces of paper in court and demanding a bigger share of the business backdated to the time when the virgin mary herself was in mourning the kings own legal people had declared everything to be watertight and above reproach but that was just more lawyers telling their client what they thought he wanted to hear there would be days in court after he died of that the king had no doubt and his beloved dealership and equally beloved family would be torn apart as a result the king was standing outside the office of the main lot on route sipping coffee from a big cup emblazoned with a gold crown he still liked to put in a couple of days each month and the other salesmen didnt object because any money he earned in commission was put back into a communal pot at the end of every month one salesmans name was drawn from a hat over beers in arties shack and all of the money went to him or to her for two women now worked on the kings lots and they sold a bunch of cars to the kind of men who had wires running straight from their dicks to their wallets the winner paid for beers and food and so everyone was happy it was four in the afternoon dead time and since it was a weekday in the middle of the month the king didnt expect it to pick up much before closing while they might get a few walkins once the office workers finished up the only thing most of them would have in their pockets would be their hands then right at the end of the lot he saw a man leaning into the windshield of a volvo v turbo wagon auto leather interior amfmcassettecd player sunroof fortyfive thousand miles thing had been driven like it was made of eggshells so there wasnt a scratch on the paintwork the kings boys had it tagged at twenty thousand with plenty of room for maneuver the guy was wearing a sun visor and dark glasses but the king couldnt tell much else about him other than that he looked a little old and beatup the kings eyesight wasnt so good these days but once he got his marks in focus he could tell more about them in thirty seconds than most psychologists could learn in a year of sessions the king put his cup down on the windowsill straightened his tie slipped the keys to the volvo from the lockup box and headed out into the lot someone asked him if he needed any help there was a burst of laughter the king knew what they were doing looking out for him while pretending that they werent guy is older than i am he said im only worried that he dont die before i get him to sign the papers there was more laughter the king could see that the old man at the volvo had opened the drivers door and slipped into the seat that was a good sign getting them into the damn car was the hardest part and once they were testdriving then guilt started to kick in the salesman a nice guy was taking time out of his busy schedule to go for a ride with them he knew a little about sport maybe liked the same music once hed taken a flip through the dial and found something that made the mark smile after hed gone to all that trouble well what could a decent human being do but listen to what the man had to say about this beautiful automobile and hey it was hot out there right so better to do it in the cool of the office with a cold can of soda in one hand huh what do you mean talk to your wife first shes gonna love this car its safe its clean its got solid resale value you walk out of this lot without signing and it wont be here once youre done having a conversation with the little lady that you didnt need to have to begin with because shes going to tell you what im telling you its a steal you get her hopes up and bring her down here only to find out that this baby is gone and youre going to be in a worse position than you were before you started talk to the bank we got a finance package right here thats better than any bank nah theyre just numbers youre never gonna end up paying back that much the king reached the volvo leaned down and looked in through the drivers window well how you doin to the pitch died on his lips larry crane grinned up at him all yellow teeth unwashed hair and dirtencrusted wrinkles why im doin fine king just fine you lookin at buyin a car there larry im lookin king thats for sure but i aint buyin yet bet you could do me a favor though we bein old war buddies and all i can cut you a deal sure said the king yeah said larry bet you could cut me one and i could cut you one right back he lifted one mangy buttock from the seat and broke wind loudly the king nodded even the false warmth he had managed to generate now fading rapidly uhhuh he said uhhuh you aint here to buy no car larry what do you want larry crane leaned over and opened the passenger door sit in with me king he said you can roll the windows down the smell gets too much for you i got a proposition to make the king didnt take the seat you aint gettin no money from me larry i told you that before were all done on that score i aint askin for money sit in boy aint gonna cost you nothin to listen the king exhaled a wheezy breath he looked over at the office wishing hed never left his coffee then lowered himself into the volvo you got the keys for this piece of shit asked larry i got em then lets you and me go for a ride we got some talkin to do france the french cistercians were used to hiding secrets from to the monastery at pontigny in burgundy gave shelter to thomas becket the english prelate exiled for opposing henry ii until he decided to return to his diocese and was murdered for his troubles locdieu at martiel in the midipyrenees provided a refuge for the mona lisa during world war ii its combination of a fortresss high walls and the grandeur of a country manor rendering it most appropriate for such a ladys enforced retreat it is true that other monasteries farther afield held treasures of their own the cistercians of dulce cor or sweetheart at loch kindar in scotland were entrusted with the embalmed heart of john lord balliol in and of his wife the lady devorgilla who followed him to the grave two decades later and zlata koruna in the czech republic held a spine reputed to have come from the crown of thorns placed upon the head of christ purchased from king louis himself by premysl otakar ii yet these were relics known to be retained and while they were guarded by the monks there were few concerns by the twentieth century that an awareness of their presence might lead to the monasteries themselves being targeted no it was those artifacts retained in silence hidden behind cellar walls or within great altars that placed at risk the monasteries and their inhabitants the knowledge of their presence was passed on from abbot to abbot so that few knew what lay beneath the library at salem in germany or under the ornate church paving at byland in yorkshires north riding or in fontfroide there had been monks at fontfroide since although the first formal community probably made up of former hermits from the benedictine order was established in the abbey of fontfroide itself appeared in or and quickly became a frontline fortress in the fight against heresy when pope innocent iii moved against the manicheans his legates were two monks from fontfroide one of whom pierre de castelnau was subsequently assassinated a former abbot of fontfroide led the bloody crusade against the albigensians and the monastery aligned itself staunchly against the catharist forces of montsegur and queribus otherwise tolerated by the liberals of aragon it was perhaps no surprise that fontfroide should eventually seize the greatest of prizes and so the abbey was finally rewarded for its steadfastness when its former abbot jacques fournier became pope benedict xii fontfroide was wealthy to boot its prosperity based upon the twentyfive farmsteads that it owned and its grazing herds of over twenty thousand cattle but gradually the monks grew fewer and fewer and during the french revolution fontfroide was turned into a hospice by the city of narbonne in a way this was fontfroides salvation for it led to the preservation of the abbey when so many others fell into ruin and a cistercian community flourished once again at the abbey from until when the state put fontfroide up for sale and it was bought and preserved by a pair of french art lovers from the languedoc but in all that time even during periods when no monks graced its cloisters fontfroide remained under the close scrutiny of the cistercians they were there when it was a hospice taking care of the sick and injured in the guise of laymen and they returned to its environs when the wealthy benefactors gustave fayet and his wife madeleine dandoque purchased it to prevent it from being shipped brick by brick to the united states there is a little church that lies less than a mile from fontfroide a far humbler offering to god than its great neighbor it is called in english the vigil church and from there the cistercians kept watch over fontfroide and its secrets for almost five hundred years its treasures remained undisturbed until world war ii entered its final phase the germans began to retreat and the american soldiers came to fontfroide no said the king uhuh i got one of those letters too and i threw it in the trash mark hall knew that times had changed even if larry crane didnt in those months after the war the world was still in chaos and a man could get away with a great deal once he took even a little care about it it wasnt like that now he had kept a watchful eye on the newspapers and had followed the case of the meadors with particular interest and concern joe tom meador while serving with the us army during world war ii had stolen manuscripts and reliquaries from a cave outside quedlinburg in central germany where the citys cathedral had placed them for safekeeping during the conflict joe tom mailed the treasures to his mother in may and once he returned home he took to showing them to women in return for sexual favors joe tom died in and his brother jack and sister jane decided to sell the treasures making a futile effort to disguise their origins along the way the haul was valued at about million but the meadors got only million minus legal fees from the german government furthermore by selling the items they attracted the interest of the us attorney for eastern texas carol johnson who initiated an international investigation in six years later a grand jury indicted jack jane and their lawyer john torigan on charges of illegally conspiring to sell stolen treasures charges that carried with them a penalty of ten years in prison and fines of up to that they got away with paying to the irs was beside the point for mark hall it was clear to him that the smart thing would be to take to the grave the knowledge of what he and larry had done in france during the war but now here was dumb and greedy larry crane about to draw them into a whole world of potential hurt hall was already troubled by the appearance of the letter it meant that someone was making connections and drawing conclusions from them if they stayed quiet and refused to take the bait then maybe hall would be able to go to his grave without spending his childrens inheritance on legal fees they were parked in the driveway outside the kings house his wife was away visiting jeanie so theirs was the only car present larry laid a shaky hand on the kings arm the king tried to shake it off but larry responded by turning the resting hand into a claw and gripping the king tightly just lets take a look at it is all im sayin we just need to compare it with the picture make sure its the same thing were talking about these people are offering a whole lot of money i got money for the first time larry cranes temper frayed well i sure as fuck dont he shouted i got shit king and im in trouble what kind of trouble can an old goat like you get into you know i always liked to gamble ah jesus i knew you was the kind of fool thought he was smarter than other fools but the only folks who should bet on horses are those who can afford to lose last i heard you werent exactly high on that list crane took the insult absorbing the blow he wanted to lash out at the king to beat his head against the pinefresh dashboard of this scandinavian piece of shit but doing that wouldnt get him any closer to the money maybe he said and for a few moments crane allowed his selfhatred so long buried beneath his hatred of others to shine through i never had your smarts thats for sure i married bad and i made bad decisions in business i aint got no kids and could be thats for the best idve screwed them up too i figure all told i got a lot of what i deserved and then some he released his grip on the kings arm but these men theyre gonna hurt me king theyll take my house if they can get it hell its the only thing i have left thats worth anything but theyll cause me pain along with it and i cant handle no pain like that all im askin is that you take a look at that thing you got to see if its a match could be we can cut a deal with the folks that are lookin for it it just takes a phone call we can do this quiet and no one will ever know please king do this for me and youll never have to see me again i know you dont like me bein around and your wife shed see me burnin in the fires of hell and she wouldnt waste her sweat to cool me down but that dont bother me none i just want to hear what this guy has got to say but i cant do that unless i know that we have what hes lookin for i got my part here he removed a greasy brown envelope from a plastic grocery bag that lay on the backseat inside was a small silver box very old and very battered i never paid it much mind until now he explained even seeing it there in the driveway of his own house gave the king the creeps he didnt know why they had taken it to begin with except that some voice in his head had told him it was strange maybe even valuable the first time hed laid eyes on it he liked to think hed have known that even if those men had not died trying to keep it for themselves but that was in the aftermath when his blood was still hot his blood and the blood of others i dont know said the king get it whispered larry lets put them together just so we can see the king sat in silence unmoving he stared at his nice house his neatly kept lawn the window of the bedroom he shared with his wife if i could undo just one element of my life he thought if i could take back just one action it would be that one all that has followed all the happiness and joy has been blighted by it for all the pleasure i have enjoyed in life for all of the wealth that i have amassed and all the kudos i have gained i have never known one day of peace the king opened the car door and walked slowly to his house private larry crane and corporal mark e hall were in real trouble their platoon had been on patrol in the languedoc part of a joint effort with the british and canadians to secure the southwest and flush out isolated germans while the main us force continued its eastward advance and had wandered into a trap on the outskirts of narbonne germans in brownandgreen camouflage uniforms backed up by a halftrack with a heavy machine gun the uniforms had thrown the americans because of equipment shortages some units were still using an experimental twopiece camouflage uniform the m which resembled the clothing routinely worn by the waffen ss in normandy hall and crane had already been involved in an incident earlier in the campaign when their unit opened fire on a quartet of riflemen from the second armored division of the fortyfirst who had become cut off during bitter fighting with the second ss panzer division near saint denislegast two of the riflemen were shot before they had a chance to identify themselves and one of them had died of his wounds lieutenant henry had fired the fatal shot himself and mark hall sometimes wondered if that was why he allowed the troops advancing out of the darkness crucial moments of grace before ordering his own men to open fire by then it was too late hall had never before seen troops move with the speed and precision of those germans one minute they were in front of the americans the next they were dispersed among the trees on both sides of the road quickly and calmly surrounding their enemies prior to annihilating them the two soldiers buried themselves in a ditch as gunfire exploded around them and the trees and bushes were turned to splinters that shot through the air like arrows and embedded themselves in skin and clothing germans said crane a little unnecessarily his face buried in the dirt there aint supposed to be no germans left here what the hell are they doing in narbonne killing us thought hall thats what theyre doing but crane was right the germans were in retreat from the region but these soldiers were clearly advancing hall was bleeding from the face and scalp as the fusillade continued around them their comrades were being torn apart already only a handful were left alive and hall could see the german soldiers closing in on the survivors to finish them off twin lightning flashes now gradually being revealed as the need for duplicity was eliminated hall could see that the halftrack was american a captured m mounted with a single thirtysevenmillimeter gun this was no ordinary bunch of germans these men had a purpose he heard crane whimpering the other man was so close to him that hall could smell his breath as crane cowered against him in the hope that halls body would provide some cover hall knew what he was doing and pushed the younger man hard get the fuck away from me he said we got to stick together pleaded crane the sounds of gunfire were becoming less frequent now and those that they heard were single bursts from german machine guns hall knew they were finishing off the wounded he started to crawl through the undergrowth seconds later crane followed many miles and many years away from the events of that day larry crane sat in an airconditioned volvo rubbing his fingers on the cross carved into the box he tried to remember what the paper that it once contained had looked like he recalled taking a look at the writing on the fragment but it was unreadable to him and he had rejected the fragment as worthless although he did not know it the words were latin and largely inconsequential the real substance lay elsewhere in a set of tiny letters and digits carefully drawn into the top righthand corner of the vellum but both the king and larry crane had been distracted by the illustration upon the page it looked like a design for something a statue of some kind but neither man had ever understood why anyone would want to make a statue like this using what looked like pieces of bone and dried skin scavenged from both humans and animals but somebody wanted it and if larry crane was right they were prepared to pay handsomely for the pleasure the two soldiers were wandering aimlessly desperately trying to find shelter from the strange unseasonable cold that was settling in and from the germans who were now presumably combing the area for any survivors to ensure that their presence was not communicated to superior forces this was no lastditch assault no futile german attempt to force back the allied tide like the actions of some teutonic king canute the ss men must have parachuted in maybe capturing the halftrack along the way and halls belief that they had some seriously dark purpose for doing so was reinforced by what he had witnessed as he and crane retreated men in civilian clothing emerging from cover shadowing the halftrack and apparently directing the efforts of the soldiers it made no sense to hall no sense at all he could only hope that the path he and crane were taking would lead them as far away as possible from the germans prize they made for higher ground and at last found themselves in what appeared to be an uninhabited region of the corbière hills there were no houses and no livestock hall figured that any animals that had once grazed had been killed for food by the nazis it started to rain halls feet were damp the top brass had taken the view that the new buckled combat boots recently issued to soldiers would suffice for winter once treated with dubbin but hall now had conclusive evidence if further evidence were needed that even in the wet grass this was not the case the boots neither repelled water nor retained warmth and as the two men trudged through the damp undergrowth halls toes began to hurt so badly that his eyes watered in addition problems with the supply chain meant that he and crane were clad only in wool trousers and ike jackets between them they had four frag grenades cranes m with a spare immediate use clip carried on his bandolier sling for reasons hall couldnt quite figure out since crane had barely managed to fire off a couple of rounds during the ambush and halls browning automatic rifle he had nine of his xround mags left including the one in the gun and crane as his designated assistant had two more belts giving them twentyfive mags in total they also had four krations two each of spam and sausage it wasnt bad but it wasnt good either not if those germans found their trail you got any idea where we are asked crane nope said hall of all the men he had to end up with after a goddamned massacre it would have to be larry crane the guy was unkillable hall felt like a pincushion what with all the splinters that had entered him and crane didnt have a scratch on his body still it was like they said somebody was looking out for crane and by staying close by a little of that protection had rubbed off on hall as well it was a reason to be thankful he supposed at least he was alive its cold said crane and wet you think i havent noticed you gonna just keep walking until you fall down im gonna keep walking until he stopped they were on the top of a small rise to their right white rocks shone in the moonlight farther on a complex of buildings was silhouetted against the night sky hall could make out what looked like a pair of steeples and great dark windows set into the walls what is it its a church maybe a monastery you think there are monks there not if they have any sense crane squatted on the ground supporting himself with his rifle what do you reckon we go down take a look around get up he yanked at crane smearing blood on the other mans uniform he felt stabs of pain run through his hand as some of the splinters were driven farther into his flesh hey you got blood on me said crane yeah im sorry about that said hall real sorry sandy crane was talking to her sister on the phone she liked her sisters husband he was a goodlooking man he wore nice clothes and smelled good he also had money and wasnt afraid to spread it around so that his wife could look her best at the golf club or at the charity dinners that they seemed to attend every second week and about which her sister never tired of telling her well sandy would show her a thing or two once larry got his hands on that money barely eight hours had elapsed since she opened the letter but already sandy had their windfall spent ten times over yeah she said larry looks like he might be coming into a little money one of his investments paid off and now were just waiting for the check to be cut she paused to listen to her sisters false congratulations uhhuh said sandy well maybe we might just come along with you to the club sometime see about getting us one of those memberships too sandy couldnt see her sister proposing the cranes for membership in her swanky club for fear of being run out of the gates with the dogs at her heels but it was fun to yank her chain some she just hoped that for once larry wouldnt find a way to screw things up hall and crane were a stones throw away from the outer wall when they saw shadows cast by moving lights down whispered hall the two soldiers hugged the wall and listened they heard voices french said crane theyre speaking french he risked a glance over the wall then rejoined hall three men he said no weapons that i can see the men were moving to the soldiers left hall and crane followed them from behind the wall eventually making their way to the front of the main chapel where a single door stood open above it was a tympanum carved with three basreliefs including a brilliantly rendered crucifixion at the center but the wall was dominated by a stainedglass oculus and two windows the traditional reference to the trinity although they were not to know it the door they were watching was rarely opened for any reason in the past it had been unlocked only to receive the remains of the viscounts of navarre or other benefactors of the abbey to be buried at fontfroide there were noises coming from inside the chapel hall and crane could hear stones being moved and grunts of effort from the men within a figure passed through the darkness to their right keeping watch on the road that led to the monastery his back was to the soldiers silently hall closed in on him sliding his bayonet from his belt when he was close enough he slapped his hand over the mans mouth and placed the tip of the knife to his neck not a move not a sound he said comprenez the man nodded hall could see a white robe beneath the mans tattered greatcoat youre a monk he whispered again the man nodded how many inside use your fingers the monk lifted three fingers they monks too nod okay were going inside you and me crane joined him monks said hall he saw crane breathe out deeply with relief and felt a little of the same relief himself we dont take any chances though said hall you cover me he forced the monk down the flight of four stone steps that led to the church door as they drew closer they could see the lights flickering within hall stopped at the entrance and glanced inside there was gold on the stone floor chalices coins even swords and daggers that gleamed with gemstones set into their hilts and scabbards as the monk had said three men were laboring in the cold surroundings their breath rising in great clouds their bodies steaming with sweat two were naked from the waist up forcing a pair of crowbars into the gap between floor and stone the third older than the others stood beside them urging them on he had sandals on his feet almost obscured by his white robes he called a name and when no response came he moved toward the door hall stepped into the chapel he released his grip on the monk and pushed him gently ahead of him crane appeared beside him its okay he said were americans the expression on the old monks face didnt indicate that he thought this was okay at all and hall realized that the cleric was just as concerned about the allies as he was about any other potential threat no he said you should not be here you must go go he spoke english with only the barest hint of an accent behind him the monks who had briefly paused in their efforts to shift the stone now redoubled them i dont think so said hall were in trouble germans we lost a lot of guys germans said the monk where near narbonne said hall ss then they will soon be here said the monk he turned to the watcher and told him to return to his post crane appeared on the verge of stopping him but hall held him back and the monk was allowed to pass you want to tell us what youre doing hall asked better that you do not know please leave us there was a howl of rage and disappointment from the laborers and the great stone fell back into place one of the men sank to his knees in frustration you trying to hide that stuff there was a pause before the answer came yes said the monk and hall knew that he was not telling the entire truth he briefly wondered what kind of monk told lies in a church and figured that the answer was a desperate one you wont move that with just two men said hall we can help right he looked to crane but the privates eyes were fixed on the treasure that lay upon the floor hall slapped cranes arm hard i said we can help them you okay with that crane nodded sure sure he shrugged off his uniform jacket placed his gun on the floor and he and hall joined the men at the stone now that he was up close hall could see that they were tonsured they looked to their leader waiting for him to respond to the americans offer bien he said at last vite with four men now working instead of two the stone began to lift more easily but it was still immensely heavy twice it slipped back down into its resting place until a last great effort forced it up sufficiently far for it to be pushed back onto the floor hall rested his hands on his knees and stared into the hole they had created a silver hexagonal box perhaps six inches in circumference and sealed with wax lay in the dirt it was plain and unadorned apart from a simple cross carved into the top the old monk knelt and carefully reached in to retrieve it he had just lifted it out when the alarm was raised by the sentinel at the door shit said hall trouble already the old monk was pushing the cache of gold into the hole and urging his fellows to replace the stone as best they could but they were exhausted and making slow progress please said the monk help them but hall and crane were making for the door carefully they joined the lookout at the top of the steps men perhaps a dozen or more in total were advancing along the road in the moonlight their helmets shining behind them came the halftrack with more men following it the two americans took one look at each other and melted into the darkness the king stood on the top rung of the ladder and pulled the cord the attic swam into light illumination not quite reaching the farthest corners his wife had told him again and again that they needed to install a window in the roof or at least put in a stronger lightbulb but hall had never really made either a priority they didnt come up here much anyway and he was no longer entirely sure what most of these boxes and old suitcases contained cleaning it up was a chore that he was too old for so he had resigned himself not with any great difficulty to the fact that it would be up to his children to sort through this junk when he and jan were dead and gone there was one box that he did know where to find it was on a shelf with a collection of wartime memorabilia that was now merely accumulating dust but which at one point he had considered displaying no that wasnt quite true like most soldiers he had taken souvenirs from the enemynothing macabre nothing like the ears that some of those poor demented bastards in vietnam had collectedbut uniform hats a luger pistol even a ceremonial sword that he had found in the scorched remains of a bunker on omaha he had picked them up without a second thought after all if he didnt take them then someone else would and they were no use to their previous owners in fact when he entered that bunker he could smell the officer who was once probably the proud owner of the sword as his charred body was still smoking in one corner not a good way to go trapped in a cement bunker with liquid fire pouring through the gun slit not a good way to go at all but once he returned home his desire to be reminded of his wartime service diminished greatly and any thoughts of display were banished like the trophies themselves to a dark unused place hall climbed farther into the attic keeping his head slightly bowed to prevent any painful knocks against the ceiling and threaded his way through boxes and rolled up rugs until he reached the shelf the sword was still there wrapped in brown paper and clear plastic but he left it as it was behind it was a locked box he had always kept it secured in part because it contained the luger and he didnt want his kids when they were younger to discover it and start playing with it like it was a toy the key was kept in a nearby jar of rusty nails just to further discourage idle hands he poured the nails onto the floor until the key became visible then used it to open the box there was a trunk filled with old hardcover books nearby and he sat down upon it resting the box upon his knee it felt heavier than he remembered but then it had been a long time since he had opened it and he was older now he wondered idly if bad memories and old sins accumulated weight the burden of them steadily growing greater as the years went by this box was foul memories given shape sins endowed with bulk and form it seemed almost to drag his head down to it as though it were suspended from a chain around his neck he opened it and slowly began placing the contents on the floor beside his feet the luger first then the dagger it was silver and black and emblazoned with a deathshead emblem the blade when withdrawn showed spots of rust below the hilt and along the blade but otherwise the steel was largely intact he had greased it and wrapped it before storing it away and his precautions had paid off the plastic peeled away easily and in the dim light the grease gave to the blade a glistening organic quality as though he had just removed a layer of skin and exposed the interior of a living thing he laid the knife beside the luger and removed the third item a lot of soldiers returned from the war with iron crosses taken from the enemy mostly standard types but some like the one hall now held in his hand adorned with an oakleaf cluster the officer from whom it was taken must have done something pretty special hall thought he must have been trusted greatly to be sent to narbonne in the face of the advancing enemy in order to seek out the monastery of fontfroide and retrieve whatever was secured there only two things remained in the box the first was a gold cross four inches in height and decorated with rubies and sapphires hall had retained it against his better judgment because it was so beautiful and perhaps also because it symbolized his own faith stored away in shame after what he had done now as the time of his death inevitably approached he realized that he had not misplaced that faith entirely the cross had always been there locked away in the attic with the discarded fragments of his own life and those of his wife and children true some were useless and some were better forgotten but there were items of value here too things that should not have been set aside so readily he brushed his fingertips across the centerpiece of the ornament a ruby as big as the ball of his thumb i kept it because it was precious he told himself i kept it because it was beautiful and because somewhere in my heart and my soul i still believed i believed in its strength and its purity and its goodness i believed in what it represented it was always the secondtolast item in the box always for that way it rested upon the vellum fragment at the bottom anchoring it in place rendering its contents somehow less awful larry crane never understood larry crane never believed in anything but i did i was raised in the faith and i will die in the faith what i did at fontfroide was a terrible thing and i will be punished for it when i die yet the moment that i touched the fragment i knew it was a link to something far viler those germans did not risk their lives for gold and jewels to them they were just trinkets and ornaments no they came for that piece of vellum and if one good thing came out of that night it was the fact that they did not get it it will not be enough to save me from damnation though no larry crane and i will burn together for what we did that night the ss men poured down the steps like channels of filthy muddy water and pooled together in the little courtyard that lay before the church door creating a kind of honor guard for the four civilians who stepped from the halftrack to join them from the shadows where he lay hall saw the old monk try to bar their way he was pushed into the arms of the waiting soldiers and thrown against the wall hall heard him speak to the senior officer the one with the dagger on his belt and the medal at his neck who had accompanied the men in civilian clothes the monk held out a bejeweled gold cross offering it to the soldier hall couldnt understand german but it was clear the monk was trying to convince the officer that there was more where that came from if he wanted it the officer said something curt in reply then he and the civilians entered the church hall heard some shouting and a short burst of gunfire a voice was raised and hall discerned some words that he did understand an order to cease fire he wasnt sure how long that would last once the germans got whatever they had come for they would leave nobody alive to talk about it hall began working his way backward moving through the darkness and into the woods until he was facing the halftrack its passenger door was open and there was a soldier sitting at the wheel watching what was taking place in the courtyard hall unsheathed his bayonet and crawled to the very edge of the road when he was certain that he was out of sight of the other soldiers he padded across the dirt and pulled himself into the halftracks cab staying low all the time the german sensed him at the last minute because he turned and seemed about to shout a warning but halls left hand shot up and caught him under the chin forcing his mouth closed with a snap while the blade entered below the soldiers sternum and pierced his heart the german trembled against the bayonet then grew still hall used the blade to anchor him to his seat before slipping out of the cab and into the back of the halftrack he had a clear view of the soldiers on the right of the steps and of most of the courtyard but there were at least three hidden by the wall to the left he looked to his right and saw crane peering at him from a copse of bushes for once thought hall just once do the right thing larry he signaled with his fingers indicating to crane that he should go around the back of the vehicle and through the trees so that he could take out the germans hidden from hall there was a pause before crane nodded and started to move larry crane was trying to light a cigarette but the damn cigarette lighter had been removed from the volvo so that smokers would not be encouraged to spoil its imitation new car scent with tobacco smoke he searched his pockets once again but his own lighter wasnt there he had probably left it at home in his hurry to confront his old buddy the auto king with the prospect of easy wealth now that he thought of it the unlit cigarette in his mouth tasted a little musty which led him to suspect that hed left both cigarettes and lighter in the house and what was now in his mouth was a relic of an old pack that had somehow escaped his notice he had taken the first jacket he could lay a hand on and it wasnt one that he usually wore it had leather patches on the elbows for a start which made him look like some kind of new york jew professor and the sleeves were too long it caused him to feel older and smaller than he was and he didnt need that what he did need was a nicotine boost and hed bet a dime that the king hadnt locked the door to his house after he went inside larry figured there would be matches in the kitchen at worst he could light up from the stove wouldnt be the first time although hed tried it once when he had a couple under his belt and had just about singed his eyebrows off the right one still grew sort of rangy as a result fuckin auto king in his nice house with his fat wife his slick sons and that whiny daughter of his looked like she could do with some feeding up and some holding down under a real man the king didnt need any more money than he had already and now he was making his old army buddy squirm on the hook while he thought about whether or not to take the bait well hed take the bait whether it sat comfortably with him or not larry crane wasnt about to let his fingers get broken just because the auto king was having scruples after the fact hell the old bastard wouldnt even have a business if it hadnt been for larry theyd have left that monastery poor as when they found it and halls old age would have been spent scrounging nickels and clipping coupons not as a respected pillar of the georgia business community living in a goddamned mansion in a nice neighborhood you think theyd still respect you if they found out how you came by the money to buy into that first lot huh you bet your ass they wouldnt theyd hang you out to dry you and your bitch wife and all your miserable brood larry was getting nicely stoked up now it had been a while since hed let the old blood run free and it felt good he wasnt going to take no shit from the auto king not this time not ever again the cigarette moist with poisonous spit larry crane strode into the kings house to light up the officer emerged from the church flanked by the men in civilian clothing one of them was carrying the silver box in his hands while the others had packed the gold into a pair of sacks behind them came one of the monks whom hall and crane had helped with the shifting of the stone his arms held behind his back by two ss soldiers he was forced against the wall to join the abbot and the sentinel three monks that meant one was already dead and it looked like the rest were about to follow him the abbot started to make one final plea but the officer turned his back on him and directed three soldiers to take up position as a makeshift firing squad hall got behind the thirtysevenmillimeter and saw that crane was at last in place he counted twelve germans in his sights that would leave just a handful more for crane to deal with assuming everything went without a hitch hall drew a deep breath placed his hands on the big machine gun and pulled the trigger the burst of noise was deafening in the silence of the night and the power of the gun shook him as he fired centuriesold masonry fragmented as the bullets tore into the monastery pockmarking the façade of the church and shattering part of the lintel above the door although by the time they hit the wall theyd passed through half a dozen german soldiers ripping them apart like they were made of paper he glimpsed the muzzle flare from cranes gun but he couldnt hear its report his ears were ringing and his eyes were full of dark marionettes in uniform dancing to the beat of the music he was creating he watched the side of the officers head disappear and saw one of the civilians bucking against the wall dead but still jerking with each shot that hit him he raked the courtyard and steps until he was certain that everyone in his sights was dead then stopped firing he was drenched in sweat and rain and his legs felt weak he climbed down as crane advanced from the bushes and the two soldiers looked upon their work the courtyard and steps ran red and fragments of tissue and bone seemed to sprout from the cracks like night blooms one of the monks at the wall was dead killed perhaps by a ricochet guessed hall or a burst of gunfire from a dying german the sacks of church ornaments lay upon the ground some of their contents lying scattered beside them nearby rested the silver box while hall watched the senior cleric reached for it hall could now see that he was bleeding from the face injured by fragments of flying stone the other monk the sentinel was already trying to replace the gold in the sacks neither said a word to the americans hey said crane hall looked at him thats our gold said crane what do you mean our gold crane gestured at the sacks with the muzzle of his gun we saved their lives right we deserve some reward he pointed his gun at the monk leave it said crane the monk didnt even pause arret said crane then added just in case arret français oui arret by then the monk had refilled the sacks and was lifting one with each hand preparing to take them away crane sent a burst of gunfire across his path the monk stopped suddenly waited for a second or two then continued on his way the next shots took him in the back he stumbled the sacks falling to the ground once again then found purchase against the wall of the church he remained like that propping himself up until his knees buckled and he crumpled in a heap by the door the hell are you doing said hall you killed him you killed a monk its ours said crane its our future i didnt survive this long to go back home poor and i dont believe you want to go back to working on no farm the old monk was staring blankly at the body in the doorway you know what you got to do said crane we can walk away said hall no you dont think hell tell someone what we done hell remember us well be shot as looters as murderers no youll be shot thought hall im a hero i killed ss men and saved treasure ill getwhat a commendation a medal maybe not even that there was nothing heroic about what i did i turned a big gun on a bunch of nazis they didnt even get a shot off in response he stared into larry cranes eyes and knew that no german had killed the monk with the chest wound even then larry had his plan in place you kill him said crane or the muzzle of cranes gun hung in the air midway between hall and the monk the message was clear were in this together said crane or were not in this at all later hall would argue to himself that he would have died had he not colluded with crane but deep inside he knew that it wasnt true he could have fought back even then he could have tried reasoning and waited for his chance to make a move but he didnt in part it was because he knew from past efforts that larry crane wasnt a man to be reasoned with but there was more to his decision than that hall wanted more than a commendation or a medal he wanted comfort a start in life crane was right he didnt want to return home as dirt poor as he was when he left there was no turning back not since crane had killed one and probably two unarmed men it was time to choose and in that instant hall realized that maybe he and larry crane had been meant to find each other and that they werent so different after all from the corner of his eye he registered the last of the monks make a move toward the church door and he turned his bar upon him hall stopped counting after five shots when the muzzle flare had died and the spots had disappeared from in front of his eyes he saw the cross lying inches from the old mans outstretched fingers droplets of blood scattered like jewels around it they carried the sacks and the box almost to narbonne and buried them in the woods behind the ruins of a farmhouse two hours later a convoy of green trucks entered the village and they rejoined their comrades and fought their way across europe with varying degrees of valor until the time came to be shipped home both elected to stay in europe for a time and returned to narbonne in a jeep that was surplus to requirements or became surplus as soon as they paid a suitable bribe hall made contact with people in the antique business who were acting in turn as middlemen for some of the less scrupulous collectors of art and relics already picking their way through the bones of europes postwar culture none of them seemed very much interested in the silver box or its contents the vellum document was unpleasant at best and even if worth anything would be difficult to dispose of to anyone but a very specialized collector and so crane and hall had divided that item into two halves with crane taking the primitive silver box and hall retaining the document fragment crane had tried to sell the box once but had been offered next to nothing for it so he decided to hold on to it as a souvenir after all he kind of liked the memories that went with it larry crane found some long matches in a drawer and lit his cigarette he was watching the empty birdbath in the backyard when he heard the sound of footsteps descending the stairs in here he called hall came into the kitchen i dont remember inviting you inside he said needed a light for my smoke said crane you got that paper no said hall you listen here said crane then stopped as hall stepped toward him now the two old men were facetoface crane with his back against the sink hall before him no said hall you listen im sick of you youve been like a bad debt my whole life a bad debt that i can never pay off it ends here today crane blew a stream of smoke into halls face youre forgettin somethin boy i know what you did back there outside that church i saw you do it i go down and ill take you with me you mark me he leaned in close to hall his breath smelled foul as he spoke its over when i say its over cranes eyes suddenly bulged in their sockets his mouth opened in a great oval of shock the last of the cigarette smoke shooting forth through the gap accompanied by a spray of spittle that struck hall on the side of the face halls left hand extended in a familiar movement closing cranes mouth while his right forced the blade of the ss dagger up under cranes breastbone hall knew what he was doing after all hed done it before larry cranes body sagged against him and he smelled the old mans innards as he lost control of himself say it larry whispered hall say its over now there was blood but less than hall had expected it didnt take him long to clean it up he drove the volvo around the back of his house then wrapped cranes body in plastic sheeting from the garage left over from the last round of renovations on the house when he was certain that crane was wrapped up tight he placed him with a little trouble in the trunk of the car then went for a ride into the swamps chapter thirteen tucson airport was undergoing renovation and a temporary tunnel led from the baggage claim to the car rental counters the two men were given a camry which caused the smaller of the pair to complain bitterly as they made their way into the garage maybe if you lost some of that weight off your ass then you wouldnt find it so damn pokey said louis i got a foot on you and i can fit into a camry angel stopped you think im fat gettin there you never said nothing about it before the hell you mean i never said nothing i been telling you ever since i met you that your problem is you got a sweet tooth you need to go on that atkins shit id starve i think you are missing the point folks in africa starve you go on a diet you be like a squirrel you just need to nap let your body burn off whats already there angel tried to give the flesh on his waist a discreet squeeze how much can i squeeze and still be healthy they say an inch like on the tv angel looked at what he had clenched in his hand is that across or up man you even have to ask and you in trouble for the first time in many days angel allowed himself a smile albeit a small one and very shortlived since marthas appearance at the house louis had barely eaten or slept angel would awake in the darkness to find their shared bed empty the pillows and sheets long cold on his partners side on the first night when they had brought martha back to the city and transferred her to her new lodgings he had padded softly to the bedroom door and watched in silence as louis sat at a window staring out over the city scrutinizing every passing face in the hope that he might find alices among them guilt emanated from his pores so that the room seemed almost to smell of something bitter and old angel knew all about alice he had accompanied his partner on his searches for her initially along eighth avenue when they first learned that she had arrived in the city and later at the point when giulianis reforms really started to bite and vice enforcement began hitting the streets of manhattan on a regular basis nypd ghosts mingling with the crowds below fortyfourth and monitoring teams waiting to pounce from unmarked vans the point was a little easier in the beginning out of sight out of mind that was the giuliani mantra once the tourists and conventioneers in manhattan werent tripping over too many teenage hookers if they accidentallyor purposelystrayed from times square then everything was better than it was before over at hunts point the ninetieth precinct only had the manpower to operate a tenperson special operation maybe once a month usually targeted at the men who patronized and involving just one undercover female officer true there were occasional sweeps but those were relatively infrequent in the beginning until zero tolerance began to hit hard the cops creating a virtual tickertape parade of summonses which almost inevitably led to arrests since the homeless and drugaddicted who formed the bulk of the citys street prostitutes could not afford to pay their fines and that was a ninetyday stint in rikers right there the almost continual harassment of the prostitutes by the cops forced the women to stagger their beats in order to avoid being seen in the same spot two nights running it also forced them to frequent increasingly isolated places with the johns which left them open to rape abduction and murder it was into this sucking hole that alice was descending and their interventions counted for nothing in fact angel could see that the woman sometimes seemed almost to take a strange pleasure in taunting louis with her immersion in the life even as it inexorably led to her degradation and ultimately to her death in the end all louis could do was make sure that whatever pimp was feeding off her knew the consequences if anything happened to her and paid her fines to ensure that she didnt do jail time finally he could no longer bring himself to witness her decay and it was perhaps unsurprising that she slipped through the net when free billy died and came instead under the control of gmack and so angel watched him that first night not speaking for some time until at last he said you tried not hard enough she may still be out there somewhere louis gave a barely perceptible shake of his head no shes gone i can feel it listen to go back to bed and he did because there was nothing more that could be said there was no point in trying to tell him that it wasnt his fault that people made their own choices that you couldnt save someone who didnt want to be saved didnt matter how hard you tried louis would not or could not believe those things this was his guilt and alices path was not entirely of her own choosing the actions of others had set her upon it and his were among them but there was more that angel could not have guessed at small private moments between louis and alice that perhaps only martha might have understood for they found an echo in the phone calls and the occasional cards that she herself received louis could remember alice as a child how she would play at his feet or fall asleep curled up beside him bathed in the glow of their first tv she cried when he left home although she was barely old enough to comprehend what was happening and in the years that followed as his visits grew fewer and fewer she was always the first to greet him slowly she recognized the changes that were coming over him as the boy who had killed her father believing him guilty of the murder of his own mother matured into a man capable of taking the lives of others without exploring questions of innocence or guilt alice could not have put a name to these changes or have precisely explained the nature of louiss ongoing metamorphosis but the coldness that was spreading through him touched something inside of her and halfformed suspicions and fears about her fathers death were given body and substance louis saw what was happening and determined to put some distance between himself and his family a decision made easier by the nature of his business and his reluctance to put those whom he loved at risk of reprisal all of these tensions came to a head on the day that louis left his childhood home for the last time when alice came to him as he sat in the shade of a cottonwood tree the sun slowly setting behind him his shadow spreading like dark blood across the short grass by then she was approaching her teenage years although she looked older than she was and her body was maturing more quickly than the bodies of her peers momma says youre leaving today she said thats right the way she said it its like you aint ever coming back things change people change this aint no place for me now she pursed her lips then raised her hand to her brow shielding her eyes as she stared into the redness of the sun i seen the way people look at you what way is that like theys scared of you even momma she looks like that sometimes shes got no call to be scared of me you neither why are they scared i dont know i heard stories louis stood and tried to pass her by but she blocked his way her hands splayed against his midriff no she said you tell me you tell me that the stories aint true i got no time for stories he gripped her wrists and turned her slipping by her and heading toward the house they say my daddy was a bad man they say he got what he deserved she was shouting now he heard her running after him but he did not look back they say you know what happened to him tell me tell me and she struck him from behind with such force that he stumbled and fell to his knees he tried to rise and she slapped him he saw that she was weeping tell me she said again but this time her voice was soft barely a whisper tell me that it isnt true but he could not answer her and he walked away and left them all only once in the years of her descent did alice again bring up the subject of her father it was fourteen months before her disappearance when louis still believed that she might yet be saved she called him from the private clinic in phoenicia in the midst of the catskills and he drove up to see her that afternoon he had placed her there after jackie o called him and told him that alice was with him that a john had hurt her badly and she had nearly overdosed in an effort to dull the pain she was bruised and bleeding her eyes slivers of white beneath heavy lids her mouth agape louis took her to phoenicia the following morning once she was straight enough to understand what was happening the beating had shocked her and she appeared more willing than ever before to consider intervention she spent six weeks isolated in phoenicia then the call came louis found her in the main garden sitting on a stone bench she had lost a little weight and looked tired and drawn but there was a new light in her eyes a tiny flickering thing that he had not seen in a long time the slightest wind could blow it out but it was there for the moment they walked together the chill mountain air making her shiver slightly even though she was wearing a thick padded jacket he offered her his coat and she took it wrapping it around her like a blanket i drew a picture for you she said after they had made a circuit of the grounds talking of the clinic and the other patients she had encountered i didnt know you liked to draw said louis i never had the chance before they told me it might help me a lady comes in every day for an hour more if she thinks youre making progress and she can spare the time she says i have talent but i dont believe so she reached into the pocket of her jacket and withdrew a sheet of white paper folded to a quarter of its size he opened it its our house she said as though fearful that her work was too poor to enable him to guess its subject matter its beautiful he said and it was she had depicted the house as though seen through a mist using chalks to dull the lines a faint warm light shone through the windows and the door was slightly ajar the foxgloves and dayflowers in the garden were smudges of pink and blue the trilliums tiny stars of green and red the forest beyond was a wash of tall brown trunks like the masts of ships descending into a sea of green ferns thank you he said i called momma she said they said it was okay to call people now that id been here for a time i told her i was doing fine but that aint true its hard you know she examined his face her lips slightly pursed and he was suddenly reminded of the girl who had confronted him beneath the cottonwood im sorry she said i think maybe whatever you did before i was born you did out of love im sorry too he replied she smiled and for the first time since she was a young girl she kissed him on the cheek goodbye she said she began to shrug off his coat but he stopped her you keep it he said its cold up here she drew the coat around her then headed back into the clinic he saw an orderly search the coat for contraband then return it to her she looked back at him waved then was gone he did not know what happened subsequently there were rumors of an argument with a fellow patient and a painful troubled session with one of the resident therapists whatever occurred the next call he received from phoenicia was to tell him that alice was gone he searched for her on the streets but when she emerged after three weeks from whatever dark corner she had been inhabiting that tiny light had been extinguished forever and all he had left was a picture of a house that appeared to be fading even as he looked at it and the memory of a last kiss from one who was in her way bonded more closely to him than any other in this world now for the first time since marthas appearance and the discovery of the remains in williamsburg louis seemed energized angel knew what it meant someone was about to suffer for what had been done to alice and angel didnt care once it brought his partner some release they arrived at their rental i hate these cars said angel yeah so you said already im just offended that shed even think we looked like the kind of guys whod drive a camry they placed their bags on the ground and watched as a man in rental livery approached them he had a small titanium case in his hand you forgot one of your bags he said thanks said louis no problem car okay my friend here doesnt like it the guy knelt removed a penknife from his pocket and carefully inserted the blade into the right front tire he twisted the knife removed it and watched with satisfaction as the tire started to deflate so go get something else he said then walked out of the garage and into a waiting white suv which immediately drove away i guess he doesnt really work for a rental company said angel you should be a detective doesnt pay enough ill go get us a decent car angel returned minutes later with the key to a red mercury louis took the baggage and walked to the car then popped the trunk he glanced around before opening the titanium case two glock nines were revealed alongside eight spare clips bound with rubber bands into four sets of two they wouldnt need any more than that unless they decided to declare war on mexico he slipped the guns into the outer pockets of his coat and added the clips then closed the trunk he got in the car and found shiver playing on an indie station louis liked howe gelb it was good to support the local boys he passed one of the glocks and two of the spare clips to angel both men checked the guns then once they were satisfied put them away you know where were going said angel yeah i think so great i hate reading maps he reached for the radio dial dont touch that dial man im warning you boring leave it angel sighed they emerged from the gloom of the garage into the greater darkness outside the sky was dusted with stars and a little cool desert air flowed through the vents refreshing the men its beautiful said angel i guess the smaller man took in the vista for a few seconds more then said you think we could stop for doughnuts it was late and i was back at cortlandt alley the taste of the thai food still lingering in my mouth i could hear laughter over on lafayette as people smoked and flirted outside one of the local bars the window of ancient amp classic inc was illuminated the men inside carefully positioning a new delivery of furniture and ornaments a sign warned of a hollow sidewalk and i thought that i could almost hear my footsteps echoing through the layers beneath my feet i made my way to neddos doorway this time he didnt bother with the chain once id told him who i was he led me into the same back office and offered me some tea i get it from the people run the store at the corner its good i watched as he poured it into a pair of china cups so small they looked like they belonged in a dolls house as i held one in my hand i could see that it was very old the interior a mass of tiny brown hairline cracks the tea was fragrant and strong ive been reading all about the killing in the newspapers said neddo kept your name out of it i see maybe theyre concerned for my safety more concerned than you are clearly someone might suspect that you had a death wish mr parker im happy to say that its unfulfilled so far i trust that you werent followed here i have no desire to link my life expectancy with yours i had been careful and told him so tell me about santa muerte mr neddo neddo looked puzzled for a moment then his face cleared the mexican who died this is about him isnt it tell me first then ill see what i can give you in return neddo nodded his assent shes a mexican icon he said saint death the angel of the outcasts of the lawless even criminals and evil men need their saints she is adored on the first day of every month sometimes in public more often in secret old women pray to her to save their sons and nephews from crime while the same sons and nephews pray to her for good pickings or for help in killing their enemies death is the last great power mr parker depending upon how its scythe falls it can offer protection or destruction it can be an accomplice or an assassin through santa muerte death is given form she is a creation of men not of god neddo rose and disappeared into the confusion of his store he returned with a skull on a crude wooden block wrapped in blue gauze decorated with images of the sun it had been painted black apart from its teeth which were gold cheap earrings had been screwed into the bone and a crude crown of painted wire sat upon its head this said neddo is santa muerte she is typically presented as a skeleton or a decorated skull often surrounded by offerings or candles she enjoys sex but since she has no flesh she approves of the desires of others and lives vicariously through them she wears gaudy clothes and rings upon her fingers she likes neat whiskey cigarettes and chocolate instead of singing hymns to her during services they play mariachi music she is the secret saint the virgin of guadalupe may be the countrys patron saint but mexico is a place where people are poor and struggling and turn to crime either through necessity or inclination they remain profoundly religious yet to survive they have to break the laws of church and state albeit a state that they regard as profoundly corrupt santa muerte allows them to reconcile their needs with their beliefs there are shrines to her in tepito in tijuana in sonora in juarez wherever poor people gather it sounds like a cult it is a cult the catholic church has condemned her adoration as devil worship and while i have a great many difficulties with that institution its not hard to see that in this case there is some justification for its position most of those who pray to her merely seek protection from harm in their own lives there are others who require that she approve the visitation of harm upon others the cult has grown powerful among the foulest of men drug traffickers people smugglers purveyors of child prostitutes there was a spate of killings in sinaloa earlier this year in which more than fifty people died most of the bodies bore her image in tattoos or on amulets and rings he reached across and brushed a little dust from beneath the empty sockets of the icon and they are far from the worst he concluded more tea he refilled my cup the man who died in the apartment had a statue like this one hidden in the wall of one room and he called on santa muerte throughout the attack i said i think he and maybe others used the room to hurt and to kill i believe the skull came from the woman i was looking for neddo glanced at the skull upon his own desk im sorry he said had i known that i would have been more sensitive about showing you this icon i can remove it if you prefer you can leave it at least i know now what it was meant to represent the man you killed said neddo have they identified him his name was homero garcia he had a criminal record from his youth in mexico i didnt tell neddo that the federales were very interested in garcia the news of his death had drawn a great many telephone calls to the ninesix from the mexicans including a formal request from the mexican ambassador that the nypd cooperate in every way possible with mexican law enforcement by providing them with copies of any and all material relating to the investigation into garcias death former juvenile offenders did not usually excite such interest in diplomatic and legal circles where did he come from i was reluctant to say more i still knew little about neddo and his fascination with the display of human remains made me uneasy he recognized my distrust mr parker you may approve or disapprove of my interests and of how i make my living but mark me i know more about these matters than almost anyone else in this city i have a scholars fascination i can help you but only if you tell me what youve learned it seemed that i didnt have too much choice the mexicans are more interested in him than they should be given his record i said theyve provided some information about him to the police but its clear that theyre holding back on more garcia was born in tapito but his family left there when he was an infant he began training as a silversmith apparently it was a tradition in his family it seems he was melting down stolen items in return for a cut of the resale value which led to his arrest he was jailed for three years then was released and returned to his trade officially he was never in trouble again after that neddo leaned forward in his chair where did he practice his craft mr parker he said and there was a new urgency to his voice where was he based in juarez i said he was based in juarez neddo released a long sigh of understanding women he said the girl for whom you were searching was not the first i think homero garcia was a professional killer of women harrys best rest was less than busy when the mercury considerably dustier than before pulled up in the parking lot there were still rigs scattered through the darkness but there was nobody eating in the diner and any lonely trucker looking for comfort from the cantina women could have enjoyed a range of choice had he arrived earlier in the evening although the attentions of the police in the aftermath of the spyhole killings had somewhat depleted even their numbers the cantina was locked up for the night and only two of the women remained slouched sleepily at the bar in the hope of picking up a ride from the man who remained with them smoking a joint and sipping a last tecate in the murk the carnival lights that illuminated the bar barely touching his features harry was out back stacking beer crates when louis emerged from the darkness you own this place he asked yeah said harry you looking for something someone louis corrected who takes care of the women around here the women around here take care of themselves said harry he smiled at his own little joke then turned to go back inside his partners would deal with this man once he had informed them of his presence harry found his way blocked by a small man with three days worth of stubble and a haircut that was a month past good the guy looked like he was putting on a little weight too harry didnt mention that harry didnt say anything because the man at the door had a gun in his hand it wasnt quite pointed at harry but the situation was a developing one and there was no telling right now how it might end a name said louis i want the name of the man who ran sereta i dont know any sereta past tense said louis shes dead she died at the spyhole im sorry to hear that said harry you can tell her yourself you dont give me a name i dont want any trouble those your cabanas over there asked louis indicating three little huts that stood right at the edge of the parking lot yeah sometimes a man gets tired of sleeping in his truck he wants to he can have clean sheets for a night or an hour whatever if you dont start cooperating im going to take you into one of those cabanas and im going to hurt you until you tell me what i need to know if you give me his name and youre lying to me ill come back take you into one of those cabanas and kill you you have a third option octavio said harry quickly his names octavio but hes gone he left when the whore got killed tell me what happened shed been working for a couple of days when men came one was a fat guy real fat the other was a quiet guy in blue they knew to ask for octavio they spoke to him some then left he told me to forget them that night all those folks got killed up at the motel where did

blue jeans a white hat hes in there now whats his name ernesto does he carry a gun jesus they all carry guns call him what i said call him tell him theres a girl out here wants to see him about work then hell know i sold him out ill make sure he sees our guns im sure hell understand your reasons now call him harry walked to the door ernesto he shouted girl out here says shed like to talk to you about some work send her in said a mans voice she wont come in says shes frightened the man swore they heard his footsteps approach the door was opened and a young mexican stepped into the light he looked sleepy and the faint smell of pot hung about him stuff will ruin your health said angel as he slipped behind the mexicans back and removed a silver colt from the young mans belt his own gun touching the nape of ernestos neck although not as fast as a bullet will lets take a walk louis turned to harry he wont be coming back you tell anyone what happened here and well be talking again youre a busy man you have a lot of things to forget now with that they took ernesto away they drove for five miles until they found a dirt road then headed into the darkness until they could no longer see the traffic on the highway after a time ernesto told them what they wanted to know they drove on coming at last to a shabby trailer that sat behind an unfinished house on unfenced land the man named octavio heard them coming and tried to run but louis shot him in the leg octavio tumbling down a sandy slope and coming to rest in a driedout water hole he was told to get rid of the gun in his hand or die where he lay octavio threw away the gun and watched as the twin shadows descended on him the very worst said neddo are in juarez the tea had grown cold the image of santa muerte still stood between us listening without hearing watching blindly juarez now i understood one and a half million people lived in juarez most of them in indescribable poverty made all the more difficult for being endured in the shadow of el pasos wealth here were smugglers of drugs and people here were prostitutes barely into puberty and others who would never live long enough to see puberty here were the maquiladoras the huge electrical assembly plants that provided microwaves and hair dryers to the first world the prices kept down by paying the workers ten dollars a day and denying them legal protection or union representation outside the perimeter fences stretched row upon row of crate houses the colonias populares without sanitation running water electricity or paved roads home to the men and women who labored in the maquiladoras the more fortunate of whom were picked up each morning by the redandgreen buses once used to ferry american children to and from school while the rest were forced to endure the perilous earlymorning walk through sitio colosio valle or some similarly malodorous area beyond their homes lay the municipal dumps where the scavengers made more than the factory workers here were the brothels of mariscal and the shooting galleries of ugarte street where young men and women injected themselves with mexican tar a cheap heroin derivative from sinaloa leaving a trail of bloodied needles in their wake here were eight hundred gangs each roaming the streets of the city with relative impunity their members beyond a law that was powerless to act against them or more properly too corrupt to care for the federales and the fbi no longer informed the local police in juarez of operations on their turf in the certain knowledge that to do so would be to forewarn their targets but that was not the worst of juarez in the last decade over three hundred young women had been raped and murdered in the city some putas some faciles but most simply hardworking poor and vulnerable girls usually it was the scavengers that found them lying mutilated among the garbage but the authorities in chihuahua continued to turn a blind eye to the killings even as the bodies continued to turn up with numbing regularity recently the federales had been brought in to investigate using accusations of organtrafficking a federal crime as their excuse to intervene but the organtrafficking angle was largely a smoke screen by far the most prevalent theories bolstered by fear and paranoia were the predations of wealthy men and the actions of religious cults among them santa muerte only one man had ever been convicted for any of the killings the egyptian abdel latif sharif allegedly linked to the slayings of up to twenty women even in jail investigators claimed that sharif continued his killings paying members of los rebeldes one of the citys gangs to murder women on his behalf each gang member who participated was reputedly paid a thousand pesos when the members of los rebeldes were jailed sharif was said to have recruited instead a quartet of bus drivers who killed a further twenty women their reward twelve hundred dollars per month to be divided between them and a fifth man as long as they killed at least four girls each month most of the charges against sharif were dropped in sharif was just one man and even with his alleged associates could not have accounted for all of the victims there were others operating and they continued to kill even while sharif was in jail there is a place called anapra said neddo it is a slum a shanty twentyfive thousand people live there in the shadow of mount christo rey do you know what lies at the top of the mountain a statue of jesus he laughed hollowly is it any wonder that people turn away from god and look instead to a skeletal deity it was from anapra that sharif was said to have stolen many of his victims and now others have taken it upon themselves to prey upon anapras women or on those of mariscal more and more the bodies are being found with images of santa muerte upon them some have been mutilated after death deprived of limbs heads if one is to believe the rumors those responsible have learned from the mistakes of their predecessors they are careful they have protection its said that they are wealthy and that they enjoy their sport it may be true it may not there were tapes in garcias apartment i said they showed women dead and dying neddo had the decency to look troubled yet he was here in new york said neddo perhaps he had outlived his usefulness and fled maybe he planned to use the tapes to blackmail the wrong people or to secure his safety it may even be that such a man would take pleasure from revisiting his crimes by viewing them over and over whatever the reason for his coming north he does appear to provide a human link between santa muerte and the killings in juarez its not surprising that the mexican authorities are interested in him just as i am aside from the connection to santa muerte why would this be of concern to you i asked juarez has a small ossuary said neddo a chapel decorated with the remains of the dead it is not particularly notable and no great skill was applied to its initial creation for a long time it was allowed to fall into decay but in recent years someone has devoted a great deal of time and effort to its restoration i have visited it objects have been expertly repaired there have even been new additions to its furnishings sconces candlesticks a monstrance all of far superior quality to the originals the man responsible apparently claimed only to have used remains left to the ossuary for such a purpose but i have my doubts it was not possible to make a close examination of the work that had been donethe priest responsible for its upkeep was both secretive and fearfulbut i believe that some of the bones were artificially aged much like the skull that you brought to me that first evening i asked to meet the man responsible but he had already left juarez i heard later that the federales were seeking him it was said that they were under instructions to capture him alive and not to kill him that was a year ago across from the ossuary the same individual had created a shrine to santa muerte a very beautiful very ornate shrine if homero garcia came from juarez and was a devotee of santa muerte then its possible that he and the restorer of the ossuary were one and the same after all a man capable of intricate work with silver might well be capable of similar work with other materials including bone he sat back in his chair once again his fascination with the details was clear just as it had been when he spoke about the preacher faulkner and his book of skin and bones perhaps garcia had come to new york of his own volition and without the assistance of others but i doubted it someone had discovered his talents found him the warehouse in williamsburg and given him a space in which to work he had been brought north for his skill out of reach of the federales and perhaps also away from those for whom he sourced and disposed of women i thought again of the winged figure constructed from pieces of birds and animals and men i remembered the empty crates the discarded shards of bone that lay upon the worktable like the remnants of a craftsmans labors whatever garcia had been commissioned to create his work was nearing completion when i killed him i looked at neddo but he was lost in the contemplation of santa muerte and even after all that he had told me i wondered what it was that he was keeping from me my cell phone rang as i was nearing the hotel it was louis he gave me the number of a pay phone and told me to call him back in turn from a land line i called from the street using my at ampt calling card to reach the number i could hear traffic in the background and people singing on the street what have you got i said the pimp running sereta was called octavio he went to ground after she was killed but we found his nephew and through him we found octavio we hurt him a lot he told us he was going back to mexico to juarez where he came from hey you still there i had almost dropped the phone this was the second mention of juarez in less than an hour i began joining the dots garcia may have known of octavio from juarez sereta fled new york and entered octavios ambit when alice was found she probably told them what she knew of her friends whereabouts garcia put out some feelers and octavio got back to him then two men were dispatched to find sereta and retrieve what was in her possession yeah i said ill explain when you get back wheres octavio now hes dead i took a deep breath but said nothing octavio had a contact in new york louis continued he was to call him if anyone came asking about sereta its a lawyer his name is sekula in scarborough rachel sat on the edge of our bed cradling sam who had at last fallen asleep there was a patrol car outside the house and the scarborough cops had boarded up the shattered window rachels mother was beside her daughter her hands clasped between her thighs call him rachel said joan rachel shook her head but she was not responding to her mother it cant go on said joan it just cant go on like this but rachel just held her daughter close and did not reply chapter fourteen walter cole got back to me the next morning i was still asleep when he called i had faxed him the list of the numbers called from eddie tagers cell phone and asked him to see what he could do with them if he had no luck there were others i could turn to this time outside the law i just thought walter could get the information more quickly than i could you know that tampering with mail is a federal crime he said i didnt tamper i mistakenly assumed that it was addressed to me well thats good enough for me anyone can make a mistake i have to tell you though im running out of favors i can call in i think this is it youve done enough and more dont sweat it you want me to fax this to you later for now just read me the names take them from around am on the date i marked thats about the time alice was picked up on the streets someone must have contacted tager to tell him to bail alice and i was hoping that he had called that person back once he was done he read me the list of names but i didnt recognize any of them most of them were men two were women give me the womens names again gale friedman and hope zahn the second one was that a business or personal number its a cell the bills go to a box number on the upper west side registered with a private company named robson realty robson was part of the ambassade group the same one that was looking after the apartment development in williamsburg seems like tager called her twice once at am and once at am there were no more calls from his cell until the next afternoon and her number doesnt show up again hope zahn i pictured sekula in his pristine anteroom asking his coldly beautiful secretary not to disturb himno calls please hopewhile he sized me up sekulas days were numbered is that any help asked walter you just confirmed something for me can you fax that info to my room i had a personal fax machine on the desk in the corner i gave him the number again i also checked the cell phone number that gmack gave us said walter the phone belonged to a point junkie named lucius cope cope vanished three weeks ago if they had his phone then hes dead so what now i have to go home after that it all depends on what the kindness of strangers i guess or maybe kindness isnt the right word i headed out for coffee and called sekulas office along the way a woman answered the phone but i could tell that it wasnt sekulas usual secretary this girl was so chirpy she belonged in an aviary hello could i speak to hope zahn please uh im afraid shes out of the office for a few days could i take a message how about mr sekula hes also unavailable when do you expect them back im sorry said the secretary but may i ask whos calling tell hope that eddie tager called its in connection with alice temple at the very least if zahn or sekula checked back with the office it would give them something to think about does she have your number shed like to think so i said then thanked her for her time and hung up sandy crane was a little concerned about her husband which meant that the week was turning into a real collection of firsts for her the first promise of money in a while the first mutual joy she and her husband had experienced since larry had finally succumbed to senescence and now concern for her husbands wellbeing albeit tinged by a considerable degree of selfinterest he hadnt yet returned from his visit to his old war buddy but he occasionally spent nights away from home so it wasnt entirely out of the ordinary usually though his absences coincided with horse races in florida and rarely now did he embark upon a journey with the sense of purpose he had shown the day before sandy knew that her husband liked to gamble it worried her some but so long as he kept it within reason she wasnt going to raise a fuss if she started complaining about his spending then he might in turn decide to curb her excesses and sandy had few enough luxuries in her life as things stood sandy wouldnt have put it past the old fart to try to cut her out of the deal entirely though her fears were allayed slightly by the knowledge that larry needed her he was aged and weak and he had no friends even if that stuckup sonofabitch hall agreed to play ball larry would need her by his side to make sure that he wasnt taken for a ride she was still a little surprised that larry hadnt called the night before but he was like that perhaps hed found a bar where he could bitch and moan for the night or if hall was willing to cooperate where he could get himself a mild drunk on to celebrate even now he was probably sleeping it off in a motel room between trips to the john to empty his bladder larry would be back one way or another sandy sipped a double vodkaanother first this time of dayand thought some more about what she might do with the money new clothes for a start and a car that didnt smell of old man stink she also liked the idea of a younger guy one with a firm body and a motor that purred instead of sputtering like the failing engines of the men who currently serviced her occasional needs she wouldnt object to paying by the hour for him either that way there was nothing he could refuse to do for her the doorbell rang and she spilled a little of her vodka in her rush to rise from her chair larry had a key so it couldnt be larry but suppose something had happened to him maybe that bastard hall had allowed his conscience to get the better of him and confessed all to the cops if that was the case then sandy crane would plead dumber than the special kids in the little bus that passed by her house every morning the spookyfaced people inside waving at her like they thought she gave a rats ass about them when they really just creeped her out worse than snakes and spiders a man and a woman stood at the door they were well dressed the man in a gray suit the woman in a blue jacket and skirt even sandy had to admit that the woman was a looker long dark hair pale features tight body the man carried a briefcase in his hand and the woman a brown leather satchel over her right shoulder mrs crane said the man my name is sekula im an attorney from new york this is my assistant miss zahn your husband contacted our firm yesterday he said he had an item in which we might be interested sandy didnt know whether to curse her husbands name or applaud his foresight it depended on how things worked out for them she supposed the old fool was so anxious to ensure a sale that hed contacted the people whod sent the letter before he even had his hands on both the box and the paper it had once contained she could almost picture him a sly grin on his face as he convinced himself that he was playing these bigcity folk like they were violins except he wasnt that smart hed given too much away or raised their expectations so high that they were now at her door sandy wondered if hed told them about mark hall but immediately decided that he hadnt if they knew about hall then they would be standing on his doorstep not her own my husband isnt here right now she said im expecting him back any moment the smile on sekulas face didnt falter perhaps you wouldnt mind if we waited for him we really are anxious to secure the item as soon as possible and with the minimum of fuss and attention sandy shifted uneasily on her feet i dont know she said im sure you people are okay and all but i dont really like letting strangers into my house the smile seemingly etched on sekulas face was starting to creep her out like the smiles of the kids on the bus there was something blank about it even shitforbrains hall managed to inject a little humanity into his hammy grins when he was trying to sell some deadbeat an automobile i understand said sekula i wonder if this might convince you of our good intentions he leaned his briefcase against the wall snapped the locks and opened it so that sandy could see the contents a small stack of dead presidents lined up like little mount rushmores in green just a token of our goodwill said sekula sandy felt herself grow moist i think i can make an exception she said just this once the funny thing about it was that sekula didnt want to harm the woman that was how they had remained hidden for so long when others had been hunted down they did not hurt people unless it was absolutely necessary or they had not until sekulas investigations had added a degree of urgency to their quest the subsequent recruitment by brightwell of the odious garcia had marked the beginning of the next phase and an escalation in violence sekula was a longtime believer he was recruited to the cause shortly after his graduation from law school the recruitment had been subtle and gradual drawing on his already prodigious legal skills to track suspicious sales and to ascertain ownership and origins wherever necessary gradually progressing to more detailed explorations of the shadowy secret lives that so many people concealed from those around them he viewed this as a fascinating endeavor even as he came to understand that he was being used to target the individuals for their exploitation rather than to assist in any prosecution public or private the information gathered by sekula was utilized against them and his employers amassed influence knowledge and wealth as a consequence but sekula quickly discovered that he was untroubled by this realization he was a lawyer after all and had he entered the arena of criminal law he would surely have found himself defending what most ordinary people would regard as the indefensible by comparison the work in which he was engaged was initially morally compromised in only the faintest of ways he had grown wealthy as a result wealthier than most of his peers who worked twice as hard as he and he had gained other rewards too hope zahn among them he had been directed to employ her and he had done so willingly since then she had proved invaluable to him both personally professionally and it had to be admitted sexually if sekula had a weakness it was women but ms zahn fed his every sexual appetite and some others that he didnt even know were there until she discovered them for him and when after a number of years sekula was informed of the true nature of their quest he could barely work up the energy to be even slightly surprised he wondered sometimes if this was an indication of the extent to which he had been corrupted or whether it was always in his nature and his employers had recognized it long before he himself had in fact it had been sekulas idea to target the veterans inspired by his discovery of the details of a sale conducted through an intermediary in switzerland shortly after the end of the second world war the sale had passed unnoticed amid the flurry of deals in the aftermath of the war when looted items changed hands at a frightening rate their previous owners in many cases reduced to a coating of ash on the trees of eastern europe it was only when sekula gained copies of the records of the auction house from a disgruntled employee aware of the lawyers willingness to pay moderately well for such information that the entry was revealed to him sekula was grateful to the swiss for their scrupulous attention to detail which meant that even deals of dubious origin were all recorded and accounted for in many ways he reflected the swiss had more in common with the nazis in their desire to document their wrongdoings than they might like to admit the entry was straightforward detailing the sale of a fourteenthcentury jeweled monstrance to a private collector based in helsinki included was a careful description of the item sufficient to indicate to sekula that it was part of the trove stolen from fontfroide the final sale price agreed the houses commission and the balance to be forwarded to the seller the nominal seller was a private dealer named jacques gaud based in paris sekula carefully followed the paper trail back to gaud then pounced gauds family had since built up their grandfathers business and now enjoyed a considerable reputation in the trade sekula by examining the records of the swiss auction house had found at least a dozen further transactions instigated by gaud that could charitably be described as suspicious he crosschecked the items in question against his own list of treasures looted or disappeared during the war and came up with enough evidence to brand gaud as a profiteer from the misery of others and to effectively destroy the reputation of his descendants business as well as placing them at risk of ruinous criminal and civil actions following discreet approaches and assurances from sekula that the information he had obtained would go no further the house of gaud et frères discreetly released to him copies of all the paperwork relating to the sale of the fontfroide treasures it was there that the trail ran out for the payment made through gaud to the actual seller following a deduction by gaud for his assistance that was excessive to the point of extortion was in the form of cash the only clue that the current owners of the business were able to offer as to the identity of the men in question was that gaud had indicated they were american soldiers this was hardly surprising to sekula as the allies were just as capable of looting as the nazis but he was aware of the twin massacres at narbonne and fontfroide it was possible that survivors of the former might in turn have been involved in the latter although the americans were not present in the area in significant numbers by that phase of the war nevertheless sekula had identified a possible connection between the killing of a platoon of american gis by ss raiders and the ss raiders deaths in turn at fontfroide through contacts in the veterans administration and the vfw he discovered the identities of the surviving soldiers based in the region at the time as well as the addresses of those others who had lost relatives in the encounter he then sent out over a thousand letters seeking general information on wartime souvenirs that might be of interest to collectors and a handful containing more specific information relating to the missing fontfroide trove if he was wrong then there was always the chance that the letters might still elicit some useful information if he was right they would serve to cover his tracks the targetspecific letters detailed the rewards to be gained for the sale of unusual items deriving from the second world war including material not itself directly related to the conflict with particular emphasis on manuscripts it contained repeated assurances that all responses would be handled in the strictest confidence the real bait was the entry from the auction catalog issued by the house of stern with its photograph of a battered silver box sekula could only hope that whoever had taken it had held on to both the box and its contents then late the previous morning a man had called and described to sekula what could only be a fragment of the map and the box in which it was contained the caller was old and tried to retain his anonymity but he had given himself away from the moment that he used his home phone to dial new york now here they were one day later seated with an ugly drunk in polyester pants spotted with spilled vodka watching as she got progressively more intoxicated hell be home soon she repeatedly reassured the visitors slurring her words i cant imagine where hes gotten to sandy asked them to show her the money again and sekula obliged she ran a pudgy finger over the faces on the notes and giggled to herself wait until he sees all this she said the old fart will shit himself perhaps while were waiting we might take a look at the item sekula suggested sandy tapped her nose with the side of her finger all in good time she said larry will get it for you even if he has to beat it out of the old fuck sekula felt miss zahn tense beside him for the first time his unthreatening façade began to fragment do you mean that the item is not actually your husbands to sell he asked carefully sandy crane tried to retrieve her mistake but it was too late no its his to sell but you see theres this other fella and well he has a say in it too but hell agree larry will make him agree who is he mrs crane said sekula sandy shook her head if she told him hed go away and talk to hall himself and hed take all that lovely money with him shed said too much already it was time to clam up hell be back soon she said firmly believe me its all taken care of sekula stood it should have been easy the money would have been handed over the manuscript would have come into their possession and they would simply have left if brightwell subsequently decided to kill the seller then that was his call to make he should have guessed that it would never be so simple sekula wasnt good at this part that was why miss zahn was with him miss zahn was very good at it very good indeed she was already on her feet removing her jacket and unbuttoning her blouse while sandy crane watched her mouth hanging open as she made vague sounds of incomprehension it was only when miss zahn undid the last button and slipped the blouse from her body that the crane woman at last began to understand sekula thought the tattoos upon his lovers body were fascinating even if he found it almost impossible to imagine the pain that their creation must have caused her apart from her face and hands her skin was entirely obscured by illustrations the monstrous distorted faces blending into one another so it was almost impossible to identify individual beings among them yet it was the eyes that were the most disturbing aspect even for sekula there were so many of them large and small encompassing every imaginable color like oval wounds upon her body now as she advanced toward sandy crane they seemed to alter the pupils expanding and contracting the eyes rotating in their sockets exploring this new unfamiliar place with the drunken woman now cowering before them but it was probably no more than a trick of the light sekula stepped into the hallway and closed the door behind him he went into the dining room across the hall and sat down in an armchair it gave him a clear view of the driveway and the street beyond he tried to find a magazine to read but all he could see were copies of readers digest and some supermarket tabloids he heard mrs crane say something in the room beyond then her voice became muffled seconds later sekula grimaced as she started screaming against the gag the fbis new york field division had moved location so often in its history that it should have been staffed by gypsies in when it first opened it was located in the old post office building a site now occupied by city hall park since then it had opened up shop at various points on park row in the subtreasury building at wall and nassau at grand central terminal in the us courthouse at foley square on broadway and in the former lincoln warehouse at east sixtyninth before finally making a home at the jacob javits federal building down near foley square again i called the fbi shortly before eleven and asked to be put through to special agent philip bosworth the man who had visited neddo to inquire about his knowledge of sedlec and the believers i got bounced around before ending up with the osms department or what used to be the chief clerks office before everybody got a shiny new title the office service manager and his staff were responsible for noninvestigative matters a man who identified himself as grantley asked me my name and business i gave him my license number and told him i was trying to get in touch with special agent bosworth regarding a missing person investigation special agent bosworth is no longer with this office said grantley well can you tell me where i can find him no can i give you my number and maybe you could pass it on to him no can you help me in any way at all i dont think so i thanked him i wasnt sure for what but it seemed the polite thing to do edgar ross was still one of the special agents in charge at the new york division unlike sacs in most of the other field offices the sac wasnt the final authority in new york ross answered to the assistant director in charge a pretty good guy named wilmots but ross still had a whole family of hungry assistant sacs under his command and was therefore the most influential law enforcement official i knew our paths had crossed during the pursuit of the man who had killed susan and jennifer and i think ross felt he owed me a little slack as a result of what had occurred i even suspected that he had a grudging affection for me but maybe that was the result of my watching too many tv cop shows in which gruff lieutenants secretly harbored homoerotic fantasies about the mavericks under their command i didnt think rosss feelings about me went quite that far but then he was a difficult man to read sometimes one never knew i called his office shortly after i was done with grantley i gave my name to rosss secretary and waited when she came back on the line she told me that ross wasnt available but said shed pass on the fact that id called i thought about holding my breath while i waited for him to call back but figured that id have blacked out long before that ever happened from the brief delay in our exchange though i gathered that ross was around but had tightened up since last we spoke i was anxious to get back to rachel and sam but i wanted to accumulate all the information that i could before i left the city i felt i had no option but to take an expensive cab ride down to federal plaza the area was a peculiar clash of cultures on the east side of broadway there were the big federal buildings surrounded by concrete barricades and adorned with weird rusting pieces of modern sculpture on the other side directly facing the might of the fbi were storefronts that advertised cheap watches and caps while doing a profitable sideline in assisting with immigration applications and discount clothing stores that offered suits for i grabbed a coffee at a dunkin donuts then settled down to wait for ross he was if nothing else a man of routine hed confessed as much to me the last time wed met i knew that he liked to eat most days at starks veranda at the corner of broadway and thomas a government hangout that had been around since the end of the nineteenth century and i just hoped that he hadnt suddenly taken to lunching at his desk by the time he eventually emerged from his office id been waiting two hours and my coffee was long since finished but i felt a touch of satisfaction at my investigative skills when he headed for the veranda quickly followed by the pain of rejection when i saw the expression on his face as i fell into step beside him no he said get lost you dont write you dont call i said were losing touch what we have now just isnt the same as it used to be i dont want to be in touch with you i want you to leave me alone buy me lunch no no what part of leave me alone dont you understand he stopped at the crosswalk it was a mistake he should have taken his chances with the traffic im trying to trace one of your agents i said look im not your personal goto guy at the bureau said ross im a busy man there are terrorists out there drug dealers mobsters they all require my attention they take up a lot of my time the rest i save for people i like my family my friends and basically anyone who isnt you he scowled at the oncoming traffic he might even have been tempted to draw his gun and wave it around threateningly in order to cross come on i know you secretly like me i said youve probably got my name written on your pencil case the agents name is philip bosworth the osms office told me he was no longer with the division id just like to get in touch with him i had to give him credit for trying to shake me off i took my eye off him for just a second and instantly he was skipping through oncoming traffic like a governmentfunded frogger i caught up with him though i was hoping youd be killed he said but secretly i knew he was impressed you pretend youre such a tough guy i said but i know youre all warm and fuzzy inside look i just need to ask bosworth some questions thats all why why is he important to you the thing in williamsburg the human remains in the warehouse he may know something about the background of the people involved people i heard there was one guy he got shot you shot him you shoot a lot of people you ought to stop we were at the entrance to the veranda if i tried to follow ross inside the staff would have my ass on the sidewalk faster than you could say deadbeat i could see him balancing the wisdom of stepping inside and trying to forget about me against the possibility that i might know something usefulthat and the likelihood that i would still be outside when he was done and the whole thing would just start over again somebody set him up there gave him a place to live and work i said he didnt do it alone the cops said you were investigating a missing person case howd you know that we get bulletins i had someone call the ninesix when your name came up see i knew you cared caring is relative who was the girl they found alice temple friend of a friend you dont have too many friends and i have my suspicions about some of the ones you do have you keep bad company do i have to listen to the lecture before you help me you see thats why things are always so difficult with you you dont know when to stop ive never met a guy who was so keen on mixing it up bosworth i said philip bosworth ill see what i can do someone will get back to you maybe dont call me okay just dont call me the verandas door opened and we stepped aside to let a gaggle of old women leave as the last of them departed ross slipped inside the restaurant i was left holding the door i counted to five waiting until just before he got out of sight so i shouted ill call you right mark hall couldnt stop vomiting ever since hed come home his stomach had bubbled with acid until eventually it just rebelled and began spewing out its contents he had barely slept the night before and now his head and body ached dully he was just thankful that his wife was away otherwise shed have been fussing over him insisting that a doctor should be called instead he was free to slump on the bathroom floor his cheek flat against the cool of the toilet bowl waiting for the next spasm to hit he didnt know how long hed been there all he knew was that whenever he thought of what hed done to larry the smell of cranes last breath came back to him like larrys ghost was breathing upon him from the beyond and a fresh bout of puking would immediately commence it was strange he had hated crane for so long every time hall saw him it was as though he were watching an imp grinning at him from beyond the grave a reminder of the judgment he must inevitably face for his sins he had long hoped that crane would simply crawl off and die but as in wartime larry crane had proved to be a tenacious survivor mark hall had killed his share of men during the war some of them from far away distant figures falling in the echo of a rifle shot others up close and personal so that their blood had spattered his skin and stained his uniform none of those deaths had troubled him after the first as the naive boy who had taken the bus to basic training was transformed into a man capable of ending the life of another it was a just war and had he not killed them then they would surely have dispatched him but he had believed his days of killing to be far behind him and he had never envisioned himself taking a knife to an unarmed old man even one as odious as larry crane the shock of it and the disgust that it engendered had sucked the energy from him and nothing could ever be the same again hall heard the doorbell ring but he didnt get up to answer it he couldnt he was too weak to stand and too ashamed to face anyone even if he could he stayed on the floor his eyes closed he must have dozed off because the next thing he remembered the bathroom door was opening and he was looking at two pairs of feet a womans and a mans his eyes followed the womans legs over her skirt to her hands hall thought that he could see blood on them he wondered if his own hands looked the same way to her who are you he said he could barely speak his voice sounded like the slow sweepings of a yard brush over dusty ground weve come to talk about larry crane said sekula hall tried to raise his head to look but it hurt him to move i havent seen him said hall sekula squatted before the old man he had a clean scrubbed face and good teeth hall didnt like him one bit what are you police said hall if youre cops show me some id why would you think we are police mr hall is there something youd like to share with us have you been a bad boy hall dryretched the memory of larry cranes death smell coming back to him mr hall were in kind of a hurry said sekula i think you know what weve come for dumb greedy larry crane even in death he had found a way to ruin mark hall its gone said hall he took it with him where i dont know i dont believe you to hell with you get out of my house sekula rose and nodded to miss zahn this time he stayed in the room just to make sure that she understood the urgency of the situation it didnt take long the old man started talking as soon as the needle approached his eye but miss zahn inserted it anyway just to be sure that he wasnt lying by that time sekula had looked away the stink of vomit was already getting to him when she was done they took hall now blind in his left eye and bundled him into the car then drove him to where he had dumped the body of larry crane in a muddy hollow beside a filthy swamp the box was cradled against cranes chest where hall had placed it before leaving his old war buddy to rot after all he figured that if crane wanted it so badly he should take it with him wherever he was going carefully sekula removed the box from the old mans grasp and opened it the fragment was inside and undamaged the box had been well designed capable of protecting its contents from water from snow from anything that might damage the information it held its intact said sekula to the woman were so close now mark hall the auto king sat on the dirt in his old man pants his left hand cupped to his gouged eye when miss zahn took him by the hand and led him to the water he did not struggle not even when she forced him to kneel and held his head beneath the surface until he drowned when he grew still they dragged him to the hollow and laid him beside his former comrade uniting the two old men in death as they had been united however unwillingly in life chapter fifteen walter cole called me as i was driving from the city ive got more news he said the me has confirmed the identity of the remains found in garcias apartment its alice toxicology tests also revealed the presence of dmt dimethyltryptamine in a small section of tissue that was found still adhering to the base of her skull ive never heard of it what does it do apparently its a hallucinogenic drug but it has very particular symptoms it causes feelings of paranoia and makes users hallucinate alien intelligences or monsters sometimes it makes them think that theyre traveling through time or onto other planes of existence want to hear something else thats interesting they found traces of dmt in garcias body too the me thinks it might have been administered through the food in his kitchen but theyre still running tests it was possible that alice had been given the drug in order to make her more cooperative allowing her captors to masquerade as her saviors once the effects of the drug began to wear off but garcia had been fed dmt too perhaps as a means of keeping him under some form of control by ensuring that he remained in a state of nearconstant fear the dosage wouldnt have to be high just enough to keep him on edge so that his paranoia could be manipulated if required ive got one more thing for you said walter the building in williamsburg had a basement the entrance was hidden behind a false wall it seems we now know what garcia was doing with the bones it was the nypds forensic investigation division that found the basement they had taken their time going through the building floor by floor working from the top down checking the plans for the building against what they saw around them noting what was recent and what was old the cops who broke down the wall found a new steel door in the floor nearly forty square feet and secured with heavyduty locks and bolts it took them an hour to get it open backed up by the same emergency service unit that had responded on the night garcia died when the door was open the esu descended a set of temporary wooden stairs into the darkness the space beneath was of the same dimensions as the main steel door and some twelve feet deep garcia had been hard at work in the hidden space garlands of sharpened bone hung from the corners of the basement meeting in a cluster of skulls at each corner the walls had been concreted and inset with pieces of blackened bone to the halfway mark sections of jawbones femurs finger bones and rib jutting out as though discovered in the course of some ongoing archaeological dig four towers of candleholders created from marble and bone stood in a square at the center of the room the candles held in skullandbone arrangements similar to those i had discovered in garcias apartment with four chains of bones linking them as though sealing off access to some as yet unknown addition to the ossuary there was also a small alcove two or three feet in height empty but clearly also awaiting the arrival of another element of display perhaps the small bone sculpture that now rested in the trunk of my car the mes office was going to have a difficult task identifying the remains but i knew where they could start with a list of dead or missing women from the region of juarez mexico and the unfortunates who had disappeared from the streets of new york since garcias arrival in the city lucius cope among them i drove north i made good time once i cleared the boroughs and arrived in boston shortly before pm the house of stern was situated in a side street almost within the shadow of the fleet center it was an unusual location for such a business audibly close to a strip of bars that included the local outpost of hooters the windows were smoked glass with the companys name written in discreet gold lettering across the bottom to the right was a wood door painted black with an ornate gold knocker in the shape of a gaping mouth and a gold mailbox filigreed with dragons chasing their tails in a slightly less adult neighborhood the door of house of stern would have been a compulsory stop for halloween trickortreaters i pressed the doorbell and waited the door was opened by a young woman with bright red hair and purple nail polish that was chipped at the ends im afraid were closed she said we open to the public from ten until four monday to friday im not a customer i said my names charlie parker im a private investigator id like to see claudia stern is she expecting you no but i think shell want to see me perhaps you might show her this i handed over the box in my arms the young woman looked at it a little dubiously carefully removing the layers of newspaper so that she could see what was inside she revealed a section of the bone statue considered it silently for a moment then opened the door wider to admit me she told me to take a seat in a small reception area then vanished through a halfopen green door the room in which i sat was relatively unadorned and a little downattheheels the carpet was worn and frayed and the wallpaper was wearing thin at the corners heavily marked by the passage of people and the bumps and scrapes it had received during the movement of awkward objects two desks stood to my right covered in papers and topped by a pair of sleeping computers to my left were four packing crates from which piles of curly wood shavings poked like unruly clown hair a series of lithographs hung on the wall behind them depicting scenes of angelic conflict i walked over to take a closer look at them they were reminiscent of the work of gustave doré the illustrator of the divine comedy but the lithographs were tinted and appeared to be based on some other work unfamiliar to me the angelic conflict said a female voice from behind me and the fall of the rebel host they date from the early nineteenth century commissioned by dr richard laurence professor of hebrew at oxford to illustrate his first english translation of the book of enoch in then abandoned and left unused following a disagreement with the artist these are among the only extant copies the rest were all destroyed i turned to face a small attractive woman in her late fifties dressed in black slacks and a white sweater smudged here and there with dark marks her hair was almost entirely gray with only the faintest hint of dark at the temples her face was relatively unlined the skin tight and the neck bearing only the slightest trace of wrinkles if my estimate of her age was correct she was wearing her years well ms stern she shook my hand claudia im pleased to make your acquaintance mr parker i returned my attention to the illustrations out of curiosity why were the lithographs destroyed the artist was a catholic named knowles who worked regularly for publishers in london and oxford he was quite accomplished although somewhat derivative of others in his style knowles was unaware of the controversial nature of enoch when he agreed to undertake the commission and it was only when the subject of his work came up during discussions with his local parish priest that he was alerted to the history of the scripture in question do you know anything of the biblical apocrypha mr parker nothing worth sharing i replied that wasnt entirely true i had come across the book of enoch before although i had never seen the actual text the traveling man the killer who had taken my wife and daughter had made reference to it it was just one of a number of obscure sources that had helped to fuel his fantasies she smiled revealing white teeth that were yellowing only slightly at the edges and the gums then perhaps i can enlighten you and you can in turn enlighten me about the object with which you introduced yourself to my assistant the book of enoch was part of the accepted biblical canon for about five hundred years and fragments of it were found among the dead sea scrolls laurences translation was based upon sources dating from the second century bc but the book itself may be older still most of what we know or think we know of the fall of the angels comes from enoch and it may have been that jesus christ himself was familiar with the work for there are clear echoes of enoch in some of the later gospels it subsequently fell out of favor with theologians largely because of its theories on the nature of angels like how many can dance on the head of a pin in a way said ms stern while there was at least some acceptance that the origins of evil on earth lay in the fall of the angels their nature provoked disagreement were they corporeal if so what of their appetites according to enoch the great sin of the dark angels was not pride but lust their desire to copulate with women the most beautiful aspect of gods greatest creation humanity this led to disobedience and a rebellion against god and they were cast out of heaven as punishment such speculations found little favor with the church authorities and enoch was denounced and removed from the canon with some even going so far as to declare it heretical in nature its contents were largely forgotten until when a scottish explorer named james bruce traveled to ethiopia and secured three copies of the book that had been preserved by the church in that country fifty years later laurence produced his translation and thus enoch was revealed to the englishspeaking world for the first time in over a millennium but without knowless illustrations he was concerned about the controversy that might arise following its publication and apparently his parish priest told him that he would refuse him the sacraments if he contributed to the work knowles notified dr laurence of his decision laurence traveled to london to discuss the matter with him and in the course of their discussions a heated argument arose knowles began casting his illustrations into the fire the originals as well as the first copies laurence snatched what he could salvage from the artists desk and fled to be honest the illustrations are not particularly valuable in themselves but i am fond of the story of their creation and decided to hold on to them despite occasional requests that they be offered for sale in a way they symbolize what this house has always set out to do to ensure that ignorance and fear do not contribute to the destruction of arcane art and that all such pieces find their way to those who would most appreciate them now if youd like to come with me we can discuss your own piece i followed her through the green door and down a corridor that led to a workshop area here the secretary with the red hair was checking the condition of some leatherbound books in one corner while in another a middleaged man with receding brown hair worked on a painting illuminated by a series of lamps youve come along at an interesting time said claudia stern were preparing for an auction the centerpiece of which is an item with links to sedlec a quality that it shares with your own statue but then i imagine that you knew this already given your presence here might i ask who recommended that you bring the bone sculpture to me a man named charles neddo hes a dealer in new york i know of mr neddo he is a gifted amateur he occasionally comes up with some unusual objects but he has never learned to distinguish between what is valuable and what should be discarded and forgotten he spoke highly of you im not surprised frankly mr parker this house is expert in such matters a reputation painstakingly acquired over the last decade before we came on the scene arcane artifacts were the preserve of backstreet merchants grubby men in dank basements occasionally one of the established names would sell dark material as it was sometimes known but none of them really specialized in the area stern is unique and it is rarely that a seller of arcana fails to consult us first before putting an item up for auction similarly a great many individuals approach us on both a formal and informal basis with queries relating to collections manuscripts even human remains she moved to a table upon which stood the statue found in garcias apartment now carefully positioned on a rotatable wheel her finger flipped the button on a desk lamp casting white light upon the bones which brings us to this fellow i assume mr neddo told you something of the images origins he seemed to think that it was a representation of a demon trapped in silver sometime in the fifteenth century he called it the black angel immael said ms stern one of the more interesting figures in demonic mythology its rare to find a naming so recent a naming according to enoch two hundred angels rebelled and they were cast down initially on a mountain called armon or hermon herem in hebrew means a curse some of course descended farther and founded hell but others remained on earth enoch gives the names of nineteen i think immael is not among them although that of his twin ashmael is included in certain versions in fact the first record of immael derives from manuscripts written in sedlec after the year in which the black angel is reputed to have been created all of which has contributed to its mythology she slowly turned the wheel examining the sculpture from every possible angle where did you say you found this i didnt she lowered her chin and peered at me over the tops of her half glasses no you didnt did you i should like to know before i go any farther the original owner who was also probably the artist responsible is dead he was a mexican named garcia neddo believed that he was also behind the restoration of an ossuary in juarez and the creation of a shrine to a mexican figurehead called santa muerte how did the late mr garcia meet his end you dont read the papers not if i can help it he was shot most unfortunate he appeared to have considerable talent if he made this it really is very beautiful my guess is that the human bones used are not old i see little evidence of wear the majority are from children probably chosen for reasons of scale there are also some canine and avian bones and the nails on the ends of its limbs appear to be cat claws its most remarkable but probably unsalable questions would be asked about the provenance of the child bones there is the strong possibility that they may be linked to the commission of a crime anyone trying either to buy or sell it without involving the authorities would leave him or herself open to charges of obstructing the course of justice at the very least i wasnt trying to sell it the man who made this was involved in the killing of at least two young women in the united states and perhaps many more in mexico someone arranged for him to come north to new york i want to find out who that might have been so where does the statue fit in and why bring it to me i thought it might pique your interest and allow me to ask you some questions which it did ive been holding one question back what can you tell me about the believers ms stern killed the light the gesture allowed her a moment to compose her features and to hide partially the expression of alarm that briefly transformed them im not sure that i understand i found a symbol carved inside a skull in garcias apartment it was a grapnel according to neddo its used by a group of some kind a cult to identify its members and to mark some of its victims the believers have an interest in the history of sedlec and in the recovery of the original statue of the black angel assuming it even exists youre about to auction off a fragment of a vellum map that is supposed to contain clues to the location of the statue i would imagine that would be enough to attract the attention of these people i thought ms stern was going to spit on the ground so obvious was her distaste at the subject i had raised the believers as they term themselves are freaks as im sure mr neddo informed you we sometimes deal with strange individuals in the course of our work but most of them are harmless they are collectors and can be forgiven their enthusiasms as they would never hurt another human being the believers are another matter if the rumors are to be credited and they are only rumors they have existed for centuries and their formation was a direct result of the confrontation in bohemia between erdric and immael their numbers are small and they keep a very low profile the sole reason for their existence is to reunite the black angels angels neddo only told me about one statue not a statue said ms stern but a being she led me to where the man with receding hair was working upon the restoration of the painting it was a large canvas about ten feet by eight and depicted a battleground fires burned on distant hills and great armies moved through ruined houses and scorched fields the detail was intricate each figure beautifully and carefully painted although it was difficult to tell if what i was seeing was the battle itself or its aftermath there appeared to be pockets of fighting continuing in sections of the painting but most of the central area consisted of courtiers surrounding a regal figure some distance from him a oneeyed leader rallied troops to himself the work had been placed upon an easel and surrounded by lights almost like a patient in an operating theater upon the shelves around it stood microscopes lenses scalpels magnifying glasses and jars of assorted chemicals while i watched the restorer took a thin wooden stick and scored it with a penknife then pushed it into cotton and rotated it to create a cotton bud of the required thickness when he was satisfied with his creation he dipped it into a jar of liquid and began carefully applying it to the surface of the painting thats acetone mixed with white spirit said ms stern its used to clean away unwanted layers of varnish tobacco and fire smoke the effects of pollution and oxidation one has to be careful to find the correct chemical balance for every painting because the requirements of each one will be quite unique the intention is to achieve a strength sufficient to remove dirt and varnish even paint added by later artists or restorers without burning through to the original layers beneath this has been and continues to be a particularly painstaking restoration as the anonymous artist used an interesting mixture of techniques she pointed to two or three areas in the work where the paint appeared exceptionally thick here he has used oilfree paints giving his pigment an unusual consistency as you can see the impastothe thicker areas of painthave accumulated layers of dust in the grooves which weve had to remove with a combination of acetone and scalpel work again her hands danced across the work almost but not quite touching the surface there is also a great deal of craquelure this web effect where the old pigments have dried and degraded over time now let me show you something she found a smaller painting depicting a solemnlooking man in ermine and a black hat across the room her secretary abandoned her work and moved over to join us apparently claudia sterns master classes were worth attending in case you were wondering this is the alchemist dr dee she explained we are due to offer this for sale at our auction alongside the painting upon which james is currently working now let me adjust the lighting she turned off the large lights surrounding the paintings using a central switch for a moment we were in semidarkness until our corner of the room was suddenly illuminated by an ultraviolet glow our teeth and eyes now shone purple but the greatest change was visible upon the two paintings the smaller work the depiction of the alchemist dee was spattered with specks and dots as though the entire work had been attacked by a demented student of jackson pollock the larger painting though was almost entirely clear of such marks apart from a thin halfmoon in one corner where the restorer was still working the dots on the portrait of dee are called overpaint and they show the parts where previous restorers have retouched or filled in damaged areas said miss stern if one were to perform the same experiment in almost any great gallery in the world one would witness the same effect on most of the works present the preservation of works of art is a constant process and it has always been so miss stern lit the main lights once again do you know what a sleeper is mr parker in our business it is an object whose value is unrecognized by an auction house and that subsequently passes into the hands of a buyer who realizes its true nature this battlefield painting is just such a sleeper it was discovered in a provincial auction house in somerset england and bought for the equivalent of one thousand dollars its clear that the sleeper has not been restored at any point in its existence although it appears to have been kept in relatively good condition apart from the inevitable effects of natural aging yet there was one large area of concealment in the bottom righthand corner noticeable once the overpaint was revealed by the ultraviolet light originally sections of this work had been crudely worked upon to conceal some of the detail it contained it was uncovered relatively easily what you are seeing here is the second stage of the restoration take a step back and look at that area with a new eye the bottom righthand corner showed the bodies of monks all of them wearing white hanging from the wall of a monastery human bones were stacked like kindling beneath their feet and one of the monks had an arrow in the center of his forehead a grapnel had been painted upon the front of each monks robes in what appeared to be blood a group of mounted soldiers was riding away from them led by a tall armored figure with a white mote in his right eye human heads dangled from their saddles and their horses wore spikes upon their foreheads if the bearded figure was their leader it was to one of his men that ones eye was immediately drawn he was not riding a horse but instead walked alongside his captain bearing a bloodied sword in his right hand he was a fat imp gross and deformed with a great goiter or tumor at his neck he wore a tunic of leather plates that failed to conceal the enormity of his belly and his legs seemed almost to be collapsing under the weight of his body there was blood around his mouth where he had fed upon the dead in his left hand he held aloft a banner bearing the symbol of the grapnel why was this hidden i asked this is the aftermath of the sacking of the monastery at sedlec said miss stern the killing of the monks during a period of truce was first blamed upon jan ziska and his hussites but this painting may be closer to the truth it seems to suggest that the killings were the work of mercenaries operating in the confusion of the aftermath and led by these two men later documentary evidence including the testimony of eyewitnesses supports the artists version of events she spread the index and middle fingers of her right hand to indicate the bearded rider and the grotesque figure cavorting beside him this oneshe indicated the fat manhas no name their leader was known simply as the captain but if one is to believe the myths surrounding sedlec he was really ashmael the original black angel according to the old stories after the banishment from heaven ashmael was shunned by the company of the fallen because his eyes were marked by his last glimpse of god in his loneliness ashmael tore himself in two so that he would have company in his wanderings and he gave the name immael to his twin eventually they grew weary and descended into the depths of the earth near sedlec where they slept until the mines were dug then they awoke and found the world above at war so they began fomenting conflict playing one side off against the other until at last immael was confronted and cast down into molten silver ashmael immediately commenced searching for him but when he reached the monastery the statue had already been spirited away so he avenged himself on the monks and continued his quest a quest which according to the tenets of the believers goes on to this day so now you know mr parker the believers exist to reunite two halves of a fallen angel it is a wonderful story and now i plan to sell it in return for twenty percent of the final price in the end i am the only person who will profit from the story of the black angels i was home before midnight the house was silent i went upstairs and found rachel asleep i didnt wake her instead i was about to check up on sam when rachels mother appeared at the door and putting a finger to her lips to hush me indicated that i should follow her downstairs would you like coffee she asked coffee would be good she heated some water and retrieved the ground beans from the freezer i didnt speak as she went about preparing the coffee i sensed that it wasnt my place to begin whatever conversation we were about to have joan placed a cup of coffee in front of me and cradled her own in her hands we had a problem she said she didnt look at me as she spoke what kind of problem someone tried to get into the house through sams window a burglar we dont know the police seem to think so but rachel and i were not so sure why they didnt set the motion sensors off the sensors werent disabled either so we cant figure out how they got to the house and this is going to sound crazy i know but it seemed as if they were crawling up the exterior we heard one of them moving on the outside wall behind rachels bed there was another on the roof and when rachel went into sams room she says she saw a womans face at the window but it was upside down she shot at it and she what id taken sam out of the room and rachel had set off the panic button she had a gun and she shot the window out we had it replaced today i hid my face in my hands for a few moments saying nothing i felt something touch my fingers and joan took my hand in hers listen to me she said i know that sometimes it might seem like frank and i are hard on you and i know you and frank dont get along too well but you have to understand that we love rachel and we love sam we know that you love them too and that rachel cares about you and loves you more deeply than shes ever loved any other man in her life but the feelings she has for you are costing her a great deal theyve put her life at risk in the past and theyre bringing her pain now something caught in my throat when i tried to speak i took a sip of coffee to try to dislodge it but it would not be moved rachel has told you about her brother curtis said joan yes i said he sounded like he was a good man joan smiled at the description curtis was pretty wild when he was a teenager said joan and wilder still when he was in his twenties he had a girlfriend justine and boy he drove her crazy she was much gentler than he was and though he always looked out for her i think he kind of frightened her some and she left him for a time he couldnt understand why and i had to sit him down and explain to him that it was okay to cut loose a little that young men did those kinds of things but at some point you had to start behaving like an adult and rein in the young part it didnt mean that you had to spend the rest of your life in a suit and tie never raising your voice or stepping out of line but you had to recognize that the rewards a relationship brought came at a price the cost was a whole lot less than what you got in return but it was a sacrifice nonetheless if he wasnt prepared to make that sacrifice by growing up then he had to just let her go and accept that she wasnt for him he decided that he wanted to be with her it took some time but he changed he was still the same boy at heart of course and that wild streak never left him but he kept it in check the way you might train a horse so you can harness its power and channel its energy eventually he became a policeman and he was good at what he did those people who killed him made the world a poorer place by taking him from it and they broke so many hearts just so many i never thought id be having that conversation again with a man and i understand that the circumstances are not the same i know all that youve gone through and i can imagine some of your pain but you have to choose between the life youre being offered here with a woman and a child maybe a second marriage and more children to come and this other life that you lead if something happens to you because of it then rachel will have lost two men that she loved to violence but if something happens to her or to sam as a consequence of what you do then everyone who loves rachel and sam will be torn apart and you worst of all because i dont believe that you could survive that loss a second time nobody could youre a good man and i understand that youre driven to try to make things right for people who cant help themselves for those whove been hurt or even killed theres something noble in that but i dont think youre concerned with nobility its sacrifice but not the right kind youre trying to make up for things that can never be undone and you blame yourself for allowing them to occur even though it wasnt in your power to stop them but at some point youre going to have to stop blaming yourself youre going to have to stop trying to change the past all of that is gone hard as it may be to accept what you have now is new hope dont let it slip away and dont let it be taken from you joan rose and emptied the remains of her coffee into the sink then placed the mug in the dishwasher i think rachel and sam are going to come stay with us for a little while she said you need time to finish whatever it is youre doing and to think im not trying to come between you none of us is i wouldnt be having this conversation with you if that was the case but shes frightened and unhappy and thats not even taking into account the aftermath of the birth and all the confused feelings that brings with it she needs to be around other people for a time people wholl be there for her round the clock i understand i said joan placed her hand on my shoulder then kissed me gently on the forehead my daughter loves you and i respect her judgment more than that of anyone else that i know she sees something in you i can see it too you need to remember that if you forget it then its all lost the black angel walked in the moonlight through tourists and residents past stores and galleries scenting coffee and gasoline on the air distant bells tolling the coming of the hour it examined the faces of the crowds always seeking those that it might recognize watching for eyes that lingered a second too long upon its face and form it had left brightwell in the office lost among shadows and old things and now replayed their conversation in its head it smiled faintly as it did so and lovers smiled too believing that they saw in the expression of the passing stranger the remembrance of a recent kiss and a parting embrace that was the angels secret it could cloak the vilest of feelings in the most beautiful of colors for otherwise no one would choose to follow its path brightwell had not been smiling when earlier they had met it is him said brightwell you are jumping at shadows the black angel replied brightwell withdrew a sheaf of copied papers from the folds of his coat and placed them before the angel he watched as its hand flicked through them taking in snatches of headlines and stories and with each page that it read its interest grew until at last it was crouched over the desk its shadow falling upon words and pictures its fingers lingering upon names and places from cases now solved or buried charon pudd charleston faulkner eagle lake kittim kittim it could be coincidence said the angel softly but it was said without conviction less a statement than a step in an ongoing process of reasoning so many said brightwell i dont believe that he has been haunting our footsteps its not possible there is no way that he can know his own nature we know our nature said brightwell the angel stared intently into brightwells eyes and saw anger and curiosity and the desire for revenge and fear yes perhaps just a little it was a mistake to go to the house said the angel i thought we could use the child to draw him to us the black angel stared at brightwell no it thought you wanted the child for more than that your urge to inflict pain has always been your undoing you dont listen it said to him ive warned you about drawing attention to us especially at so delicate a juncture brightwell appeared about to protest but the angel stood and removed its coat from the antique coat stand by its desk i need to go out for a while stay here rest ill return soon and so the angel now walked the streets like a slick of oil trailing through the tide of humanity that smile darting occasionally across its face never lingering for more than a second or two and never quite reaching its eyes once an hour had gone by it returned to its lair where brightwell sat patiently in a shadowy corner far from the light confront him if you wish if it will confirm or disprove what you believe hurt him said brightwell if you have to there was no need to ask the last question the one that remained unspoken there would be no killing for to kill him would be to release him and he might never be found again sam lay awake in her crib she didnt look at me as i approached instead her gaze was fixed raptly on something above and beyond the bars her tiny hands made grabbing motions and she seemed to be smiling i had seen her like that before when rachel or i stood over her either talking to her or offering her some bauble or toy i moved closer and felt a coldness in the air around her still sam didnt look at me instead she gave what sounded like a little giggle of amusement i reached across the crib my fingers outstretched for the briefest of moments i thought that i felt a substance brush against my fingers like gossamer or silk then it was gone and the coldness with it immediately sam began to cry i took her in my arms and held her but she wouldnt stop there was movement behind me and rachel appeared at my side ill take her she said her arms reaching for sam and irritation in her voice its okay i can hold her i said ill take her she snapped and it was more than annoyance i had been called to scenes of domestic arguments as a cop and seen mothers latch on to their children in the same way anxious to protect them from any threat of violence even as their husbands or partners attempted to make up for whatever they had done or had threatened to do once the police were there i had seen the look in those womens eyes it was the same as the one that i saw in rachels i handed the baby to her without a word why did you have to wake her said rachel holding sam against her and stroking her gently on the back it took me hours to get her down i found my voice she was awake i just went over to look at her and it doesnt matter its done now she turned her back to me and i left them both and undressed in the bathroom then took a long shower when i was done i went downstairs and found a pair of sweatpants and a tshirt then headed into my office and rousted walter from the couch id make a bed there for the night sam had stopped crying and there was no sound from upstairs for a time until at last i heard rachels soft footfalls on the stairs she had put on a dressing gown over her nightshirt her feet were bare she leaned against the door watching me i couldnt say anything at first when i tried to speak there was again that tickling in my throat i wanted to shout at her and i wanted to hold her i wanted to tell her that i was sorry that everything would be all right and i wanted her to say the same to me even if neither of us was telling the entire truth i was just tired she said i was surprised to see you back despite all that joan had said i still wanted more you acted like you thought i was going to drop her or hurt her i said its not the first time either no its not that she said she moved toward me i know youd never do anything to harm her rachel tried to touch my hair and to my shame i pulled away she started to cry and the sight of her tears was shocking to me i dont know what it is she said i dont know whats wrong itsyou werent here and someone came something came and i was frightened do you understand im scared and i hate being scared im better than that but you make me feel this way now it was out her voice was raised as her face contorted into an expression of utter hurt and rage and grief you make me feel this way for sam for myself for you you go away when we need you to be here and you put yourself in harms way forfor what for strangers for people youve never met im here sam is here this is your life now youre a father youre my lover i love yougod jesus i do love you i love you so muchbut you cant keep doing this to me and to us you have to choose because i cant go through another year like this one do you know what ive done do you know what your work has made me do i have blood on my hands i can smell it on my fingers i look out of the window and i can see the place where i spilled it every day i glimpse those trees and i remember what happened there it all comes back to me i killed a man to protect our daughter and last night i would have done it again i took his life out there in the marshes and i was glad i hit him and i hit him again and i wanted to keep hitting him i wanted to tear him to pieces and for him to feel every second of it every last iota of pain i saw the blood rise in the water and i watched him drown and i was happy when he died i knew what he wanted to do to me and to my baby and i wasnt going to let that happen i hated him and i hated you for making me do what i did for putting me in that place do you hear me i hated you slowly she slid to the floor her mouth was wideopen her lower lip curled in upon itself tears falling and falling and falling misery without end i hated you she repeated dont you understand i cant do this i cant hate you and then the words ceased and there were only sounds without meaning i heard sam crying but i couldnt go to her all that i could do was reach out to rachel whispering and kissing as i tried to quell the pain until at last we lay upon the floor together her fingers on my back and her mouth against my neck as we tried to hold on to all that we were losing by binding ourselves to each other we slept together that night in the morning she packed some things put the baby in the child seat in joans car and prepared to leave well talk i said as she stood by the car yes i kissed her on the mouth she put her arms around me and her fingers touched the back of my neck they lingered there and then were gone but the scent of her remained even after the car had disappeared even after the rain came even after sunlight faded and darkness rose and the stars scattered the night sky like sequins fallen from the gown of a woman halfimagined halfrecalled and through the emptiness of the house a cold crept and as i fell into sleep a voice whispered i told you she would leave only we remain a touch like gossamer fell upon my skin and rachels perfume was lost in the stink of earth and blood and in new york the young prostitute named ellen woke from her place beside gmack and felt a hand upon her mouth she tried to struggle until she felt the cool of the gunmetal against her cheek close your eyes said a mans voice and she thought that she recognized it from somewhere close your eyes and be still she did as she was told the hand remained over her mouth but the gun was moved away from her beside her she heard gmack start to wake the painkillers made him drowsy but they usually wore off during the night forcing him to take some more huh said gmack she heard five words spoken then there was a sound like a book being dropped upon the floor the hand was removed from her mouth keep your eyes closed said the voice she kept her eyes squeezed shut until she was certain that the man was gone when she opened them again there was a hole in gmacks forehead and the pillows were red with his blood chapter sixteen without rachel and sam around i fell into a black place i dont recall much of the twentyfour hours that followed their departure i slept i ate little and i didnt answer the phone i thought about drinking but i was already so consumed by selfloathing that i was unable to lower myself further messages were left but none that mattered and after a time i just stopped listening to them i tried to watch some television even flicked through the newspaper but nothing could hold my attention i pushed thoughts of alice of louis of martha far from me i wanted no part of them and as the hours crept slowly by a pain grew inside me like an ulcer bleeding into my system i lay fetally upon the couch my knees drawn into my chest and spasmed as the hurt ebbed and flowed i thought that i heard noises from upstairs the footsteps of a mother and a child but when i went to look there was nobody there a towel had fallen from the clothes dryer the door of which now stood open and i could not recall if it was i who had left it that way i thought about calling rachel every second minute but i did not lift the phone i knew that nothing would come of it if i did what could i say to her what promises could i make without doubting even as i spoke the words that i would be able to keep them again and again joans words came back to me i had lost so much once such a loss would be unendurable a second time in the new and unwelcome quiet of the house i felt time slipping once more so that past and present blurred the dams that i had tried so hard to erect between what was and what yet might be weakening still further spilling agonizing memories into my new life mocking the hope that old ghosts could ever be laid to rest it was the silence that brought them the sense of existences briefly halted rachel still had clothes in the closets and cosmetics on her dressing table her shampoo hung in the shower stall and there was a strand of her long red hair lying like a question mark on the floor beneath the sink i could smell her on the pillow and the shape of her head was clear on the cushions of the couch by our bedroom window where she liked to lie and read i found a white ribbon beneath our bed and an earring that had slipped behind the radiator an unwashed coffee cup bore a trace of her lipstick and there was a candy bar in the refrigerator halfeaten sams little crib still stood in the center of her room for joan had retained the one used by her own children and it was easier to simply retrieve that from her attic rather than disassemble sams own crib and transport it to vermont i think perhaps that rachel was also reluctant to remove the crib from our house knowing the pain it would cause me with its unavoidable implications of permanence some of sams toys and clothes lay on the floor by the wall i picked them up and put the dirty bibs and tops into the laundry basket i would wash them later i touched the place where she slept i caught her baby smell on my fingers she smelled as jennifer once did and i remembered all of these things i did before when blood lay drying in the cracks on the kitchen floor there was discarded clothing upon a bed and a doll on a childs chair there was a cup on a table halffilled with coffee and a glass bearing traces of milk there were cosmetics and brushes and hair and lipstick and lives ended in the middle of tasks halfdone so that for a moment it seemed as though they must surely return that they had merely slipped away for a few moments and would come back eventually to finish their nighttime drinks to place the doll on the shelf where it belonged to resume their lives and permit me to share that place with them to love me and to die with me and not leave me alone to mourn for them until at last i grieved so long and so hard that something returned phantasms conjured up by my pain two entities that were almost my wife and child almost now i was in another house and again there were reminders of lives around me of tasks left unfinished and words left unsaid except that these existences were continuing elsewhere there was no blood on the floor not yet there was no finality here merely a pause for breath a reconsideration they could go on perhaps not in this place but somewhere far away somewhere safe and secure fading light falling rain and night descending like soot upon the earth voices halfheard and touches in the darkness blood in my nose and dirt in my hair we remain always we remain i awoke to the sound of the telephone i waited for the machine to pick up the message a mans voice spoke vaguely familiar but nobody i could place i let the cassette roll on later after i had showered and dressed i walked walter as far as ferry beach and let him play in the surf outside the scarborough fire department men were cleaning down the engines with hoses the winter sunlight occasionally breaking through the clouds and causing the droplets to sparkle like jewels before they disintegrated upon the ground in the early days of the fire department steel locomotive wheels were used to summon the volunteers and there was still one outside engine s station over at pleasant hill then in the late s elizabeth libby and her daughter shirley took over the emergency dispatch service operating out of the store on black point road where they lived and worked they would activate their gamewell alarm system when a call came in which in turn set off air horns at the station houses the two women were on duty twentyfour hours a day seven days a week and in their first eleven years in charge of the service they went away together only twice one of my earliest memories of scarborough was of watching old clayton urquhart presenting a plaque to elizabeth libby for long service in my grandfather was a volunteer member of the fire department helping out when the need arose and my grandmother was one of the women who worked the mobile canteen that provided food and drink to the firefighters when they were tackling big blazes or fires of long duration so they were both there for the presentation elizabeth libby who used to give me candy when we visited her wore winged glasses and had a white flower pinned to her dress she dabbed happily at her eyes with a small lace handkerchief as people shed known all her life said nice things about her in public i tied walter to the cemetery gate and walked to the place where my grandfather and grandmother were interred she had died long before he and i had few lasting memories of her apart from that occasion when elizabeth libby received her plaque i had buried my grandfather myself taking a spade after the mourners had gone and slowly covering the pine casket in which he lay it was a warm day and i hung my jacket upon a headstone i think i talked to him while i worked but i dont remember what i said i probably spoke to him as i had always done for men are ever boys with their grandfathers he was a sheriff s deputy once but a bad case poisoned him taking hold of his conscience and tormenting it so that he knew no rest from the thoughts that pursued him in the end it would be left to me finally to close the circle and help to bring an end to the demon that had taunted my grandfather i wondered if he left those agonies behind him when he died or if they followed him into the next world did peace come to him with his last breath finally silencing the voices that had haunted him for so long or did it come later when a boy that he had once danced upon his knee fell on the snow and watched as an old horror bled away to nothing i pulled a weed from beside his headstone it came away easily as such plants will my grandfather taught me how to distinguish the weeds from the plants good flowers have deep roots and the bad ones dwell in shallow soil when he told me things i did not forget them i filed them away in part because i knew that he might ask me about them at some future date and i wanted to be able to answer him correctly you have old eyes he used to tell me you should have an old mans knowledge to match them but he slowly began to grow frail and his memory began to fail him the alzheimers stealing him away little by little relentlessly thieving all that was valuable to him slowly disassembling the old mans memory and so it was left to me to remind him of all that he had once told me and i became the teacher to my grandfather good flowers have deep roots and bad ones dwell in shallow soil shortly before he died the disease gave him a temporary release and things that had seemed lost forever returned to him he remembered his wife and their marriage and the daughter they had together he recalled weddings and divorces baptisms and funerals the names of colleagues who had gone before him into the last great night that glows faintly with the light of a promised dawn words and memories rushed from him in a great torrent and he lived his life over again in a matter of hours then it was all gone and not a single moment of his past remained as though that flood had scoured away the final traces of him leaving an empty dwelling with opaque windows reflecting all but revealing nothing for there was nothing left to reveal but in those last minutes of lucidity he took my hand and his eyes burned more brightly than they had ever done before we were alone his day was drawing to a close and the sun was setting upon him your father he said youre not like him you know all families have their burdens to bear their troubled souls my mother she was a sad woman and my father could never make her happy it wasnt his fault and it wasnt hers she was just the way that she was and people didnt understand it then it was a sickness and it took her in the end like cancer took your mother your father he had something of that sickness in him too that sadness i think maybe that was part of what attracted your mother to him it spoke to something inside of her even if she didnt always want to hear what it said i tried to remember my father but as the years passed after his death it grew harder and harder to picture him when i tried to visualize him there was always a shadow across his face or his features were distorted and unclear he was a policeman and he shot himself with his own gun they said that he did it because he couldnt live with himself they told me that he killed a girl and a boy after the boy seemed about to pull a weapon on him they couldnt explain why the girl had also died i guess there was no explanation or none that could suffice i never got to ask him why he did what he did but i might have understood it a little said my grandfather you see i have some of that sadness too and so do you ive fought it all my life i wasnt going to let it take me the way that it took my mother and youre not going to let it take you either he gripped my hand tighter a look of confusion passed across his face he stopped talking and narrowed his eyes trying desperately to remember what it was that he wanted to say the sadness i said you were talking about the sadness his face relaxed i saw a single tear break from his right eye and slip gently down his cheek its different in you he said its harsher and some of it comes from outside from another place we didnt pass it on to you you brought it with you its part of you part of your nature its old and he gritted his teeth and his body shook as he fought for those last minutes of clarity they have names the words were forced out spit from his system ejected like tumors from within they have names he repeated and his voice was different now harsh and filled with a desperate hatred for an instant he was transformed and he was no longer my grandfather but another being one that had taken hold of his ailing fading spirit and briefly reenergized it in order to communicate with a world it could not otherwise reach all of them they have names and theyre here theyve always been here they love hurt and pain and misery and theyre always searching always looking and theyll find you because its in you as well you have to fight it you cant be like them because theyll want you theyve always wanted you he had somehow raised himself from his bed but he fell back exhausted he released his grip leaving the imprint of his fingers on my skin they have names he whispered the disease surging forward like ink clouding clear water and turning it to black claiming all of his memories for its own i dropped walter back at the house and played my unheard messages for the first time the walk had cleared my head and the time spent tending to the grave had brought me a little peace even as it had reminded me of why neddos words about the names of the believers had seemed familiar to me it might also have been the fact that i had come to a kind of decision and there was no point in agonizing any longer none of the messages came from rachel one or two contained offers of work i deleted them the third was from assistant sac rosss secretary in new york i called her back and she told me that ross was out of the office but promised to contact him in order to let him know that id called ross got back to me before i had time to make a sandwich it sounded like he was in starks veranda again i could hear dishes banging behind him the tinkling of china against crystal and people talking and laughing as they ate what was the big hurry with bosworth if it was going to take you half a day to call back he asked ive been distracted i said sorry the apology seemed to throw ross id ask if you were doing okay he said but i wouldnt want you to start thinking that i cared its fine id just view it as a moment of weakness so you still interested in this thing it took me a while to reply yes i said im still interested bosworth wasnt my responsibility he wasnt a field agent so he fell under the remit of one of my colleagues which one mr that doesnt concern you dont push it it doesnt matter under the circumstances i might have dealt with bosworth the same way that he did they put him through the process the process was the name given to the feds unofficial method for dealing with agents who stepped out of line in serious cases like whistleblowing efforts were first made to discredit the agent involved fellow agents would be given access to the personnel file for the individual involved colleagues would be questioned about the agents habits if the agent had gone public with something potentially damaging personal information might in turn be leaked to the press the fbi had a policy of not firing whistleblowers as there was a danger that by doing so the bureau might lend credence to the individuals accusations hounding a recalcitrant agent and smearing his or her name was far more effective what did he do i asked ross bosworth was a computer guy specializing in codes and cryptography i cant tell you much more than that partly because id have to kill you if i did but mostly because i cant explain it to you anyway since i dont understand it it seems he was doing a little personal work on the side something to do with maps and manuscripts it earned him a reprimand from oprthe office of professional responsibility was responsible for investigating allegations of misconduct within the fbibut it didnt go to a disciplinary hearing that was about a year ago anyway bosworth took some leave after that and next thing he popped up in europe in a french jail he was arrested for desecrating a church a church technically a monastery septfons abbey he was caught digging up the floor of a vault in the dead of night the legate in paris got involved and managed to keep bosworths background out of the papers he was suspended with pay when he returned and ordered to seek professional help but he wasnt monitored he came back to work in the same week that an interview with an unnamed fbi agent appeared in some ufo magazine alleging that the bureau was preventing a proper investigation of cult activities in the united states it was clearly bosworth again burbling some nonsense about linked map references the bureau decided that it wanted him gone so he was put through the process his security clearance was downgraded then pretty much removed entirely apart from allowing him to switch on his computer and play with google he was shifted to duties beneath his abilities given a desk beside a mens room in the basement and virtually cut off from contact with his colleagues but he still wouldnt break and in the end he was given the option of a fitness for duty examination at the pearl heights center in colorado fitness for duty examinations were the kiss of death for an agents career if the agent refused to submit to one he or she was automatically fired if the agent submitted then a diagnosis of mental instability was frequently the outcome decided long before the agent even arrived at the testing center the evaluations were carried out in medical facilities with special contracts to examine federal employees and usually stretched over three or four days subjects were kept isolated apart from their interactions with medical personnel and required to answer up to six hundred yesorno questions if they werent already crazy when they went in the process was designed to make them crazy by the time they left did he take the test he traveled to colorado but he never made it to the center he was automatically dismissed so where is he now officially i have no idea unofficially hes in new york it seems that his parents have money and they own an apartment up on first and seventieth in a place called the woodrow bosworth lives there as far as anyone can tell but hes probably a basket case we havent been in contact with him since his dismissal so now you know right i know not to join the fbi then start dismantling churches i dont even like you walking by the building so recruitment is hardly a concern for you this stuff didnt come for free if bosworth is tied in with this thing in williamsburg then i want a headsup thats fair fair you dont know from fair just remember i want to be informed first if bosworth smells bad on this i promised to get back to him if i found out anything he should know it seemed to satisfy him he didnt say goodbye before he hung up but he didnt say anything hurtful either the most recent call was from a man named matheson matheson was a former client of mine last year id looked into a case involving the house in which his daughter had died i couldnt say that it had ended well but matheson had been satisfied with the outcome his message said that someone was making inquiries about me and had approached him for a recommendation or so they claimed the visitor a man named alexis murnos said he was calling on behalf of his employer who wished to remain anonymous for the present matheson had a highly developed sense of suspicion and he gave murnos as little to go on as possible all he could get out of murnos who declined to leave a contact number was that his employer was wealthy and appreciated discretion matheson asked me to call him back when i got the message i wasnt aware that youd added discretion to your list of accomplishments matheson said once his secretary had put me through to him thats what made me suspicious and he gave you nothing zilch i suggested that he contact you himself if he had any concerns he told me that he would but then said that hed appreciate it if i kept his visit strictly between the two of us naturally i called you as soon as he left i thanked matheson for the warning and he told me to let him know if there was anything more that he could do as soon as we were done i called the offices of the press herald and left a message there for phil isaacson the papers art critic once theyd confirmed that he was due in later that day it was a long shot but phils expertise extended from law to architecture and beyond and i wanted to talk to him about house of stern and the auction that was due to take place there that reminded me that i had not yet heard back from angel or louis it was a situation that was unlikely to last very much longer i decided to drive into portland to kill some time until i heard from phil isaacson maybe tomorrow i would leave walter with my neighbors and return to new york in the hope that i might be able to get in touch with former special agent bosworth i set the alarm system in the house and left walter halfasleep in his basket i knew that as soon as i was gone he would make a beeline for the couch in my office but i didnt care i was grateful to have him around and his hairs on the furniture seemed like a small return for the company they all have names my grandfathers words came back to me as i drove now echoing not only neddo but also claudia stern two hundred angels rebelledenoch gives the names of nineteen names there was a christian bookstore in south portland i was pretty certain that theyd have a section on the apocrypha it was time to take a look at enoch the car a red series bmw picked me up at route and stayed with me when i left the highway for maine mall road i pulled into the parking lot in front of panera bread and waited but the car with two men inside headed on by i gave them five minutes then moved out of the lot keeping an eye on my rearview mirror as i drove i saw the bmw parked over by the dunkin donuts but it didnt try to follow me this time instead after making a couple of loops of the area i spotted its replacement this time the bmw was blue and it had only one man in the front but it was clear that i was the object of his attentions i almost felt resentful twin bmws these guys were being hired by the hour and being paid cheap part of me was tempted to confront them but i wasnt sure that id be able to control my temper which meant there was a good chance that things could end badly instead i made a call jackie garner answered on the first ring hey jackie i said want to break some heads i sat in my car outside tim hortons doughnut shop the blue bmw was in the maine malls lot across the street while its red sibling waited in the parking lot of the sheraton one at each side of the road it was still amateurish but it showed promise my cell phone rang how you doing jackie im at the best buy i looked up i could see jackies van idling in the fire lane its a blue bmw mass plates maybe three rows in hell move when i move wheres the other car over by the sheraton its a red bmw two men jackie seemed confused theyre using the same badge same model just a different color dumb kind of what are you going to do about the guys in red let them come i guess then we can deal with them why i got the sense that jackie had an alternative solution well he said you see i brought some friends do you want this done quietly jackie if i wanted it done quietly would i have called you thats what i thought so who did you bring along he tried to avoid the question but i pinned him down jackie tell me who did you bring the fulcis he sounded vaguely apologetic dear god the fulci brothers they were mooks for hire twin barrels of muscle and flab with more chips on their shoulders than all the employees of the frito company put together even the for hire part was misleading if the situation offered sufficient scope for mayhem the fulcis would happily offer their services for free tony fulci the elder of the two brothers held the record for being the most expensive prisoner ever to have been jailed in washington state calculated on a lengthofstay basis tony did some time there at the end of the nineties when a lot of prisons were hiring out their inmates to large corporations to do telesales and callcenter work tony was given a job phoning people on behalf of a new isp named fastwire asking its rivals customers to consider switching service from their current provider to the new kid on the block the sum total of tony fulcis only conversation with a customer went pretty much as follows tony reading slowly from an idiot card i am calling on behalf of fastwire comm customer im not interested tony hey let me finish customer i told you im not interested tony listen what are you stupid this is a good deal customer i told you i dont want it tony dont you hang up that phone you hang up that phone and youre a dead man customer you cant talk to me like that tony hey fuck you i know who you are i know where you live and when i get out of here in five months and three days im gonna look you up then im gonna tear you limb from limb now you want this pieceofshit deal or not fastwire quickly abandoned its plans to extend the use of prisoners as callers but not quickly enough to prevent it from being sued tony cost washingtons prisons million in lost contracts once the fastwire story got around or million for every month tony was incarcerated and tony was the calm one in the family all things considered the fulcis made the mongol hordes look restrained you couldnt have found anyone more psychotic maybe but they would have cost more there was no way out of it i told him id head toward deering avenue and try to draw the solo tail away with jackie following the fulcis could intercept the other guys wherever they chose give me two minutes said jackie i just gotta tell the fulcis man theyre juiced you dont know what this means to them getting to do some real detective work tony just wished you could have given him a little more notice he wouldve come off his meds the fulcis didnt have to go far to take the red bmw they simply blocked it off in the sheratons lot by parking their truck behind it the fulcis drove a customized dodge x inspired by the monstertruck dvds that they watched when they werent making other peoples lives more interesting in a chinese way the bmws doors opened the driver was a cleanshaven middleaged man in a cheapish gray suit that made him look like an executive for a company that was struggling to make ends meet he weighed maybe or roughly half a fulci his companion was bigger and swarthier possibly bringing their combined weight up to a fulci and a quarter or a fulci and a half if tony was abusing his diet pills the fulcis dodge had smokedglass windows so the guy in the suit could almost have been forgiven for what he said next hey he said get that fucking tin can out of the way were in a hurry here nothing happened for about fifteen seconds while the fulcis primitive semimedicated brains tried to equate the words theyd heard spoken with their own vision of their beloved truck eventually the door on the drivers side opened and a very large very irate tony fulci jumped gracelessly from the cab to the ground he wore a polyester golf shirt elasticwaisted pants from a bigman store and steeltoed work boots his belly bulged under his shirt the sleeves of which stopped above his enormous biceps the material insufficiently lycraed to make the stretch demanded of it by his pumped arms twin arcs of muscle reached from his shoulders to just below his ears their symmetry undisturbed by the intrusion of a neck giving him the appearance of a man who had recently been forcefed a very large coat hanger his brother paulie joined him he made tony look a little on the dainty side jesus christ said the bmws driver why said tony does he drive a fucking tin can as well then the fulcis went to work the blue bmw stayed with me all the way to deering avenue hanging back two or three cars but always keeping me in sight jackie garner was behind him at every turn i had picked the route because it was guaranteed to confuse anyone who wasnt a native and the fact that he was still within the portland city limits instead of being led into open country would make the tail less likely to believe that he had been spotted and was about to be confronted i reached the point where deering becomes oneway just before the intersection with forest forcing all traffic heading out of town to make a right i took the tail with me as i turned then went left onto forest left again back onto deering and took a hard right to revere the bmw had no choice but to stick with me every time or risk being dumped so that when i braked suddenly he had to do the same when jackie shot in behind him he realized what was happening there was no other option for the bmw except to try to use the bread companys lot to buy himself some space and time he pulled in fast and we came at him in a v trapping him against the wall i kept my gun tight against my body as i approached i didnt want to scare anyone who might happen by the driver kept his wrists on the wheel his fingers slightly raised he wore a baggy blue suit with a matching tie the wire of his cell phone earpiece was clipped to the lapel of his jacket he was probably having trouble raising his buddies i nodded to jackie he had a little snubnose browning in his right hand he kept it fixed on the driver as he opened the door get out i said do it slowly the driver did as he was told he was tall and balding with black hair that was just a little too long to look good im not armed he said jackie pushed him against my car and frisked him anyway he came up with a wallet and a from an ankle holster whats this said jackie soap you shouldnt tell lies i said theyll turn your tongue black jackie tossed me the wallet inside was a massachusetts drivers license identifying the man before us as one alexis murnos there were also some business cards in his name for a company named dresden enterprises with offices in the prudential in boston murnos was the head of corporate security i hear youve been asking questions about me mr murnos it would have been a lot easier to approach me directly murnos didnt reply find out about his friends i told jackie jackie stepped back to make a call on his cell most of it consisted of uhhuhs and yeahs apart from one worrying interjection of jesus it broke that easy guy must have brittle bones the fulcis have them in the bed of their truck he told me when he was done theyre rentacops from some security agency in saugus tony says he thinks theyll stop bleeding soon if murnos was troubled by the news he didnt show it i had a feeling that murnos was probably better at his job than the other two jokers but somebody had asked him to do too much too quickly and with limited resources it seemed like time to prick his professional pride youre not very good at this mr murnos i said corporate security at dresden enterprises must leave a little something to be desired we dont even know what dresden enterprises is said jackie he could be responsible for guarding chickens murnos sucked air in through his teeth he had reddened slightly so i said are you going to tell me what this is about maybe over a cup of coffee or do you want us to take you to meet your friends it sounds like theyre going to need a ride home eventually and probably some medical attention ill have to leave you with the gentlemen who are currently looking after them but itll only be for a day or two until i find out more about the company youre working for that will mean paying a visit to dresden enterprises possibly with a couple of people in tow which could be very professionally embarrassing for you murnos considered his options they were kind of limited i guess coffee sounds good he said finally see i said to jackie that was easy you got a way with people said jackie we didnt even have to hit him he sounded mildly disappointed it transpired that murnos was actually empowered to tell me a certain amount and to deal with me directly he just preferred to sneak around until he was certain of all the angles in fact he admitted that he had amassed a considerable quantity of information on me without ever leaving his office and he had partly guessed that matheson would contact me if worse came to worst as it just had he would then get a chance to see what i did when my feathers were ruffled my colleagues arent really bleeding in the back of a truck are they he asked we were sitting at a table in big sky it smelled good in there behind the counter the kids who did the baking were cleaning down baking trays and freshening the coffee i exchanged a guilty look with jackie he was eating an apple scone his second im pretty certain that they are i said the guys that took care of them they aint too particular about these things said jackie plus one of your people said something insensitive about their truck i was grateful to jackie for all that hed done but it was time to get him out of the way i asked him to find the fulcis and make sure they didnt inflict any further damage on anyone he bought them a bag of scones and went on his way you have interesting friends said murnos once jackie was gone believe me you havent even met the most entertaining ones if you have anything to share with me then nows the time murnos sipped his coffee i work for mr joachim stuckler he is the ceo of dresden enterprises mr stuckler is a venture capitalist specializing in software and multimedia so hes wealthy yes i think that would be a fair comment if hes wealthy why does he hire cheap labor that was my fault i needed men to help me and id used those two before i didnt expect them to be beaten for their trouble neither did i expect to be cornered in a parking lot and relieved of my weapon by someone who then offered to buy me coffee and a scone its been one of those days for you yes it has mr stuckler is also a collector of note he has the wealth to indulge his tastes what does he collect art antiques unusual material i could see where this was leading such as little silver boxes from the fifteenth century murnos shrugged he is aware that you were the one who found the remains in the apartment he believes that your case may impinge upon something of interest to him he would like to meet you to discuss the matter further if you were free he would appreciate a few hours of your time naturally he will pay you for your trouble naturally except im not really in the mood for a trip to boston murnos shrugged again you were looking for a woman he said matteroffactly mr stuckler may be able to provide you with some information on those responsible for her disappearance i glanced over at the kids behind the counter i wanted to hit murnos i wanted to beat him until he told me all that he knew he saw that desire in my face believe me mr parker my knowledge of this affair is limited but i do know that mr stuckler had nothing to do with whatever happened to the woman he merely learned that you were the one who killed homero garcia and discovered human remains in his apartment he is also aware of the opening of the chamber in the basement of the building i made some inquiries on his behalf and discovered that your interest lay in the woman mr stuckler is happy to share whatever insights he may have with you and in return you may be able to fill some gaps in his own knowledge if you cannot then mr stuckler is still willing to talk with you and to tell you whatever he feels may be of help to you it is a winwin situation for you mr parker murnos recognized that i had no choice but he had the decency not to gloat i agreed to see his employer over the next couple of days murnos confirmed the arrangement in a cell phone conversation with one of stucklers assistants then asked me if it was okay if he left i thought it was nice of him to ask until i realized that he was only looking for his gun back i accompanied him outside emptied the bullets down a drain and handed the gun to him you should get another gun i said that one isnt much use to you on your ankle murnoss right hand flexed and i was suddenly looking down the barrel of a smith amp wesson sigma four inches long and a pound in weight i have another gun he said it looks like im not the only one who hires cheap he kept the muzzle trained on me for just a second longer than necessary before allowing it to disappear back into the folds of his coat he smiled at me then got into his car and drove away murnos was right jackie garner was a lunkhead but not as big a lunkhead as the guy who employed him i drove back toward scarborough stopping off first at the bible store the woman behind the counter was happy to help me and seemed only slightly disappointed when i didnt add some little silver angel statues or a my guardian angel says youre too close bumper sticker to my purchase of two books on the apocrypha we sell a lot of those she told me theres a heap of folks who think that the catholic church has been hiding something all these years what could they be hiding i asked despite myself i dont know she said speaking slowly as she would to an idiot child because its hidden i left her to it i sat in my car and flicked through the first of the books but there wasnt much that was of use to me the second was better as it contained the entire book of enoch the names of the fallen angels appeared in chapter and in this particular edition ashmaels was among them i glanced quickly through the rest of the book much of which seemed fairly allegorical in nature apart from the early descriptions of the angels banishment and fall according to enoch they were not subject to death even after they fell nor would they ever be forgiven for what they had done instead the fallen angels set about teaching men to make swords and shields and lecturing them on astronomy and the movements of the stars so that the world became alteredand men being destroyed cried out there were also some details about the greek theologian origen who was anathematized for suggesting that the angels who fell were those in whom the divine love had grown cold and that they were then hidden in gross bodies such as ours and have been called men i saw again the painting in claudia sterns workshop the figure of the captain the bloody grapnel on the dead monks robes and the grossest body of allthe fat distorted creature marching by his leaders side all bloodied and grinning with the joy of killing i picked up a sandwich at amatos on route and filled up on gas before heading east for home at the pump beside me two men one bearded and overweight the other younger and trimmer were consulting a map in their grimy black peugeot the bearded man was wearing a gray handknitted sweater a clerical collar was visible at his neck they didnt pay me any attention and i didnt offer them any help as i drew near my house i saw a car parked in front of the driveway it wasnt quite blocking me but it would be difficult to go around it without slowing down a man was leaning against the hood and the weight of his body had forced the front of the car down so that the fender was on the verge of nuzzling the ground he was taller than i by five or six inches and massively obesely overweight shaped like a great egg with a huge wad of fat at his belly that hung down over his groin and lapped at his thighs his legs were very short so short that his arms appeared longer than they were his hands far from being flabby and awkward were slim and almost delicate although the wrists were heavy and swollen taken together the various parts of his body appeared to have been inexpertly assembled from a variety of donors as though a young baron frankenstein had been let loose in his toy box with the leftovers from a massacre at weight watchers he wore plain black shoes on small feet and tan trousers that had been altered at the legs to fit the ends folded inside and inexpertly stitched making it possible to judge the extent of the alterations by the circle of holes halfway up his shins the bloating at his stomach was too big or too uncomfortable to encompass so the waistband of the trousers ran underneath it thereby allowing it to hang free beneath his billowing white shirt the shirt was buttoned almost to the neck constricting it to such an extent that the great swelling concealing the collar was a violent reddish purple in color like the terrible discoloration that occurs in a corpse when the blood has gathered at the extremities i could see no hint of a jacket under his brown camelhair overcoat there were buttons missing from the front possibly after some futile and ultimately doomed attempt to close it his head balanced finely on the layered fats of his neck narrowing from a very round skull to a small distinctly weak chin an inverted sparrows egg atop the larger ostrich egg of his body his features should have been lost in jowls and flab sunken into them like a childs drawing of the man in the moon instead they retained their definition losing themselves only as they drew nearer his neck his eyes were closer to gray than green as though capable only of a monochrome version of human sight and no lines extended from them he had long eyelashes and a thin nose that flared slightly at the end exposing his nostrils his mouth was small and feminine with something almost sensual about the curvature of the lips he had small ears with very pronounced lobes his head was closely shaved but his hair was very dark so that it was possible to see the imprint of the faded widows peak above his forehead his resemblance to the foul creature in the painting at claudia sterns auction house was startling this man was fatter perhaps and his features more worn but it was still as though the figure with the bloodied mouth had detached himself from the canvas and assumed a new existence in this world i stopped my mustang a short distance from him i preferred not to draw up alongside him he didnt move as i stepped from my car his hands remain clasped below his chest resting upon the upper slope of his belly can i help you i said he thought about the question perhaps he said his washedout eyes regarded me he did not blink i felt a further slight glimmer of recognition this time more personal as when one hears a song playing on the radio one that dates from ones earliest childhood and is recalled only on the faintest of levels i dont usually conduct business at my home i said you dont have an office he replied you make yourself difficult to find for an investigator one might almost suspect that you didnt want to be traced he moved away from his car he was strangely graceful seeming almost to skate across the ground rather than to walk his hands remained clasped on his belly until he was only a couple of feet away from me then his right hand extended toward me let me introduce myself he said my name is brightwell i believe we have matters to discuss as his hand moved through the air the sleeve of his coat dangled loosely and i glimpsed the beginnings of a mark upon his arm like twin arrowheads recently burned into the flesh immediately i backed away and my hand moved for the gun beneath my jacket but he was faster than i so fast that i barely saw him move one moment there was space between us the next there was none and he was pressed hard against me his left hand digging into my right forearm the nails tearing through the fabric of my coat and into my skin drawing blood from the flesh his face touched mine his nose brushing against my cheek his lips an inch from my mouth sweat dropped from his brow and fell upon my lips before slowly dripping onto my tongue i tried to spit it away but it congealed inside coating my teeth and adhering to the roof of my mouth like gum its force so strong that it snapped my mouth closed causing me to bite the tip of my tongue his own lips parted and i saw that his teeth came to slightly blunted points as though they had gnawed too long on bone found he said and i inhaled his breath it smelled of sweet wine and broken bread i felt myself falling tumbling through space overcome by shame and sorrow and a sense of loss that would never end a denial of all that i loved that would stay with me through all eternity i was aflame screaming and howling beating at the fires with my fists but they would not be extinguished my whole being was alive with burning the heat coursed through my veins it animated my muscles it gave form to my speech and light to my eyes i twisted in the air and saw far below the waters of a great ocean i glimpsed my own burning shape reflected in them and others beside me this world was dark but we would bring light to it found and so we fell like stars and at the moment of impact i wrapped the tattered remnants of charred black wings around me and the fires went out at last i was being dragged somewhere by the collar of my jacket i didnt want to go i had trouble keeping my eyes open so that the world drifted between darkness and halflight i heard myself speaking muttering the same words over and over forgive me forgive me forgive me i was almost at brightwells car it was a big blue mercedes but the backseat had been removed to enable him to push back the drivers seat and give him room to enter the car stank of meat i tried to fight him but i was weak and disoriented i felt drunk and the taste of sweet wine was upon my tongue he opened the trunk and it was filled with burning flesh my eyes closed for the last time and a voice called my name charlie it said how have you been i hope were not interrupting i opened my eyes i was still standing at the open door of my mustang brightwell had moved a few steps from his car but had not yet reached me to my right was the black peugeot and the bearded man with the clerical collar had jumped from the car and was now pumping my hand furiously its been a long time we had some trouble finding this place let me tell you i never thought that a city boy like you would end up out in the boonies you remember paul the younger man stepped around the hood of the peugeot he was careful not to turn his back on the huge figure watching us from a short distance away brightwell seemed uncertain of how to proceed then turned around got in his car and drove in the direction of black point i tried to make out the license plate but my brain was unable to make sense of the numbers who are you i said friends said the bearded man i looked down at my right hand there was blood dripping from my fingers i rolled up my sleeve and saw five deep puncture wounds upon my arm i stared at the road ahead but the mercedes was gone from sight the cleric handed me a handkerchief to stem the bleeding on the other hand he said that was definitely not a friend iv i tell them there is no forgiveness and yet there is always forgiveness michael collins chapter seventeen we sat around the kitchen table while the marshes prepared to flood waiting for the coming of the tides that would bring with them death and regeneration already the air felt different there was a stillness to nature a watchfulness as though every living thing that depended on the marshes for its existence was attuned to their rhythms and knew instinctively what was about to occur i cleaned out the cuts on my arm although i could not quite trace the chain of events that led to my receiving them i still had a sense of vertigo a dizziness that left me feeling uncertain on my feet and i could not rinse the taste of sweet wine from my mouth i offered my visitors coffee but they expressed a preference for tea rachel had left some herbal tea behind the instant coffee it smelled a little like someone had taken a leak in a rosebush the bearded cleric who said his name was martin reid winced slightly when he tasted it but he persevered clearly those years spent following his vocation had endowed him with a degree of inner strength how did you find me i asked it wasnt too hard to connect you to the events in brooklyn he said you make quite an impression wherever you go we learned a little more about you from mr neddo in new york neddos involvement with these men was a surprise i had to confess that neddo now unconditionally gave me the creeps i couldnt deny that he had an extensive knowledge of certain matters but the pleasure that he derived from it was troubling being around him was like keeping company with a semireformed addict whose ambition to stay clean was not as urgent as his love for the narcotic i think mr neddo may be morally suspect i said you may become tainted by association we are all flawed in our own way maybe but my closet isnt filled with chinese skulls fresh from the executioners gun reid conceded the point admittedly i try not to delve too deeply into his acquisitions he is nevertheless a useful source of information and you have reason to be grateful to him for informing us of your visit to him and of the path that your investigation is following the gentleman on the road didnt look best pleased by our intrusion into his business if we hadnt arrived when we did it could have turned very ugly or in his case uglier he certainly isnt a looker i conceded reid gave up on his tea thats terrible he said ill still be tasting that on the day i die i apologized once again the man on the road told me that his name was brightwell i said i think you know a little more than that about him the younger priest who had introduced himself as paul bartek looked to his colleague they were both cistercian monks based in europe but staying for the present in a monastery in spencer reid had a scottish accent but barteks was harder to identify there were traces of french and american english as well as something more exotic tell me what happened on the road said reid what did you feel i tried to recall the sensations i had experienced the memory seemed to intensify my nausea but i persevered one minute he seemed to be leaning against his car and the next he was right in my face i said i could smell his breath it smelled like wine then he was gripping my arm and dragging me toward his car he made those cuts on my arm the trunk opened and it looked like a wound it was made of flesh and blood and it stank reid and bartek exchanged a look what i said we could see both of you as we approached said bartek he never moved he didnt touch you i displayed the cuts for them yet i have these that you do said reid theres no denying it did he say anything to you he said that i was hard to track down and that we had matters to discuss anything else i remembered the sensation of falling of burning i did not want to share it with these men because it brought with it a sense of great shame and regret but something told me that they were trustworthy even good and that they were ready to provide answers to some of the questions that i had there was a sense of vertigo of descending from a great height i was burning and there were others burning around me i heard him speak as he was dragging me to the car or as i thought he was what did he say found he said i was found if reid was surprised by this then he kept it hidden well bartek didnt have his friends poker features he looked shocked is this man a believer i asked why would you say that said reid he had a mark on his arm it looked like a grapnel neddo told me that they marked themselves but do you even know what a believer really is said reid there was something skeptical almost patronizing in his tone that i didnt care for i kept my voice low and even it took a lot of effort i dont like it when someone assumes my ignorance and by implication dangles the promise of enlightenment in front of me i said i dont even care for it when people tease dogs with treats so dont overstep the mark here i know what theyre looking for and i know what theyre capable of doing to get it i stood and retrieved the book that i had bought in south portland i threw it to reid and he caught it awkwardly with both hands splaying the pages i spit a volley of words at him as he examined its pages sedlec enoch dark angels in corporeal form an apartment with human remains yellowing in a pissfilled bath a basement decorated with human bones waiting for the arrival of a silver statue with a demon trapped inside it a man who sits placidly in a burning car while his body turns to ash and a young womans skull trimmed with gold left in an alcove after shed been murdered in a purposebuilt tiled room are we any clearer now father or brother or whatever it is you like to be called reid had the decency to look apologetic but i was already regretting my outburst in front of these strangers not merely out of shame at my own loss of temper but because i didnt want to give anything away in my anger im sorry said reid im not used to dealing with private detectives i always tend to assume that nobody knows anything and to be honest im rarely surprised i sat down once again at the table and waited for him to continue the believers or those who lead them are convinced that they are fallen angels banished from heaven reborn over and over in the form of men they feel that they are incapable of being destroyed if they are killed then they roam in noncorporeal form until they find another suitable host it may take years decades even before they do so but then the process begins again if they are not killed then they believe that they age infinitely more slowly than human beings ultimately they are immortal that is what they believe and what do you believe i dont believe that theyre angels fallen or otherwise if thats what youre asking i used to work in psychiatric hospitals mr parker a popular delusion among patients was that they were napoleon bonaparte im sure that there is a good reason why they favored bonaparte over say hitler or general patton but i never really cared enough to find out what that might be it was enough to know that a fortyyearold gentleman from pakistan who weighed two hundred pounds in his bare feet was in all probability not napoleon bonaparte but the fact that i didnt believe he was who he claimed to be made no difference to him similarly it doesnt matter whether we go along with the convictions of the believers or not they believe and they convince other weaker souls to adhere to that belief they appear particularly adept at the power of suggestion at planting false memories in fertile ground but they and the people with whom they surround themselves are no less dangerous for being deluded but there was more to them than that the circumstances of alices death gave clear evidence that these individuals were infinitely more unpleasant and more powerful than even reid was prepared to acknowledge at least here and to me there was also the matter of the dmt the drug found in alices remains and in garcias body it wasnt just force of will that bound people to them what did he mean by telling me that i was found i dont know i dont believe you thats your prerogative i let it go what do you know about a company called dresden enterprises it was reids turn to be surprised i know a little its owned by a man named joachim stuckler hes a collector im supposed to meet him in boston he contacted you he sent one of his flying monkeys to make the arrangements in fact he sent three flying monkeys but two wont be taking to the air again anytime soon they tried to play clever too incidentally reid looked uneasy at the implied threat id remind you that we are also stronger than we appear and that just because we wear collars doesnt mean we wont try to defend ourselves the men who stomped stucklers envoys are named tony and paulie fulci i said i dont think theyre good catholics despite their heritage in fact i dont think theyre good anythings but they take a certain pride in their work psychotics are funny that way i have no qualms about setting the fulcis on you assuming that i dont decide to make your lives difficult myself or hand you on to someone who makes the fulcis look like missionary workers i dont know what you think is going on here but let me explain it for you the young woman who was killed was called alice temple she was the cousin of one of my closest friends but cousin doesnt explain the obligation he feels toward her just as friend doesnt communicate the magnitude of my debt to him were looking for the men responsible and we will find them you may not care much for my threats you may not even be troubled by the possibility of being stomped by six hundred pounds of misplaced italianamerican pride but let me tell you something my friend louis is infinitely less tolerant than i am and anyone who gets in his way or holds back information is playing with fire and will get badly burned you seem to be looking at this like its some kind of intellectual game with information as the forfeit but there are lives involved and right now i dont have time to trade with you either help me now or get out and accept any consequences that arise when we come looking for you again bartek looked at the floor i know all about you mr parker said reid haltingly at first i know what happened to your wife and your daughter ive read about the men and women whom youve hunted down i also suspect that unknowingly youve come close to these believers before for youve certainly destroyed some who shared their delusions you couldnt make the connection and for some reason neither could they not until recently perhaps it is to do with the difference between good and evil good is selfless while evil is always selfinterested good will attract good to itself and those involved will unite toward a common goal evil in turn draws evil men but they will never truly act as one they will always be distrustful always jealous ultimately they seek power for themselves alone and for that reason they will always fall apart at the end he smiled a little sheepishly im sorry i have a tendency to wax philosophical it is a consequence of dealing with such matters anyway i know too that you have a partner now and a little girl i dont see any trace of them here there are dirty dishes in your sink and i see in your eyes that youre troubled by things that have nothing to do with this case thats none of your business i said oh but it is youre vulnerable mr parker and youre angry and theyll exploit that theyll use it to get at you i dont doubt for one moment that youre prepared to hurt people who frustrate you or who get in your way right now i dont think youd even need much of an excuse to do it but believe me when i say that we were being cautious in our answers for good reason maybe youre right though maybe the time has come to be more honest with each other so let me begin stuckler has two faces and two collections one he displays to the public and the other is entirely private the public collection consists of paintings sculpture antiques all with ironclad provenance and above reproach in both taste and source the second collection betrays his origins stucklers father was a major in der führer regiment of the second ss panzer division he was a veteran of the russian front and he was one of those who later carved a bloody trail through france in he was at tulle when they hanged ninetynine civilians from lampposts as reprisals for attacks on german forces by the maquis and he had gasoline on his hands after the slaughter and burning of over six hundred civilians at oradoursurglane mathias stuckler followed orders apparently without question just as might be expected of one of the armys elite his other role was as a treasure seeker for the nazis stuckler had a background in art history he was a cultured man but as with a great many cultured men his taste for beautiful things coexisted with a barbarous nature he helped to loot the hapsburg royal familys treasures from vienna in including what some fool believed was the spear of longinus and he was a favorite of himmlers himmler had a particular passion for the occult after all this was a man who sent expeditions to tibet to seek the origins of the aryan race and who used slave labor to renovate wewelsburg castle to resemble camelot complete with round table personally i dont think stuckler believed a word of it but it gave him an excuse to loot and to acquire treasures for his own gratification and reward which he set aside carefully as the opportunity arose after the war those treasures found their way to his son and that is what we believe forms the bulk of the private collection if the rumors are true some of goerings art collection has also since found its way to joachim stucklers vaults goering attempted to send a trainload of stolen art to safety by train from his hunting lodge in bavaria toward the end of the war but the train was abandoned and the collection disappeared a painting by françois boucher stolen from a paris gallery in and known to be part of goerings trove was quietly repatriated last year and stuckler was reputed to have been the source it seems that he made inquiries about selling it and its provenance was discovered to avoid embarrassment he handed it back to the french claiming that he himself had purchased it some years earlier under a misapprehension stuckler has always denied the existence of a secret cache and claims that if his father did manage to assemble such a trove of looted itemsand he has publicly stated his belief that this is a liethen its whereabouts died with his father what happened to his father mathias stuckler was killed late in the summer of during an incident at the french cistercian monastery of fontfroide in the corbière hills the circumstances have never been fully explained but a party of ss soldiers a number of civilian liaisons from the university of nuremberg and four cistercian monks were shot to death during a confrontation in the monastery courtyard stuckler was doing his masters bidding but something unexpected occurred in any event the treasure at fontfroide was denied him and what was the treasure ostensibly a valuable fourteenthcentury gold crucifix various gold coins a quantity of gemstones two gold chalices and a small jeweled monstrance it doesnt sound like the kind of haul that would drag the ss up a mountain in the face of the enemy the gold was a decoy the real treasure lay in a nondescript silver box it was a fragment of a coded map one of a number of pieces placed in similar boxes during the fifteenth century then dispersed the knowledge contained within them has since been lost to us which might have been for the best if the boxes too had been irretrievably lost careless of you to mislay your own statue i said reid flinched slightly but otherwise gave no indication that my awareness of the black angel and the story of its creation was perhaps greater than he had anticipated it wasnt an item that the order was anxious to display he said from the beginning there were those who said that it should be destroyed utterly why wasnt it because if one believes the myth of its creation they feared that any attempt to destroy it would release what lay within those were more credulous times i hasten to add instead it was hidden and the knowledge of its whereabouts dispersed to trusted abbots in the form of vellum fragments each fragment contains a great deal of ancillary informationillustrations dimensions of rooms partial accounts of the creation of the statue you mentionedand a numerical reference alongside a single letter either d or s for dexter or sinister right or left they are units of measurement all taken from a single starting point combined together they are supposed to give the precise location of a vault stuckler was trying to assemble the map when he died as many others before him had tried to do the fontfroide fragment disappeared following the attack and has not been seen since you know that the statue is rumored to lie buried in the vault thats what stuckler was attempting to recover and thats what the believers are also trying to locate recent developments have given their search a new impetus a fragment of the map was found earlier this year at sedlec in the czech republic but subsequently disappeared before it could be examined we believe that a second went missing from a house in brooklyn some weeks back winstons house which is how you came to be involved for we now know that two women were present in the house when the killings occurred and were subsequently hunted down in the belief that they were in possession of the fragment thats two pieces excluding fontfroide three more pieces one from bohemia one from italy and another from england have been missing for centuries the contents of the italian section have long been common knowledge but the rest are almost certainly in the wrong hands yesterday we received information that a fragment possibly the missing piece from fontfroide may have been acquired in georgia two veterans of world war ii were found dead in a swamp its not clear how they died but both were survivors of an attack by ss soldiers near fontfroide the same ss soldiers who were subsequently killed at the monastery was stuckler responsible for the deaths of the veterans he may have been although it would be out of character for him we believe that he has at least one fragment and possibly more he is certainly driven in his quest i couldnt see murnos colluding in the deaths of two old men he didnt seem like the type is stuckler a believer we have no evidence to suggest that he is but they keep themselves well hidden it is entirely possible that stuckler is one of them or he may even be a renegade one who has chosen to take his chances against his fellows so it could be that hes competing with them for possession of this map a fragment is due to be offered for sale this week at an auction house in boston run by a woman named claudia stern it is our understanding that this is the sedlec fragment although we cannot prove it the map and the box went missing from sedlec soon after the discovery and before a proper examination could be made we have investigated the possibility of taking legal action to stop the sale until its provenance can be determined but we have been instructed that any such attempt would fail we have no proof that it was taken from sedlec or that the cistercian order has any claim to its ownership soon all the pieces will be available for examination and then the believers will go hunting for the statue i watched them leave as the evening grew dark and quiet i hadnt learned as much as i had hoped but neither had they we were still circling one another wary of giving too much away i had not mentioned sekula to reid and bartek but angel and louis had taken on the task of checking out his office once they returned to new york if they found out anything more then they would tell me i closed the door and called rachel on her cell my call went straight to her message system i thought about trying her parents number but i didnt want to have to deal with frank or joan instead i walked walter along the marshes but when we came to a copse of trees at the farthest extreme of the woods he would go no farther and grew agitated until we turned back to the house the moon was already visible in the sky and it was reflected in the waters of the little pond like the face of a drowned man hanging in its depths reid and bartek drove toward i they did not speak until they were heading south on the interstate why didnt you tell him asked bartek i told him enough maybe too much you lied to him you said that you didnt know what it meant to be found these people are deluded brightwell isnt like the rest hes different how can it be otherwise the way he keeps reappearing unchanged let them believe what they want to believe brightwell included theres no point in worrying him more than he is the man already looks weighed down by his burdens why should we add to them bartek stared out the window great mounds of earth had been torn up for the widening of the highway trees lay fallen waiting to be cut up and transported the outlines of digging equipment were visible against the darkening sky like beasts frozen in the midst of some great conflict no he thought its more than a delusion its not merely the statue that theyve been seeking he spoke carefully reid had a temper and he didnt want him sulking in the drivers seat for the rest of the journey he will have to be told regardless of any other problems he may have he said theyll come back because of who they believe he is and theyll hurt him ahead of them the kennebunk exit was approaching bartek could see the parking lot of the rest stop and the lights of the fastfood outlets they were in the fast lane a big rig on their inside bugger said reid i knew i shouldnt have brought you along he floored the accelerator cut in front of the truck and made the exit seconds later they were heading back the way that they had come walter was already barking by the time their car pulled up he had learned to respond to the warning noises from the motion sensor at the gate now that rachel was gone i had opened the gun safe and placed one gun in the hall stand and another in the kitchen the third the big smith i tried to keep close to hand wherever i was i watched the big priest come to the door the younger one stayed by the car lose your way i said as i opened the door a long time ago said reid is there somewhere we can go to eat im starving i took them to the great lost bear i liked the bear it was unpretentious and inexpensive and i didnt want to be stiffed on a pricey meal by a pair of monks we ordered hot wings and burgers and fries reid seemed impressed by the selection of beers and went for some british import that looked like it had been bottled in the time of shakespeare so where were you stricken by remorse at your dishonesty i asked reid shot bartek a poisonous look the voice of my bloody conscience started up somewhere beside a burger king he said it wasnt quite the road to damascus said bartek but then youre no saint paul apart from a shared bad temper as you seem aware i wasnt entirely forthcoming about certain matters said reid my young colleague here appears to feel that we should make clear the risks that youre facing and what brightwell meant by your being found i stand by what i said earlier theyre deluded and they want others to share their delusions they can believe what they want to believe and you dont have to go along with it but i now accept that those beliefs can still be a threat to you it goes back to the apocrypha and the fall of the angels god forces the rebels from heaven and they burn in their descent they are banished to hell but some choose instead to wander the nascent earth consumed by hatred of god and eventually the growing hordes of humanity that they see around them they identify what they believe to be the flaw in gods creation god has given man free will and so he is open to evil as well as good so the war against god continues on earth waged through men i suppose you could term it guerrilla warfare in a way but not all of the angels turned their backs on god according to enoch there was one who repented and believed that he could still be forgiven the others tried to hunt him down but he hid himself among men the salvation he sought never came but he continued to believe in the possibility that it might be offered to him if he made reparation for all that he had done he did not lose faith after all his offense was great and his punishment had to be great in return he was prepared to endure whatever was visited upon him in the hope of his ultimate salvation so our friends these believers are of the opinion that this last angel is still out there somewhere and they hate him almost as much as they hate god himself found they want to kill him according to their tenets he cant be killed if they kill him they lose him again he wanders finds a new form and the search has to start over so what are their options to corrupt him to make him despair so that he joins their ranks again or they can imprison him forever lock him up somewhere so that he weakens and wastes away yet can never enjoy the release of death he will endure an eternity of slow living decay an appalling thought if nothing else you see said bartek god is merciful that is what i believe that is what martin believes and that is what according to enoch the solitary angel believed god would even have forgiven judas iscariot had he asked for his forgiveness judas wasnt damned for betraying christ he was damned for despairing for rejecting the possibility that he might be forgiven for what he had done i always thought judas got a raw deal said reid christ had to die to redeem us and a lot of people played a part in getting him to that point you could argue that judass role was preordained and that in the aftermath no man could have been expected to bear the burden of killing god without despairing you might have thought that there would have been a little room for maneuver in gods great scheme for judas i sipped at an alcoholfree beer it didnt taste great but i wasnt about to blame the beer for that youre telling me that they think i might be this angel that theyve been seeking yes said reid enoch is very allegorical as youve surely learned by now and there are places where the allegory bleeds into the more straightforward aspects enochs creator meant the repentant angel to symbolize the hope of forgiveness that we all should hold within us even those who have sinned most grievously the believers have chosen to interpret it literally and in you they think theyve found their lost penitent theyre not certain though thats why brightwell tried to get close to you i didnt tell you when we first met but i think ive seen someone who looked like brightwell before i said where in a painting of sedlec in the fifteenth century it was in claudia sterns workshop its going to be auctioned this week along with the box from sedlec i expected reid to scoff at my mention of a similarity to brightwell but he didnt theres a lot that is interesting about mr brightwell if nothing else heor ancestors who looked startlingly like himhas been around for a long long time he nodded to his companion and bartek began spreading upon the table pictures and photographs from a file by his feet we were right at the rear of the bear and the waitress had been told that we were okay for the present so we would be left undisturbed i drew the first picture toward me with my finger it was a blackandwhite photograph of a group of men most of them in nazi uniforms interspersed with them were civilians there were about twelve men in all and they were seated outdoors at a long wooden table littered with empty wine bottles and the remains of food the man at the back on the left is mathias stuckler said bartek the other men in uniform are members of the special ss group the civilians are members of the ahnenerbe the ancestral heritage research and teaching society incorporated into the ss in effectively it was himmlers research institute and it was far from benign in its methods berger its race expert saw the potential for experimentation in the concentration camps as early as he spent eight days at auschwitz that year selecting over a hundred prisoners to measure and assess then had them all gassed and shipped to the anatomy department at strasbourg all ahnenerbe staff held ss rank these are the men who died at fontfroide this photograph was taken only a few days before they were killed by this point many of stucklers comrades from der führer regiment had died trying to halt the allied advance after dday the soldiers with him in this picture were all that remained of his most loyal cadre the rest ended up in hungary and austria fighting alongside the flotsam of the third reich until the last day of the war they were committed men albeit ones committed to the wrong cause there was nothing very distinctive about any of the figures in the group although stuckler was taller and bulkier than the rest and a little younger his features though were harsh and the light in his eyes was long spent i was about to lay the photograph to one side when bartek stopped me look beyond them to the people behind i examined the background there were military men at some of the other tables sometimes accompanied by women but more often surrounded by others of their kind in one corner a man sat drinking alone a halfempty glass of wine before him he was discreetly looking at the ss group while the photograph was being taken so his face was partially visible it was brightwell he was marginally slimmer and with slightly more hair but his tumorous neck and the slightly feminine tilt to his features dispelled any doubts as to his identity but this photograph was taken nearly sixty years ago i said it must have been doctored reid looked dubious its always possible but we think its authentic and even if this one is not there are others about which there can be no doubt i drew the rest of the images nearer to me most were blackandwhite some sepiatinted many were dated the oldest being from frequently they depicted churches or monasteries often with groups of pilgrims in front of them in each photograph the specter of a man lurked a strange obese figure with full lips and pale almost luminous skin in addition to the photographs there was a highquality copy of a painting similar to the one claudia stern had shown to me possibly even by the same artist once again it depicted a group of men on horseback surrounded by the clamor and violence of war there were flames on the horizon and all around them men were fighting and dying their sufferings depicted in intricate detail the men on horseback were rendered distinctive by the symbol on their saddles a red grapnel they were led by a man with long dark hair and dressed in a cloak beneath which his armor could be seen the artist had painted his eyes slightly out of scale so that they were too large for his head one had a white cast to it as though the paint had been scratched to reveal the blank canvas beneath to his right the figure of brightwell held a banner marked with a red grapnel in one hand the other held the severed head of a woman by its hair this is like the painting that i saw i said its smaller and the horsemen in this one are the focus and not just an element but its very similar this painting shows the military action at sedlec said bartek sedlec is now part of the czech republic and we know that as the myth has it this was the site of the confrontation between immael and the monk erdric after some discussion it was decided that it was too dangerous to keep the statue at sedlec and that it should be hidden the fragments of vellum were dispersed in each case entrusted only to the abbot of the monastery in question who would share this knowledge with just one other of his community as death neared the abbot of sedlec was the only member of the order who knew where each box had been sent and once they had been distributed he sent the statue on its journey to its new hiding place unfortunately while the statue was in the process of being moved sedlec was attacked by the men in the painting the abbot had succeeded in hiding the black angel but the knowledge of its whereabouts was lost because only he knew the monasteries to which the map fragments had been entrusted and the abbots in question were sworn to secrecy under threat of excommunication and perpetual damnation so the statue remains lost if it ever existed i said the boxes exist said reid we know that each contains a fragment of some kind of map true it may all be a great ruse an elaborate joke on the part of the abbot of sedlec but if it is a joke then he was killed for it and a great many others have died for it since why not just let them look for it i said if it exists they can have it if it doesnt theyve wasted their time it exists said reid simply that much in the end i do believe it is its nature that i dispute not its existence it is a magnet for evil but evil is reflected in it not contained within all of thishe indicated the material on the table with a sweep of his handis incidental i have no explanation as to how brightwell or someone who resembles him to an extraordinary degree came to be in these images perhaps he is part of a line and these are all his dead kin whatever is the case the believers have killed for centuries and now is the time to put a stop to them theyve grown careless largely because circumstances have forced their hand for the first time they think they are drawing close to securing all of the fragments if we watch them the order can identify them and take steps against them what kind of steps if we find evidence linking them to crimes we can hand that information over to the authorities and have them tried and if you dont find evidence then it will be enough to make their identities known and there will be others who will do what we cannot do kill them reid shrugged imprison them perhaps or worse its not for me to say i thought you said they couldnt be killed i said that they are convinced that they cant be destroyed its not the same thing i closed my eyes this was madness now you know what we know said reid all we can ask is that you share with us any knowledge that might help us against these people if you meet with stuckler i would be interested to hear from you what he had to say similarly if you succeed in finding the fbi agent bosworth you should tell us in all of this he remains an unknown i had told them about bosworth on the journey into portland it seemed that they were already aware of him after all he had tried to tear apart one of their churches still they did not know where he was and i decided not to tell them that he was in new york and finally mr parker i want you to be careful said reid there is a controlling intelligence at work here and its not brightwell he tapped his finger against the copy of the painting allowing it to rest above the head of the armored captain with the white mark on his eye somewhere there is one who believes that he is the reincarnation of the captain which means that he suffers from the greatest delusion of all in his mind he is ashmael driven to seek his twin for the present brightwell is curious about you but his priority is to find the statue once that is secure he will turn his attention back to you and i dont think that will be a positive development reid leaned across the table and gripped my shoulder with his left hand his right reached into his shirt and removed from it a blackandsilver cross that hung around his neck remember though no matter what may happen the answer to all things is here with that he removed the cross and handed it to me after a moments hesitation i took it i returned to my house alone reid and bartek had offered to accompany me and even to stay with me but i politely declined maybe it was misplaced pride but i didnt feel comfortable with the possibility that i needed two monks to watch my back it seemed like a slippery slope that would eventually lead to nuns accompanying me to the gym and the priests from saint maximilians running my bathwater there was a car parked in my driveway when i pulled in and my front door was open walter was lying on the porch mat happily gnawing on a marrowbone angel appeared behind him walter looked up wagged his tail then returned to his supper i dont remember leaving the door open i said we like to think that your door is always open to us and if it isnt we can always open it with a pick plus we know your alarm codes we left a message on your cell i checked my phone i hadnt heard it ring but there were two messages waiting i got distracted i said with what its a long story i said i listened to my messages as i walked the first was from angel the second was from ellis chambers the man i had turned away when he came to me about his son the man i had advised to seek help elsewhere his words deteriorated into sobs before he could finish telling me all that he wanted to say but what i heard was enough the body of his son neil had been found in a ditch outside olathe kansas the men to whom he owed money had finally lost their patience with him chapter eighteen few people now remember the name of sam lichtman lichtman was a new york cabdriver who on march was driving his yellow cab along seventh avenue near times square when he ran over a guy who suddenly stepped out in front of him at an intersection according to the dead mans passport his name was don julio lopez lido a spaniard in the confusion nobody noticed that don julio had been talking to another man at the intersection before he made his fatal attempt to cross and that as a curious crowd gathered in the wake of the accident this second man picked up a brown leather briefcase lying near the body and disappeared the nypd duly arrived and discovered that don julio was staying in a manhattan hotel when the cops went to his room they found maps notes and a great deal of material related to military aviation the fbi were called in and as they dug deeper into the mystery of the dead spaniard they discovered that he was actually one ulrich von der osten a captain in nazi military intelligence and he was the brains behind the main german spy network in the united states the man who had fled the scene of the accident was kurt frederick ludwig von der ostens assistant and together the two men had managed to recruit eight accomplices who were passing details of military strength shipping schedules and industrial production back to berlin including the departure and arrival times of ships using new york harbor and the numbers of flying fortresses being sent to england the reports were written in invisible ink and mailed to pseudonymous recipients at fictitious foreign addresses letters to one manuel alonzo for example were meant for heinrich himmler himself ludwig was subsequently arrested he and his associates were tried in federal court in manhattan and they each received a sentence of up to twenty years for their troubles sam lichtman with one surge of gas had managed to cripple the nazis entire intelligence network in the united states my father told me lichtmans story when i was a boy and i never forgot it i guessed that lichtman was a jewish name and it seemed somehow apt that it should have been a jew who knocked down a nazi on seventh avenue in when so many of his fellows were already on cattle trains heading east it was a small blow for his people inadvertently struck by a man who then faded into folk memory louis hadnt heard the story of sam lichtman and he didnt appear very impressed with it when i told it to him he listened without comment while i went through the events of the last couple of days culminating in the visit from the two monks and the encounter with brightwell on the road when i mentioned the fat man and reids interpretation of the words he had spoken to me on the road something changed in louiss demeanor he seemed almost to retreat from me withdrawing further into himself and he avoided looking at me directly and you think this might be the same guy who was watching us when we took gmack said angel he was aware of the tension between louis and me and let me know with a slight movement of his eyes in his partners direction that we could talk about it in private later the feelings he aroused were the same i said i cant explain it any other way he sounds like one of the men who came looking for sereta said angel octavio didnt have a name for him but there cant be too many guys like that walking the streets i thought of the painting in claudia sterns workshop and the pictures and photographs that reid and bartek had shown me at the great lost bear i arranged the images in my mind in order of antiquity progressing from paint strokes to sepia then on to the man seated behind stucklers group before finally recalling the figure of brightwell himself somehow reaching for me without moving his nails cutting me without a hand being laid upon me each time he got a little older his flesh a little more corrupted that terrible painful extrusion on his neck a little larger and more obvious no there could not be many such men on this earth there could not ever have been many such men so what now said angel sekulas dropped off the planet and he was our best lead angel and louis had paid a visit to sekulas building earlier in the week and had gone through his apartment and his office they had found virtually nothing in the office insignificant files relating to a number of properties in the tristate area some fairly straightforward corporate material and a folder marked with the name ambassade realty that contained just a single letter dated two years earlier acknowledging that ambassade was now responsible for the maintenance and potential leasing of three warehouse buildings including the one in williamsburg the apartment above the office wasnt much more revealing there were clothes and toiletries both male and female which made it seem more and more likely that sekula and the improbably named hope were an item some suitably anonymous books and magazines that suggested he and his mate bought all of their reading material at airports and a kitchen filled with drearily healthy foodstuffs along with a refrigerator entirely devoid of food of any kind at all apart from longlife milk according to angel it looked like someone had cherrypicked and then removed anything that might have been remotely interesting about sekulas life and work in order to create the impression that here was one of the single most boring individuals ever to have passed a bar exam louis returned the following day and questioned the secretary who had so chirpily answered the phone to me if she was under the impression that he was a cop when she answered his questions then that was clearly some kind of misunderstanding on her behalf and nothing to do with any vagueness on louiss part she was just a caretaker hired from a temp agency and required to do nothing more than answer the phone read her book and file her nails she hadnt seen sekula or his secretary since the day shed been hired and the only means of communication she had for him was through an answering service she said that some other policemen had called in to the office following the discovery of the basement room in williamsburg but she could tell them nothing more than she had told louis she did believe though that someone had visited the office after hours as she thought that some items might have been moved from the secretarys desk and the shelves behind it it was also her final day because the agency had called to say that she was being transferred to another job and should simply activate the answering machine before she left that evening we still have bosworth and stuckler i said plus the auction is due to take place this week and if reid and neddo are right that map fragment is going to make some people break cover louis stood abruptly and left the room i looked to angel for an explanation its a lot of things he said he hasnt slept much hasnt eaten yesterday they released alices remains for burial and martha took her home he told her that hed keep looking for the men who killed her but she said it was too late she said that if he thought he was doing all this for alice then he was lying to himself she wasnt about to give him a dispensation to hurt someone just so he could feel better about his life he blames himself for what happened does he blame me too angel shrugged i dont think its that simple this guy brightwell he knows something about you somehow theres a connection between you and the man behind alices death and louis doesnt want to hear that not now he just needs time to work it out in his own way thats all angel took a beer from the cooler he offered me one i shook my head its quiet here he said have you spoken to her briefly how are they theyre doing okay when are they coming back after all this is over maybe maybe you heard me angel stopped drinking and poured the remainder of his beer down the sink yeah he said quietly i heard and then he left me alone in the kitchen joachim stuckler lived in a white twostory house on an acre of waterfront property just outside nahant down in essex county the land was highwalled and protected by an electronic gate the grounds were neatly tended and mature shrubs masked the walls on the inside from the front the main house looked like an above average dwelling albeit one that had been decorated by drunken greeks nostalgic for their homelandthe façade boasted more pillars than the acropolisbut as i passed through the gate and followed the driveway i caught a glimpse of the back of the house and saw that it had been extended considerably large picture windows gleamed smokily in the sunlight and a sleek white cruiser rested at a wooden jetty the lapse of taste in decoration aside stuckler seemed to be doing okay financially the front door was already open when i pulled up in front of the house and murnos was waiting for me i could tell from his expression that he wasnt one hundred percent behind his bosss decision to invite me over but i got that a lot id learned not to take it personally are you armed mr parker murnos asked i tried to look sheepish just a bit well take care of it for you i handed over the smith murnos then produced a circular wand from a drawer and wiped it over me it beeped a little at my watch and belt murnos checked to make sure i wasnt concealing anything potentially lethal in either then led me to a living room where a short stocky man in a navy pinstripe suit set off by a raging pink tie stood posed by an ornate sideboard just a few decades too late for life magazines celebrity photographers to immortalize him in glorious blackandwhite his hair was dark gray and brushed backward from his forehead his skin was lightly tanned and he had very white teeth the watch on his wrist could have paid my mortgage for a year the furnishings in the room and the art upon the walls could probably have covered the rest of scarboroughs mortgages for a year well maybe not out on prouts neck but most of the folk on prouts neck didnt need too much help with their bills he rose and stretched out a hand it was a very clean hand i felt kind of bad about shaking it in case he was just being polite and secretly hoped that i wasnt going to sully him with any form of contact joachim stuckler he said im pleased to make your acquaintance alexis has told me all about you his trip to maine proved quite expensive i will have to compensate the men who were hurt you could have just called i have to be stuckler paused poised like a man in an orchard searching for a particularly ripe apple then plucked the word from the air with a delicate hand gesture cautious he concluded as im sure youre aware by now there are dangerous men about i wondered if stuckler despite his posturing and vague effeminacy was one of them he invited me to take a seat then offered me tea you can have coffee if you prefer its just a habit of mine to take midmorning tea tea is fine murnos picked up the receiver of an old black telephone and dialed an extension seconds later a flunky arrived carrying a tray he carefully set out a big china pot and two matching cups along with a sugar bowl milk and a small plate of lemon slices a second plate contained a selection of pastries they looked crumbly and hard to eat the cups were very delicate and lined with gold stuckler poured a little tea into a cup then allowed it to flow more freely once he was content with the color when both cups were filled he asked me how i preferred to take my tea black is fine i said stuckler winced slightly but otherwise he hid his displeasure manfully we sipped our tea it was all very pleasant we just needed some dim bulb called algy to wander in wearing tennis whites and carrying a racket and we could have been in a drawing room comedy except that stuckler was considerably more interesting than he appeared another call to ross this time answered a little more quickly than before had given me some background on the neat grinning man before me according to rosss contact in the iwgthe interagency working group created in to delve into among other things the records relating to nazi and japanese war crimes in order to assess evidence of cooperation between us organizations and individuals of questionable background from the former regimesstucklers mother maria had traveled to the united states with her only son shortly after the end of the war the ins tried to have a great many of these people deported but the preference in the cia and in particular in hoovers fbi was to keep them in the states so they could report back on communist sympathizers within their own communities the us government wasnt too particular about whom it welcomed in those days five associates of adolf eichmann each of whom had played a part in the final solution worked for the cia and efforts were made to recruit at least a further two dozen war criminals and collaborators maria stuckler bargained her way to the states with the promise of documents relating to german communists secured by her husband during his dealings with himmler she was a clever woman delivering enough material to keep the americans keen and with each disclosure getting a little closer to her ultimate goal of us citizenship for her son and herself her citizenship application was personally approved by hoover after she handed over the last of her store of documents which related to various leftwing jews who had fled germany before the start of the war and had since found gainful employment in the united states the iwg concluded that some of maria stucklers information proved crucial in the early days of the mccarthy hearings which made her something of a heroine in hoovers eyes her favored person status enabled her to set up the antiques business that her son subsequently inherited and to import objects of interest from europe with little or no interference from us customs the old woman was still alive apparently she lived in a big house in newport rhode island and all of her faculties were fully intact at the age of eightyfive now here i was taking tea with her son in a room furnished and paid for with the spoils of war if reid was right in his assessment of stucklers private collection and secured by an ambitious womans slow process of betrayal over more than a decade i wondered if it ever bothered stuckler rosss contact had said that stuckler was a generous contributor to a great many good causes including a number of jewish charities although some had declined his largesse once the identity of the prospective donor became known it might have been genuine pangs of conscience that led to his donations it might also merely have been good public relations a means of deflecting attention away from his business and his collections i realized that i had developed a sudden deepseated dislike for stuckler and i didnt even know him im grateful to you for taking the time to come here he said he had no trace of an accent german or otherwise his tone was entirely neutral contributing to the sense of an image that had been carefully cultivated to give away as little as possible about the origins and true nature of the man who lay behind it with respect i said i came here because your employee indicated that you might have some information i can take tea at home despite the calculated insult stuckler continued to radiate goodwill as though he took great pleasure in the suspicion that everyone who came to his house secretly disliked him and their jibes were merely honey on his bread of course of course i think perhaps i can help you before we begin though i am curious about the death of mr garcia in which i understand you played a significant role i should like to know what you saw in his apartment i didnt know where this was leading but i understood that stuckler was used to bargaining he had probably learned the skill from his mother and applied it every day in his business dealings i wasnt going to get anything out of him unless i gave him at least as much in return there were bone sculptures ornate candlesticks made from human remains some other halfcompleted efforts and a representation of a mexican deity santa muerte made from a female skull stuckler didnt seem interested in santa muerte instead he made me elaborate on what i had seen questioning me about small details of construction and presentation he then gestured to murnos who took a book from a side table and brought it to his employer it was a black coffee table volume with the words memento mori in red along the spine on the cover was a photograph of a piece that might have come from garcias apartment a skull resting upon a curved bone that jutted out like a white tongue from beneath the ruined jaw which was missing five or six of its front teeth below the skull was a column of five or six similar curved bones stuckler saw me looking each is a human sacrum he said one can tell from the five fused vertebrae he flicked through fifty or sixty pages of text in a number of languages including german and english until he came to a series of photographs he handed the volume to me please take a look at these photographs and tell me if anything is familiar i leafed through them all were in blackandwhite with a faint sepia tint the first depicted a church of some kind with three spires set in a triangular pattern it was surrounded by bare trees and an old stone wall separated at regular intervals by columns topped with carved skulls the rest of the pictures showed ornate arrangements of skulls and bones beneath vaulted ceilings great pyramids and crosses garlands of bones and white chain candlesticks and candelabras and finally another view of the church this time taken from the rear and in daylight the surrounding walls were thick with ivy but the monochrome textures of the photograph gave it the appearance of a swarm of insects as though bees were massing along the walls what is this place i said once again there was something obscene about the photographs about this reduction of human beings to a series of adornments to a church is this sedlec first you have to answer my question said stuckler he wagged a finger at me in reproach i considered breaking it i looked at murnos he didnt need telepathy to know what i was thinking from the expression on his face i imagined that a lot of people maybe murnos included had thought about hurting joachim stuckler i ignored the finger and pointed instead to one small photograph of an anchorshaped arrangement of bones set in an alcove beside a cracked wall seven humerus bones formed a stellate pattern with a skull at their center supported in turn by what might have been portions of sternum or scapula then a vertical column of more humerus bones which met at last a semicircle of vertebrae curving upward on either side and ending in a pair of skulls there was something similar to this in garcias apartment i said is that what you showed to mr neddo i didnt answer stuckler snorted impatiently come come mr parker as i told you i know a great deal about you and your work i am aware that you consulted neddo it was natural that you should do so after all he is an acknowledged expert in his field he is also i might add a believer well in his defense perhaps was a believer might be more accurate he has since turned his back on them although i suspect that he retains a faith in some of their more obscure convictions this was news to me assuming stuckler was telling the truth neddo had kept his connection to the believers well hidden it raised further questions about his loyalties he had spoken to reid and bartek and i could only assume that they knew of his background but i wondered if neddo had told brightwell about me as well what do you know about them i asked that they are secretive and organized that they believe in the existence of angelic or demonic beings and that they are looking for the same item that i am seeking the black angel for the first time stuckler actually looked impressed if i was a little more insecure i might have blushed happily in the light of his approval yes the black angel although my desire for it is different from theirs my father died seeking it perhaps you are aware of my background yes i rather suspect that you are i dont believe you are the kind of man who fails to equip himself with information before meeting a stranger my father was a member of the ss and part of the ahnenerbe reichsführer himmlers delvers into the occult most of it was nonsense of course but the black angel was different it was real or at least one could say with reasonable certainty that a silver statue of a being in the process of transformation from human to demonic existed such an artifact would be an adornment to any collection regardless of its value but himmler like the believers was of the opinion that it was more than a mere statue he knew the tale of its creation such a story had a natural appeal for him he began seeking the pieces of the map that contained the location of the statue and it was for this reason that my father and his men were dispatched to the monastery at fontfroide after himmler discovered that one of the boxes containing a map fragment was reputed to be hidden there the ahnenerbe boasted prodigious researchers capable of unearthing the most obscure references it was a dangerous errand undertaken under the noses of the allied forces and it led to my fathers death the box disappeared and so far i have been unable to trace it he jabbed a finger at the book in answer to your earlier question this is indeed sedlec where the black angel came into being that is why garcia was working on his bone sculptures he was commissioned to create a version of the ossuary at sedlec an environment worthy of holding the black angel until its secrets could be unlocked you think such a thing to be strange there was a new fervor to him now stuckler was a fanatic just like brightwell and the believers his veneer of sophisticated giveandtake was falling away and to my benefit on the subject of his particular obsession stuckler could not contain himself why are you so certain that it exists i said because i have seen it replicated said stuckler you have too in a way he stood suddenly come please murnos started to object but stuckler silenced him with a raised hand dont worry alexis everything is coming to its natural conclusion i followed stuckler through the house until we came to a doorway beneath the main stairs murnos stayed behind me all the way even as stuckler unlocked the door and we descended into the cellars of the house they were expansive and lined with stone most of the area was given over to a wine collection which must have stretched to a thousand bottles all carefully stored with a thermostat on the wall monitoring the temperature we passed through the racks of bottles until we came to a second door this time made of metal and accessed using a keypad and a retinal scanner murnos opened this door then stepped aside to allow stuckler and me to enter we were in a square stone room glassed alcoves around the walls contained what were clearly stucklers most treasured items there were three icons the gold upon them still intact the colors rich and vibrant there were gold chalices and ornate crosses there were paintings and small sculptures of men that might have been roman or greek but the room was dominated by a statue perhaps eight feet in height and constructed entirely from human bones i had seen a similar piece of sculpture before except on a much smaller scale in garcias apartment it was the black angel a single great skeletal wing was unfurled its spines the slightly curved bones of the radius and ulna its arms were made from femurs and fibulae to achieve the sense of scale its great jointed legs an ornate arrangement of skillfully wired bones the barest hint of the joins visible between them its head was made up of fragments of many skulls each carefully cut and fused to create the whole ribs and vertebrae had been used to construct the main horn that rose from its head and curved down to its collarbone it rested on a granite pedestal its clawed toes hanging slightly over the edge and gripping the stone in its presence i felt a terrible sense of fear and disgust the pictures of the bone adornments at sedlec had unsettled me but at least there might have been some purpose to them some recognition of the passage of all mortal things yet this was something without merit human beings reduced to constituent parts in the creation of an image of profound evil extraordinary dont you think said stuckler i could not guess at how often he had stood here before it but judging from the tone of his voice his awe at this possession never faded its one word for it i replied where did it come from my father discovered it in the monastery at morimondo in lombardy during the search for clues about the fontfroide fragment it was the first sign that he was close to the map there was some damage to it as you can see stuckler pointed out fragmented bones a crudely repaired fissure in the spine missing fingers my fathers guess was that it had been transported from sedlec probably some time after the initial dispersal of the map fragments and had eventually found its way to italy a double bluff perhaps to direct attention away from the original he ordered it to be concealed he had a number of locations for such things and nobody dared to question his instructions on these matters it was to have been a gift for the reichsführer but my father was killed before he could arrange for its transportation instead it passed to my mother after the war along with some of the other items accumulated by my father but surely anyone could have made this i said no said stuckler with absolute conviction only someone who had examined the original could have created it how do you know if youve never seen the original stuckler strode across to one of the alcoves and carefully opened the glass cover i followed him over he activated a light inside it revealed two small silver boxes now open with a simple cross carved into the lid of each beside them carefully protected between thin layers of glass were two pieces of vellum each perhaps a foot square i saw sections of a drawing depicting a wall and window with a series of symbols around the edge a sacred heart entangled with thorns a beehive a pelican there was also a series of dots on each probably representing numbers and the corners of what might have been shields or coats of arms almost immediately i saw the combination of roman numerals and a single letter that reid had described one manuscript was dominated by the drawing of a great leg curving backward and the clawed toes at its feet it was almost identical to that of the statue behind us i could detect the faintest trace of lettering concealed in the leg but i could not read any of the letters the second manuscript showed onehalf of a skull again it was identical to the skull on stucklers bone statue you see said stuckler these fragments have been separated for centuries ever since the creation of the map only someone who had seen the drawing could have constructed a representation of the black angel but only someone who had seen the original could have done so in such detail the drawing is relatively crude the actuality much less so you asked me why i believe it exists this is why i turned my back on stuckler and his statue murnos was watching me without expression so you have two of the fragments i said and youll bid at auction for a third i will bid as you suggest once the auction is complete i will make contact with the other bidders in order to see who among them is also in possession of pieces of the map nobody knows of the existence of this cellar and its contents apart from alexis and i you are the first outsider to have the privilege of seeing it and only because of the imminence of the auction i am a wealthy man mr parker i will establish contacts deals will be struck and i will acquire sufficient knowledge to make an accurate determination of the black angels resting place and the believers you think you can buy them out dont be fooled by the ease with which you dealt with the hired help in maine mr parker you were not regarded as a real danger we can take care of them if necessary but i would prefer to reach an accommodation agreeable to both sides i doubted if that would happen from what i had learned so far stucklers reasons for seeking the black angel were very different from those of brightwell and his kind to stuckler it was merely another treasure to be stored away in his cave albeit one with links to his own dead father the black angel would stand alongside the bone sculpture one darkly mirroring the other and he would adore them both in his neat obsessive way but brightwell and the individual to whom he answered believed that there was something hidden beneath the silver a living being stuckler wanted the statue to remain intact and unexamined brightwell wanted to explore what lay within have you encountered a man named brightwell i said stuckler looked at me blankly should i have he asked i couldnt tell if he was hiding his knowledge of brightwell or genuinely didnt know of his existence i wondered how recently brightwell had emerged from the shadows impelled by his belief that the centurieslong search was nearing an end and if that was the reason why stuckler professed to be unaware of him despite stucklers faintly comical bearing he was clearly skilled in his business of choice and had somehow managed to conduct his own search for the map fragments while avoiding the attentions of brightwells kind it was a situation that was about to change i think youll be hearing from him once he discovers that you share a common goal i said i look forward to meeting him then said stuckler and there was the hint of a smile upon his face its time for me to go i said but stuckler was no longer listening instead murnos led me out leaving his employer lost in contemplation of the ruined bodies of human beings now joined together in a dark tribute to old undying evil chapter nineteen i met phil isaacson for dinner in the old port shortly after returning from my meeting with stuckler it was becoming ever clearer that the following days auction would be a turning point it would draw those who wanted to possess the sedlec box including the believers and it would bring stuckler into conflict with them if he succeeded in acquiring the item i wanted to be present at the auction but when i called claudia stern she wasnt available instead i was told that entry to the auction was strictly by invitation only and that it was too late to be added to the list of invitees i left a message for claudia asking her to call me but i didnt expect to hear back from her i didnt imagine that her clients would be pleased if she allowed a private investigator into their midst an investigator moreover who was interested in the eventual destination of one of the more unusual pieces to have come on the market in recent years but if there was one person who could be relied upon to find a way into the house of stern and who might know enough about the bidders to be of assistance it was phil isaacson natashas used to be on cumberland avenue close by bintliff s and its move to the old port was one of the few recent developments in the life of the city of which i was totally in favor its new surroundings were more comfortable and if anything the food had improved which was quite an achievement given that natashas was excellent to begin with when i arrived phil was already seated at a table close by the banquette that ran along the length of the main dining room as usual he looked like the dictionary definition of dapper he was a small whitebearded man dressed in a tweed jacket and gray pants with a red bow tie neatly knotted against his white shirt his main profession was the law and he remained a partner in his cumberlandbased practice but he was also the art critic of the portland press herald i had no problem with the newspaper but it was still a surprise to find an art critic of phil isaacsons quality hiding among its pages he liked to claim that theyd simply forgotten that he wrote for them and sometimes it wasnt hard to imagine someone in the news editors office picking up the paper reading phils column and exclaiming wait a second we have an art critic id first met phil at an exhibition over at the june fitzpatrick gallery on park street where june was showing work by a cumberland artist named sara crisp who used found itemsleaves animal bones snakeskinto create works of stunning beauty setting the fragments of flora and fauna against complex geometric patterns i figured it was something to do with order in nature and phil seemed to generally agree with me at least i think he agreed with me phils vocabulary was considerably more advanced than mine where the art world was concerned i ended up buying one of the pieces a cross made from eggshells mounted in wax set against a red backdrop of interlocking circles well well said phil when i reached the table i was beginning to think youd found someone more interesting with whom to spend your evening believe me i did try i said looks like all the interesting people have better things to do tonight a waitress deposited a glass of californian zin on the table i told her to bring the bottle and ordered a selection of oriental appetizers for two to go with it phil and i swapped some local gossip while we waited for the food to arrive and he gave me tips on some artists that i might want to check out if i ever won the state lottery the restaurant began to fill up around us and i waited until everyone at the nearby tables appeared suitably caught up in one anothers company before i broached the main subject of the evening so what can you tell me about claudia stern and her clients i asked as phil finished off the last prawn from the appetizer tray phil laid the remains of the prawn on the side of his plate and patted his lips delicately with his napkin i dont tend to cover her auctions in my column to begin with i wouldnt want to put people off their breakfasts by detailing the kind of items with which she sometimes deals and secondly im not convinced of the value of writing about human remains besides why would you be interested in anything she has to offer is this to do with a case kind of you could say it has a personal element to it phil sat back in his chair and stroked his beard well lets see its not an old house it was founded only ten years ago and specializes in what might be termed esoteric items claudia stern has a degree in anthropology from harvard but she has a core of experts upon whom she calls when the need to authenticate items arises her area of interest is simultaneously wide and very specialized were talking about manuscripts bones rendered into approximations of art and various ephemera linked to biblical apocrypha she mentioned human remains to me when i met her but she didnt elaborate i said well its not something most of us would discuss with strangers said phil until recentlysay five or six years agostern did a small but lively trade in certain aboriginal items skulls mainly but sometimes more ornate items now that kind of dealing is frowned upon and governments and tribes arent slow to seek recovery of any such remains that are presented for auction there are fewer difficulties with european bone sculptures as long as theyre suitably old and the auction house made the papers some years ago when it auctioned skeletal remains from a number of polish and hungarian ossuaries the bones had been used to make a pair of matching candelabra as i recall any idea who might have purchased them phil shook his head stern is lowkey to the point of secretive it caters to a very particular type of collector none of whom has ever to my knowledge complained about the way claudia stern conducts her business affairs all items are scrupulously checked to ensure their authenticity she never sold anyone a broomstick that didnt fly apparently not the waitress removed the remains of the appetizers a few minutes later our main courses arrived lobster for phil steak for me i see you still dont eat seafood he remarked i think that some creatures were created ugly to discourage people from eating them or dating them said phil there is that he set about tearing apart his lobster i tried not to watch so do you want to tell me why claudia stern should have come to your attention he asked strictly between ourselves i should add theres a sale taking place there tomorrow the sedlec trove said phil ive heard rumors one of phils areas of interest was the aesthetics of cemeteries so it wasnt surprising that he was aware of sedlec sometimes the breadth of his knowledge was almost worrying you know anything about it i hear that the fragment of vellum at the center of the auction contains drawings of some kind and that in itself its worth relatively little apart from a certain curiosity value i know that claudia stern has presented only a tiny portion of the vellum for authentication with the remainder supposedly being kept under lock and key until a buyer is found i also know that there has been a lot of secrecy maintained and care taken for such a minor item i can tell you a little more i said and i did by the time i was done phils lobster lay halfconsumed on his plate i had barely touched my beef the waitress looked quite pained when she came to check up on us is everything okay she asked phils face lit up with a smile so perfect only an expert could have spotted that it was false although his regret was genuine everything was divine but i dont have the appetite i once had he explained i let her take my plate as well and the smile faded slowly from phils face do you really believe that this statue is real he said i think that something was hidden a long time ago i replied too many individuals are concerned about it for it to be a complete myth as for its exact nature i cant say but its safe to assume that its valuable enough to kill for how much do you know about collectors of this type of material i know some of them by name others by reputation those in the business occasionally share gossip with me could you get a pair of invitations to the auction i think i could it would mean calling in some favors but you just told me that you believe claudia stern would probably prefer if you didnt attend im hoping that shell be sufficiently distracted by all thats happening to allow me to get a foot in the door with you by my side if we arrive close to the auction im banking on the hope that it will be easier to let us stay than to throw us out and risk disrupting the affair anyway i do lots of things that people would prefer i didnt do id be out of a job if i didnt phil finished his wine i knew this free meal would end up costing me dearly he said come on i said i know youre fascinated and if anyone kills you just think of the obituary youll get in the press herald youll be immortalized that is not reassuring said phil i was hoping that immortality would come to me through not dying you may yet be the first i told him and what are your chances slim i said and declining brightwell was hungry he had fought the urges for so long but lately they had become too strong for him he recalled the death of the woman alice temple in the old warehouse and the sound of his bare feet slapping on the tiles as he approached her temple her name was somehow appropriate in light of the desecration that had been visited on her body it was strange to brightwell the way in which he was able to stand outside himself and watch what occurred as though his mortal form were engaged in certain pursuits while its guiding consciousness was otherwise occupied brightwell opened his mouth and sucked in a deep breath of oily air his fists clenched and unclenched whitening his knuckles beneath his skin he shuddered recalling the fury with which he had torn the woman apart that was where the separation occurred the division of self and notself one part seeking only to rend and tear while the other stood aside calm yet watchful waiting for the moment the final moment this was brightwells gift the reason for his being even with his eyes closed or locked in complete darkness he could sense the coming of the last breath the spasming was increasing in frequency now his mouth was very dry temple alice temple he loved that name loved the taste of her as his mouth found hers blood and spit and sweat intermingled upon her lips her consciousness seeping away her strength failing now brightwell was with her once again his ensanguined fingers clutching at her head his lips locked against her lips the redness of her red within red without she was dying and to anyone else from a doctor to a layman there would be only the sight of a body deflating the life leaving it at last as it slumped naked in the battered chair but life was not the only element departing at that moment and brightwell was waiting for it as it left her he felt it as a rushing sensation in his mouth like a sweet breeze ascending through a scarlet tunnel like a gentle fall making way for harsh winter like sunset and night presence and absence light and notlight and then it was within him locked inside trapped between worlds in the ancient dark prison that was brightwell brightwell the guiding angel the guardian of memories brightwell the searcher the identifier brightwells breathing grew faster he could feel them within him tormented and questing brightwell capable of bending the will of others to his own of convincing the lost and forgotten that the truth of their natures lay in his words he needed another the taste was on him deep inside him a crescendo grew a great chorus of voices crying out for release he did not regret all that had followed from her death true it had brought them unwanted attention she was not alone in the world after all there were those who cared about her and who would not let her passing go unexamined but the intersection of her lifes path with that of brightwell was no coincidence brightwell was very old and with great age came great patience he had always retained his faith his certainty that each life taken would bring him closer and closer to the one who had betrayed him who had betrayed them all for the possibility of a redemption always destined to be denied him he had kept himself well hidden submerging the truth of his being burying it beneath a pretence of normality even as the three worldsthis world the world above and the great honeycomb world belowdid all in their power to demonstrate to him that normality had no place in his existence brightwell had plans for him oh yes brightwell would find a cold dark place with chains upon the walls and there he would bind him and watch him through a hole in the brickwork as he wasted away hour upon hour day upon day year upon year century after century teetering on the brink of death yet never falling finally into the abyss and if brightwell were wrong about his natureand brightwell was rarely wrong even in the smallest of thingsthen it would still be a long agonizing death for the man who had threatened to stand in the way of the revelation that they had long sought and the recovery of the one that had been lost to them for so long the preparations were all in place tomorrow they would find out what they needed to know there was nothing more that could be done so brightwell allowed himself a small indulgence later that night he came across a young man in the shadow of the park and he drew him to himself with promises of money and food and strange carnal delights and in time brightwell was upon him his hands buried deep within the boys body his long nails slicing organs and gently crushing veins controling the intricate piece of machinery that was the human form slowly bringing the boy to the climax that brightwell sought until at last they were locked together lip to lip and the surging sweetness filled brightwell as another voice was added to the great choir of souls within chapter twenty martin reid called me first thing the next morning leading angel to question if he was actually in league with the very people he was supposed to be working against since only someone involved with the devil would call at am will you be attending todays event he asked i hope so what about you he grunted im a little too well known to mingle unnoticed in such company anyway i had a fraught telephone conversation with our miss stern yesterday during which i stressed once again my unhappiness with her determination to continue with the sale despite doubts about the provenance and ownership of the box well have somebody there to keep an eye on what transpires but it wont be me not for the first time it struck me that there was something wrong with the way in which reid was dealing with the sale of the sedlec fragment the catholic church was not short of lawyers especially in the commonwealth of massachusetts as anyone who had dealt with the archdiocese in the course of the recent abuse scandals could attest if it were determined to stop the auction from going ahead claudia sterns business would have been crawling with oleaginous men and women in expensive suits and polished shoes by the way he said i hear you were asking questions about us i had checked up on both reid and bartek after my meeting with them it took me a while to find anyone who was prepared to admit that they had ever set foot in a church let alone taken holy orders but eventually their identities were confirmed to me through saint josephs abbey in spencer massachusetts where both men were staying reid was officially based at san bernardo alle terme in rome and was apparently responsible for instructing visiting clerics and nuns about the way of life of saint benedict the saint most closely associated with the rules governing the order through contemplation of places in which he spent crucial parts of his life norica subiaco and monte cassino bartek worked out of the new monastery of our lady of novy dvur in the czech republic the first monastery to be built in the czech republic since the fall of communism and it was still under construction he had previously lived in the community at septfons abbey in france to which he and a number of other young czech men had fled in the early s to escape religious persecution in their own country but had also worked extensively in the united states mainly at the abbey of the genesee in upstate new york septfons i remembered was the monastery that bosworth the elusive fbi agent had desecrated still barteks story sounded plausible enough but reid didnt strike me as the type who was content to sit at the front of a tour bus muttering platitudes through a microphone interestingly the monk who explained all this to mehaving first cleared it with the head of the order in the united states and presumably with reid and bartek themselvestold me that the two monks actually represented two distinct orders bartek was a trappist a group deriving its name from the abbey of our lady of la trappe in france and formed after a split in the order between those who subscribed to strict observance of silence austerity and simple vestments and those like reid who preferred a little more laxity in their duties and lifestyles this latter group was known as the sacred order of citeaux or the cistercians of the common observance i also couldnt help but feel that there was a certain amount of respect bordering on awe in the way the monk spoke about the two men i was curious i told reid and i also had only your word that you were actually a monk so what did you learn he sounded amused nothing that you didnt give them permission to tell me i said apparently youre a tour guide is that what they said said reid well well they also serve who only stand and wait at the bus door for latecomers its important that history is not forgotten thats why i gave you the cross i hope youre wearing it its very old as it happened i had attached the cross to my key ring i already wore a cross a simple byzantine pilgrims cross over one thousand years old that my grandfather had given to me as a gift when i graduated high school i didnt think that i needed to wear another i keep it close i assured him good if anything ever happens to me you can give that a rub and ill be in touch from the next world im not sure i find that reassuring i said like a great many things about you such as i think you want this auction to go ahead i dont think you and your order made more than cosmetic efforts to stop it for some reason its in your interests that whatever is contained in that last fragment is revealed there was only silence from the other end of the line reid might almost have abandoned the phone were it not for the soft susurration of his breathing and what reason would that be he asked and there was no longer any trace of amusement instead he sounded wary no not wary exactly he wanted me to figure out the answer but he wasnt about to give it to me despite all my threats of the combined wrath of louis and the fulcis being unleashed upon him reid was going to play the game his way right until the end maybe youd like to see the black angel too i said your order lost it and now it wants it back reid tuttutted and the mask was restored close said reid but no cigar for you mr parker look after that cross now and give my love to claudia stern he hung up and i never spoke to him again i met phil isaacson at fanueil hall and from there we walked to the auction house it was clear that claudia stern had taken certain precautions for the sale of the map fragment a sign announced that the house was closed for a private sale and that all inquiries would be dealt with by phone i rang the bell and the door was opened by a big man in a dark suit who looked like the only thing he had ever bid on was the option of striking the first blow this is a private event gentlemen invitation only phil removed the invitations from his pocket i didnt know how he had acquired them they were printed on stiff cards and embossed in gold with the word stern and the date and time of the auction the doorman examined them then looked at both of us closely to make sure that we werent about to produce crosses and holy water and start sprinkling the place once he was satisfied he stepped aside to let us through not quite fort knox i said still more than one would usually encounter i have to confess i am rather looking forward to this phil registered at the desk and was handed a bidding paddle a young woman in black offered us refreshments from a tray in fact there were a lot of people in black present it looked like the launch of a new cure album or the reception after a goth wedding we both opted for orange juice then took the stairs up to the auction room as i had hoped there were still people milling about and we were lost in the throng i was surprised at the size of the crowd but even more surprised at the fact that most of them seemed relatively normal apart from their monochromatic dress sense although there were a few who looked like they might spend a little too much time alone in the dark pursuing unpleasant activities including one particularly nasty specimen with pointed nails and a black ponytail who was only one step away from wearing a tshirt announcing that he suckled at satans nipple maybe jimmy page will be here i said i should have brought along my copy of led zep iv jimmy who said phil i couldnt tell if he was kidding led zeppelin a popular beat combo your honor we took a seat at the back i kept my head down and looked through phils copy of the catalog most of the lots were books some of them very old there was a facsimile of the ars moriendi a kind of howto guide for those hoping to avoid damnation after death first published in translation by the englishman caxton in consisting of eleven blockbook woodcuts depicting the deathbed temptation of a dying man claudia stern clearly knew how to put together an impressive and enlightening sales package from the couple of paragraphs describing the lot i learned that the term shriven meant to be absolved of ones sins that therefore to be given short shrift meant being allowed little time to confess before death and that a good death did not necessarily preclude a violent end i also learned from a book of saints that saint denis the apostle of gaul and patron of france was decapitated by his tormentors but subsequently picked up his head and went for a walk with it which said a lot for saint deniss willingness to be a good sport and put on a show for the crowd some of the lots appeared to be linked to one another lot was a copy of the malleus maleficarum the hammer of witches that dated from the early sixteenth century and was said to have belonged to one johann geiler von kaisersberg a fireandbrimstone cathedral preacher in strasbourg while a copy of his sermons from was lot geilers sermons were illustrated by a witch engraving by hans baldung who studied under dürer and lot consisted of a series of erotic prints by baldung featuring an old manrepresenting deathfondling a young woman apparently a theme to which baldung returned repeatedly in his career there were also statues icons paintingsincluding the piece that i had witnessed being restored in the workshop now listed only as kutna hora th century artist unknownand a number of bone sculptures most of them were on display but they bore no resemblance to those that i had seen in stucklers book or in garcias apartment they were cruder and less finely crafted i was becoming quite the connoisseur of bone work people began to take their seats as one oclock approached i saw no sign of stuckler or murnos but eight women were seated at a table by the auctioneers podium each with a telephone now pressed to her ear its unlikely that any serious bids will come from the floor for the more esoteric items said phil the buyers wont want their identities to become known partly because of the value of some but mostly because such interests still remain open to misinterpretation you mean people will think theyre freaks yes but they are freaks yes as long as were agreed on that still i guessed that stuckler had someone on the floor watching the other bidders he would not want to be entirely cut off from what happened during the auction there would be others too somewhere among the crowd were those who called themselves believers i had warned phil about them although i believed that he at least was in no danger from them claudia stern appeared from a side door accompanied by an older man in a dandruffflecked black suit she took her place at the podium and the man stood beside her at a high table a huge ledger open before him in which to take down the details of the successful bidders and their bids ms stern rapped the podium with her gavel to quiet the crowd then welcomed us to the auction there was some preamble about payment and collection then the auction began the first lot was an item familiar to me by reputation an copy of richard laurences translation of the book of enoch twinned with a copy of byrons verse drama heaven and earth a mystery dating from the same year it aroused some mildly competitive bidding and went to an anonymous telephone bidder geilers copy of the malleus maleficarum went to a tiny elderly woman in a pink suit who looked grimly satisfied with her purchase i guess the rest of the coven should be pleased said phil know thine enemy exactly after five or six more items none of which created any great stir the twin brother of the door ape emerged from the office he was wearing white gloves and holding a silver box adorned with a cross it was almost identical to the ones i had seen in stucklers treasury but appeared in marginally better condition once its image was displayed on a screen beside ms stern there were fewer dents that i could see and the soft metal was barely scratched now said ms stern we come to what i feel will be for many the prize lot of this auction lot a fifteenthcentury box in bohemian silver cross inlay containing a fragment of vellum those of you with a particular interest in this lot were given ample opportunity to examine a small section of the fragment and to obtain independent verification of its age where necessary no further questions or objections will be entertained and the sale is final a casual visitor might have wondered what all the fuss was about given the relatively lowkey introduction but there was a definite heightening of tension in the room and a brief flurry of whispers i saw the women at the phones poised pens in hand i will open the bidding at said ms stern there were no takers she smiled indulgently i know that there is interest in this room and money to go with it nevertheless ill permit a slow start who will give me the satanist with the long nails raised his paddle and we were off the bids quickly climbed in increments of passing the original starting point and moving up to then eventually around the mark the bids from the floor dried up and ms stern turned most of her attention to the telephones where in a series of nods the bidding rose to then and eventually reached the mark the bids continued to climb finally passing until at there was a pause any further bids asked ms stern nobody moved im holding at she waited then rapped the gavel sharply sold for the silence was broken and the buzz of conversation resumed already people were drifting toward the door now that the main business of the afternoon was concluded ms stern sensing the same handed the gavel over to one of her assistants and the sale resumed with considerably less excitement than before ms stern exchanged a few words with the young woman who had taken the telephone bid then moved quickly toward the door of her office phil and i stood to leave and she glanced down as we did so her face briefly wrinkling in puzzlement as though she were trying to remember where she had seen me before her gaze moved on she nodded at phil and he smiled in return she likes you i said i have that whitebearded charm that disarms women maybe they just dont see you as threatening which makes me all the more dangerous you have a rich inner life phil thats the polite way of putting it we were at the first landing when ms stern appeared from a doorway below she waited for us to descend to her philip its good to see you again she turned a pale cheek for him to kiss then extended a hand toward me mr parker i wasnt aware that you were on the list i feared that your presence at this auction might make bidders uneasy were they to become aware of the nature of your profession i just came to keep an eye on phil in case he got carried away by the excitement and bid on a skull she invited us to join her for a drink we followed her through a door marked private and into a room cozily furnished with overstuffed couches and leather chairs catalogs for past and forthcoming auctions were piled neatly on two sideboards and fanned across an ornate coffee table ms stern opened a lavishly stocked bar cabinet and invited us to make our selection i had an alcoholfree becks just to be polite phil opted for red wine actually i was rather surprised you didnt make a bid yourself mr parker she said after all you were the one who came to me with that interesting bone sculpture im not a collector ms stern no i dont suppose you would be in fact you appear to be a rather harsh judge of collectors as testified to by the late mr garcias end have you discovered anything more about him a little anything youd like to share her expression was one of vague superiority capped with a wry grin whatever i had to tell her about garcia she figured she knew already he kept videos of dead and dying women i think he played an active role in their creation a ripple passed across ms sterns face and the angle of her grin was reduced slightly and you believe that his presence in new york was linked to the sedlec box auctioned today she said otherwise why would you be here id like to know who bought it i said a lot of people would like to know that she readjusted her sights and aimed her charm at phil its veneer was thin i got the impression that she was displeased both by his presence and by the fact that he had not come alone phil i think sensed it too all of this is of course off the record she said im not here in my journalistic capacity said phil you know youre always welcome here in any capacity she replied but she made it sound like a lie its just that in this case discretion was and is required she sipped her wine a thin trickle dripped down the glass it stained her chin slightly but she didnt appear to notice this was a very delicate sale mr parker the value of the lot was directly proportionate to the degree of secrecy surrounding its contents if the contents of the fragment were revealed before the saleif for example we had permitted potential bidders to examine the entire vellum in detail instead of just a portionthen it would have sold for far less than it did today the majority of bidders in the room were merely curiosity seekers faintly hoping to gain for themselves a link to an obscure occult myth the real money was far from here a total of six individuals went to the trouble of lodging deposits with us in order to be permitted to examine a cutting from the vellum none of whom were in the auction room today not one person was allowed to view even one of the symbols or drawings depicted upon it apart from you i looked at it as did two of my staff but frankly it was meaningless to me even were i able to interpret it i would still have required the other fragments to place it in context our concern was that someone already in possession of additional drawings might view our fragment and add its contents to what he or she knew are you aware of its provenance i said i understand that it was in dispute youre referring to the fact that it was believed to have been stolen from sedlec itself there is no proof that this was the same box the item came to us from a trusted european source we believed that it was real and so too did those who bid upon it today and youll keep the winning bid secret as best we can such things have a habit of filtering out eventually but we have no wish to make the buyer a target for unscrupulous men our reputation rests upon preserving the anonymity of our clients particularly given the nature of some of the items that pass through this house so youre aware that the buyer may be at risk or it may be that others are now at risk from the buyer she replied she was watching me carefully was the buyer a believer is that what youre telling me ms stern laughed exposing her slightly stained teeth im telling you nothing mr parker merely pointing out that there is more than one conclusion to be drawn all i can say for certain is that i will be a great deal happier once the box has left my possession thankfully it is small enough to be passed to the buyer without attracting undue attention we will be done with it by close of business what about you ms stern i said do you think you might be at risk after all youve seen it she drained a little more of her wine then stood we rose with her our time here was at an end i have been in this profession for a long time she said in truth i have seen some very strange items in the course of my dealings and i have met some equally strange individuals none of them has ever threatened me and none ever will i am well protected i wasnt about to doubt her everything about the house of stern made me uneasy it was like a trading post at the junction of two worlds are you a believer ms stern she put her glass down then slowly rolled up each sleeve of her blouse in turn her arms were unmarked all trace of good humor left her during the performance of the act i believe in a great many things mr parker some with very good reason one of those things is good manners of which you appear to have none in future philip id be grateful if you would check with me before you bring guests to my auctions i can only hope that your taste in companions is the only faculty that appears to have deserted you since last we met or else your newspaper will have to look elsewhere for its art criticism ms stern opened the door and waited for us to leave phil looked embarrassed when he said goodbye to her she didnt reply but she spoke to me as i followed phil from the room you should have stayed in maine mr parker she said you should have kept your head down and lived a quiet life then you would not have come to anyones attention youll forgive me for not trembling i said ive met people like the believers before no she replied you have not then she closed the door in my face i walked phil to his car sorry if i made life awkward for you i said as he closed his door and rolled down the window i never liked her anyway he said and her wine was corked tell me though does everybody react as badly to you as she did i reflected on the question actually i said as i left him that was pretty good for me angel and louis were waiting for me nearby they were eating oversized wraps and drinking bottled water in louiss lexus angel i noticed had half the worlds napkin production laid over his legs his feet the parts of the seat not covered by his body and the floor itself it was a slight case of overkill although some stray beansprouts and a couple of blobs of sauce had hit the napkins already so it paid to be cautious he must really love you if hes letting you eat in his car i said as i climbed in the back to talk to them louis acknowledged me with a nod but there was still something unspoken between us i was not about to broach the subject he would do so in his own time yeah its only taken like a decade said angel for the first five years he wouldnt even let me sit in his car weve come a long way louis was carefully wiping his fingers and face you got sauce on your tie i said he froze then lifted the silk in his fingers motherf he began before turning on angel thats your damn fault you wanted to eat so you made me want to eat damn i think you should shoot him i said helpfully i got some spare napkins you want them said angel louis snatched some from angels lap sprinkled water on them and tried to work on the stain swearing all the time if his enemies found out about his achilles heel we could be in real trouble i said to angel yeah they wouldnt even need guns just soy sauce maybe satay if they were really playing rough louis continued to swear at both of us and at the stain all at once it was quite a trick it was also good to see a flash of his old self it sold i said getting down to business two hundred and thirtyfive thousand dollars whats the houses cut asked angel phil reckoned fifteen percent of the purchase price angel looked impressed not bad did she tell you who the buyer was she wouldnt even tell me the identity of the seller reid figures the box was stolen from sedlec just hours after the discovery of the damage to the church then made its way to the auction house through a series of intermediaries its possible that the house of stern itself was the final purchaser in which case ms stern made quite a killing today as for the buyer stuckler wanted it badly hes obsessed and he almost certainly had the money to fund his obsession he told me that he was prepared to pay whatever it took under the circumstances he probably regarded it as a bargain so now what happens stuckler gets his fragment delivered to him and tries to combine it with whatever material he already has in an effort to locate the angel i dont think hes one of the believers so theyll make a move on him once he reveals himself as the purchaser maybe theyll offer to buy the information in which case theyll be rebuffed or hell try to strike a deal with them it could be that theyll simply take the direct approach stucklers house is pretty secure though and he has men with him murnos is probably good at his job but i still think theyre underestimating the people with whom theyre dealing i guess well just have to wait and see how it works out said louis probably badly for stuckler i said louis looked pained i was talking about my tie brightwell sat in an easy chair his eyes closed his fingers rhythmically extending and relaxing as though from the force of the blood being pumped through his body he rarely slept but he found that such moments of quiet served to replenish his energies he even dreamed in a sense replaying moments from his long life reliving old history ancient enmities lately he had been remembering sedlec and the death of the captain a party of hussite stragglers had intercepted them as they made their way toward prague and a stray arrow had found its mark in the captain while the others killed the attackers brightwell himself injured had clawed his way across the ground the grass already damp from the captains wound he had brushed the hair away from his leaders eyes exposing the white mote that seemed always to be changing its form at the periphery while the core remained ever constant so that looking at it was like peering at the sun through a glass there were those who hated to see it this reminder of all that had been lost but brightwell did not hesitate to look upon it when the opportunity arose it fueled his own resentment and gave him an added impetus to act against the divine the captain was struggling to breathe when he tried to speak blood bubbled up from his throat already brightwell could sense the separation beginning spirit disengaging itself from host as it prepared to wander in the darkness between worlds i will remember whispered brightwell i will never stop searching i will keep myself alive when the time comes for us to be reunited with one touch i will impart all that i have learned and remind you of all that you will have forgotten and of what you are the captain shuddered brightwell clasped the captains right hand and lowered his face to that of his beloved and amid the stink of blood and bile he felt the body give up its struggle brightwell rose and released the captains hand the statue was gone but he had learned of the abbots map from a young monk named karel brabe before he died somewhere the boxes were already being stored in secret places and karel brabes soul now dwelt in the prison of brightwells form but brabe had told brightwell something else before he died in the hope of ending the pain that brightwell was inflicting upon him you make a poor martyr brightwell had whispered to the young man brabe was still only a boy and brightwell knew great lore about the bodys capacities his fingers had torn deep wounds in the young novice and his nails were tearing at secret red places as they snipped at veins and punctured organs blood and words spilled from the boy in twin torrents the flawed nature of the fragments and a statue of bone itself concealing a secret a twin for the obscene relic they were seeking the search had taken so long so long brightwell opened his eyes the black angel stood before him it is nearly over said the angel we dont know for certain that he has it he has given himself away and parker after we have found my twin brightwell lowered his eyes it is him he said i am inclined to agree said the black angel if he is killed i will lose him again and you will find him again after all you found me some of the strength seemed to leave brightwell his shoulders sagged and for a moment he looked old and worn this body is betraying me he said i do not have the strength for another search the black angel touched his face with the tenderness of a lover it stroked his pitted skin the swollen flesh at his neck his soft dry lips if you must pass from this world then it will be my duty in turn to seek you out it said and remember i will not be alone this time there will be two of us to search for you chapter twentyone that night i spoke to rachel for the first time since shed left frank and joan were at a local charity fundraiser and rachel and sam were alone in the house i could hear music playing in the background overcome by happiness by the pernice brothers kings of the deceptively titled song rachel sounded frantically upbeat in the demented way common to those who are on heavy medication or who are trying desperately to keep themselves together in the face of imminent collapse she didnt ask me about the case but chose instead to tell me what sam had done that day and talk of how frank and joan were spoiling her she inquired about the dog then held the receiver to sams ear and i thought i heard the child respond to my voice i told her that i loved her and that i missed her i told her that i wanted her always to be safe and happy and i was sorry for the things that i had done to make her feel otherwise i told her that even if i wasnt around even if we couldnt be together i was thinking of her and i would never ever forget how important she was to me and i knew rachel was listening too and in this way i told her all the things that i could not say to her the dog woke me he wasnt barking merely whining softly his tail held low while he wagged it nervously as he did when he was trying to make amends for doing something wrong he cocked his head as he heard some noise that was inaudible to me and glanced at the window his mouth forming strange sounds that i had never heard from him before the room was filled with flickering light and now there was a crackling sound in the distance i smelled smoke and saw the glow of the flames eclipsed by the drapes on the window i left my bed and pulled the drapes apart the marshes were aflame already the engines from the scarborough fire department were converging on the conflagration and i could see one of my neighbors on the bridge that crossed the muddy land below my house perhaps trying to find the source of the blaze fearful that someone might be hurt the flames followed paths determined by the channels and were reflected in the still dark surface of the waters so that they appeared both to rise into the air and to ignite the depths i saw birds swooping against the redness panicked and lost in the night sky the thin branches of a bare tree had caught fire but the fire engines had now almost come to a halt and hoses would soon be trained upon the tree so perhaps it might yet be saved the damp of winter meant that the blaze would be easily contained but the burned grass would still be visible to all for months to come a charred reminder of the vulnerability of this place then the man on the bridge turned toward my house the flames lit his face and i saw that it was brightwell he stood unmoving silhouetted by fire his gaze fixed upon the window at which i stood the headlights of the fire trucks seemed to touch him briefly for he was suddenly luminous in his pallor his skin puckered and diseased as he turned away from the approaching engines and descended into the inferno i made the call early the next morning while louis and angel ate breakfast and tossed pieces of bagel for walter to catch they too had seen the figure on the bridge and if anything his appearance had deepened the sense of unease that now colored all of my relations with louis angel seemed to be acting as a buffer between us so that when he was present a casual observer might almost have judged that everything between us was normal or as normal as it had ever been which wasnt very normal at all the scarborough firemen had also witnessed brightwells descent into the burning marsh but they had searched in vain for any sign of him it was assumed that he had doubled back under the bridge and fled for the fire was being blamed upon him that much at least was true brightwell had set the fire as a sign that he had not forgotten me the smell of smoke and burned grass hung heavily in the air as i listened to the phone ringing on the other end of the line then a young woman answered can i speak to rabbi epstein please i asked may i tell him whos calling tell him its parker i heard the phone being put down there were young children shouting in the background accompanied by a timpani of silverware on bowls then the sound was drowned out by the closing of a door and an old mans voice came on the phone its been some time said epstein i thought youd forgotten me actually i rather hoped that youd forgotten me epsteins son had been killed by faulkner and his brood i had facilitated his revenge on the old preacher he owed me and he knew it i need to talk to your guest i said i dont think its a good idea why is that it risks drawing attention even i dont visit him unless its absolutely necessary how is he as well as can be expected under the circumstances he does not say a great deal ill need to see him anyway may i ask why i think i may have encountered an old friend of his a very old friend louis and i took an earlyafternoon flight down to new york the journey passing in near silence angel opted to stay at the house and look after walter there was no sign in portland or new york of brightwell or of anyone else who might have been watching us we took a cab to the lower east side in heavy rain the traffic snarled up and the streets thronged with glistening commuters heartily weary of the long winter but the rain began to ease as we crossed houston street and by the time we neared our destination the sun was spilling through holes in the clouds creating great diagonal columns of light that held their form until they disintegrated on the roofs and walls of the buildings epstein was waiting for me in the orensanz center the old synagogue on the lower east side where i had first met him after the death of his son as usual there were a couple of young men around him who clearly had not been brought along for their conversational skills so here we are again said epstein he looked the same as he always did small graybearded and slightly saddened as though despite his efforts at optimism the world had somehow already contrived to disappoint him that day you seem to like meeting people here i said its public yet private when necessary and more secure than it appears you look tired im having a difficult week youre having a difficult life if i were a buddhist i might wonder what sins you had committed in your previous incarnations to justify the problems you appear to be encountering in this one the room in which we stood was suffused with a soft orange glow the sunlight falling heavily through the great window that dominated the empty synagogue lent added weight and substance by some hidden element that had joined with it in its passage through the glass the noise of traffic was muted and even our footsteps on the dusty floor sounded distant and muffled as we walked toward the light louis remained by the door flanked by epsteins minders so tell me said epstein what has happened to bring you here i thought of all that reid and bartek had told me i recalled brightwell the feel of his hands upon me as this wretched being reached out to me and tried to draw me to himself and the look on his face before he gave himself to the flames that sickening feeling of vertigo returned and my skin prickled with the memory of an old burning and i remembered the preacher faulkner trapped in his prison cell his children dead and his hateful crusade at an end i saw again his hands reaching out for me through the bars felt the heat radiating from his aged wiry body and heard once more the words that he spoke to me before spitting his foul poison into my mouth what you have faced until now is as nothing compared to what is approaching the things that are coming for you are not even human i could not tell how it came to be but faulkner had a knowledge of hidden things reid had suggested that perhaps faulkner the traveling man the child killer adelaide modine the arachnoid torturer pudd maybe even caleb kylethe bogeyman who had haunted my grandfathers lifewere all linked even if some of them were unaware of the ties that bound them to one another theirs was a human evil a product of their own flawed natures faulty genetics might have played a part in what they became or childhood abuse tiny blood vessels in the brain corrupting or little neurons misfiring could have contributed to their debased natures but free will also played a part for i did not doubt that a time came for most of those men and women when they stood over another human being and held a life in the palms of their hands a fragile thing glowing hesitantly beating furiously its claim upon the world and made a decision to snuff it out to ignore the cries and the whimpers and the slow descending cadence of the final breaths until at last the blood stopped pumping and instead flowed slowly from the wounds pooling around them and reflecting their faces in its deep sticky redness it was there that true evil lay in the moment between thought and action between intent and commission when for a fleeting instant there was still the possibility that one might turn away and refuse to appease the dark gaping desire within perhaps it was in this moment that human wretchedness encountered something worse something deeper and older that was both familiar in the resonance that it found within our souls yet alien in its nature and its antiquity an evil that predated our own and dwarfed it with its magnitude there are as many forms of evil in the world as there are men to commit them and its gradations are near infinite but it may be that in truth it all draws from the same deep well and there are beings that have supped from it for far longer than any of us could ever imagine a woman told me of a book a part of the biblical apocrypha i said i read it it spoke of the corporeality of angels of the possibility that they could take upon themselves a human form and dwell in it hidden and unseen epstein was so silent and still that i could no longer hear him breathe and the slow rise and fall of his chest appeared to have ceased entirely the book of enoch he said after a time you know the great rabbi simeon ben jochai in the years following the crucifixion of jesus christ cursed those who believed in its contents it was judged to be a later misinterpretation of genesis because of correspondences between the two texts although some scholars have suggested that enoch is actually the earlier work and is therefore the more definitive account but then the apocryphal worksboth the deuterocanonical books such as judith tobit and baruch that follow the old testament and the excised later gospels like those of thomas and bartholemeware a minefield for scholars enoch is probably more difficult than most it is a genuinely unsettling piece of writing with profound implications for the nature of evil in the world it is hardly surprising that both christians and jews found it easier to suppress it than to try to examine its contents in the light of what they already believed and thereby attempt to reconcile the two views would it have been so difficult for them to see the rebellion of the angels as being linked to the creation of man that the pride of the angels was wounded by being forced to acknowledge the wonder of this new being that they perhaps also envied its physicality and the pleasure it could take in its appetites most of all in the joy that it found by joining with the body of another they lusted they rebelled and they fell some descended into the pit and others found a place here and at last took upon themselves the form that they had so long desired an interesting speculation dont you think but what if there are those who believe it who are convinced that they are these creatures is that why you want to see kittim again i think i said slowly that i have become a beacon for foul things and the worst of them are now closer than they have ever been before my life is being torn asunder once i could have turned away and they might have passed me by but its too late for that now i want to see the one you have to confirm to myself that i am not insane and that such things can and do exist perhaps they do exist said epstein and maybe kittim is the proof but we have encountered resistance from him he very quickly built up a tolerance to the drugs even sodium pentothal no longer has any significant effect under its influence he merely rants but we have given him a strong dose in anticipation of your visit and it may allow you a few minutes of clarity from him do we have far to go i asked go said epstein go where it took me a moment to understand hes here it was little more than a glorified cell accessed through a utility closet in the basement the closet was encased in metal and the back wall doubled as a door accessed by both a key and an electronic combination it swung inward to reveal a soundproofed area divided in two by steel mesh cameras kept a constant vigil on the area behind the wire which was furnished with a bed a sofa and a small table and chair there were no books that i could see a tv had been fixed to the far corner of the wall on the other side of the barrier and as far away from the cell as possible there was a remote control device for it on the floor beside the sofa a figure lay on the bed wearing only a pair of gray shorts his limbs were like bare branches with every muscle visible to the eye he looked emaciated thinner than any man that i had ever seen before his face was turned to the wall and his knees were drawn up to his chest he was almost bald apart from a few stray strands of hair that clung to his purple flaking skull the texture of his skin reminded me of brightwell and the swelling that afflicted him they were both beings in the process of slow decay my god i said what happened to him he refused to eat said epstein we tried to forcefeed him but it was too difficult eventually we came to the conclusion that he was trying to kill himself and well we were prepared to see him die except he didnt die he merely grows a little weaker with every week that goes by he sometimes takes water but nothing more mostly he sleeps how long has this been going on months the man on the bed stirred then turned over so that he was facing us his skin had contracted on his face so that the hollows in the bone were clearly visible he reminded me of a concentration camp inmate except that his catlike eyes betrayed no hint of weakness or inner decay instead they glittered emptily like cheap jewels kittim he had emerged in south carolina as an enforcer for a racist named roger bowen and a link between the preacher faulkner and the men who would have freed him if they could but bowen had underestimated his employee and had failed to understand the true balance of power in their relationship bowen was little more than kittims puppet and kittim was older and more corrupt than bowen could ever have imagined his name hinted at his nature for the kittim were said to be a host of dark angels who waged war against men and god whatever dwelt within kittim was ancient and hostile and worked for its own ends kittim reached for a plastic beaker of water and drank from it the liquid spilling onto the pillow and sheets he raised himself until he was seated on the edge of the bed he stayed like that for a time as though building up the strength that he needed then stood he wavered slightly and seemed about to fall but instead shuffled across the cell toward the wire his bony fingers reached out and gripped the strands as he forced his face against the mesh he was so thin that for an instant i almost thought he might try to press his face between them his eyes shifted first to louis then to me come to gloat he said his voice was very soft but betrayed no hint of his bodys decay you dont look so good said louis but then you never looked good i see you still bring your monkey with you wherever you go perhaps you could train him to walk behind you holding an umbrella still the same old joker i said you know youre never going to make friends that way thats why youre down here away from all the other children i am surprised to see you alive he said surprised yet grateful grateful why would you be grateful i was hoping said kittim that you might kill me why i replied so you canwander kittims head tilted slightly and he looked at me with new interest beside me epstein was watching us both carefully perhaps he said what would you know of it i know a little i was hoping you could help me to learn more kittim shook his head i dont think so i shrugged then weve nothing more to say i would have thought that youd be glad of a little stimulation though it must get lonely down here and dull still at least you have a tv ricki will be coming on soon and then after that you can watch your stories kittim stepped away from the wire and sat down once again on his bed i want to leave here he said thats not going to happen i want to die then why havent you tried to kill yourself they watch me thats not answering the question kittim extended his arms and turned his hands so that the palms faced upward he looked at his wrists for a long time as though contemplating the wounds that he might inflict upon them were he able i dont think you can kill yourself i said i dont think that choice is open to you you cant end your own existence even temporarily isnt that what you believe kittim didnt reply i persisted i can tell you things i said what things i can tell you of a statue made of silver hidden in a vault i can tell you of twin angels one lost one searching dont you want to hear kittim did not look up as he spoke yes he whispered tell me an exchange i said first who is brightwell kittim thought for a moment brightwell isnot like me he is older more cautious more patient he wants what does he want revenge against whom everyone everything is he alone no he serves a higher power it is incomplete and seeks its other half you know this where is it hidden it had forgotten what it was but brightwell found it and awoke what lay within now like all of us it cloaks itself and it searches and what will happen when it finds its twin it will hunt and it will kill and what will brightwell get in return for helping it power victims kittim lifted his gaze from the floor and looked unblinkingly at me and you how can you know that i am aware of him he thinks that you are like us but that you fell away only one did not follow brightwell believes that he has found that one in you and what do you believe i do not care i wanted only to explore you he lifted his right hand and stretched his fingers twisting them in the air as though it were flesh and blood through which his nails were slowly tearing now tell me he said what do you know of these things they call themselves believers some are just ambitious men and some are convinced that they are more than that theyre looking for the statue and theyre close to finding it they are assembling fragments of a map and soon they will have all the information that they need they even built a shrine here in new york in readiness to receive it kittim took another sip of water so they are close he said after all this time he did not seem overjoyed at the news as i watched him the truth of reids words became clearer to me evil is selfinterested and ultimately without unity whatever his true nature kittim had no desire to share his pleasures with others he was a renegade i have one more question i said one more what does brightwell do with the dying he touches his mouth to their lips why i thought i detected a note of what might have been envy in kittims voice as he answered souls said kittim brightwell is a repository of souls he lowered his head and lay down once more on his bed then closed his eyes and turned his face to the wall the woodrow was a nondescript place there was no doorman in green livery and white gloves to guard its residents privacy and its atrium was furnished with the kind of hardwearing green vinyl chairs beloved of struggling dentists everywhere the outer doors were unsecured but the inner doors were locked to their right was an intercom and three lines of bells each with a faded nameplate beside it philip bosworths name was not among those listed although a number of the plates were blank maybe rosss information was wrong said louis its the fbi not the cia i said anyway whatever else i can say about him ross doesnt screw around when it comes to information bosworth is here somewhere i tried each of the anonymous bells in turn one was answered by a woman who appeared to be very old very badtempered and very very deaf the second was answered by someone who could have been her older deafer and even more cantankerous brother the third bell rang in the apartment of a young woman who might well have been a hooker judging by the confusion about an appointment that followed ross said the apartment was owned by bosworths folks suggested louis maybe he has a different last name maybe i conceded i ran my finger down the lines of bells stopping halfway down the third row but maybe not the name on the bell was rint just like that of the man responsible for the reconstruction of the sedlec ossuary in the nineteenth century it was the kind of joke that could come only from someone who had once tried to dig up the floor of a french monastery i rang the bell seconds later a wary voice emerged from the speaker box hello my name is charlie parker im a private investigator im looking for philip bosworth theres nobody here by that name assistant sac ross told me how to find you if youre concerned call him first i heard what might have been a snicker then the connection was terminated that went well said louis at least we know where he is we stood outside the closed doors nobody came in and no one went out after ten minutes went by i tried the rint bell again and the same voice answered still here i said what do you want to talk about sedlec to talk about the believers i waited the door buzzed open come on up we entered the lobby there was a blue semicircular fitting on the ceiling above us concealing the cameras that watched the entrance and the lobby two elevators their doors painted gunmetal gray stood before us there was a key slot in the wall between them so that only residents could access them as we approached the elevator on the left opened the top half of the interior was mirrored with gold trim the bottom half was upholstered in old yet wellmaintained red velvet we stepped inside the doors closed and the elevator rose without either of us touching a button clearly the woodrow was a more sophisticated residence than it appeared from outside the elevator stopped on the top floor and the doors opened onto a small windowless carpeted area across from us was a set of double wood doors leading to the penthouse apartment there was another blue surveillance bubble mounted on the ceiling above the apartment door opened the man who greeted us was not what i had expected he wore blue chinos and a light blue ralph lauren shirt and there were tassels on his tan penny loafers the shirt was buttoned wrongly though and the trousers were pressed and without a single wrinkle indicating that he had just dressed himself in a hurry from his closet mr bosworth he nodded i put his age at about forty but his hair was graying his features were newly lined with pain and one of his blue eyes was paler than the other as he stepped aside to admit us he shuffled slightly as though suffering from pins and needles in one or both feet he held the handle of the door with his left hand while his right remained fixed in the pocket of his chinos he did not offer to shake my hand or louiss instead he simply closed the door behind us and walked slowly to an easy chair holding on to its armrest with his left hand as he lowered himself down his right hand still did not leave his pocket the room in which we now stood was impressively modern with a pretty good view of the river through a row of five long windows the carpet was white and the seating areas furnished entirely with black leather there was a widescreen tv and a dvd player in a console against one wall and a series of black bookcases stretched from floor to ceiling most of the shelves were empty apart from a few pieces of pottery and antique statuary that were lost in their minimalist surroundings a large smokedglass dining table stood to my left surrounded by ten chairs it looked like it had never been used beyond it i could see a pristine kitchen every surface gleaming to the left was a hallway presumably leading to the bedrooms and bathroom beyond it was like a show apartment or one that was on the point of being vacated by its current owner bosworth was waiting for us to speak he was clearly a sick man his right leg had already spasmed once since we had arrived causing him some distress and there was a tremor in his left arm thank you for seeing us i said this is my colleague louis bosworths eyes flicked between us he licked at his lips then reached for a plastic tumbler of water on the small glass table beside him carefully ensuring that he had it firmly in his grip before he raised it to his mouth he sipped awkwardly from a plastic straw then returned the tumbler to its table i spoke to rosss secretary he said once he had drained the last of the water she confirmed your story otherwise you would not be here now and you would instead be under the supervision of this buildings security guards while you waited for the police to arrive i dont blame you for being cautious thats very magnanimous of you im sure he snickered again but the laughter was directed less at me than at himself and his debilitated condition a kind of double bluff that failed to convince anyone in the room sit he said gesturing to the leather sofa on the other side of the coffee table its been some time since ive had the pleasure of company other than that of doctors and nurses or concerned members of my own family may i ask what youre suffering from i already had some idea the tremors the paralysis the spasms were all symptoms of ms disseminated sclerosis he said late onset it was diagnosed last year and has progressed steadily from the first in fact my doctors say the speed of my degeneration is quite alarming the vision in my right eye was the first obvious symptom but since then i have endured the loss of postural sense in my right arm weakness in both of my legs vertigo tremors sphincter retention and impotence quite a cocktail of miseries dont you think as a result i have decided to leave my apartment and abandon myself permanently to the care of others im sorry its interesting said bosworth seemingly ignoring me completely only this morning i was considering the source of my condition a metabolic upset an allergic reaction on the part of my nervous system or an infection from some outside agent i feel it is a malevolent illness i sometimes picture it in my head as a white creeping thing extending tendrils through my body implanted within to paralyze and ultimately kill me i wonder if perhaps i unwittingly exposed myself to some agent and it responded by colonizing my system but that is the stuff of madness is it not agent ross would be pleased to hear it i think he could pass it on to his superiors reassuring them that they were right to end my career in the manner in which they did they said that you desecrated a church excavated not desecrated i needed to confirm a suspicion and what was the result i was proved right what was the suspicion bosworth raised his left hand and waved it gently from side to side in a slow deliberate movement perhaps to distinguish the gesture from the tremors that continuously shook the limb you first after all you came to me once again i was drawn into the game of feeding information to another without exposing too much of what i knew or what i thought might be true i had not forgotten reids warning from the night at the great lost bear that somewhere there was one who believed that a black angel dwelt within him and so i did not mention the involvement of reid and bartek or the approaches made to me by stuckler instead i told bosworth about alice and garcia and the discoveries made in the williamsburg building i revealed most of what i knew about the map fragments and sedlec and the believers i talked of the auction and the painting in claudia sterns workshop and the book of enoch and i spoke of brightwell all very interesting he said when i had finished youve learned a lot in a short time he rose painfully from his chair and went to a drawer at the base of one of his bookshelves he opened it retrieved what was inside and placed it on the table between us it was part of a map drawn in red and blue inks upon thin yellowed paper and mounted on a piece of protective board in the top righthand corner was a black foot with taloned toes the margins were filled with microscopic writing and a series of symbols it was similar in content to the fragments i had seen in stucklers treasury its a copy said bosworth not an original where did this come from san galgano in italy said bosworth as he resumed his seat the monastery at san galgano was one of the places to which a fragment was sent its no more than a beautiful ruin now but in its time its façade was noted for the purity of its lines and it was said that its monks were consulted during the construction of the siena cathedral nevertheless it was subject to repeated attacks by florentine mercenaries its revenues were plundered by its own abbots and the renaissance in italy led to a falling off in the number of those willing to answer the monastic call by there were only five monks left there by there was only one and he lived as a hermit when he died the san galgano fragment was found among his possessions its provenance was not understood initially and it was retained as a relic of a holy mans life inevitably rumors of its existence spread and an order came from rome that it should be entrusted to the care of the vatican immediately but by that time a copy had already been made subsequently further duplicates were created so the san galgano section of the map is in the possession of any number of individuals by now the original was lost on the journey to rome the monks transporting it were attacked and it was said that rather than allow it to be seized along with their money and possessions they burned it in a fit of panic and so all that remain are copies such as this one this then is the only piece of the sedlec map to which many people have enjoyed access and the only clue that existed for many years as to the nature of the directions to the statues resting place the original creator of the map invented a simple but perfectly adequate means of ensuring that the location contained within it remained unknowable without all the parts of the document most of the writing and symbols are merely decorative and the drawing of the church refers simply to bernards concept of how such places of worship should look it is an idealized church and nothing more the real meat as youre no doubt aware is here bosworth pointed to a combination of roman numerals and a single letter d in one corner its simple like any treasure map worth its salt its based around distances from a set point but without all of the distances involved its useless and even with all of them to hand you still need to know the location of the central reference point all the boxes all of the fragments are ultimately meaningless unless you have knowledge of the location in question in that sense the map might be regarded as a clever piece of sleight of hand after all if people were busy searching for what they believed to be crucial clues then they would be less likely to try to find the thing itself each fragment does however offer one piece of useful information look again at the copy particularly at the imp in the center i stared at the document and at the small demonic character bosworth was pointing at now that i looked more closely i could see from its skull that it was a very crude version of the bone statue that stuckler had shown to me barely more than a stick drawing there was lettering visible around it forming a circle that enclosed the figure quantum in me est said bosworth as much as in me lies i dont understand its just a drawing of the black angel no its not bosworth practically seethed at my inability to make the connections that he had made see here and here the trembling index finger of his left hand brushed the page these are human bones bosworth was right it was not a stick figure but a bone figure more care had been taken with the illustration than first appeared the whole illustration consists of human bones bones from the ossuary at sedlec this is a depiction of the recreation of the black angel it is the bone statue that conceals the actual location of the vault but most of those who have sought the angel wrongfooted by their obsession with the fragments and dismissive of this fragment because of its relative ubiquity have been unable to acknowledge that possibility and those who have correctly interpreted its message have kept the knowledge to themselves while widening their search to include the replica but i made the connection and if this man brightwell is clever enough then he has made it too the statue has been missing since the last century although it was rumored to be in italy before world war ii broke out since then there has been no trace of it the believers are not looking merely for the fragments but for those who possess the fragments in the hope that they may also have in their possession the bone sculpture that is why garcia recreated it in his apartment it is not just a symbol it is the key to the thing itself i tried to take in all that he had said why are you telling us this said louis it was the first time he had spoken since we entered bosworths apartment because i want it found said bosworth i want to know that it is in the world but i can no longer find it for myself i have money if you find it i will have it brought to me and ill pay you well for your trouble you never explained why you dug up the floor of the monastery at septfons i said there should have been a fragment there said bosworth i traced its path it took me five years of hunting rumors and halftruths but i did it like so many treasures it was moved for its own protection during the second world war it went to switzerland but was returned to france once it was safe to do so it should have been beneath the floor but it was not someone had taken it away again and i know where it went i waited it went to the czech republic to the newly founded monastery at novy dvur perhaps as a gift a token of their respect for the efforts of the czech monks to keep the faith under the communists that has always been the great flaw in the cistercians stewardship of the fragments over the last six hundred years their willingness to entrust them to one another to expose them briefly to the light that is why the fragments have slowly come into the possession of others the sedlec fragment auctioned yesterday is i believe the fragment transported from septfons to the czech republic it did not belong in sedlec sedlec has not existed as a cistercian community for nearly two centuries so someone put it there bosworth nodded eagerly someone wanted it to be found he said someone wants to draw attention to sedlec why because sedlec is not merely an ossuary sedlec is a trap then bosworth played his final card he opened the second folder revealing copies of ornate drawings each depicting the black angel from different angles you know of rint he asked you used his name as a pseudonym thats how we found your bell he was the man who redesigned the ossuary in the nineteenth century i bought these in prague they were part of a case of documents linked to rint and his work owned by one of rints descendants who i found living in near penury i paid him well for the papers much more than they were worth in the hope that they would provide more conclusive proof than they ultimately did rint created these drawings of the black angel and according to the seller there were once many more than this but they were lost or destroyed these drawings were rints obsession he was a haunted man later others copied them and they became popular among specialized collectors with an interest in the myth but rint made the originals the question was how did rint come to create such detailed drawings were they entirely products of his own imagination or did he see something during his restoration that allowed him to base his illustrations upon it i believe that the latter is the case for rint was clearly greatly troubled in later life and perhaps the bone sculpture still rests in sedlec my illness prevents me from investigating further which is why i am sharing this knowledge with you bosworth must have seen the expression on my face change how could he have failed to do so it was all clear now rint had not glimpsed the bone sculpture because the bone sculpture had long been lost according to stuckler it spent two centuries in italy hidden from sight until his father discovered it no rint saw the original the black angel rendered in silver he saw it in sedlec when he was restoring the ossuary bosworth was right the map was a kind of ruse because the black angel had never left sedlec all those centuries it had remained hidden there and at last both stuckler and the believers were confident that all the information they needed to recover it was within their grasp and i knew also why martin reid had given me the small silver cross i rubbed my fingers across it where it rested alongside my keys my thumb traced its lines and the letters etched on its rear in a cruciform shape s l e c d what is it said bosworth we have to go i said bosworth stood and tried to stop me but his weak legs and wasted arm made him no match for me you know he said you know where it is tell me he tried to raise himself but we were already making for the door tell me screamed bosworth forcing himself up i saw him stumbling toward me his face contorted but by then the elevator doors were closing i caught a last glimpse of him then we were descending i got to the lobby just as a pair of uniformed men emerged from the doorway to the right of the elevator bank inside i could see tv monitors and telephones they stopped as soon as they saw louis more precisely they stopped as soon as they saw louiss gun down he said they hit the ground i went past him and opened the door he backed out then we were on the street running fast melting into the crowd as the last minutes ticked away and the believers commenced the slaughter of their enemies chapter twentytwo they first appeared as shadows on the wall drifting with the night clouds following the moonlight then shadow became form blackgarbed raiders their eyes distended and their features hidden by the nightvision goggles that they wore all were armed and as they scaled the walls their weapons hung down from their backs the combination of mutated eyes and slim stingerlike black barrels making each seem more insect than man a boat waited offshore sitting silently upon the waters alert for the signal to approach if required and a blue mercedes stood beneath a copse of trees its sole occupant pale and corpulent his green eyes unencumbered by artificial lenses brightwell had no need for them his eyes had long been comfortable with darkness the raiders descended into the garden then separated two moved toward the house the others to the gate but at a prearranged signal all stopped and surveyed the dwelling seconds ticked by but still they did not move they were four black sentinels like the burned remains of dead trees enviously regarding the slow coming of spring inside the house murnos sat before a bank of tv monitors he was reading a book and the figures surrounding the property might have been interested to see that it was a concordance to enoch its contents fueled the beliefs of those who threatened his employer and murnos felt compelled to learn more about them in order to understand his enemy they shall be called upon earth evil spirits and on earth shall be their habitation murnos had grown increasingly uneasy with stucklers grand obsession and recent events had done nothing to assuage his concerns the purchase of the latest fragment at auction was a mistake it would draw attention to what was already in stucklers possession and murnos did not share his employers belief that an agreement could be reached with those others who were also seeking the silver statue evil spirits shall they be upon earth and the spirits of the wicked shall they be called beside him a second man watched the screens his gaze flicking carefully across each one there was a single window in the room overlooking the garden murnos had warned stuckler about it in the past in murnoss opinion the room was unsuited to its primary purpose he believed that a security room should be virtually impregnable capable of being used as a panic room if necessary but stuckler was a man of many contradictions he wanted men around him and he desired the impression of security but murnos did not think that stuckler really considered himself to be at risk he was his mothers creature in every way the knowledge of his fathers strength and the nature of his sacrifice instilled in him from an early age so that it verged on the sacrilegious for him to indulge in fear or doubt or even concern for others murnos hated the old womans occasional visits stuckler would send a limousine for her and she would arrive with her private nurse wrapped in blankets even in the height of summer her eyes shaded by sunglasses all year round an old crone who persisted in living while taking no joy in any aspect of the world around her not even in her son for murnos could see her contempt for stuckler could hear it in her every utterance as she looked upon this prissy little man softened by indulgence his weaknesses redeemed only by his willingness to please her and his hero worship of a dead father so intense that occasionally the hatred and envy that underpinned it would bubble through contorting him with rage and transforming him utterly no food shall they eat and they shall be thirsty they shall be concealed and shall rise up against the sons of men he looked at burke his coworker burke was good stuckler had initially balked at paying him what he asked but murnos had insisted that burke was worth it the others too had all been approved by murnos even if they were not quite in burkes league and still murnos believed that they were not enough a light began to flicker rhythmically on a panel on the wall accompanied by an insistent beeping the gate said burke someones opening the gate it wasnt possible the gate could only be opened from within or by one of the three control devices contained in the cars and all of the vehicles were on the property murnos checked the monitors and thought for an instant he saw a figure beside the gate and another leaving a copse of trees for they come forth during the days of slaughter and destruction and then the screens went dead murnos was already on his feet when the window beside them was blown apart burke took the brunt of the first fusillade shielding murnos for valuable seconds and enabling him to get to the door he scrambled through as bullets pinged off metal and pockmarked the plaster on the walls stuckler was upstairs in his room but the noise had woken him from his sleep murnos could already hear him shouting as he entered the main hallway somewhere in the house another window shattered a small man with a gun appeared from the kitchen barely more than a shadow in the gloom and murnos fired at him forcing him back he kept firing as he made for the stairs there was a gothicstyle window on the landing and murnos saw a shape pass across it ascending the outside wall toward the second floor he tried to shout a warning as he heard more shots but he stumbled on the stairs and the words were lost in an instant of shock murnos gripped the banister to lift himself up and his hands slid wetly upon the wood there was blood on his fingers he looked down at his shirt and saw the stain spreading across it and with it came the pain he raised his gun seeking a target and felt a second impact at his thigh his back arched in agony his head striking hard against the stairs and his eyes briefly squeezing shut as he tried to control the pain when he opened them again there was a woman staring at him from above the shape of her clearly visible beneath her dark clothing her eyes blue and hateful she had a gun in her hand instinctively murnos closed his eyes again as death came brightwell drove to the front of the house and entered the grounds he followed miss zahn down to the cellar through the racks of wine and into the treasury that now lay open to him above him loomed the great black statue of bone stuckler was kneeling before it dressed in blue silk pajamas there was some blood in his hair but he was otherwise unhurt three pieces of vellum were handed to brightwell taken by his raiders from the shattered display case he handed them over to miss zahn but his gaze was fixed upon the statue his head came almost to the level of its rib cage the scapulae fused to the sternum at the front and to each other at the back like an armored plate he drew back his hand and punched hard against the mass of bone the sternum cracked under the impact no said stuckler what are you doing brightwell struck again stuckler tried to stand but miss zahn forced him to stay down youll destroy it said stuckler its beautiful stop the sternum shattered under the force of brightwells blows the skin on his knuckles and the back of his hand had been torn by the sharp bone but he did not seem to notice instead he reached into the hollow that he had created and explored it his arm buried within the statue almost to the elbow and his face tensed with the effort until his features suddenly relaxed and he withdrew his hand there was a small silver box clutched in his fist this one entirely unadorned he opened his hand and displayed the box to stuckler then carefully removed the lid inside was a single piece of vellum perfectly preserved he handed it to miss zahn to unfold the numbers the maps he said to stuckler they were all incidental in their way what mattered was the bone statue and what it contained stuckler was weeping he reached for a shard of shattered black bone and held it in his hand you did not understand your own acquisitions herr stuckler said brightwell quantum in me est the details lie in the fragments but the truth lies here he threw the empty box to stuckler who touched his fingers to the interior in disbelief all this time he said the knowledge was within my grasp all this time brightwell took the final piece of fragment from miss zahn he examined the drawing upon it and the writing above the drawing was architectural in nature showing a church and what appeared to be a network of tunnels beneath it his brow furrowed then he began to laugh it never left he said almost in wonder tell me said stuckler please allow me that much brightwell squatted and showed stuckler the illustration then rose and nodded to miss zahn stuckler did not look up as the muzzle of the gun touched the back of his head its caress almost tender all this time he said all this time then time what was and what was yet to be came to an end and a new world was born for him two hours later reid and bartek were walking back to their car they had stopped to eat at a bar just south of hartford their last meal together before they were due to leave the country and reid had indulged himself as was sometimes his wont he was now rubbing his belly and complaining that chili nachos always gave him gas nobody made you eat them said his companion i cant resist them said reid theyre just so alien barteks chevy was parked on the road beneath one of a long line of bare trees that filigreed the cars beneath in shadow part of a small forest that bordered green fields and a distant development of new condos i mean reid continued no decent society would even con a shape moved against one of the trees and in the fraction of a second between awareness and response reid could have sworn that it descended down the tree trunk headfirst like a lizard clinging to the bark run he said he pushed hard at bartek forcing him into the woods then turned to face the approaching enemy he heard bartek call his name and he shouted run i said run you bastard there was a man facing him a small piefaced figure in a black jacket and faded denims reid recognized him from the bar and wondered how long they had been watched by their enemies the man did not have any weapon that reid could see come on then said reid ill have you he raised his fists and moved sideways in case the man tried to get past him to follow bartek but he stopped short as he became aware of a stench close by priest said the soft voice and reid felt the energy drain from him he turned around brightwell was inches from his face reid opened his mouth to speak and the blade entered him so swiftly that all that emerged from his throat was a pained grunt he heard the small man moving into the undergrowth following bartek a second figure accompanied him a woman with long dark hair you failed said brightwell he drew reid to him embracing him with his left arm even as the knife continued to force its way upward his lips touched reids the priest tried to bite him but brightwell did not relinquish his hold and he kissed reids mouth as the priest shuddered and died against him miss zahn and the small man returned after half an hour reids body already lay concealed in the undergrowth we lost him she said no matter said brightwell we have bigger fish to fry he stared out into the darkness as though hoping that despite his words he might yet have the chance to deal with the younger man then when that hope proved misplaced he walked with the others back to their car and they drove south they had one more call to make after a time a thin figure emerged from the woods bartek followed the line of the trees until he found at last the splayed figure cast aside amid stones and rotten wood and he gathered the body to him and said the prayers for the dead over his departed friend neddo was seated in the little office at the back of his store it was almost dawn and the wind outside rattled the fire escapes he was hunched over his desk carefully using a small brush to clean the dust from an ornate bone brooch the door to his place of work opened but he did not hear it above the howling of the wind and so engrossed was he in the delicate task before him that he failed to notice the sound of soft footsteps moving through his store it was only when the curtain moved and a shadow fell across him that he looked up brightwell stood before him behind brightwell was a woman her hair was very dark her shirt was open to her breasts and her skin was alive with tattooed eyes youve been telling tales mr neddo said brightwell we indulged you for too long he shook his head sadly and the great wattle of flesh at his neck wobbled and rippled neddo put the brush down his spectacles had a second pair of lenses attached to them by a small metal frame in order to magnify the piece upon which he was working the lenses distorted brightwells face making his eyes seem bigger his mouth fuller and the redandpurple mass above his collar more swollen than ever so that it appeared to be on the verge of an eruption a prelude to some great spray of blood and matter that would emerge from deep within brightwell burning like acid everything with which it came into contact i did what was right said neddo if only for the first time what were you hoping for absolution perhaps on earth they shall never obtain peace and remission of sin brightwell recited for they shall not rejoice in their offspring they shall behold the slaughter of their beloved shall lament for the destruction of their sons and shall petition for ever but shall not obtain mercy and peace i know enoch as well as you but i am not like you i believe in the communion of saints the forgiveness of sinners brightwell stepped aside allowing the woman space to enter neddo had heard about her but had never seen her without foreknowledge she might have appeared beautiful to him now facing her at last he felt only fear and a terrible tiredness that prevented him from even attempting escape the resurrection of the body neddo continued his speech growing faster and life everlasting amen you should have remained faithful said brightwell to you i know what you are i turned to you out of anger out of grief i was mistaken neddo commenced a new prayer oh my god i am heartily sorry for all my sins because they have offended thee the woman was examining neddos tools the scalpels the small blades neddo could hear her working her way through them but he did not look at her instead he remained intent upon completing his act of contrition until brightwell spoke and the words died in neddos mouth we have found it said brightwell neddo stopped praying even now with death so close and his protests of repentance still wet upon his lips he could not keep the wonder from his voice truly he said yes where was it i would like to know sedlec said brightwell it never left the precincts of the ossuary neddo removed his glasses he was smiling all of the searching and it was there all along his smile grew sad i should like to have seen it he said to have looked upon it after all that i have heard and all that i have read the woman found a rag she soaked it with water from a jug then stepped behind neddo and forced the material into his mouth he tried to struggle pulling at her hands and her hair but she was too strong brightwell joined her pushing neddos hands down into the chair his weight and strength keeping the smaller mans body rigid the cold of the scalpel touched neddos forehead and the woman began to cut chapter twentythree we flew into prague via london arriving late in the afternoon stuckler was dead we had hired a car in new york and driven north to his house after our meeting with bosworth but by the time we arrived the police were already there and a couple of calls confirmed that the collector and his men had all been killed and that the great bone statue in his treasury now had a hole in its chest angel joined us in boston shortly after and we left for europe that night the temptation was to press on for sedlec which lay about forty miles east of the city but there were preparations to be made first in addition we were tired and hungry we checked into a small comfortable hotel in an area known as mala strana which seemed to translate as lesser town according to the young woman at the reception desk close by a little funicular railway ran up petrin hill from a street named újezd along which old trams rattled their connections occasionally sparking on the overhead lines and leaving a crisp burned smell in the air there were cobbles on the streets and some of the walls were obscured by graffiti traces of snow still lingered in sheltered corners and there was ice on the vltava river while louis made some calls i phoned rachel and told her where i was it was late and i was worried that i might wake her but i didnt want to just leave the country without letting her know her main concern still seemed to be for the dog but he was safely housed with a neighbor sam was doing fine and they were all planning on visiting rachels sister the next day rachel was quieter but more like her old self i always wanted to see prague said rachel after a time i know maybe another time maybe how long will you stay there a couple of days are angel and louis with you yes funny isnt it that youd be somewhere like prague with them instead of me she didnt sound like she found it funny at all its nothing personal i said and we have separate rooms i suppose thats reassuring perhaps when you get back youll come here and we can talk i noticed that she didnt say when or if she was coming home and i didnt ask i would go to vermont when i returned and we would talk and perhaps i would drive back to scarborough alone that might be an idea i said you didnt say that youd like to do it ive never had anyone tell me that we should talk and come out of it feeling better than when i went in it doesnt have to be that way does it i hope not i do love you she said you know that dont you i know thats what makes it so hard isnt it but you have to choose what life youre going to lead we both do i guess her voice trailed off i have to go i said ill see you when i get back fine goodbye rachel bye the hotel booked us a table at a place called u modre kachnicky or the blue duckling which lay on a discreet side street off újezd the restaurant was heavily decorated with drapes and rugs and old prints and mirrors gave an impression of spaciousness to the smaller lower level the menu contained a great deal of game the houses speciality so we ate duck breast and venison the various meats resting on sauces made from bilberry juniper and madeira wine we shared a bottle of frankovka wine and ate in relative silence while we were still finishing our main courses a man entered the restaurant and was directed to our table by the hostess he looked like the kind of guy who sold stolen cell phones on broadway leather jacket jeans nastycolored shirt and a growth of beard that was frozen somewhere between forgot to shave and hobo i wasnt about to point any of this out to him though his jacket could easily have contained two of me inside it as long as someone found a way to release its current occupant from it without tearing it apart in the process because the leather seemed to be a little tight on him i wondered if he was somehow related to the fulcis from way back maybe from when man first discovered fire his name was most according to louis who had apparently dealt with him before most was a papka or father of one of the prague criminal brigades related by marriage to the vor v zakone the thief in law responsible for all homegrown organized crime criminal organizations in the czech republic were mainly structured around these brigades of which there were maybe ten in the entire country they dealt in racketeering the smuggling of prostitutes from former eastern bloc countries pandering automobile theft drugs and weapons but the lines of demarcation between criminal gangs were becoming increasingly unclear as the number of immigrants increased ukrainians russians and chechens were now among the main participants in organized crime in the country and none of them were reluctant to use violence and brutality against their victims or inevitably against one another each group had its own areas of specialization the russians were more involved in financial crime while the aggressive ukrainians favored bank raids and serial robberies the bulgarians who had previously concentrated on erotic clubs had now branched out into auto theft drug trafficking and the supply of bulgarian prostitutes to brothels the italians less numerous focused on purchasing real estate the chinese favored running casinos and illegal brothels as well as people smuggling and kidnapping although such activities tended to remain within their own ethnic groups and the albanians had a piece of everything from drugs to debt collection and the trade in leather and gold the homegrown boys were being forced to battle for their turf against a new breed of immigrant criminal that didnt play by any of the old rules compared to the new arrivals most was an oldfashioned specialist he liked guns and women possibly both together hello he said is good he indicated the deer medallions in bilberry sauce on angels plate surrounded by a pile of spinach noodles yeah said angel its real good an enormous finger and thumb plucked one of the remaining medallions from angels plate and dropped it into a mouth like the holland tunnel hey man said angel i wasnt most gave angel a look it wasnt threatening it wasnt even mildly menacing it was the look a spider might have given a trapped fly if the insect had suddenly produced a small bill of rights and begun complaining loudly about infringements on its liberty eating that anyway finished angel somewhat lamely way to stand up for your rights i said yeah well i dont know what youre looking so smug about he said youre sharing the rest of yours to make up for it the big man wiped his fingers on a napkin then stretched out a hand to louis most he said louis said louis introducing angel and me in turn doesnt most mean bridge i said i had seen signs on the streets directing tourists to karlv most the charles bridge most spread his hands in the gesture of delight common to all those who find visitors to their land making an effort not only were we buying guns from him we were learning the language bridge yes is right said most he made a balancing gesture with his hands i am bridge bridge between those who have and those who want bridge between fucking europe and africa if he fell over muttered angel under his breath excuse said most angel raised his knife and fork and grinned through a mouthful of deer good meat he said hmmmm most didnt look convinced but he let it slide we should go he said is busy time for me we paid the check and followed most out to where a black mercedes was parked on the corner of nebovidská and harantova wow said angel gangster car very lowkey you really dont like him do you i said i dont like big men who throw their weight around i had to admit that angel was probably right most was a bit of a jerk but we needed what he had to offer try to play nice i said its not like youre adopting him we got in the car louis and angel taking a seat in back while i sat in the passenger seat beside most louis didnt look uneasy despite the fact that he didnt have a gun this was purely a business transaction for him in turn most probably knew enough about louis not to screw him around we drove over the vltava past tourist restaurants then little local bars eventually leaving behind a big railway station before heading in the direction of the enormous tv mast that dominated the night sky we turned down some side streets until we came to a doorway with an illuminated sign above it depicting a figure of cupid shooting an arrow through a heart the club was called cupid desire which made a kind of sense most pulled up outside and killed the engine the entrance to the club was guarded by a barred gate and a boredlooking gatekeeper the gate was opened most handed the car keys to his employee then we were descending a flight of steps into a small grimy bar eastern european women some blond some dark all bored and worn down sat in the murk nursing sodas rock music played in the background and a tall redhaired woman with tattoos on her arms worked the tiny bar there were no men in sight when most arrived the tattooed woman uncapped a budvar for him then spoke to him in czech you want something to drink most translated no were good said louis angel looked around the lessthanglorified bordello busy time he said what the hell is it like when its quiet we followed most through into the heart of the building past numbered doors that stood open to reveal double beds covered only by pillows and a sheet the walls decorated with framed posters of vaguely artful nudes until we came to an office a man sat on a padded chair watching three or four monitors that showed the gate to the club what appeared to be the back alley two views of the street and the cash register behind the bar most passed him and headed to a steel door at the back of the office he opened it with a pair of keys one from his wallet and the other from an alcove near the floor inside were cases of alcohol and cartons of cigarettes but they took up only a fraction of the space behind them was a small armory so said most what would you like louis had said that we would have no trouble acquiring weapons in prague and he was right the czech republic used to be a world leader in the production and export of armaments but the death of communism led to a decline in the industry after there were still about thirty arms manufacturers in the country though and the czechs werent as particular about the countries to which they exported arms as they should have been zimbabwe had reason to thank the czechs for breaching the embargo on the export of weapons as had sri lanka and even yemen that friend to us interests abroad and the target of a nonbinding un embargo there had even been attempts to export arms to eritrea and the democratic republic of congo facilitated by export licenses covering nonembargoed countries which were then used to redirect their cargoes to their true destinations some of these weapons were legitimately acquired some were surplus weapons sold on to dealers but there were others that came through more obscure channels and i suspected that the bulk of mosts inventory might have been acquired in this way after all in the czech national polices elite antiterrorist unit urna was discovered to be selling its own weapons ammunition and even semtex explosive to organized crime elements miroslav kvasnak the head of urna was sacked but that didnt stop him from later becoming the deputy director of czech army intelligence and later the czech defense attaché to india if the cops were prepared to sell guns to the very criminals they were supposed to be hunting then the free market appeared to have arrived with a vengeance if nothing else the czechs flush with the newfound joys of capitalism clearly understood how to go about creating an entrepreneurial society against the far wall were racks of guns semiautomatic weapons mainly along with some shotguns including a pair of fn tactical police shotguns that were clearly just out of the crate i saw cz assault rifles and five n light machine guns mounted on their bipods and lined up on a table beneath their smaller brothers m mags and m saw belts were stacked neatly beside each there were also aks and rack upon rack of similar vzs beside them were two further racks of various automatic and semiautomatic weapons and arrayed on a pair of oilclothcovered trestle tables was a selection of pistols nearly everything on display was new and a lot of it appeared to be military issue it looked like half of the czech armys best weaponry was being stored in mosts basement if the country was invaded theyd have to make do with peashooters and cusswords until someone cobbled together enough money to buy the guns back angel and i watched as louis checked his weapons of choice working the slides chambering rounds and inserting and ejecting clips as he made his selections he eventually opted for a trio of heckler amp koch pistols with knights suppressors to reduce flash and noise the guns were marked ussocom on the barrel which meant that they were made originally for us special operations command the barrel and slide were slightly longer than on the usual h ampk and they had a screw thread on the muzzle for attaching the suppressor along with a laseraiming module mounted in front of the trigger guard he also picked up some gerber patriot combat knives and a steyr ninemillimeter machine pistol for himself fitted with a thirtyround magazine and a suppressor this one longer than the pistol itself well take two hundred rounds for thes and ill take three thirties for the steyr said louis when he was done the knives youll throw in for free most agreed a price for the guns although his pleasure in the sale was dimmed a little by louiss negotiating skills we left with the weapons most even gave us some holsters although they were kind of worn the mercedes was still parked outside but this time there was another man behind the wheel my cousin explained most he patted me on the arm you sure you dont want to stay have some fun the words fun and cupid desire didnt seem a natural fit to me i have a girlfriend i said you could have another said most i dont think so im not doing so good with the one i have most didnt offer girls to angel and louis i pointed this out to them on the ride back to the hotel maybe youre the only one of us who looks like a deviant suggested angel yeah that must be it you being so cleanliving and all we should be there now said louis he was talking about sedlec theyre not dumb i said theyve waited a long time for this theyll want to look the place over before they make their move theyll need equipment transport men and they wont try to get to the statue until after dark well be waiting for them when they come we drove to sedlec the next day following the highway toward the polish border because it was a faster road than the more direct route through the villages and towns we passed fields of corn and beet still recovering from the harvest and drove through thick forests with small huts at their edges for the hunters to use according to the guidebook id read on the plane there were bears and wolves farther south down in the bohemian forests but up here it was mainly small mammals and game birds in the distance i could see redroofed villages the spires of their churches rising above the houses once we left the highway we passed through the industrial city of kolin the crossroads for the railways heading east to moscow and south to austria there were crumbling houses and others in the process of restoration beer signs hung in windows and chalkwritten menus were displayed by open doors sedlec was now almost a suburb of the larger town of kutna hora a great hill rose up before us kank according to the map the first big mine opened in the city following the discovery of silver on the catholic churchs property i had seen paintings of the mines in the guidebook they reminded me of boschs depictions of hell with men descending beneath the earth dressed in white tunics so that they could be seen in the dim light of their lamps leather skirts at their backs so that they could slide down the mine shafts quickly without injuring themselves they carried enough bread for six days for it took five hours to climb back to the surface and so the miners stayed underground for most of the week only coming up on the seventh day to worship to spend time with their families and to replenish their supplies before returning to the world beneath the surface once again most kept an icon of saint barbara the patron saint of miners upon their persons for those who died in the mines did so without benefit of clergy or the speaking of the last rites and their bodies would probably remain below ground even if they could be found amidst the rubble of a collapse with saint barbara close by them they believed they would yet find their way to heaven and so the town of kutna hora still rested on the remains of the mines beneath its buildings and streets were mile upon mile of tunnels and the earth was mingled with the bones of those who had worked and died to bring the silver to the surface this i thought was a fitting place for the interment of the black angel an ancient outpost of a hidden hell in eastern europe a little corner of the honeycomb world chapter twentyfour we hung a right at a big kaufland supermarket and came to the intersection of cechova and starosedlecka streets the ossuary was on the latter directly before us surrounded by high walls and a cemetery across from it was a restaurant and store named u balanu and around the corner to the right was a hotel we asked to take a look at the rooms eventually finding two that gave us a good view of the ossuary then went to view the ossuary itself sedlec had never wanted for bodies to fill its graves what the mines or plague or conflict could not provide the lure of the holy land fulfilled the fourteenthcentury zbraslav chronicle records that in one year alone thirty thousand people were buried in the cemetery a great many of them brought there specifically for the privilege of being buried in soil from the holy land for it was believed that the graveyard held miraculous properties and that any decedent buried there would decompose within a single day leaving only preserved white bones behind when those bones inevitably began to stack up the cemeterys keepers built a twostory mortuary containing an ossuary within which the remains might be displayed if the ossuary served a practical purpose by allowing graves to be emptied of skeletal remains and freed up for those more in need of a dark place in which to shed their mortal burden it also served a spiritual purpose at least equally well the bones became reminders of the transience of human existence and the temporary nature of all earthly things at sedlec the border between this world and the next was marked in bone even here in this foreign place there were echoes of my own past i recalled a hotel room in new orleans the air outside still and heavy with moisture we had been closing in on the man who had taken my wife and child from me and coming at last to some understanding of the nature of his art he too believed in the transience of all human affairs and he left behind his own memento mori as he traveled the land tearing skin from flesh and flesh from bone to show us that life was but a fleeting unimportant thing capable of being taken at will by a being as worthless as himself except that he was wrong for not all that we tried to achieve was without value and not every aspect of our lives was unworthy of celebration or remembrance with each life that he took the world became a poorer place its index of possibilities reduced forever deprived of the potential for art science passion ingenuity hope and regret that the unlived existences of generation upon generation of progeny would have brought with them but what of the lives that i had taken was i not equally culpable and was that not why there were now so many names of both good men and bad carved upon that palimpsest i bore and for each of which i might justifiably be called to account i could argue that by committing a smaller evil i had prevented a greater one from occurring but i would still bear the mark of that sin upon me and perhaps be damned for it yet in the end i could not stand by there were sins that i had committed out of anger touched by wrath and for those i had no doubt that i would at last be charged and found wanting but the others i chose to act as i did believing that the greater evil lay in doing nothing i have tried to make reparation in my way the problem is that like cancer a little corruption of the soul will eventually spread throughout the whole the problem is that there are no small evils we passed through the cemetery gates and skirted the graves the more recent stones often marked with photographs of the deceased inset into the marble or granite beneath the word rodina followed by the family name one or two even had alcoves carved in the stone protected by glass behind which framed portraits of all of those buried beneath the ground sat undisturbed as they might have done on a sideboard or a shelf when those depicted were still alive three steps led down to the ossuary entrance a pair of plain wooden doors overlooked by a semicircular window to the right of the entrance a steeper flight of steps led up to the chapel for the chapel stood above the ossuary and from its window one might look down on the interior of the ossuary itself inside the door a young woman sat behind a glass display case containing cards and trinkets we paid her thirty czech koruny each to enter or barely four dollars between us we were the only people present and our breath assumed strange forms in the cold air as we looked upon the wonders of sedlec my god said angel what is this place a stairway led down before us on the walls at either side the letters ihs for iesus hominum salvator or jesus savior of humanity were set in long bones surrounded by four sets of three bones representing the arms of a cross each arm ended in a single skull at the base of the stairs two sets of parallel columns mirrored one another the columns were made up of skulls alternated with what appeared to be femurs the bones set vertically beneath the upper jaw of each skull the columns followed the edges of two alcoves into which had been set a pair of enormous urns or perhaps they might have been baptismal fonts again constructed entirely from human remains and lidded by a circle of skulls i stepped into the main area of the ossuary to my right and left were chambers containing huge pyramids of skulls and bones too many to count topped in each case by a wooden crown painted gold two similar barred rooms faced me so that they occupied the four corners of the ossuary according to the information leaflet thrust into our hands at the door the remains represented the multitudes facing judgment before god while the crowns symbolized the kingdom of heaven and the promise of resurrection from the dead on one of the walls beside the skull chamber to my right there was an inscription again inset in bone it read františek rint z ceske skalice in common with most artists rint had signed his work but if bosworth was right then rint had seen something while he was completing the reconstruction of the ossuary and what he had seen had haunted him to such a degree that he had spent years recreating its image as though by doing so he might slowly begin to exorcise it from his imagination and bring himself peace at last the other chamber to my left was marked by the coat of arms of the schwarzenberg family who had paid for rints work once again it was made entirely from bone rint had even constructed a bird a raven or a rook using a pelvic bone for its body and a section of rib for its wing the bird was dipping its beak into the hollow eye socket of what was supposed to be a turkish skull a detail that had been added to the coat of arms as a gift from emperor rudolf ii after adolf of schwarzenberg had curbed the power of the turks by conquering the fortification of raab in but all of this was merely a sideshow compared to the centerpiece of the ossuary from the vaulted ceiling a chandelier hung fashioned from elements of every bone that the human body could supply its extended parts were hanging arm bones ending in a plate of pelvic bones upon which rested in each case a single skull a candleholder was inset into the top of each head and a ribbon of interlinked bones formed the suspension chains keeping them in place it was impossible to look upon it and not feel ones sense of disgust overcome by awe at the imagination that could have produced such an artifact it was simultaneously beautiful and disturbing a marvelous testament to mortality inset into the floor beneath the chandelier was a rectangular concrete slab this was the entrance to the crypt within which were contained the remains of a number of wealthy individuals at each corner of the crypt stone stood a baroque candelabra in the shape of a gothic tower with three lines of seven skulls set into each again with an arm bone clasped beneath their ruined jaws and topped by angels blowing trumpets all told the remains of some forty thousand persons were contained in the ossuary i looked around angel and louis were examining a pair of glass cabinets behind which were contained the skulls of some of those who had died in the hussite campaigns two or three bore the small holes of musket balls while others had gaping wounds inflicted by blunt force a sharp blade had almost entirely cleaved away the back of one skull something dripped onto my shirt spreading a stain across the fabric i looked up and saw moisture on the ceiling perhaps the roof was leaking i thought but then i felt a rivulet of sweat run down my face and melt upon my lips i realized that i could no longer see my breath in the air and that i had begun to perspire heavily neither angel nor louis appeared troubled angel in fact had zipped his jacket up to his chin and was stamping his feet slightly to keep warm his hands jammed into his pockets sweat ran into my eyes blurring my vision i tried to clear it by wiping the sleeve of my coat across my forehead but it seemed to make matters worse the salt stung me and i began to feel dizzy and disoriented i didnt want to lean against anything for fear of setting off the alarms about which we had been warned at the door instead i squatted on the floor and took some deep breaths but i was teetering slightly on my heels and so was forced to put my fingers to the ground to support myself they touched against the crypt stone and instantly i felt a wave of pain break across my skin i was drowning in liquid heat my whole body aflame i tried to open my mouth to say something but the heat rushed to fill the new gap stilling any sound from within i was blind mute forced to endure my torments in silence i wanted to die yet i could not instead i found myself sealed trapped in a hard dark place i was constantly on the verge of suffocation unable to draw a breath and still there was no release time ceased to have meaning there was only an endless unendurable now and yet i endured a hand was placed upon my shoulder and angel spoke his touch felt incredibly cool to me and his breath was like ice upon my skin and then i became aware of another voice beneath angels except this one repeated words in a language that i did not understand a litany of phrases spoken over and over again always with the same intonation the same pauses the same emphases it was an invocation of sorts yet one bound up entirely with madness and i was reminded of those animals in a zoo that driven insane by their incarceration and the neverchanging nature of their surroundings find themselves endlessly stalking in their cages always at the same speed always with the same movements as though the only way they can survive is to become as one with the place in which they are kept to match its unyielding absence of novelty with their own suddenly the voice changed it stumbled over its words it tried to begin once more but lost its place finally it stopped entirely and i became aware of something probing the ossuary the way a blind man might stop the tapping of his cane and listen for the approach of a stranger and then it howled over and over again the tone and volume rising until it became one repeated shriek of rage and despair but despair now for the first time in so long leavened by faint hope the sound of it tore at my ears shredding my nerves as it called to me over and over and over again it is aware i thought it knows it is alive angel and louis brought me back to the hotel i was weak and my skin was burning i tried to lie down but the nausea would not go away after a time i joined them in their room we sat at the windows and watched the cemetery and its buildings what happened in there said louis at last im not sure he was angry he didnt even try to hide it yeah well you need to explain it dont matter how weird it sounds we got no time for this you dont have to tell me that i snapped he eyed me levelly so what was it i had no choice but to answer him i thought for a moment that i felt something down there under the ossuary and that it knew i was aware of it i had a sensation of being trapped of suffocation and heat thats it i cant tell you anything more i didnt know what to expect from louis in response to this now i thought now we have arrived at it the thing that has come between us is wriggling its way to the surface you okay to go back in there he said ill wear a lighter coat next time louis tapped his fingers gently in time to some rhythm that only he could hear i had to ask he said i understand i guess im getting impatient i want this to end i dont like it when its personal he turned in his chair and stared at me theyll come wont they yes i said then you can do whatever you want with them i promised you that we would find them and we have isnt that what you wanted from me but he still wasnt satisfied his fingers drummed on the windowsill and his gaze seemed drawn again and again to the twin spires of the chapel angel was seated on a chair in one dark corner carefully maintaining a stillness and silence waiting for what divided us to be named a sea change had occurred in our friendship and i did not know if the result would bring an end to it or a new beginning say it i said i wanted to blame you said louis softly he did not look at me as he spoke i wanted to blame you for what happened to alice not in the beginning because i knew the life that she led i tried to look out for her and i tried to make other people look out for her too but in the end she chose her own path like we all do when she went missing i was grateful i was relieved it didnt last long but it was there and i was ashamed of it then we found garcia and this guy brightwell came out of the woodwork and suddenly it wasnt about alice no more it was about you because you were tied into it somehow and i got to thinking that maybe it wasnt alices fault that maybe it was yours you know how many women make their living on the streets of new york of all the whores or junkies they could have chosen of all the women who might have gotten involved with this man winston why should it have been her it was like you cast a shadow on lives and that shadow was growing and it touched her even though youd never met her didnt even know she existed after that i didnt want to look at you for a time i didnt hate you for it because it wasnt intentional on your part but i didnt want to be around you then she started calling to me he was reflected clearly in the glass now as the night drew in his face hung in the air and perhaps it was a flaw in the glass that duplicated his reflection or maybe it was something more but a second presence seemed suspended in the darkening air behind him its features indistinguishable and the stars were shining through its eyes i hear her at night i thought at the start that it was someone in the building but when i went outside the apartment to check i couldnt hear her no more it was only inside i only hear her when theres nobody else around its her voice except its not alone there are other voices with it so many of them and theyre all calling different names she calls mine its hard to understand her because someone doesnt want her calling out it didnt matter to him at first because he thought nobody cared about her but now he knows better he wants her to stay quiet shes dead but she keeps calling out like shes got no peace she cries all the time shes afraid theyre all afraid and i knew then that maybe it was no coincidence that you found angel and me either or that we found you i dont understand everything that goes on with you but i do know this whatever happened was meant to come to pass and were all involved its always been waiting in the shadows and none of us can walk away from it theres no blame to be laid at your door i know that now sure there are other women who could have been taken but what then theyd have disappeared and it would be their voices calling but there would be no one to hear them and no one would care this way we heard and we came at last he turned back to me and the woman in the night faded away i want her to stop crying he said and i could see clearly the lines upon his face and the tiredness in his eyes i want them all to stop crying walter cole called me on my cell that night i had spoken to him before we left and had told him as much as i knew you sound a million miles away he said and if i were you id keep it that way just about everyone youve ever talked to on this thing is dead and pretty soon people are going to start looking for you to answer some questions some of this you may not want to hear neddos dead someone cut him up badly it might have been torture in order to gain information except there was a rag stuffed in his mouth so even if he had something to give up he wouldnt have been able to speak thats not the worst of it either reid the monk who spoke with you was stabbed to death outside a bar in hartford the other monk phoned it in then disappeared cops want to talk to him too but either his order is protecting him or they really dont know where he is do the cops think he did it if they do theyre wrong they just want to talk to him there was blood on reids mouth and it wasnt his own unless it matches barteks then hes probably in the clear it looks like reid bit whoever killed him the blood sample has been fasttracked to a private lab theyll get the results in a day or two i already knew what they would find old corrupted dna and i wondered if reids voice had now joined alices in that dark place from which brightwells victims called out for release i thanked walter then hung up and returned to my vigil upon the ossuary sekula arrived on the morning of the second day he didnt come alone there was a driver who waited behind the wheel of the gray audi and sekula entered the ossuary in the company of a small man in jeans and a sailors coat after thirty minutes they came out and took the stairs up to the chapel they didnt stay there long checking out the alarm said angel as we watched them from the hotel the little guy is probably the expert how good is it i asked i took a look at it yesterday not good enough to keep them out doesnt even look like its been upgraded since the last breakin the two men emerged from the chapel and walked around the perimeter of the building then headed back to the audi and drove away we could have followed them said louis we could i said but what would have been the point they have to come back angel was pulling at his lower lip how soon i asked me id get it done as soon as possible if the alarm wasnt a problem tonight maybe it felt right they would come and we would know everything there was a small courtyard beside the u balanu store across the street from the ossuary that doubled as an outdoor area for the restaurant during the summer it was an easy matter to gain entry to it and that was where louis took up position shortly after dusk the following evening i was in the hotel room where i could get a good overview of all that was taking place louis and i had agreed that we would make no move alone angel was in the cemetery there was a small shed with a redtiled roof to the left of the ossuary its windows were broken but guarded by black steel grates at one time it might have functioned as the gravediggers cottage but it now contained just slates bricks planks of wood and one very cold new yorker my cell phone was switched to vibrate all was silence apart from the distant growl of passing cars and so we waited the gray audi arrived shortly after nine it made one full circuit of the block then parked on starosedlecka it was followed minutes later by a second black audi and a nondescript green truck its tires thick with accumulated mud and the gold lettering along its body faded and unreadable sekula got out of the first car accompanied by the little alarm specialist and a second figure wearing black trousers and a calflength hooded coat the hood was up for the temperature had dropped considerably that day even sekula was identifiable only by his height as a scarf covered his mouth and he wore a black knitted cap on his head three people emerged from the second vehicle one was the charming miss zahn she didnt seem troubled by the cold her coat was open and her head was uncovered given the temperature of what was running in her veins the night probably felt a little balmy to her the second person was a whitehaired man whom i did not recognize he had a gun in his hand the third was brightwell he was still wearing the same beige clothes like miss zahn the cold didnt appear to bother him unduly he walked back to the truck and spoke to one of the two men inside it looked like they were planning to transport the statue if they found it the two men climbed down from the cab and followed brightwell to the back of the truck once the door was opened two more men climbed out swaddled in layers of clothing for the cold journey in the unheated rear then after a brief consultation brightwell led miss zahn sekula the unknown individual in the hooded coat and the alarm specialist to the cemetery gate one of the hired hands followed them angel had locked the gate behind him when he was making his way to the hut but brightwell simply cut the chain and the group entered the grounds of the ossuary i took a brief head count outside we had the driver of the audi and three of the truck crew inside the grounds there were six more i buzzed louis what can you see i said one guy now at the ossuary door inside the grounds he said quietly the driver standing at the passenger door back to me i heard him shift position two amateurs from the truck at either corner keeping watch on the main road one more at the gate i thought about it give me five minutes ill come around from behind the truck and take the corner guys you have the driver and the man at the gate tell angel he has the door ill buzz you when im ready to move i exited the hotel and worked my way as quickly as i could around the block eventually i had to climb a wall and walk through a green field containing a childrens play area the cemetery to my left i buzzed angel as i entered the field im in the field behind you dont shoot me just this once im gonna move with you i heard a low noise from the cemetery as angel emerged from the shed then everything was quiet again i found a gate at the far end of the field i opened it as quietly as i could to my left i could just see the back of the truck i kept to the wall until it began to curve toward the main entrance the shape of the guard at the gate was clearly visible if i attempted to cross the street there was a good chance that he would see me i buzzed louis again change of plan he said angels taking the door and the gate inside the cemetery the guard at the ossuary door lit a cigarette his name was gary toolan and he was little more than an american criminal for hire based in europe mostly he just liked women booze and hurting people but some of the people for whom he was now working gave him the creeps they were different somehow alien the guy with white hair the looker with the strange skin and most of all the fat man with the swollen neck made him very uneasy he didnt know what they were doing here but he was certain of one thing he had their number and that was why he had received payment in advance if they tried anything he had his money he had a backup pistol and the men that he had sourced for these freaks would stand by him in the event of trouble toolan took a long drag on his cigarette as he dropped the match the shadows around him shifted and it took him a second to realize that the falling light and the mutating darkness were unrelated angel shot him in the side of the head then moved toward the gate louis checked his watch he still had the phone to his ear i waited three counted louis two one now there was a soft pop and the man at the gate crumpled to the ground shot from behind by angel i ran the audi driver immediately went for his gun but louis was already moving to take him the driver seemed to sense him at the last minute for he was starting to turn when louiss bullet entered the back of his skull now one of the men at the corner was shouting something he ran to the cab and almost managed to open the door before he slid down the side and tried to reach for the small of his back where my first shot had taken him i shot him again on the ground and took the last man as he loosed off a round it blew out a chunk of crumbling masonry from the wall beside my head but by then the man who had fired the shot was dead louis was already pulling the body of the driver into the restaurant courtyard he stopped when he heard the shot nobody emerged from any of the nearby houses to see what was going on either they had taken the shot for a car backfiring or they just didnt want to know i pushed the bodies of the two men under their truck where they would not easily be seen then louis and i ran to the ossuary angel was crouching at the door casting quick glances into the interior one more down inside he said he heard the shot and came running it looks like theyve got the crypt stone up and theres a light burning by the hole but i dont think theres anyone else in there i guess theyre all belowground the heat inside the ossuary was intense at first i was afraid that i was about to experience a return of the nausea that i had felt the previous day thus confirming louiss worst fears about me but when i looked at angel and louis they had both begun to sweat profusely we were surrounded by the sound of dripping water as rivulets ran from the ceilings and walls dropping on the exposed bones and washing like tears down the white cheeks of the dead the body of the alarm specialist lay inside the door already speckled with moisture the crypt stone had been ejected from its resting place and lay to one side of the entrance beside which a batterypowered lamp burned we skirted the hole trying not to expose ourselves to anyone waiting below i thought i could detect however faintly the sound of voices then stone moving upon stone a flight of rough steps led down into the gloom a trace of illumination visible from an unseen light source in the crypt itself angel looked at me i looked at angel louis looked at both of us great whispered angel just great we should be wearing targets on our chests youre staying up here i told him keep to the shadows by the door we dont need any more of them arriving and trapping us down there angel didnt object in his position i wouldnt have objected either louis and i stood just out of sight of the steps one of us would have to go first whatll it be i said age or beauty he stepped forward and placed his foot on the first step both he said i stayed a couple of steps behind him as he descended the floor of the ossuary which doubled as the crypt ceiling was two feet thick so we were almost halfway down before we could see anything and even then half of the crypt remained in darkness to our left was a series of niches each occupied by a stone tomb all were ornately carved with coats of arms or depictions of the resurrection to our right was a similar arrangement of tombs except that one of the stone coffins had been overturned and its occupants remains spilled across the flagged floor the bones had long since disarticulated but i thought i could faintly see traces of the shroud in which the body had been interred the niche now empty revealed a rectangular opening previously concealed by the tomb maybe four feet high and as many feet across i could see light filtering through the gap from behind the voices were louder now and the temperature had risen noticeably it was like standing at the mouth of a furnace waiting to be consumed by the flames i felt a breath of slightly cooler air at my neck and in the same instant spun to my right pushing louis to one side with as much force as i could muster before i hit the floor something sliced through the air and impacted on one of the columns supporting the vault i smelled a hint of perfume as miss zahn grunted with the shock of the crowbars impact upon the stone i struck out as hard as i could with my heel and caught her on the side of the knee her leg buckled and i heard her scream but she whipped the crowbar instinctively in my direction as i tried to rise striking me on my right elbow and sending a shock wave through my arm that paralyzed it immediately i dropped my gun and was forced to scramble backward before i felt the wall at my back and could raise myself using my left hand i heard a shot fired and even though it was suppressed it still echoed loudly in the enclosed space i couldnt tell where louis was until i scrambled to my feet and saw him pressed against one of the tombs locked in close combat with sekula the lawyers gun now lay on the floor but with his left hand he was keeping louiss own gun away from him while his right scratched at louiss face looking for soft tissue to damage i couldnt intervene despite her pain miss zahn was limping around me looking for another opportunity to strike she had removed her jacket to allow herself some respite from the heat and in the course of her attempts to strike me the buttons on her black shirt had popped a shaft of light caught her and i saw the tattoos upon her skin they seemed to move in the lamplight the faces twisting and contorting the great eyes blinking the pupils dilating a mouth opened revealing small catlike teeth a head turned its pug nose flattening further as though another living being inside her had pressed itself hard against her epidermis from below trying to force itself through to the world outside her whole body was a teeming gallery of grotesques and i could not seem to draw my eyes from them the effect was almost hypnotic and i wondered if that was how she subdued her victims before taking them entrancing them as she moved in for the kill my right arm ached and i felt as if all the moisture was being drained from my body by the heat i couldnt understand why she didnt just shoot me i stumbled backward as miss zahn feinted at me i lost my footing and then the crowbar was moving in a great arc toward my head when a voice said hey bitch and a booted foot caught miss zahn in the jaw breaking it with a sharp snapping sound her eyes squeezed shut in shock and in the shadowy light i thought that the faces on her body responded in turn the eyes briefly snapping closed the mouths opening in silent roars of agony miss zahn looked to where angel lay sideways upon the stairs just beneath the level of the ceiling his right foot was still outstretched and above it he held the miss zahn dropped the crowbar and raised her left hand angel fired and the bullet tore through the palm she slid down the wall leaving a trail of dark matter behind one eye remained open but the other was a black and red wound she blinked once and again all the tattooed eyes on her skin seemed to blink in unison then her eye closed the painted eyelids on her body drooping slowly in turn until at last all movement ceased as she died the energy seemed to leave sekula he sagged giving louis the opening that he sought he forced the muzzle of his gun upward into the soft flesh beneath sekulas chin and pulled the trigger the noise of a shot reverberated around us once again the sound finding material expression in the dark fountain that struck the vaulted ceiling louis released sekula and allowed him to crumple to the floor he stopped said louis indicating sekula i was under his gun and he stopped he sounded puzzled he told me that he didnt think he could kill a man i said i guess he was right i sagged against the damp wall of the crypt my arm ached badly but i didnt think there were any bones broken i nodded my thanks to angel and he returned to his post in the ossuary itself beyond us lay the opening in the wall after you this time said louis i looked at the remains of miss zahn and sekula at least i might see the next person who attacks us i said she had a gun he said pointing at the pistol tucked into miss zahns belt she could have just shot you she wanted me alive i said why your charm i shook my head she thought i was like her and like brightwell i stooped and passed through the gap louis steps behind me we were in a long tunnel with a ceiling barely six feet in height that prevented louis from standing up straight the tunnel stretched ahead into the darkness curving gently to the right as it went on either side were alcoves or cells most of which appeared to contain nothing more than stone beds although some had broken bowls and old empty wine bottles on the floor indicating that they had been occupied at one point each had a kind of portcullis arrangement to close it off the barred gate capable of being raised and lowered through a pulley and chain system outside each alcove in nearly every case the alcoves were unbarred but we came to one on the right upon which the gate had been lowered inside my flashlight picked out clothed human remains the skull still retained some of its hair and the clothing was relatively intact the stench was foul from within what is this place said louis it looks like a jail seems like they forgot they had a guest down here something rustled in the closed cell a rat i thought its only a rat it has to be whoever was lying in that cell was long dead it was tattered skin and yellowed bone nothing more and then the man inside moved on his stone cot his fingernails dragged across the stone his right leg stretched almost imperceptibly and his head shifted slightly where it rested the effort it took was clearly enormous i could see every wasted muscle working on his desiccated arms and every tendon straining in his face as he tried to speak his features were buried deep in his skull as though they were slowly being sucked inside the eyes were like rotted fruits in the hollows of the sockets barely visible behind his emaciated hand as he sought to shield himself from the light while simultaneously trying to see those that lay behind it louis took a step back how can he still be alive he said he could not keep the shock from his voice i had never heard him speak like that before like the halflife of an isotope that remained the only way i could fathom it the process of dying but with the inevitable end delayed beyond imagining perhaps like kittim this unknown man was proof of that belief it doesnt matter i said leave him i saw louis raise his pistol the action surprised me he was not a man known for conventional mercies i laid my hand on the barrel of the gun forcing it gently down no i said the being on the stone slab tried to speak i could see the desperation in its eyes and i almost felt something of louiss pity for it i turned away and heard louis follow by now we were deep beneath the ground and far from the cemetery from the direction in which we were heading i believed that we were somewhere between the ossuary and the site of the former monastery nearby there were more cells here many with the portcullises lowered but i glanced only in one or two as i went by those who had been incarcerated in them were now clearly dead their bones long separated they probably made mistakes along the way i thought it was like the old witch trials if the suspects died they were innocent if they survived then they were guilty the heat grew more and more intense the walls were hot to the touch and our clothing became so burdensome that we were forced to shed our jackets and coats along the way there was a rushing sound in my head threaded through it i thought i could discern words except they were no longer fragments of an old incantation spoken in madness these had purpose and intent they were calling urging there was light ahead of us we saw a circular room lined with open cells and a trio of lanterns at its center beyond them stood the obese figure of brightwell he was working at a blank wall trying to free a brick at the level of his head using a crowbar beside him was the hooded jacketed figure its head lowered brightwell registered our presence first because he turned suddenly the crowbar still in his hands i expected him to reach for a gun but he did not instead he seemed almost pleased his mouth was disfigured his lower lip crisscrossed with black stitches where reid had bitten him during his final struggle i knew he said i knew that youd come the figure to his right lowered its hood i saw a womans gray hair hanging loose then her face was exposed in the lanternlight claudia sterns fine bone structure had taken on a thin hungry aspect her skin was pale and dry and when she opened her mouth to speak i thought that her teeth seemed longer than before as though her gums were receding there was a white mote in her right eye previously hidden by some form of concealing lens brightwell handed the crowbar to her but he made no attempt to move toward us or to threaten us in any way nearly done he said its good that you should be here for this claudia stern inserted the crowbar into the gap brightwell had made and strained i saw the stone shift in its place she repositioned the bar then pushed hard the stone moved some thirty degrees until it was perpendicular to the wall in the gap revealed i thought i saw something shine with a final effort she forced the stone away it fell to the floor as she continued to work at the bricks forcing them apart more easily now that the first breach had been made i should have stopped her but i did not i realized that i too wanted to know what lay behind the wall i wanted to see the black angel a large square patch of silver was now clearly visible through the hole i could pick out the shape of a rib and the edge of what might have been an arm the figure was rough and unfinished with droplets of hardened silver fixed upon it like frozen tears suddenly as though responding to an unanticipated impulse claudia stern dropped the crowbar and thrust her hand into the hole it took a moment for me to notice the temperature rising again for it was already so hot in the chamber but i began to feel my skin prickle and burn as though i were standing unprotected in intense sunlight i looked at my skin almost expecting it to begin reddening as i watched the voice in my head was louder now a torrent of whispers like the rushing of water at a great fall its substance unintelligible but its meaning clear close to where stern was standing liquid began to drip through holes in the mortar sliding slowly down the walls like droplets of mercury i could see them steaming and i could smell the dust burning whatever lay behind that wall it was now melting the silver falling away to reveal whatever lay concealed within stern looked at brightwell and i could see the surprise on her face this was clearly beyond her expectations all of the preparations that they had made indicated that they had intended to transport the statue back to new york not to have it melt around their feet i heard a sound from behind the wall like the beating of a wing and it brought me back to where i was reminding me of what i had to do i pointed my gun at brightwell stop her brightwell didnt move you wont use it he said well come back beside me louis seemed to jerk his head his face contorted as though in pain and he raised his left hand to his ear then i heard it too a chorus of voices their words raised in a cacophony of pleading all coming from somewhere deep within brightwell the silver drops had become a series of streams seeping out through cracks in the walls i thought i heard more movement behind the stones but there was so much noise in my head that i could not be certain youre a sick deluded man i said you know its true he said you sense it in yourself i shook my head no youre wrong there is no salvation for you or for any of us said brightwell god deprived you of your wife your child now hes going to take a second woman away from you and a second child he doesnt care do you think he would have allowed them to suffer as they did if they really mattered to him if anyone really mattered to him why then would you believe in him and not in us why do you continue to have hope in him i struggled to find my voice it seemed as though my vocal cords were burning because with you i said there is no hope at all i sighted carefully along the barrel you wont kill me said brightwell once more but there was now doubt in his voice suddenly he moved all at once he was everywhere and nowhere i heard his voice in my ear felt his hands on my skin his mouth opened revealing those slightly blunted teeth they were biting me and my blood was pooling in his mouth as he tore into me i fired three times and the confusion stopped brightwells left foot was shattered at the ankle and there was a second wound below his knee the third shot had gone astray i thought then i saw the spreading stain upon his belly a gun appeared in brightwells hand he tried to raise it but louis was already on top of him pushing it away i moved past them both making for claudia stern her attention was entirely focused on the wall before her mesmerized by what was taking place before her eyes the metal was already cooling upon the ground around her feet and there was no longer any silver to be seen through the gap in the wall instead i saw a pair of black ribs encased by a thin layer of skin the exposed patch slowly increasing in dimension around the area where her hand remained in contact i grasped the womans shoulder and pulled her away from the wall breaking her contact with whatever was concealed within she screamed in rage and her voice was echoed by something deep within the walls her fingers scraped at my face and her feet kicked at my shins i caught a flash of metal in her left hand just before the blade sliced across my chest opening a long wound from my left side all the way up to my collarbone i struck her hard in the face using the base of my hand and as she stumbled away i hit her again forcing her back until she was at the entrance to one of the cells she tried to slash at me with the knife but this time i kicked out at her and she fell onto the stones i followed her in and removed the knife from her hand placing my foot against her wrist first so that she could not strike out at me she made an attempt to scramble past me but i kicked her again and i felt something crack beneat my foot she let out an animal sound and stopped moving i backed out of the cell the silver had stopped bleeding from the walls and the heat seemed to dissipate slightly the streams upon the floor and wall were growing hard and i could no longer hear any sounds real or imagined from the presence behind the stones i went to where brightwell lay louis had torn away the front of his shirt exposing his mottled belly the wound was bleeding badly but he was still alive hell survive if we get him to a hospital said louis its your choice i said alice was part of you louis took a step backward and lowered his gun no he said i dont understand this but you do brightwells voice was calm but his face was contorted with pain if you kill me ill find you he said to me i found you once and ill find you again however long it may take i will be god to you i will destroy everything that you love and i will force you to watch as i tear it apart and then you and i will descend to a dark place and i will be with you there there will be no salvation for you no repentance no hope he took a long rasping breath i could still hear that strange cacophony of voices but now its pitch had changed there was an expectancy to it a rising joy no forgiveness he whispered above all no forgiveness his blood was spreading across the floor it followed the gaps in the flagstones gradually seeping in geometric patterns toward the cell in which stern lay she was conscious now but weak and disoriented she stretched a hand toward brightwell and he caught the movement and looked to her i raised the gun i will come for you said brightwell yes she said i know you will brightwell coughed and scraped at the wound in his belly i will come for them all he said i shot him in the center of the forehead and he ceased to be a final breath emerged from his body i felt a coolness upon my face and smelled salt and clean air as the great choir was silenced at last claudia stern was crawling across the floor trying to resume contact with the figure that still stood trapped behind the wall i moved to stop her but now there were footsteps approaching from the tunnel behind us louis and i turned and prepared to face them bartek appeared in the doorway angel was with him looking a little uncertain five or six others followed men and women and i understood finally why no one had responded to the shot on the street why the alarm had not been replaced and how a last crucial fragment of the map had found its way from france to sedlec you knew all along i said you baited them then you waited for them to come four of those who had accompanied bartek stepped around us and surrounded claudia stern dragging her back to the open cell martin revealed its secrets to me said bartek he said that youd be there at the end he had a lot of faith in you im sorry i heard what happened i will miss him said bartek i think i lived vicariously through his pleasures i heard the jangling of chains claudia stern started to scream but i did not look what will you do with her they called it walling in medieval times a terrible way to die but a worse way not to die assuming she is what she believes herself to be and theres only one way to find out unfortunately yes but you wont keep her here everything will be moved in time and hidden once again sedlec has served its purpose it was a trap but the bait had to be real they would sense it if the statue were not present the pretence of its loss had to be maintained claudia sterns screams increased in intensity then were suddenly silenced come said bartek its time to leave we stood in the churchyard bartek knelt and brushed snow from a headstone revealing a photograph of a middleaged man in a suit there are bodies i said bartek smiled this is an ossuary in a churchyard he said we will have no trouble hiding them still its unfortunate that brightwell did not survive i made a choice martin was afraid of him you know he was right to be did brightwell say anything before he died he promised that hed find me bartek placed his hand upon my right arm and squeezed it gently let them believe what they will believe martin told me something about you before he died he said that if any man had ever made recompense for his wrongs no matter how terrible they were it was you deserved or not youve been punished enough dont add to it by punishing yourself brightwell or something like him will always exist in this world others too in turn there will always be men and women who are prepared to confront these things and all that they represent but in time you wont be among them youll be at rest with a stone like this one above your head and youll be reunited with the ones that you loved and who loved you in return but remember to be forgiven you have to believe in the possibility of forgiveness you have to ask for it and it will be given do you understand i nodded my eyes were hot i dredged up the words from my childhood from dark confessionals inhabited by unseen priests and a god who was terrible in his mercy bless me father for i have sinned the words spilled out of me like a cancer given form a torrent of sins and regrets purging themselves from my body and in time i heard two words in return and barteks face was close to mine as he whispered them in my ear te absolvo he said do you hear me you are absolved i heard him but i could not believe v through these years ive seen days that i wont miss at all but then god knows ive been as high as the sun through it all you kept me warm holding on to my hand but now youre on your own pinetop seven tennessee pride epilogue the days fall like leaves all is quiet now the marsh grass is blackened and when the wind blows from the southeast it carries with it the smell of smoke someone found the charred body of a mute swan floating in the water and the burned remains of shrews and hares have been discovered in the charred undergrowth the dog no longer likes to venture where the fire burned and so the twin boundaries of his world are represented by events from the recent past flames rising where no flames should have been and a deformed man drowning slowly in a pool of bloodied water as a pregnant woman watches him die i traced the young prostitute named ellen to tenth avenue just a couple of blocks from times square after the death of gmack i heard that shed been taken under the wing of a new pimp a middleaged serial abuser of women and children who called himself poppa bobby and liked his girls to call him poppa or daddy it was after midnight and i watched single men hover around the street girls like hawks circling wounded prey natives drifted past the hookers by now immune to such sights while latenight tourists darted uneasy looks at them the glances of the men perhaps lingering for a moment too long before returning to the street ahead or the faces of their partners a little moisture falling softly and secretly upon the seeds of their discontent ellen was different now before she had maintained a veneer of toughness and carried herself with a confidence that if she did not actually feel it in reality was still a sufficiently strong counterfeit of the original to enable her to live the life that had been forced upon her but now as i watched her stand on the corner a cigarette in her right hand she looked lost and fragile something had broken within her and she appeared even younger than she was i imagined that would have suited poppa bobby just fine as he could then sell her to men with such tastes as a fourteenor fifteenyearold and they would inflict themselves upon her with greater ferocity as a result i could see poppa bobby about halfway down the block leaning against the window of a convenience store pretending to read a newspaper like most of the pimps he kept his distance from the women under him when a john approached one of his team as he called them the girl would usually commence walking toward bobby in part so as not to attract the attention of any curious cops who might be watching by carrying on a conversation with a stranger at a street corner but also to allow the pimp to fall in behind maybe eavesdrop on the negotiations to make sure the girl wasnt trying to rip him off whenever possible bobby preferred to have nothing to do with the clients themselves it made them uneasy he knew to deal with a man shattering whatever illusions they might have had about the transaction in which they were engaged in addition if the john turned out to be an undercover cop then there was nothing to connect bobby to the girl i watched a man casing ellen from the subway entrance he was small and pale with a dodgers cap pressed down low on his head the cap failed to hide his eyes instead causing the hunger in them to shine more brightly in the shadow of its peak his right hand worried relentlessly at a small silver cross that dangled from a leather strap on his left wrist a misguided offering from a priest or a therapist perhaps so that when he felt the urge upon him he could touch it and derive from it the strength to resist his appetites except the touching of the cross had instead become an element of his preparations the icon an extension of his sexuality each stroke ratcheting his excitement up a notch so that sex and worship became inextricably bound together in a single act of transgression eventually he decided to make a move on her but i slipped past him and got to her first he seemed about to say something but i raised a finger to him in warning and reluctantly he backed away melting into the crowds until he could find another outlet for his cravings unseen by him a dark figure detached itself from a wall and followed him it took ellen a moment to recognize me when she did she tried to move around me hoping to attract poppa bobbys attention unfortunately poppa bobby was otherwise engaged he was sandwiched between two large italianamericans one of whom had a gun pressed into poppa bobbys side tony fulci was laughing his arm was draped around bobbys shoulder and he had clearly just told bobby to laugh along with him because bobbys mouth split reluctantly like a dropped orange tonys brother paulie was behind the two men with his right hand in the pocket of his leather jacket and his left clenched by his side forming a fist like the business end of a sledgehammer they led bobby to a dirty white van its motor running jackie garner was sitting in the drivers seat he nodded to me barely perceptibly before bobby was hustled into the back and the van pulled away where are they taking him said ellen it doesnt matter will he be back no she looked distraught what am i gonna do without him i got no money no place to go her teeth worried at her lower lip i thought she was about to cry your name is jennifer fleming i said you come from spokane and youre seventeen years old your mother reported you missing six months ago her boyfriend has since been charged with assault possession of a controlled substance with intent to supply and sexual abuse of a minor based upon photographs found in the apartment he shared with your mom the photographs were dated you were fifteen when they were taken your mom claims that she didnt know it was going on is that true jennifer was crying she nodded you dont have to go home yet if you dont want to i know a woman who runs a shelter upstate its pretty and youll have some time to think youll have your own room and there are green fields and woods to walk in if you like your mom can come visit you and you can talk about stuff but you dont have to see her until youre ready i didnt know what to expect from her she could have walked away and found shelter with some of the older women after all she had no reason to trust me men like gmack and poppa bobby had probably offered her protection too and extracted a heavy price in return but she didnt walk away she dried her tears with the back of her hand and suddenly she was just a lost girl the woman she had been forced to become disappeared entirely and the child that she still was took her place can we go now she said yes we can go now her eyes moved sideways looking past me i turned to see two men approaching one was skinny and black with gold chains at his wrist and neck the other was a fat white man wearing a red padded jacket and worn sneakers fuck you doing said the white guy wheres bobby at look over your shoulder i said what you heard me look over your shoulder he did it was a quick movement like a dog snapping at a fly over by the subway barely ten feet from us angel stood watching us louis was just rejoining him he dropped something into a trash can as he walked it looked like a dodgers cap angel waved tubby tapped his buddy on the shoulder and the small black man turned to see what the problem was shit he said if you dont walk away now those men will kill you they exchanged a look i never did like bobby anyway said the white guy whos bobby said the black guy they walked away and i left with jennifer angel and louis staying with us until we had retrieved my car from the parking garage we drove northwest beneath starless skies jennifer slept for part of the journey then found a station that she liked on the radio emmylou harris was singing lennon and mccartneys here there and everywhere one of those cover versions that most people have never heard but that most people should is this okay she said its fine i like the beatles their version is better but this is good too its sadder sometimes sad is good are you married she asked suddenly no got a girlfriend i wasnt sure how to answer i used to but not any more i have a little girl though i had another daughter once but she died her name was jennifer too was that why you came back for me because we have the same name if it was would that be enough i guess what will happen to poppa bobby i didnt answer oh she said and she said nothing else for a time then i was there yknow the night gmack got killed that wasnt his real name his real name was tyrone we were driving along the highway now away from the interstate there was little traffic ahead of us red lights ascended into the air like fireflies as a distant car scaled a dark unseen hill i didnt see the man who killed him she said i left before the police came i didnt want any trouble they found me though and they asked me about that night but i told them that i wasnt with him when he died she stared out the window her face was reflected in the glass i can keep a secret is what im saying she said i wont tell i didnt see the man who killed tyrone but i heard what he said before he pulled the trigger she didnt turn her face away from the glass i wont tell anyone else she said just so you know i wont ever tell another soul what did he say i asked he said she was blood to me there are still boxes in the hallway and clothes on the chairs some of them are rachels some are sams they buried ellis chamberss son neil today but i did not attend the funeral we save those whom we can save that is what i tell myself the house is so very quiet earlier i walked down to the seashore the wind was coming from the east but i felt a warm breeze on my face when i looked inland and i heard voices whisper to me in passing as the sea called to them welcoming them into its depths and i closed my eyes and let them wash over me their touch like silk upon me and their grace momentarily resonating in some deep part of me before it dissipated and was gone i looked up but there were no stars no moon no light and in the darkness beyond night brightwell waits i have been sleeping seated in a wicker chair on the gallery wrapped in a blanket despite the cold i do not want to be inside lying in the bed where so recently she too once lay looking at the empty reminders of our life together now something has awoken me the house is no longer silent there is a creak from a kitchen chair a door closes i hear what might be footsteps and the laughter of a child we told you that she would go away it was my decision i will add no more names to the palimpsest of the heart i will make reparation and i will be forgiven my sins the wind chime in the hallway casts its song into the still dark night and i feel a presence approach but we will never leave all is well all is well acknowledgments much of the historical detail is this novel is based on fact and the monasteries mentioned are all real in particular the ossuary at sedlec is much as i have described it although far more impressive visually than i could convey in words anyone interested can pay a virtual visit through my website wwwjohnconnollycouk but if you are lucky enough to find yourself in the czech republic then sedlec is worth a trip i would like to express my thanks to the staff at the ossuary to vladimira saiverova at the philip morris company which now owns the monastery at sedlec and to my czech guide marcela krskova for their kindness and assistance in researching the sedlec sections of this book i am also grateful to the wonderful luis urrea author of the devils highway for his help with matters of translation as always any mistakes are my fault not theirs finally i
