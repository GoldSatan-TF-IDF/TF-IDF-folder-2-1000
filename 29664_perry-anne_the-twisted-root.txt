anne perry the twisted root the young man stood in the doorway his face pale his fingers clenched on his hat twisting it around and around mr william monk agent of enquiry he asked he looked to be in his early twenties yes monk acknowledged rising to his feet come in sir how can i assist you lucius stourbridge he held out his hand coming farther into the room he did not even glance at the two comfortable armchairs or the bowl of flowers pleasantly scenting the air these had been hesters idea monk had been perfectly happy with the sparse and serviceable appearance the rooms had presented before how can i help you mr stourbridge monk asked indicating one of the chairs lucius stourbridge sat uncomfortably on the edge of it looking as if he did so more because he had been instructed to than from any desire he stared at monk intently his eyes filled with misery i am betrothed to be married mr monk he began my future wife is the most charming generous and nobleminded person you could wish to meet he glanced down then up at monk again quickly the ghost of a smile crossed his face and vanished i am aware that my opinion is prejudiced and i must sound naive but you will find that others also regard her most highly and my parents have a sincere affection for her i dont doubt you mr stourbridge monk assured him but he was uncomfortable with what he believed this young man would ask of him even when he most urgently needed work he only reluctantly accepted matrimonial cases and having just returned from an extravagant threeweek honeymoon in the highlands of scotland this was rapidly becoming one of those times he had an agreement with his friend and patron lady callandra daviot that in return for informing her of his most interesting cases andwhere she wished including her in the daytoday process she would replenish his funds at least sufficiently for his survival but he had no desire or intention that he should avail himself of her generosity any longer what is it that troubles you mr stourbridge he asked lucius looked utterly wretched miriammrs gardiner has disappeared monk was puzzled mrs gardiner lucius shook himself impatiently mrs gardiner is a widow she is he hesitated a mixture of irritation and embarrassment in his face she is a few years older than i it is of no consequence if a young woman fled her betrothal it was a purely private matter if there was no crime involved and no reason to suppose illness then whether she returned or not was her decision monk would not ordinarily have involved himself however his own happiness was so sharp he felt an uncharacteristic sympathy for the anguished young man who sat on the chair opposite him so obviously at his wits end monk could never before remember having felt that the world was so supremely right of course this was midsummer and he had no memory except in flashes of anything at all before the coaching accident in from which he had woken in hospital with a mind completely blank even so it was beyond his ability to imagine anything so complete as the wellbeing that filled him now after hester had accepted his proposal of marriage he had been alternately elated and then beset by misgivings that such a step would destroy forever the unique trust they had built between them perhaps they could not satisfactorily be anything more than friends colleagues in the fierce pursuit of justice he had spent many bleak nights awake cold with the fear of losing something which seemed more and more precious with every additional thought of no longer possessing it but as it happened every fear had vanished like a shadow before the rising sun over the great sweeping hills they had walked together even though he had discovered in her all the warmth and passion he could have wished she was still as perfectly willing and capable of quarreling with him as always of being perverse of laughing at him and of making silly mistakes herself not a great deal had changed except that now there was a physical intimacy of a sweetness he could not have dreamed and it was the deeper for having been so long in the discovery so he did not dismiss lucius stourbridge as his better judgment might dictate perhaps you had better tell me precisely what happened he said gently lucius took a gulp of air yes deliberately he steadied himself yes of course naturally im sorry i seem to be a little incoherent this has all struck me very hard i dont know what to think so much was quite apparent and monk with difficulty forbore from saying so he was not naturally tolerant if you would begin by telling me when you last saw missmrs gardiner that would be a place from which to proceed he suggested of course lucius agreed we live in cleveland square in bayswater not far from kensington gardens we were having a small party in celebration of our forthcoming marriage it was a beautiful day and we were playing a game of croquet when quite suddenly and for no apparent reason miriammrs gardinerbecame extremely distraught and rushed from the garden i did not see her go or i would have gone after herto find out if she was ill or if i could help is she often ill monk asked curiously genuine invalids were one thing but young women subject to fits of the vapors were creatures with whom he had no patience at all and if he were to help this unfortunate young man he must know as much of the truth as possible no lucius said sharply she is of excellent health and most equable and sensible temperament monk found himself flushing very slightly if anyone had suggested hester were the fainting sort he would have pointed out with asperity that she indisputably had more stomach for a fight or a disaster than they had themselves as a nurse on the battlefields of the crimea she had more than proved that true but there was no need to apologize to lucius stourbridge it had been a necessary question who saw her leave he asked calmly my uncle aiden campbell who was staying with us at the timeindeed he still is and i believe my mother also and one or two of the servants and other guests and was she ill i dont know that is the point mr monk no one has seen her since and that was three days ago and those people who did see her monk said patiently what did they tell you surely she cannot simply have walked out of the garden into the street alone without money or luggage and disappeared oh no lucius corrected himself the coachman treadwell is missing also and of course one of the coaches so it would appear that treadwell took her somewhere monk concluded since she left the croquet match of her own will presumably she asked him to take her what do you know of treadwell lucius shrugged slightly but his face was if anything even paler he has been with the family for three or four years i believe he is perfectly satisfactory he is related to the cooka nephew or something you dont think he could have harmed her monk had no idea but there was no purpose in causing unnecessary distress the young man was in a desperate enough state as it was i think it far more likely he merely took her wherever she wished to go he replied and then realized his answer made no sense if that were the case treadwell would have returned within hours but it does seem as if he may have taken your carriage for his own purposes other far darker thoughts came to his mind but it was too soon to speak of them yet there were many other simpler answers of everyday private tragedy which were more likely the most probable being that miriam gardiner had simply changed her mind about the marriage but had lacked the courage to face young lucius stourbridge and tell him so lucius leaned forward but do you believe miriam is safe mr monk if she is why has she not contacted me his throat was so tight his words were half strangled i have done everything i can think of i have spoken with every one of my friends she might have gone to i have searched my mind for anything i could have said or done to cause her to mistrust me and i can think of nothing we were so close mr monk i am as certain of that as of anything on earth we were not only in love but we were the best of friends i could speak to her of anything and she seemed to understand indeed to share my views and tastes in a way which made her at once the most exciting and yet the most comfortable person to be with he colored faintly perhaps that sounds absurd to you no monk said quickly too quickly he had spoken it from the heart and he was not accustomed to revealing so much of himself certainly not to a prospective client in a case he did not really want and which he believed impossible to see to a happy solution lucius stourbridge was gazing at him intensely his wide brown eyes deeply troubled no monk repeated with less emphasis i am sure it is possible to feel such an affinity with someone he hurried on away from emotion to facts perhaps you would tell me something of your family and the circumstances of your meeting mrs gardiner yes yes of course lucius seemed relieved to have something definite to do my father is major harry stourbridge he is now retired from the army but he served with great distinction in africa and particularly in egypt he spent much time there early in his career in fact he was there when i was born a faint smile touched his face i should like to go there someday myself i have listened to him speak of it with the greatest pleasure he dismissed the thought ruefully our family comes from yorkshirethe west riding that is where our land is all entailed on the male line of course but most substantial we go there occasionally but my mother prefers to spend the season in town i daresay most people do especially women do you have brothers or sisters monk interrupted no regrettably i am an only child monk did not remark that lucius would thus inherit this very considerable property but it was evident in the young mans face that he too had taken the point and his lips tightened a faint flush marked his cheeks my family has no objections to my marriage the younger man said with a slight edge of defensiveness he sat perfectly still in the chair looking straight at monk his eyes unblinking my father and i are close he is happy for my happiness and indeed he is fond of miriam mrs gardiner himself he sees no fault in her character or her reputation the fact that she has no dowry or property to bring to the marriage is immaterial i shall have more than sufficient for our needs and physical possessions are of no importance to me compared with the prospect of spending my life in the companionship of a woman of courage virtue and good humor and whom i love more than anyone else on earth his voice cracked a little on the last few words and the effort it cost him to keep his composure was apparent monk felt the other mans distress with a reality far greater than he could have imagined even a few weeks before in spite of his intention to concentrate entirely upon lucius stourbridges situation his mind recreated pictures of himself and hester walking side by side along a quiet beach in the lateevening sunlight the color blazing across the northern sky shadowing the hills purple in the distance and filling the air with radiance they had not needed to speak to each other knowing wordlessly that they saw the same beauty and felt the same desire to keep itand the knowledge that it was impossible and yet the fact that they had shared it gave the moment a kind of immortality and there had been other times laughter shared at the antics of a dog with a paper bag in the wind the pleasure of a really good sandwich of fresh bread and cheese after a long walk the climb to the top of a hill the gasp of wonder at the view and the relief at not having to go any farther if lucius had had any such happiness in his life and lost it for no reason he could understand no wonder he was at his wits end to find the answer however ugly or shattering to his dreams the truth might be he could not begin to heal until he knew it then i shall do all i can to discover what happened monk said aloud and if she is willing to return to you thank you lucius said eagerly his face brightening thank you mr monk cost will be no consideration i promise you i have more than sufficient means of my own but my father is also determined to find out what has happened to miriam what may i do to assist you tell me the story of your acquaintance and all you know about mrs gardiner monk replied with a sinking feeling inside him of course luciuss face softened the strain eased out of it as if merely remembering their meeting were enough to fill him with happiness i had called upon a friend of mine who lived in hampstead and i was walking back across the heath it was about this time of year and quite beautiful there were several people around children playing an elderly couple quite close to me just smiling together in the sun he smiled to himself as he described it there was a small boy rolling a hoop and a puppy chasing a stick i stopped and watched the dog it was so full of life bounding along with its tail wagging and returning the stick immensely pleased with itself i found i was laughing at it it was a little while before i realized it was a young woman who was throwing the stick once it landed almost at my feet and i picked it up and threw it back again just for the pleasure of watching of course she and i fell into conversation it all happened so naturally i asked her about the dog and she told me it actually belonged to a friend of hers his eyes were far away his memory sharp one subject of conversation led to another and before i realized it i had been talking with her for nearly an hour i made it my business to return the following day and she was there again he gave a very slight shrug of selfmockery i dont suppose for a moment she thought it was chance nor did i feel any inclination to pretend there was never that between us she seemed to perceive what i meant as naturally as if she had had the same thoughts and feelings herself we laughed at the same things or found them beautiful or sad i have never felt so totally at ease with anyone as i did with her monk tried to imagine it it was certainly not as he had felt with hester invigorated tantalized furious amused admiring even awed but not very often comfortable nothat was not entirely true now that he had at last acknowledged to himself that he loved her and had stopped trying to force her into the mold of the kind of woman he used to imagine he wanted but accepted her more or less as herself he was comfortable more often than he was not and of course there had always been the times when they were engaged in the same cause she had fought side by side with the courage and imagination the compassion and tenacity that he had seen in no other womanno other person then it was a kind of companionship which even lucius stourbridge could not guess at and so your friendship progressed he said going on to summarize what must have followed in time you invited her to meet your family and they also found her most likable yesindeed lucius agreed he was about to continue but monk interrupted him he needed the information that might help in his efforts to find the missing woman although he held little hope the outcome would prove happy for lucius or indeed for any of them a woman would not flee from her prospective husband and his house and remain gone for the space of several days without sending word unless there was a profound problem which she could see no way of solving what do you know of mrs gardiners first husband monk asked i believe he was somewhat older than she lucius answered without hesitation a man in a moderate way of business sufficient to leave her provided for and with a good reputation and no debts of money or of honor he said it firmly willing monk to believe him and accept the value of such things monk read within the omissions that the late mr gardiner was also of a very much more ordinary background than lucius stourbridge with his inherited lands and wealth and his fathers outstanding military career he would like to have known miriam gardiners personal background whether she spoke and comported herself like a lady whether she had the confidence to face the stourbridge family or if she was secretly terrified of them was she afraid every time she spoke of betraying some inadequacy in herself he could imagine it only too easily he had been the country boy from a northumbrian fishing village down in london trying to play the gentleman funny he only remembered that now thinking of miriam gardiner also trying to escape from an ordinary background and fit in with a different class of person every time she sat at the table had she also worried about using the wrong implement or making a foolish observation of being ignorant of current events or of knowing no one but he could not ask lucius such things if lucius were capable of seeing the answer he would not now be staring at monk so earnestly his dark eyes full of hope i think i had better begin by visiting your home mr stourbridge monk said aloud i would like to see where the event happened which apparently distressed mrs gardiner so much and with your familys permission speak to them and to your servants and learn whatever they are able to tell me of course lucius shot to his feet thank you mr monk i am eternally grateful to you i am sure if you can just find miriam and i could be certain that she is unhurt then we shall overcome everything else shadows filled his face again as he realized how strong was the possibility that she was not all right he could think of no reason otherwise why she would not have sent him some message when shall you be ready to depart monk felt rushed and yet lucius was right the matter was urgentin fact they might already be too late if he was going to attempt the job at all he should do it immediately he could leave a note for hester explaining that he had accepted a case and would return whenever he had made his first assessment of the situation he could not tell her in person because she was at the hospital working with callandra daviot of course it was in a purely voluntary way he had refused absolutely to allow her to help to support them by earning her own living the subject was still one of contention between them no doubt she would return to it sooner or later for the moment monk had a case himself and he must make himself ready to go with lucius stourbridge the stourbridge house in cleveland square in bayswater was handsome in the effortless style of those to whom money is not of concern its beauty was restrained and it had obviously been designed in an earlier and simpler age monk found it greatly pleasing and would have paused to admire it longer had not lucius strode ahead of him to the front door and opened it without waiting for a footman or maid come in he invited monk standing back and waving his hand as if to urge him to hurry monk stepped inside but was given no time to look around him at the hallway with its family portraits against the oak paneling he was dimly aware of one picture dominating the others a portrait of a horseman in the uniform of the hussars at the time of waterloo presumably he was some earlier stourbridge also of military distinction lucius was walking rapidly across the dark tiled floor towards the farthest doorway monk followed after him no more than glancing up at the finely plastered ceiling or the wide stairway lucius knocked on the door and after the slightest hesitation turned the handle and opened it only then did he look back at monk please come in he urged i am sure you will wish to meet my father and perhaps compare with him all that i have told you he stood aside his face furrowed with anxiety his body stiff father this is mr william monk he has agreed to help us monk walked past lucius into the room beyond he had a brief impression of comfortable wellused furniture not there for effect but for the pleasure of the occupant before his attention was taken by the man who stood up from one of the dark leather armchairs and came towards him he was slender and of little more than average height but there was a vigor and grace in him which made him commanding he was of similar build to lucius but in no other way resembled him he must have been in his fifties but his fair hair was hardly touched with gray and his blue eyes were surrounded by fine lines as if he had spent years narrowing them against a brilliant light how do you do mr monk he said immediately offering his hand harry stourbridge my son tells me you are a man who may be able to help us in our family misfortune i am delighted you have agreed to try and most grateful how do you do major stourbridge monk said with unaccustomed formality he shook stourbridges hand and looking at him a little more closely saw the anxiety in the older mans face that courtesy could not hide there was no sign of relief that miriam gardiner had gone for whatever reasons he was deeply troubled by her disappearance also i shall do my best monk promised painfully aware of how little that might be sit down stourbridge said indicating one of the other chairs luncheon will be in an hour will you join us thank you monk accepted it would give him an opportunity to observe the family together and to form some opinion of their relationshipsand perhaps how miriam gardiner might have fitted in as luciuss wife but before that sir i should like to speak more confidentially to you there are a number of questions i need to ask of course of course stourbridge agreed not sitting but moving restlessly about the room in and out of the broad splashes of sunlight coming through the windows lucius perhaps if you were to call upon your mother it was a polite and fairly meaningless suggestion intended to offer him an excuse to leave lucius hesitated he seemed to find it difficult to tear himself away from the only thing that mattered to him at the moment his intelligence must have told him there were discussions better held in his absence but he could not put his mind or his imagination to anything else she has missed you the elder stourbridge prompted she will be pleased to hear that mr monk is willing to assist us yes yes of course lucius agreed glancing at monk with the shadow of a smile then going out and closing the door harry stourbridge turned to monk the sunlight bright on his face catching the fine lines and showing more nakedly the tiredness around his eyes ask what you wish mr monk i will do anything i can to find miriam and if she is in any kind of difficulty to offer her all the help i can as you can see my son cares for her profoundly i can imagine no one else who will make him as happy monk found it impossible to doubt major stourbridges sincerity which placed upon him an even greater emotional burden why had miriam gardiner fled their house their family without a word of explanation had it been one sudden event or an accumulation of small things amounting to a whole too great for her what could it be that she could not even offer these people who loved her some form of explanation and where was treadwell the coachman stourbridge was staring at monk waiting for him to begin but monk was uncertain where to start harry stourbridge was not what he had imagined and he found himself unexpectedly sensitive to his feelings what do you know of mrs gardiner he asked more brusquely than he had intended pity was of no use to lucius or his father he was here to address their problem not wallow in emotions you mean her family stourbridge understood straightaway what monk was thinking she never spoke of them i imagine they were fairly ordinary i believe they died when she was quite young it was obviously a matter of sadness to her and none of us pursued the subject someone will have cared for her while she was growing up monk pressed he had no idea if it was a relevant point but there were so few obvious avenues to follow of course stourbridge agreed sitting down at last she was taken in by a mrs anderson who treated her with the greatest kindness indeed she still visits her quite frequently it was from mrs andersons home that she met mr gardiner when she was about seventeen and married him two years later he was considerably older than she he crossed his legs watching monk anxiously i made enquiries myself naturally lucius is my only son and his happiness is of the greatest importance to me but nothing i learned explains what has happened walter gardiner was a quiet modest man who married relatively late he was nearly forty but his reputation was excellent he was rather shy a trifle awkward in the company of women and he worked extremely hard at his businesswhich incidentally was the selling of books he made a modest success of it and left miriam well provided for by all accounts she was very happy with him no one had an ill word to say for either of them did they have children monk asked a shadow crossed stourbridges eyes no unfortunately not that is a blessing that does not come to every marriage he drew in his breath and let it out silently my wife and i have only the one child there was a sharp memory of pain in his face and monk was very aware of it it was a subject he himself had considered little he had no title or estates to leave and he had no memory of ever considering marriage far less a family he felt in no way incomplete without such a thing but then hester was not an ordinary woman he had married her with no thought of the comfort of domestic life she was not the one he would have chosen if he had the thought made him smile unconsciously one could not tell what the future might bring he had already surprised himself by changing as radically as he had perhaps in a few years he would think of children now he was honest enough to know that he would resent such other demands on hesters time and emotion as a child would have to be stourbridge was waiting for his attention she is somewhat older than your son monk put in as tactfully as he could exactly how much older is she a flash of amusement crossed stourbridges face nine years he replied if you are going to ask if she could give him an heir the answer is that i do not know of course we would like it if lucius were to have a son but it is not our main concern there is no guarantee of such a thing mr monk whomever one marries and miriam was never made to believe it was a condition of the marriage monk did not argue but he would judge for himself whether mrs stourbridge shared her husbands feelings so far his questions had elicited nothing in which he could see any reason for miriam gardiner to have left he wished he had a clearer picture of her in his mind seen through the eyes of lucius and harry stourbridge she was the model of the ideal woman their image gave her no flesh and blood and certainly no passions had they seen anything of the real woman beneath the surface they so much admired was it any use asking harry stourbridge anything further except bare facts was this her first visit to this house monk said suddenly stourbridge looked slightly surprised no not at all she had been here half a dozen times if you are thinking we did not make her welcome or that she felt overwhelmed or less than comfortable with the idea of living among us you are mistaken mr monk would she have lived here in this house monk asked envisioning a score of reasons why she might have found the prospect unendurable having been mistress of her own home no matter how ordinary compared with this house so close to kensington gardens she might find the sheer loss of privacy insupportable hester would have he could not imagine her spending the best part of her life under someone elses roof when she had nursed privately as she had since returning from the crimea she had always known that any position was temporary and that whatever its difficulties it would reach an end and shed had a measure of privacy and of autonomy in that the care of the patient was in her charge a whole new concept of imprisonment opened up to him harry stourbridge was smiling no mr monk i have properties in yorkshire and lucius is very fond of life in the north miriam had visited there some months agoi confess when the weather was a good deal less clementbut she was charmed by the area and was looking forward to moving there and being mistress of her own household so fear of losing a certain freedom was not what had driven miriam gardiner away monk tried again was there anything different about this visit major stourbridge not that i am aware except that it was a trifle more celebratory his face pinched with sadness and his voice dropped they were to be married in four weeks they desired a quiet wedding a family affair miriam did not wish large crowds or great expense she thought it both unseemly and unnecessary she loved lucius very deeply of that i have no doubt whatever he looked bemused i dont know what has happened mr monk but she did not leave because she ceased to love him or to know how profoundly he loves her it was pointless to argue the belief in stourbridges voice was complete it was going to be uniquely painful if facts proved him to be mistaken and monk were to find himself in the position of having to tell him so he should never have accepted this case he could not imagine any happy solution tell me something of your coachman james treadwell he asked instead stourbridges fair brows rose treadwell yes i see what you mean a perfectly adequate coachman good driver knows horses but i admit he is not a man for whom i have any natural liking he rested his elbows on the arms of his chair and made a steeple with his fingers i knew men like him in the army they can sit a horse like a centaur wield a sword ride over any terrain but one cannot rely on them always put themselves first not the regiment dont stand their ground when the battles against them but you kept him on stourbridge shrugged slightly you dont put a man out because you think you know his type could be wrong i wouldnt have had him as a valet but a coachman is a very different thing besides hes a nephew of my cook and shes a good woman shes been with the family nearly thirty years started as a scullery maid when my own mother was still alive monk understood like everything else it was so easily appreciated so very normal it left him little more to ask except for an account of the day itself on which miriam gardiner had fled i can give you a guest list if you wish stourbridge offered but it included no one miriam had not met before indeed no one who was not a friend believe me mr monk we have all searched our minds trying to think of anything that could have happened to cause her such distress and we can think of nothing whatever no one is aware of any quarrel even any unfortunate or tactless remark instinctively he glanced out of the window then back at monk again miriam was standing alone the rest of us were either playing croquet or watching when quite suddenly she gasped went as white as paper stood frozen for a moment then turned and stumbled away almost falling and ran towards the house his voice cracked none of us has seen her since monk leaned forward you saw this no not personally i would have gone after her if i had stourbridge looked wretched as if he blamed himself but it was described to me by several others and always in those terms miriam was standing alone no one spoke to her or in any other way approached her he frowned his eyes puzzled i have considered every possibility that common sense suggests mr monk we have called you because we can think of nothing further monk rose to his feet i shall do all i can sir he said with misgiving when lucius stourbridge had first explained his case monk had thought it an impossible one now he was even more convinced whatever had happened to miriam gardiner it arose from her own emotions and they would probably never know what it was that had so suddenly precipitated her into flight but even if they were to learn it would bring no happiness to them monk began to feel an anger against this young woman who had gone so thoughtlessly far along the path which a little consideration would have told her she could not complete she had hurt deeply at least two decent and honorable people probably more stourbridge stood also whom would you like to speak with next mr monk mrs stourbridge if you please monk replied without hesitation he knew from working with hester that women observed each other in a way a man did not they read expressions understood what was left unsaid of course stourbridge led the way out into the hall she will be in her sitting room at this hour monk followed him up the wide curving staircase and this time had an opportunity to look more closely at the magnificently plastered ceiling and the carving on the newel post at the top of the banister stourbridge crossed the landing a long window looked over the smooth lawn and monk caught a glimpse of croquet hoops still set up it looked peaceful in the sun a place of quiet happiness family games and afternoon tea in the summer trees sheltered hydrangeas beyond their last flowers dropping in a blaze of color onto the dark earth beneath stourbridge knocked on the third door along and at a murmur from inside opened it ushering monk in my dear this is mr monk he introduced them he has promised to assist us in finding miriam mrs stourbridge was sitting on a large chintzcovered chair a scrapbook of poetry and photographs spread open on the cherrywood table beside her where she had apparently laid it when interrupted her resemblance to her son was clear even at a glance she had the same dark eyes and slender line of cheek and throat her hair grew from her brow in the same broad sweep if lucius had indeed come to see her as his father had suggested he had not remained long she looked at monk with concern how do you do she said gravely please come in tell me how i can help my son monk accepted and sat in the chair opposite her it was more comfortable than its straight back would have suggested and the bright warm room would in any other circumstances have been restful now he was searching his mind for questions to ask this woman which could help him to understand what had driven miriam gardiner to such extraordinary flight stourbridge excused himself and left them verona stourbridge looked at monk steadily waiting there was no time for skirting around the edges of meaning would you please describe mrs gardiner for me he asked he wanted a picture in his mind not only to allow him to imagine her himself but to know how mrs stourbridge saw her she looked surprised where will you look mr monk we have no idea where she could have gone obviously we have already tried her home and she has not returned there her housemaid had not heard from her since she left to come here i would like a womans view of her he explained rather less romantic and perhaps more accurate oh i see yes of course she leaned back she was slender probably in her midforties and there was a natural elegance in the way she held her hands and in the sweep of her huge skirts over the chair looking at her face monk thought her observation of miriam gardiner would be clear and unsentimental perhaps the first that might offer some genuine insight into her character he watched her attentively she is of average height verona began measuring her words perhaps a trifle plumper than would be the choice for a young woman i daresay my son has already told you she was at least nine years older than he at least he questioned you mean she admitted to nine but you personally think it might be more she shrugged delicately without answering she has excellent hair fair and thick and with a becoming natural wave she continued blue eyes quite good complexion and teeth altogether a generous face indicating good nature and at least averagely good health she dressed becomingly but without extravagance i should imagine well within a moderate income she sounds a paragon of virtues mrs stourbridge monk remarked a little dryly i do not yet see a woman of flesh and bloodindeed a real woman at allmerely a recital of admirable qualities her eyebrows rose sharply she stared at him with chill then as he stared back gradually she relaxed i see she conceded of course you asked me what she looked like she was most pleasing her character was also agreeable but she was not incapable of independent thought you are asking me if she had faults of course she was stubborn at times she had some strange and unsuitable views on certain social issues she was overfamiliar with the servants which caused difficulties now and then i think she had much to learn in the running of a house of the size and standard my son would have required she kept her eyes steadily on monks very possibly she would not have been our first choice of wife for him there are many more suitable young women of our acquaintance but we were not unhappy with her mr monk nor could she have imagined that we were not even if she failed to give him an heir it was an intrusive and intimate question and a subject upon which emotions were often deep women had been abandoned because of it throughout history she looked a little pale but her hands did not tighten in her lap of course anyone would wish an heir but if you accept a person then you must do so wholeheartedly it is not something she could help if i thought she would have deliberately denied him then i would blame her for it but one thing i am perfectly sure of and that is that she loved him i do not know where she has gone or why mr monk i would give a great deal for you to be able to find her and bring her back to us unharmed and as gentle and loving as she was before monk could not doubt her the emotion in her voice betrayed a depth of distress he could feel in spite of the fact they had met only moments before and he knew nothing of her beyond the little that was obvious i will do all i can mrs stourbridge he promised i believe you did not see her leave the croquet party no i was speaking to mrs washburne and my attention was engaged she is not an easy woman was mrs gardiner apprehensive before the party not at all she was extremely happy there was no shadow in her face did she know all the guests yes she and i made up the list together did anyone come who was uninvited perhaps a companion to one of the invited guests no was there any disagreement or unpleasantness unwishedfor attention no she shook her head slightly but her eyes did not leave his it was a most enjoyable day the weather was perfect no one spoiled it by inappropriate behavior i have questioned all the servants and no one saw or heard anything except the usual trivial talk the worst that anyone knew of was a disagreement between mr wall and the reverend dabney over a croquet shots being rather poor sportsmanship it did not concern miriam she didnt play she smiled very slightly but there was no criticism in it no she said she preferred to watch i think actually she never learned and did not like to admit it he changed the subject the coachman treadwell he has not reappeared and i am told no one knows what happened to him either her face darkened that is true not entirely a satisfactory young man we employed him because he is the nephew of the cook who is a most loyal and excellent woman we cannot choose our relatives and of course your coach is still missing too indeed i shall ask your groom for a description of it and of treadwell that was a more hopeful line to pursue was there a maid who particularly looked after mrs gardiner while she stayed here yes amelia if you wish to speak with her i shall send for her thank you and your cook as well she may know something of treadwell there was a knock on the door and it opened before she had time to answer the man who came in was tall and broadshouldered a trifle thick about the waist his features were strong and the family resemblance was marked this is my brother mr monk mrs stourbridge said you must be the agent of enquiry lucius fetched in the man said he looked at monk with gravity and there was a note of sadness in his voice that could almost have been despair aiden campbell he introduced himself offering his hand i am afraid you are unlikely to have any success campbell continued glancing at his sister in half apology then back to monk mrs gardiner left of her own free will in the little we know of the circumstances that seems unarguable possibly she was experiencing severe doubts which up to that moment she had managed to conceal we may never know what suddenly caused her to realize her feelings he frowned at monk i am not convinced that seeking her will not lead to further unhappiness he took a deep breath we none of us desire that please be very careful what you do mr monk you may be led in sincerity to make discoveries we might be better not knowing i hope you understand me monk understood very well he shared the view he wished now he had been wise enough to follow his original judgment and refuse the case when lucius had first asked him i am aware of the possibilities mr campbell he answered quietly i share your opinion that i may not be able to find mrs gardiner and that if i do she still might wish to stand by her decision however i have given my word to mr stourbridge that i would look for her and i will do so then sensing the sharpness in campbells face he added i have informed him of my opinion as to the chances of success and i shall continue to be honest with him as to my progress or lack of it campbell remained silent pushing his hands into his pockets and staring at the floor aiden verona said gently i know you believe that she will not return and that only more disillusion and unhappiness will follow from seeking her but neither harry nor lucius will accept that they both feel compelled to do all they can to find out where she is if she is unhurt and why she left harry almost certainly for luciuss sake of course but he is nonetheless resolved i believe we should help them rather than make them feel isolated and as if we do not understand campbell raised his eyes and looked at her steadily of course he smiled but the effort behind it was apparent to monk of course my dear you are perfectly right it is something which must run its course how can i assist you mr monk let me take you to the stables and enquire after james treadwell he may be at the heart of this monk accepted thanking verona and excusing himself he followed campbell down the stairs and out of the side door to the mews the light was bright as he stepped outside the smells of hay horse sweat and the sharp sting of manure were strong in the closed heat of the yard he heard a horse whinnying and stamping its feet on the stones a gingerhaired boy with a brush in one hand looked up at him with curiosity answer mr monks questions billy campbell instructed hes come to help major stourbridge find treadwell and the missing carriage yer int never goin ter see them again i reckon billy replied pulling his mouth into a grimace of disgust carriage like thats worth a fair bit you think he sold it and went off monk asked billy regarded him with contempt course i do wot else e lit outta ere like e were on fire nobody never told im ter e never came back if e dint flog it wy int e ere perhaps he met with an accident monk suggested that dont answer wy e went in the first place billy stared at him defiantly less es dead e should a told us wot appened shouldnt e unless hes too badly hurt monk continued the argument billys eyes narrowed you a friend of is then ive never met him i wanted your opinion which obviously was not very high billy hesitated wellcant say as i like im he hedged on the other and cant say as i know anythink bad abaht im neither just that hes gorn likewhich is bad enough and mrs gardiner monk asked billy let his breath out in a sigh she were a real nice lady she were if e done anythink to er i ope as es deadan orrible dead at that do you not think she went with him willingly billy glanced at campbell then at monk his face registering his incredulity wotd a lady like er be wantin with a shifty article like im ceptin to drive er abaht now an then as wot is is job did she think he was a shifty article billy thought for a moment well phaps she dint a bit too nice for er own good she were innocent like if yer know wot i mean mrs gardiner was a trifle too familiar with the servants mr monk campbell clarified she may well have been unable to judge his character i daresay no one told her treadwell was employed largely because he was a relative to the cook who is highly regarded he smiled biting his lip good cooks are a blessing no household discards lightly and she has been loyal to the family since before my sister time he looked around the stable towards the empty space where the carriage should have been the fact remains treadwell is gone and so is a very valuable coach and pair and all the harness has it been reported to the police monk asked campbell pushed his hands into his pockets swaying a little onto his heels not yet frankly mr monk i think it unlikely my brotherinlaw will do that he makes a great show for luciuss sake of believing that mrs gardiner had not met some accident or crisis and all will be explained satisfactorily i am afraid i gravely doubt it i can think of no such circumstance which would satisfy the facts as we know them he started to walk away from the stable across the yard and towards the garden out of earshot of billy and whoever else might be in the vicinity monk followed and they were on the gravel path surrounding the lawn before campbell continued i very much fear that the answer may prove to be simply that mrs gardiner who was very charming and attractive in her manner but nonetheless not of lucius background realized that after the first flame of romance wore off she would never make him happy or fit into his life rather than face explanations which would be distressing and knowing that both lucius and major stourbridge as a matter of honor would try to change her mind she took the matter out of their hands and simply fled he looked sideways at monk a slightly rueful sadness in his face it is an action not entirely without honor in her own way she has behaved the best there is no doubt she is in love with lucius it was plain for anyone to see that they doted upon each other they seemed to have an unusual communion of thought and taste even of humor but she is older than he already a widow and from a very ordinary background this way it remains a grand romance the memory of it will never be soured by its fading into the mundane realities think very carefully mr monk before you precipitate a tragedy monk stood in the latemorning sun in this peaceful garden full of birdsong where perhaps such a selfless decision had been made it seemed the most likely answer a decision like that might be hysterical perhaps but then miriam gardiner was a woman giving up her most precious dream i have already told major stourbridge that if i find mrs gardiner i would not attempt to persuade her to return against her will monk answered or report back to him anything beyond what she wished me to that would not necessarily include her whereabouts campbell did not reply for several minutes eventually he looked up regarding monk carefully as if making some judgment which mattered to him deeply i trust you will behave with discretion and keep in mind that you are dealing with the deepest emotions and men of a very high sense of honor i will monk replied wishing again lucius stourbridge had chosen some other person of whom to ask assistance or that he had had the sense to follow his judgment not his sentimentality in accepting marriage seemed already to have robbed him of his wits i imagine they will be serving luncheon campbell said looking towards the house i assume you are staying i still have to speak to the servants monk answered grimly walking across the gravel even if i learn nothing hester shifted from foot to foot impatiently as she stood in the waiting room in the north london hospital the sun was hot and the closed air claustrophobic she thought with longing of the green expanse of hampstead heath only a few hundred yards away but she was here with a purpose there was a massive amount to do and as always too little time too many people were ill confused by the medical system if you could call it by so flattering a word and frightened of authority her desire was to improve the quality of nursing from the manual labor it usually was to a skilled and respected profession since florence nightingales fame had spread after the crimean war the public in general regarded her as a heroine she was second in popularity only to the queen but the popular vision of her was a sentimental image of a young woman wandering around a hospital with a lamp in her hand mopping fevered brows and whispering words of comfort rather than the reality hester knew she had nursed with florence nightingale and had experienced the despair the unnecessary deaths brought on by disease and incompetence rather than the injuries of battle she also knew miss nightingales true heroism the strength of her will to fight for better conditions for the use of common sense in sanitation and efficiency in administration above all she fought to make nursing an acceptable profession which would attract decent women and treat them with respect oldfashioned ideas must be got rid of uptodate methods must be used and skills rewarded now that hester was no longer solely responsible for her own support she could devote some of her time to this end she had made it plain to monk from the outset that she would never agree to sit at home and sew a fine seam and gossip with other women who had too little to do he had offered no disagreement knowing it was a condition of acceptance they had had certain differences and would no doubt have more she smiled now in the sun as she thought of them it was not easy for either of them to make all the changes necessary to adapt to married life deeply as she loved him sharing a bedroomlet alone a bedwith another person was a loss of privacy she found not as easy to overcome as she had imagined she was not especially modestnursing life had made that impossiblebut she still reveled in the independence of having the window open or closed as she wished of putting the light out when she chose and of having as many or as few blankets over her as she liked in the crimea she had worked until she was exhausted then she had lain on her cot hunched up shaking with cold muscles too knotted up to sleep and had to arise in the morning when she was still almost drunken with tiredness but to have the warmth the gentleness of someone beside her who she knew without question loved her was greater than all the tiny inconveniences they were only pinpricks she knew monk felt them too she had seen flashes of temper in his face quickly smothered when he realized he was thinking only of himself he was used to both privacy and independence as much as she was but monk had less to forfeit than hester they were living in his rooms in fitzroy street it made excellent sense of course she had only sufficient lodgings to house her belongings and to sleep in between the private nursing cases she had taken after being dismissed from hospital service for insubordination he was developing a good practice as an agent of enquiry for private cases after his own dismissal from the police forcealso for insubordination for him to have moved would have been unwise people knew where to find him the house was well situated and the landlady had been delighted to allow them an extra room to make into a kitchen and to give up having to cook and clean for monk a duty she had done only from necessity before realizing he would probably starve if she didnt she was very pleased to have both the additional rent and more time to devote to her increasingly demanding husbandand whatever other pursuits she enjoyed beyond fitzroy street so hester was with some difficulty learning to become domestic and trying to do it with a modicum of grace her real passion was still to reform nursing as it had been ever since she had come home from the crimea lady callandra daviot shared her feelings which was why hester was standing in the north london hospital now waiting for callandra to come and recount the success or failure of their latest attempt she heard the door opening and swung around callandra came in her hair sticking out in tufts as if she had run her fingers through it her face set tight and hard with anger there was no need to ask if she had succeeded callandra had dignity courage and good humor but not even her dearest friend would have said she was graceful in spite of the best efforts of her maid her clothes looked as if she paid no regard to them merely picking up what first came to her hand when she opened the wardrobe door today it was a green skirt and a blue blouse it was warm enough inside the hospital for her not to wear whatever jacket she had chosen the man is a complete idiot she said furiously how can anyone see to diagnose what ails a person for any of a hundred diseases and still be blind as a bat to the facts before his face i dont know hester admitted but it happens frequently the door was still wide open behind callandra she turned on her heel and marched out again leaving hester to follow after her how many hours are there in a day callandra demanded over her shoulder twentyfour hester replied as they reached the end of the passage and went through the nowempty operating theater with its table in the center benches for equipment and the railedoff gallery on three sides for pupils and other interested parties to observe exactly callandra agreed and how much of that time can a surgeon be expected to care for his patient personally one hour if the patient is importantless if he is not who cares for him the rest of the time she opened the farther door into the wide passageway that ran the length of the entire ground floor the resident medicine officer hester began apothecary callandra said dismissively waving her hand in the air hester closed the door behind them they prefer to call them resident medicine officers now she remarked and the nurses i know your point if we do not train nurses and pay them properly everyone elses efforts are largely wasted the most brilliant of surgeons is still dependent upon the care we give his patients after he has treated them i know that callandra hesitated deciding whether to go right towards the casualty room or left past the postmortem room to the eye department and the secretarys office and the boardroom you know that she decided to go left dr beck knows that she spoke his name quite formally as if they had not been friends for yearsand not cared for each other far more than either dared say but mr ordway is very well satisfied with things as they are if it were up to him wed still be wearing fig leaves and eating our food raw figs presumably hester said dryly or apples callandra shot her a sharp look figs she retorted with absolute certainty hed never have had the courage to take the apple then we would not be wearing the fig leaves either heaven preserve us hester pointed out hiding her smile marriage has made you decidedly immodest callandra snapped but there was satisfaction in her voice she had long wished hesters happiness and had once or twice alluded to fears that her friend might become too wasptongued to allow herself the chance they reached the end of the corridor and callandra turned right towards the boardroom she hesitated in her step so slightly that had hester not felt the trepidation herself she might not have noticed it at all callandra knocked on the door come in the voice inside commanded callandra pushed it open and went inside hester on her heels the man sitting at the large table was of stocky build his hair receding from a broad brow his features strong and stubborn his was not a handsome face but it had a certain distinction he was extremely well dressed in a suit of pinstriped cloth which must have been very warm on this midsummer day his white collar was high and stiff a gold watch chain was draped across his broad chest the expression on his face tightened when he recognized callandra it positively flinched when he saw hester behind her lady callandra he half rose from his seat as a gesture of courtesy she was not a nurse or an employee however much of a thorn in his side she might be what can i do for you he nodded at hester miss latterly mrs monk callandra corrected him with satisfaction his face flushed slightly and he gave a perfunctory nod towards hester in mute apology his hand brushed the papers in front of him indicating how busy he was and that only politeness prevented him from pointing out the fact that they were interrupting him mr thorpe callandra began purposefully have just spoken again with mr ordway to no avail nothing i can say seems to make him aware of the necessity for improving the conditions lady callandra he cut across her wearily his voice hardedged we have already discussed this matter a number of times as chairman of the governors of this hospital i have a great many considerations to keep in mind when i make my decisions and cost has to be high among them i thought i had adequately explained that to you but i perceive that my efforts were in vain he drew breath to continue but this time callandra interrupted him i understood you perfectly mr thorpe i do not agree all the money in the world is wasted if it is spent on operating upon a patient who is not adequately cared for afterwards lady callandra he sighed heavily his patience exceedingly thin his hand moved noisily over the papers rustling them together as many patients survive in this hospital as in most others if not rather more if you were as experienced in medicine as i am you would realize that it is regrettably usual for a great number of patients to die after surgery it is something that cannot be avoided all the skill in the world cannot hester could endure it no longer we are not talking about skill mr thorpe she said firmly all that is required to ease at least some of the distress is common sense experience has shown that thorpe closed his eyes in exasperation not miss nightingale again miss mrs monk he jerked his hand sharply scattering the papers over the desktop i have had enough letters from that woman to paper my walls she has not the faintest ideas of the realities of life in england she thinks because she did fine work in utterly different circumstances in a different country that she can come home again and reorganize the entire medical establishment according to her own ideas she has delusions both as to the extent of her knowledge and the degree of her own importance its not about personal importance mr thorpe hester replied staring straight at him or about who gets the praise at least it shouldnt be it is about whether a patient recovers or dies that is what we are here for that is what i am here for madam he said grimly what you are here for i have no idea your friends would no doubt say it is from a devotion to the welfare of your fellow human beings in their suffering your detractors might take the view that it is to fill your otherwise empty time and to give yourself a feeling of importance you would not have in the merely domestic setting of running your own household hester was furious she knew perfectly well that losing her temper would also lose her the argument and it was just possible that thorpe knew that also personally she didnt think he had the wit either way she had no intention of catering to him there are always people willing to detract with a spiteful remark she answered with as good a smile as she could manage it is largely made from ignorance and meanness of spirit i am sure you have more sense than to pay attention to them i am here because i have some practical experience in nursing people after severe injury whether caused by battle or surgery and as a consequence have learned some methods that work rather better than those currently practiced here at home you may imagine so thorpe looked at her icily his light brown eyes were large but a trifle deepset his lashes would have been the envy of many a woman hester raised her brows very high is it not better that the patient lives than that he dies thorpe half rose from his chair his face pink do not be flippant with me madam i would remind you that you have no medical training whatsoever you are unlearned and totally ignorant and as a woman unsuited to the rigors of medical science just because you have been of use abroad to soldiers in the extremity of their injuries while fighting for queen and country do not imitate the unfortunate miss nightingale in imagining that you have some sort of role to teach the rest of us how we should behave hester was quite well aware of florence nightingales nature far more so than fermin thorpe who knew her only through her voluminous correspondence to everyone even remotely concerned with hospital administration hester knew miss nightingales courage her capacity for work and her spirit which fired the labor and sacrifice of this and also her inexhaustible nagging and obsession with detail her highhanded manner and the overwrought emotions which drained her almost to the point of collapse she would certainly outlast fermin thorpe and his likeby sheer attrition if nothing else experience of the crimea of its hardships and its rare victories above all of its spirit calmed the retort that came to her tongue i am sure miss nightingale believes she is sharing the reward of experiences you have been unable to have for yourself she said with curdling sweetness having remained here in england she has not realized that her efforts are not welcome thorpe flushed scarlet im sure she means well he replied in a tone he presumably intended to be placating although it came through his teeth she simply does not realize that what was true in sebastopol is not necessarily true in london hester took a deep breath having been in both places she may imagine that as far as the healing of injury is concerned it is exactly the same i suffer from that illusion myself thorpes lips narrowed to a knifethin line i have made my decision madam the women who work in this establishment are quite adequate to our needs and they are rewarded in accordance with their skills and their diligence we will use our very limited financial resources to pay for that which best serves the patients needsnamely skilled surgeons and physicians who are trained qualified and experienced your assistance in keeping good order in the hospital in offering encouragement and some advice on the moral welfare of the patients is much appreciated indeed he added meaningfully it would be greatly missed were you no longer to come i am sure the other hospital governors will agree with me wholeheartedly good day there was nothing to do but reply as civilly as possible and retreat i suppose that man has a redeeming virtue but so far i have failed to find it callandra said as soon as they were outside in the corridor and beyond overhearing hes punctual hester said dryly hes clean she went on after a minutes additional thought they walked hastily back towards the surgeons rooms passing an elderly nurse her shoulders stooping with the weight of the buckets she carried in each hand her face was puffy her eyes redrimmed and sober hester added those are not virtues callandra said bitterly they are accidents of breeding and circumstance he has the opportunity to be clean and no temptation to be inebriated except with his own importance and that is of sufficient potency that after it alcohol would be redundant they passed the apothecarys rooms callandra hesitated as if to say something then apparently changed her mind and hurried on kristian beck came out of the operating theater but he had his coat on and his shirt cuffs were clean so apparently he had not been performing surgery his face lit when he recognized callandra then he saw her expression nothing he said more an answer than a question he was of barely average height his hair was receding a little above his temples but his mouth had a remarkable passion and sensitivity to it and his voice had a timbre of great beauty hester was aware that his friendship with callandra was more profound than merely the trust of people who have the same compassion and the same anger and the will to fight for the same goals how personal it was she had not asked kristian was married though she had never heard him speak of his wife now he was regarding callandra earnestly listening to her recount their conversation with thorpe he looked tired hester knew he had almost certainly been at the hospital all night seeing some patient through a crisis and snatching a few hours sleep as he could there were shadows around his eyes and his skin had very little color he wont even listen callandra said she had been weary the moment before and angry with thorpe and with herself now suddenly her voice was gentler and she made the effort to hide her sense of hopelessness i am not at all sure i approached him in the best way kristian smiled i imagine not he said with mild humor full of ruefulness and affection mr thorpe has not been blessed with a sense of humor he has nothing with which to soften the blows of reality it was my fault hester said quietly i am afraid i was sarcastic he provokes the worst in meand i let him we shall have to try again from a different angle i cannot think of one yet she looked at kristian and forced herself to smile he actually suggested that we should busy ourselves with discipline in the hospital and being of comfort to the patients she gritted her teeth perhaps i should go and say something uplifting her intention was to leave kristian and callandra alone for one of the few moments they had together even if they were only able to discuss the supply of bandages or domestic details of nurses boarding allowances and who should be permitted to leave the premises to purchase food callandra did not look at her they knew each other too well for the necessity of words and it was far too delicate a matter to speak of perhaps she was also selfconscious so much was known and so little said kristians mouth curled in acknowledgment of the absurdity of it hospital discipline was a shambles where the nurses were concerned and yet rigidly enforced upon the patients patients who misbehaved used obscene or blasphemous language fraternized with patients of the opposite sex or generally conducted themselves in an unseemly fashion could be deprived of food for one meal or more alcohol was banned smoking and gaming incurred discharge altogether regardless of whether the person in question was healed of his or her illness for nurses drunkenness was a different matter part of their wages was paid in porter and they were largely the type of person of whom no better was expected what other sort of woman scrubs sweeps stokes fires and carries slops and who but a maniac would allow such women to assist in the skilled science of medicine hester marched off actually to the apothecarys store leaving callandra alone in the corridor with kristian have you heard from miss nightingale kristian asked turning to walk slowly back towards the surgeons area of rooms it is very difficult callandra replied trying to choose her words with care the entire country had a burning respect for florence nightingale she was the perfect heroine artists painted pictures of her bending over the sick and injured heroes of the recent war in the crimea her gentle features suffused with compassion lit by the golden glow of a candle callandra knew the reality had been very different there was no sentimentality there no murmured words of peace and devotion miss nightingale was as much a fighter as any of the soldiers and a better tactician than most certainly better than the grossly incompetent generals who had led them into the slaughter she was also erratic emotional hypochondriacal and of inexhaustible passion and courage a highly uncomfortable creature of contradictions callandra was not always sure that hester appreciated quite what a difficult woman florence nightingale was her loyalty sometimes blinded her but that was hesters nature and they had both been more than glad of it in the past kristian glanced at callandra questioningly he knew little of the realities of the crimea he was from prague in the austrian principality of bohemia one could still hear the slight accent in his speech perfect as his english was he used few idioms although after this many years he understood them easily enough but he was dedicated entirely to his own profession in its immediacy the patients he was treating now were his whole thought and aim the woman with the badly broken leg the old man with the growth on his jaw the boy with a shoulder broken by the kick of a horse he was afraid the wound would become gangrenous the old man with kidney stones an agonizing complaint thank god for the marvelous new ability to anesthetize patients for the duration of surgery it meant speed was no longer the most important thing one could afford to take minutes to perform an operation not seconds one could use care even consider alternatives think and look instead of being so hideously conscious of pain that ending it quickly was always at the front of the mind and driving the hands oh shes perfectly right callandra explained referring back to florence nightingale again everything she commands should be done and some of it would cost nothing at all except a change of mind for some the most expensive thing of all he replied the smile rueful and on his lips not in his eyes i think mr thorpe is one of them i fear he will break before he will bend she sensed a new difficulty he had not yet mentioned what makes you believe that she asked even walking as slowly as they were they had reached the end of the corridor and the doorway to the surgeons rooms he opened it and stood back for her as two medical students deep in conversation passed by them on their way to the front door they nodded to him in deference barely glancing at her she went into the waiting room and he came after her there were already half a dozen patients he smiled at them then went across to his consulting room and she followed when they were inside he answered her any suggestion he accepts is going to have to come from someone he regards as an equal he replied with a slight shrug kristian beck was in every way intellectually and morally thorpes superior but it would be pointless for her to say so and embarrassing it would be far too personal it would betray her own feelings which had never been spoken there was trust a deep and passionate understanding of values of commitment to what was good she would never have a truer friend in these things not even hester but what was personal intimate was a different matter she knew her own emotions she loved him more than she had loved anyone else even her husband when he had been alive certainly she had cared for her husband it had been a good marriage youth and nature had lent it fire in the beginning and mutual interest and kindness had kept it companionable but for kristian beck she felt a hunger of the spirit which was new to her a fluttering inside both a fear and a certainty which was constantly disturbing she had no idea if his feelings for her were more than the deepest friendship the warmth and trust that came from the knowledge of a persons character in times of hardship they had seen each other exhausted in mind and body drained almost beyond bearing when they had fought the typhus outbreak in the hospital in limehouse a part of their inner strength had been laid bare by the horror of it the endless days and nights that had melted into one another sorrow over the deaths they had struggled so hard to prevent the supreme victory when someone had survived and of course there was the danger of infection they were not immune to it themselves kristian was waiting for her to make some response standing in the sun which made splashes of brightness through the long windows onto the worn wooden floor time was short as it always seemed to be between them there were people waitingfrightened ill people dependent upon their help but they were also dependent upon being adequately nursed after surgery their survival might hang on such simple things as the circulation of air around the ward the cleanliness of bandages the concentration and sobriety of the nurse who watched over them the depth of the nurses knowledge and the fact that someone listened to what she reported might be the difference between recovery or death i wish he wasnt such a fool callandra said with sudden anger it doesnt matter a jot who you are all that matters is if you are right what is he so afraid of change he said quietly loss of power not being able to understand he did not move as another man might have looking at the papers on his desk tidying this or that checking on instruments set out ready to use he had a quality of stillness she thought again with a hollow loneliness how little she knew of him outside hospital walls she knew roughly where he lived but not exactly she knew of his wife although he had seldom spoken of her why not it would have been so natural one could not help but think of those one loved a sudden coldness gripped her was it because he knew how she felt and did not wish to hurt her the color must be burning up her face even as she stood there or was it an unhappiness in him a pain he did not wish to touch far less to share and did she even want to know would she want him to say aloud that he loved her it could break forever the ease of friendship they had now and what would take its place a love that was forever held in check by the existence of his wife and would she want him to betray that she knew without even having to waste time on the thought that such a thing would destroy the man she believed he was nothing could be sweeter than to hear him say he loved her and nothing could be more dangerous more threatening to the sweetness of what they now had was she being a coward leaving him alone when he most needed to share to be understood or being discreet when he most needed her silence or was friendship all he wanted he had a wifeperhaps all he needed here in this separate life from the personal was an ally there are still medicines missing she said changing the subject radically he drew in his breath have you told thorpe no it was the last thing she intended to do no she repeated more calmly its almost certainly one of the nurses id rather find out who myself and put a stop to it before he ever has to know he frowned what sort of medicines all sorts but particularly morphine quinine laudanum dutch liquid and several mercurial preparations he looked down his face troubled it sounds as if shes selling them dutch liquid is one of the best local anesthetics i know no one could be addicted to all those or need them for herself he moved towards the door ive got to start seeing patients ill never get through them all have you any idea who it is no she said unhappily it was the truth she had thought about it hard but she barely knew the names of all the women who fetched and carried and went about the drudgery of keeping the hospital clean and warm the linen washed and ironed and the bandages rolled let alone their personal lives or their characters all her attention had been on trying to improve their conditions collectively have you asked hester he said her hand was on the doorknob i dont think she knows either she replied his face relaxed very slightly in a smilehumor not happiness shes rather a good detective though he pointed out callandra did not need to tell hester that medicines were missing she was already unhappily aware of it however it was not at the forefront of her mind as she left callandra and kristian and went to the patients waiting room she resented bitterly fermin thorpes admonition to her to go and offer comfort to the troubled and moral guidance to the nurses although both were tasks she fully believed in and intended to carry out it was their limitations she objected to not their nature she passed one of the nurses a comfortable woman of almost fifty pleasantfaced graybrown hair always falling out of its pins a little like callandras had their backgrounds not been so different the resemblance might have been more apparent this woman could barely read or write not much more than her name and a few familiar words of her trade but she was intelligent and quick to learn a new task and hester had frequently seen her actually tending to patients when she knew there were no doctors anywhere near she seemed to have an aptitude for it an instinctive understanding of how to ease distress lower a fever or whether someone should eat or not her name was cleo anderson she lowered her eyes now as hester passed her as if she wished to avoid attracting attention hester was sorry she would have liked to encourage her even with a glance there were some patients in the waiting room already five women and two men all but one of them were elderly their eyes watchful in unfamiliar surroundings afraid of what would happen to them of what they could be told was wrong of the pain of treatment and of the cost their clothes were worn thin here and there a clean shirt showed under a faded coat some of their treatment was free but they still had to pay for food while they were in hospital and then after they left for medicine as well if it was necessary she chose the most wretched looking of the patients and went over to him he peered up at her his eyes full of fear her bearing suggested authority to him and he thought he was about to be chastised although he had no idea what for whats your name she enquired with a smile he gulped arry jackson maam is this your first time here mr jackson she spoke quietly so only those closest to him would overhear yes maam he mumbled looking away i wouldnt a come but our lil said as i ad ter always fussin she is shes a real good girl said as theyd find the money someow he lifted his head defiantly now an she will maam yer wont be done short wotever im sure she agreed softly but it wasnt money i was concerned about a spasm of pain shot through him and for a moment he gasped for breath she did not need mr thorpes medical training to see the ravages of disease in his gaunt body he almost certainly had consumption and probably pleurisy as well considering the way he held his hand over his chest he looked considerably over sixty but he might not actually have been more than fifty there would be little the physician could do for him he needed rest food clean air and someone to care for him morphine would help the pain and sherry in water was an excellent restorative they were probably all impossibly expensive for him his clothesand even more his mannerspoke of extreme poverty he looked at her with disbelief she made up her mind ill speak to dr warner and see if you shouldnt stay here a few days she stopped at the alarm in his face rest is what you need i got a bed he protested of course but you need quiet and someone who has time to look after you his eyes widened not one o them nurses the thought obviously filled him with dread she struggled for an argument to persuade him but all that came to her lips were lies and she knew it many of the nurses were kindly enough but they were ignorant and often hardpressed by poverty and unhappiness themselves ill be here she said instead she had placed herself in a position where she had to say something wot are yer then his curiosity got the better of his awe im a nurse she answered rashly and with a touch of pride i was out in the crimea he looked at her with amazement the word was still magic was yer his eyes filled with hope and she felt guilty for how simply shed done it and with so little consideration of what she could fulfill if only they could persuade thorpe to see how much it mattered that all nurses should inspire this trust not in miracles but in competence gentleness and sobriety but how could they when they were given no training and it was so blatantly apparent that the doctors had little but contempt for them the anger inside her was rock hard unconsciously her body clenched harry jackson was still staring at her she must talk to him reassure him no one could heal his illness like half of the people in this room he was long past that kind of help but she could comfort his fear and for a time at least alleviate his pain the physician came to the door and called the first patient he looked frustrated and tired in a clean frock coat and trousers that were a little wrinkled at the knees he also knew he could do little that was of real help hester moved to another patient and talked with him listening to his tales of family home the difficulties of trying to make ends meet let alone to pay for medicine when you were too sick to work a nurse walked through the room carrying an empty pail its metal handle clinking against the rings that held it the woman was stout dark about forty she did not look to either side of her as she passed the waiting people she hiccuped as she went out of the far door she was in a world of her own exhausted by hard physical labor lifting bending carrying scrubbing mealtimes and more important drink times would be the highlights of her day then she could share the odd joke with the other women and the brief euphoria of alcohol which shut out reality it was all a long way from the dream of a sweetfaced woman with a lamp in her hand who would murmur words of hope and miraculously save the dying and that too was a long way from the passionate tireless shorttempered vulnerable woman who sat in her house passing out orders pleas and advicealmost all of it goodand being stoically ignored by men like fermin thorpe it was six oclock before the last patient had been seen hester had managed to persuade the physician to admit harry jackson for a few days and she savored that small victory she was consequently smiling as she tidied the waiting room the door opened and she was pleased to see callandra who now looked even more disheveled than usual her skirt was crumpled her blouse open at the neck in the heat and she had obviously been working because her sleeves were rolled up and stained with splashes of water and blood her hair was coming out of its pins in all directions it needed taking down brushing and doing again absentmindedly callandra pulled out a pin caught up a bunch of hair and replaced it all making the whole effect worse she closed the door and glanced around to make sure the room was empty and all other doors were closed also hes gone hester assured her callandra rubbed the back of her hand across her brow theres more medicine gone today she said wearily i checked it this morning and again now its not a lot but im quite sure hester should not have been surprised but she felt a cold grip inside her close tighter it was systematic someone was taking medicines every day or two and had been doing so for a long time perhaps months possibly even years a certain amount of error or theft was expected but not of this order does mr thorpe know yet she asked quietly not about this callandra replied its getting worse for a wild moment hester actually entertained the idea that the thefts could be used to pressure fermin thorpe into seeing the necessity for training and paying better nurses then she realized that disclosure of the problem would only end in a fullscale investigation possibly involving the police and all the present staff innocent and guilty alike would suffer possibly even be dismissed in all probability not one would be able to prove her honesty still less her sobriety the whole hospital would grind to a standstill and no good would be achieved at all hes going to find out soon callandra said interrupting hesters thoughts theyll have to be replaced have we any idea who it is hester struggled for something tangible to pursue weve got twentyeight women here doing one thing or another all of them are hard up very few of them can read or write more than a few words some not that much half of them live in the hospital the other half come and go at all hours but the apothecarys rooms are locked hester pointed out are they stealing the keys or do you suppose they can pick the lock pick the lock callandra said without hesitation or sneak in and out when hes got his back turned hes as careful as he can be but he knows there are losses oh yes he doesnt like thorpe any more than we do well not much hell not report it till he has to he knows what chaos it will be but he cant carry on hiding it much longer there was a knock on the door callandra opened it and cleo stood there a look of polite enquiry on her face yer ungry love she said cheerfully theres a nice bit o cold beef an pickle goin if yer fancy it an fresh bread a glass o porter hester had not realized it but at mention of the food she was aware of how long it had been since she last ate or sat down comfortably without the need to find words to comfort a frightened inarticulate old man or woman powerless as she was to give any real help yes she accepted quickly please cleo jerked her hand to the right along there love same as usual she withdrew and they heard her feet clattering away on the hard floor they went together up to the staff room and sat at one of the plain wood tables all around them other women were eating with relish and the porter glasses were lifted even more often than the forks there was a little cheerful conversation in between mouthfuls or during they overheard many snatches dead e were in a week poor devil but wot can yer spect eh ad no choice but ter cut im open went bad it did seen it comin yeah well appens don it ere ave another glass o porter fanks im that tired i need summink ter keep me eyes open i gorn an popped that at like yer told me got one and tenpence fer it bastard id a thought ed

seven bells outta joe pake tother day and got isself locked up fer a while good riddance i say yer got any more o that pickle im that ungry ta hester had heard a hundred conversations like it the small details of life for the women who were entrusted with the care of frightened and ignorant people after the surgeons knife had done its best to remove the cause of their pain and the long road to recovery lay ahead of them perhaps if i got figures together hester said softly as much to herself as to callandra i could prove to thorpe the practical results of having women with some degree of training she kept her voice low not to be overheard women with an intelligence and an aptitude for it like cleo anderson i know it would cost more as he would be the first to point out but it would be richly rewarded moneys only the excuse im sure of that she was reaching for reasons arguments the weakness in his armor if he thought he would get the credit if his hospital were to have greater success than any other callandra looked up from her bread and pickle ive tried that a heavy bunch of hair fell out of its pins and she poked it back leaving the ends sticking out i thought id catch his vanity nothing hed like better than to outdo dr gilman at guys hospital but he hasnt the courage to try anything he isnt sure of if he spent money and there were no results soon enough she left the rest unsaid they had been around and around these arguments or ones like them so many times it was all a matter of convincing thorpe of something he did not want to know i suppose its back to writing more letters hester said wearily taking another slice of bread callandra nodded her mouth full she swallowed hows william bored hester said with a smile longing for a case to stretch his wits when hester arrived home at fitzroy street it was a little after seven oclock that evening monk had already returned and was waiting for her there were faint lines of tiredness in his face but nothing disguised his pleasure in seeing her she still found it extraordinary it brought a strange quickening of the heart and tightness in the stomach to remember that she belonged here now in his rooms that when night came she would not stand up and say goodbye uncertain when she would see him again there was no more pretending between them no more defense of their separateness they might go to the bedroom one at a time but underlying everything was the certainty that they would both be there together all night and waken together in the morning she did not even realize she was smiling as she thought of it but the warmth was always in her mind like sunshine on a landscape lighting everything she kissed him now when he rose to greet her feeling his arms close around her the gentleness of his touch perhaps surprised him more than her whats for dinner was the first thing he said after he let her go it had not crossed her mind that she would need to cook for him she had eaten at the hospital as a matter of habit the food was there she was thinking of the missing medicines and thorpes stubbornness there was food in their small kitchen of course but it would require preparing and cooking even so it would not take more than three quarters of an hour at most she could not bear the thought of eating again so soon but she could not possibly tell him to have forgotten about him was inexcusable she turned away thinking frantically theres cold mutton would you like it with vegetables and theres cake yes he agreed without enthusiasm had he expected her to be a good cook surely he knew her better than that did he imagine marriage was somehow going to transform her magically into a housekeeping sort of woman perhaps he did all she wanted to do was sit down and take her boots off tonight was her own fault but the specter of years of nights like this was appalling coming home from whatever she had been doing been fighting foror againstand having to start thinking of shopping for food bargaining with tradesmen making lists of everything she needed peeling chopping boiling baking clearing away and then laundry ironing sweeping she swallowed hard emotions fighting each other inside her she loved him liked him at times loathed him admired him despised him a hundred things but always she was tied to him by bonds so strong they crowded out everything else what did you do today she asked aloud what was racing through her head was the possibility of acquiring a servant a woman to come in and do the basic chores she herself was so illequipped to handle how much would it cost could they afford it she had sworn she was not going to go back to nursing in other peoples houses as she had done until their marriage her smile widened as she remembered the day automatically she washed her hands filled the pan with cold water and set it on the small stove to boil then reached for potatoes carrots onions and cabbage their wedding day had been typical of late spring glittering sunshine gold on wet pavements the scent of lilacs in the air the sound of birdsong and the jingle of harness horses hooves on the cobbles church bells excitement had fluttered in her chest so fiercely she could hardly breathe inside the church was cool a flurry of wind had blown her skirt around her she could see the rows of pews now in her minds eye the floor leading to the altar worn uneven by thousands of feet down the centuries the stained glass of the windows shone like jewels thrown up against the sun she had no idea what the pictures were all she had seen after that had been monks stiff shoulders and his dark head then his face as he could not resist turning towards her he was leaning against the door lintel talking to her now and she had not heard what he had said im sorry she apologized i was thinking about the dinner what did you say why had she not told him what she was really thinking too sentimental it would embarrass him lucius stourbridge he repeated very clearly his bridetobe left the party in the middle of a croquet game and has not been seen since that was three days ago she stopped scraping the carrots and turned to look at him left how didnt anybody go after her they thought at first shed been taken ill he told her the story as he had heard it she tried to imagine herself in miriam gardiners place what could have been in her mind as she ran from the garden why it was easy enough to think of a moments panic at the thought of the change in her life she was committing herself to and things that would be irrevocable once she had walked down the aisle of the church and made her vows before godand the congregation but you overcame such things you came back with an apology and made some excuse about feeling faint or if you really had changed your mind you said so perhaps with hideous embarrassment guilt fear but you did not simply disappear what is it he asked looking at her face have you thought of something she remembered the carrots and started working again although the longer it took to prepare dinner the more chance there was she could force herself to eat again her fingers moved more slowly i suppose there wasnt someone else she asked the pan was coming to the boil little bubbles beginning to rise from the bottom and burst she should hurry with the potatoes and put on a second pan for the cabbage if she chopped it fiercely it would not take long he said nothing for a few moments i suppose its the only answer he concluded treadwell must be involved somehow or why didnt he come back he saw his chance to steal the coach and he just took it she suggested putting the potatoes and carrots into the pan a little salt in it then the lid on william what how should she approach this without either inviting him to tell her to give up working at the hospital on one hand or on the other implying that she expected a higher standard of living than he was able to offer her are you going to take the case i already told you that i wish i hadnt but i gave my word why do you regret it she kept her eyes on the knife her fingers and the cabbage because theres nothing i could find out that would bring anything but tragedy to them he replied a little tartly she did not speak for a few minutes busying herself with getting out the mutton first and carving slices off it and then replacing it in the pantry she found the last of the pickles she should have purchased moreand set the table do you think she began he was watching her as if seeing her performing those domestic duties gave him pleasure was it she or simply the warmth of belonging particularly after the unique isolation of his years without memory the comforts of the past which did not exist for him except in shadows and the fear of what he would find do i think what he asked your pan is boiling thank you she eased the lid a little it was time to put the cabbage in as well hester yes you used to be the most straightforward woman i ever knew now you are tacking and jibbing like she pushed past him please dont stand in the doorway i cant move around you he stepped aside what do you think made miriam gardiner change her mind so suddenly fear she thought sudden overwhelming knowledge of what promises she was making her life her fortunes for good or ill her name her obedience perhaps most of all her body would belong to someone else perhaps in that moment as she had stood in the sunlight in the garden it had all been too much forever till death do us part you have to love someone very much indeed overwhelmingly you have to trust him in a deep fierce and certain way that lies even closer to the heart than thought in order to do that william do you think we could afford to have a woman in during the day to cook for us and purchase food and so on so that we could spend together the time we have and be sure of a proper meal she did not look at him she stood with body tight waiting for his response the words were said there was silence except for the bubbling of the water and the jiggling of the pan lid she moved it a little farther off and the steam plumed out she wished she knew what he was thinking money or principle would someone else be an intrusion hardly everyone had servants money they had already discussed that he had accepted callandras help earlier on as a matter of necessity now it was different he would never permit anyone else to support his wife they had battled over her independence already she had won it was an unspoken condition of happiness it was the only thing in which he had been prepared to give ground it was probably the surest gauge of his love for her the memory of it filled her with warmth its not important she said impulsively i then she did not know what else to say without spoiling it overexplanation always did theres no room for anyone to live in he said thoughtfully she would have to come every day she found herself smiling a little skip of pleasure inside her oh of course perhaps just afternoons is that sufficient he was generous now possibly even rash one never knew what cases he would have in the future oh certainly she agreed she took a skewer and tested the potatoes not ready yet could she have discovered something about lucius that made the thought of marrying him intolerable she asked or about his family perhaps not that instant he answered no one was standing anywhere near her far less speaking to her it was just a garden croquet match full of social chatter very open quite public she couldnt have surprised him with another woman if thats what you are thinking and there was certainly no quarrel nor was it a question of being overwhelmed or feeling a stranger she had been there many times before and already knew everyone present she helped compile the guest list she said nothing i want your thoughts he prompted you are a woman do you understand her should she tell him the truth would he be hurt she had learned that he was far more vulnerable than his hard exterior showed he had courage anger wit he was not easily wounded he felt too fiercely and too completely for others to sway him he knew what he believed it was part of what drew her to him and infuriated her sometimes even frightened her but since they had been married she had learned the tenderness underneath it was seldom in his words but it was in his touch the way his fingers moved over her body as if even in moments of greatest passion he never forgot her heart and her spirit inside the flesh she was never less than herself to him for that she would always love him hold back no portion of herself in fear or reserve but she could not have known that before miriam gardiner could not know that she turned around to face him we dont know what her first marriage was like not truly she said meeting his eyes not when the doors were closed and they were alone together perhaps there were things in that which made her suddenly afraid of committing herself irrevocably again his gray eyes searched hers she saw the question in them the flicker of uncertainty you cannot know beforehand how well or ill it will be she said very quietly one can be hurt she did not say or be repulsed exhausted feel used or soiled but she knew he understood it perhaps they knew each other very little in that regard she said aloud then in case he should imagine she had the slightest doubt or fear herself she put her arms around his neck and brushing her fingers gently over his ears and into his hair kissed his mouth his response spoiled the dinner and sealed his determination to begin looking for a woman to take over domestic duties from now on monk left home early the following morning it was long before he felt like leaving but if he were to have any success in helping lucius stourbridge he must find out what had happened to james treadwell and the carriage then he would have a far better chance of tracing some clue or indication where miriam had gone perhaps even why he surprised himself when he realized how much he dreaded the answer it was now four days since her disappearance and getting more difficult to follow her path with each hour that passed he took a hansom to bayswater and began by seeking the local tradesmen who would have been around at the hour of the afternoon when miriam fled he was lucky to find almost immediately a gardener who had seen the carriage and knew both the livery and the horses a distinctive bay and a brown illmatched for color but perfect for height and pace aye he said nodding vigorously a trowel in his hand aye it passed me going at a fair lick dint see who were in it mind wondered at the time knew as they ad a party on seed all the carriages comin thought as someone were took ill mebbe that wot appened we dont know monk replied he would not tell anyone the stourbridge tragedy but it would be public knowledge soon enough unless he managed not only to find miriam but to persuade her to return as well and he held no real hope of that did you see which way they went the gardener looked puzzled the coachman seems to have stolen the coach and horses monk explained the gardeners eyes widened arrr he sighed shaking his head never heard that what a thing whats the world coming to he lifted his hand trowel extended went round that corner there i never sawd im after that road goes north if ed wanted to go to town ed a gone tother way less traffic werent nobody after im got clean away i spose monk agreed thanked him and followed the way he had indicated walking smartly to see if he could find the next sighting he had to cast around several times and walked miles in the dusty heat but eventually footsore and exhausted he got as far as hampstead heath and then the trail petered out by this time it was dusk and he was more than ready to find a hansom and go home the idea held more charm than it had a month or two ago when it would have been merely a matter of taking his boots off his aching feet and waiting for his landlady to bring his supper now the hansom could not move rapidly enough for him and he sat upright watching the streets and traffic pass the next morning monk went early to the hampstead police station when he had been a policeman himself he could have demanded assistance as a matter of course now he had to ask for favors it was a hard difference to stomach perhaps he had not always used authority well that was a conclusion he had been forced to reach when his loss of memory had shown him snatches of his life through the eyes of others it was unpleasant and unexpectedly wounding to discover how many people had been afraid of him partly because of his superior skills but far too often due to his cutting tongue anything he was given today would be a courtesy he was a member of the public no more except of course if he had had occasion to come here in the past and they remembered him with unkindness that thought made him hesitate in his step as he turned the corner of the street for the last hundred yards to the station doors he had no idea whether they would know him or not he felt the same stab of anxiety guilt and anticipation that he had had ever since the accident and his realization of the kind of man he had been and still was very often something in him had softened but the hard tongue was still there the sharp wit the anger at stupidity laziness cowardiceabove all at hypocrisy he took a deep breath and went up the steps and in through the door the duty sergeant looked up pleased to see someone to break his morning he hated writing ledgers though it was better than idlenessjust mornin sir lovely day int it wot can i do for you good morning sergeant monk replied searching the mans pleasant face for recognition and feeling a tentative hope when it was not there he had already decided how he was going to approach the subject i am looking into a matter for a friend who is young and at the present too distressed to take it up himself im sorry sir what matter would that be robbery is it the sergeant enquired helpfully leaning forward a little over the counter yes monk agreed with a rueful smile and a slight shrug but not what you might expect rather more to it than that something of a mystery he lowered his voice and i fear a possible tragedy as well although i am hoping that it is not so the sergeant was intrigued this promised to occupy his whole day maybe longer oh yes sir what exactly was stolen a coach and horses monk answered good pair to drive a bay and a brown very well matched for height and pace and the coach was excellent too the sergeant looked puzzled you sure as its stole sir not mebbe a member o the family got a bit irresponsible like and took it out young men will race sir bad as it is an dangerous too quite sure monk nodded i am afraid it was five days ago now and it is still missing not only that but the driver who took it has not come back and neither has the young lady who was betrothed to my friend naturally we fear some harm has befallen her or she would have contacted a member of the family the sergeants face was full of foreboding oh dear that dont sound good sir i must say monk wondered if he was thinking that miriam had run off with treadwell it was not impossible monk would have formed a better judgment on that if he had seen either of them but from the description he had of treadwell from the other stourbridge servants the coachman did not seem a man likely to have attracted a charming and gentle widow who had the prospect of marrying into an excellent family and becoming the wife of a man with whom by all accounts she was deeply in love certainly lucius stourbridge loved her no it doesnt monk said aloud i have traced the carriage as far as the edge of hampstead heath but then i lost it if it has been seen anywhere around this area it would help me greatly to know it course the sergeant agreed nodding we got a good ospital ere mebbe she was took ill sudden like theyd a taken er in very charitable they are or mebbe she ad a sudden breakdown in er mind like young women can ave sometimes i shall certainly enquire at the hospital monk agreed although the sergeant had to be speaking about the hospital where hester was and he had already asked her if there had been any such young woman either seen or admitted in either case unless she were unconscious why had she not made some effort to contact the stourbridge family but i must also look further for the coach he went on that may lead me to where she is and in truth the theft of the coach is the only aspect of the matter which breaches the law course the sergeant said sagely course sergeant robb is very busy at the moment got a murder e as poor feller beaten over the ead and left on the path outside some womans ouse but e int gorn out yet today i know that for a fact an im sure as ell spare yer a few minutes like thank you very much monk accepted i shant hold him up for long you wait there sir an ill tell im as yer ere and the sergeant lumbered dutifully out of sight he returned followed by a slender young man with a goodhumored face and dark intelligent eyes he looked harassed and it was obvious he was sparing monk time only to be civil and because the desk sergeant had committed him to it little of his mind was on the subject good morning sir he said pleasantly sergeant trebbins says you are acting on behalf of a friend who has had a coach stolen seemingly by his fiancee i am afraid if they have chosen to elope it is probably ill advised and certainly less than honorable but it is not a crime the matter of stealing a coach and pair of course we can look into if you have reason to believe they came this way i do i have followed the sightings of the coach as far as the edge of the heath was that yesterday sir no im afraid it was five days ago monk felt foolish as he said it and he was ready for disinterest and even contempt in the young mans eyes instead he saw his whole body stiffen and heard a sharp intake of breath could you describe the driver of this coach sir and the coach itself possibly the horses even monks pulse quickened youve seen them then instantly he regretted the unprofessionalism of such a betrayal of emotion but it was too late to withdraw it comment would only make it more obvious robbs face was guarded i dont know sir could you describe them for me he could not keep the edge from his voice the sharpness of needing to know monk told him every detail of the coach the color style dimensions makers name he said that the horses were a brown and a bay no white markings fifteen hands and fifteenone respectively and seven and nine years old robb looked very grave and the driver he said softly the knot tightened in monks stomach average height brown hair blue eyes muscular build at the time he was last seen he was wearing livery he knew even before he had finished speaking that robb knew much about it and none of it was good robb pressed his lips together hard a moment before speaking im sorry sir but i think i may have found your coach and horses and your driver i dont know anything about the young lady would you come inside with me sir the desk sergeants face fell as he realized he was going to be excluded from the rest of the story monk remembered to thank him something he would not have done even a short while ago the man nodded but monks gesture did not solve his disappointment robb led monk to a tiny office piled with papers monk felt a jolt of familiarity as if he had been carried back in time to the early days of his own career he still did not know how long ago that was robb took a pile of books off the guest chair and dropped them on the floor there was no room on the already precariously piled table sit down sir he offered he had not yet asked monks name he sat in the other chair he was a young man in whom good manners were so schooled they came without thought william monk monk introduced himself and was idiotically relieved to see no sign of recognition in the other mans face the name meant nothing to him im sorry mr monk robb apologized but at the moment i am investigating a murder of a man who answers fairly well to the description you have just given me what is worse im afraid is that about half a mile away we found a coach and two horses which are almost certainly the ones you are missing the coach is exactly as you say and the horses are a brown and a bay well matched about fifteen hands or so he tightened his lips again and the dead man was dressed in livery monk swallowed when did you find him five days ago robb replied meeting monks eyes gravely im sorry and he was murdered you are sure yes the police surgeon cant see any way he could have come by those injuries by accident fallen off the box monk suggested treadwell would certainly not have been the first coachman to be a little drunk or careless and topple off the driving seat striking his head against an uneven cobblestone or the edge of the curb many a man had fallen under his own wheels and even been trampled by vehicles behind him unable to stop in time robb shook his head his eyes not leaving monks face if hed fallen off the box his clothes would show it you cant land on the road hard enough for injuries like that and leave no mark on the shoulders and back of your coat no threads torn or pulled no stains of mud or manure even though the streets are pretty dry now theres always something even his breeches would have been scuffed differently if hed rolled differently monk said quickly what do you mean in what way were they scuffed all on the knees as if hed crawled quite a distance some time before he died trying to escape monk asked robb chewed his lip dont know it wasnt a fight he was only struck the one blow monk was startled one blow killed him then he crawled before he was struck why not necessarily robb shook his head again doctor says he bled inside his head could have been alive for quite a while and crawled a distance knowing he was hurt but not how bad and that he was dying then could he have fallen forward and caught himself one severe blow on an angle of the box or even been down and kicked by one of the horses doctor said he was struck from behind robb swung his arms out to his right and brought them sideways and forward hard like that when he was standing up caught him on the side of the head not a lot of bloodbut lethal couldnt have been a kick monk clung to the last hope no indentation was nothing like a horses hoof a long rounded object like a crowbar or pole wasnt a corner of the box either i see monk took a deep breath have you any idea who it was that killed him or why he added the last as an afterthought not yet robb admitted he looked totally puzzled and monk had a swift impression that he was finding the case overwhelming already the fear of failure loomed in his sight he was hardly worth robbing the only thing of value he had was the coach and horses and they didnt take them a personal enemy monk concluded the thought troubled him even more for reasons robb could not know where was miriam gardiner had she been there at the time of the murder if so she was either a witness or an accompliceor else she too was dead if she had not been there then where had treadwell left her and why at her will or not how much should he tell robb if he were to serve miriams interests perhaps nothing at allnot yet anyway may i see the body he asked of course robb rose to his feet identification might help at the least it would make him feel as if he were achieving something he would know who his victim was monk thanked him and followed as he went out of his tiny office back down the stairs and into the street where there was a stir of air in the hot day even if it smelled of horses and household smoke and dry gutters the morgue was close enough to walk to and robb strode out leading the way he jammed his hands into his pockets and stared downwards not speaking it was not possible to know his thoughts monk judged him to be still in his late twenties perhaps he had not seen many deaths this could be his first murder he would be overawed by it afraid of failure disturbed by the immediacy of violence which was suddenly and uniquely his responsibility to deal with an injustice he must resolve monk walked beside him keeping pace for pace but he did not interrupt the silence carriages passed them moving swiftly harnesses bright in the sun horses hooves loud the breeze was very light only whispering through the leaves of the trees at the end of the street by the heath the smell of the air over the stretch of grass was clean and sweet somebody was playing a barrel organ the morgue was a handsome building as if the architect had intended it as some kind of memorial to the dead however temporarily there robb tensed his shoulders and increased his pace as if determined not to show any distaste for it or hesitation in his duty monk followed him up the steps and in through the door the familiar odor caught in his throat every morgue smelled like this cloyingly sweet with an underlying sourness leaving a taste at the back of the mouth no amount of scrubbing in the world removed the knowledge of death the attendant came out and asked politely if he could help them he spoke with a slight lisp and peered at robb for a moment before he recognized him youll be for your coachman again he said with a shake of his head cant tell you any more they followed him into the tiled room which echoed their footsteps it held a dampness from running water and the sting of disinfectant beyond was the icehouse where it was necessary to keep the bodies they could not bury within a day or two it had been five days since this particular one had been found no need to bring him out robb said abruptly well see him in there its just that this gentleman might be able to tell us who he is the icehouse was extremely cold the chill of it made them gasp involuntarily but neither complained monk was glad of it he had known less efficient morgues than this he lifted the sheet the body was that of a wellfed man in his thirties he was muscular especially in the upper torso and across his shoulders his skin was very white until it came to his hands and neck and face which had been darkened by sun and wind he had brownish hair sharp features and was blemished by a huge bruise covering his right temple as if someone who hated him had struck him extremely hard just once monk looked at him carefully for several minutes but he could find no other marks at all except one old scar on the leg long since healed over and a number of minor cuts and scrapes on his hands some as old as the scar on the leg it was what he would expect from a man who worked with horses and drove a coach for his living there were fresh bruises and breaks on the skin on his knees and on the palms of his hands he studied the face last but with the eyes closed and the animation gone in death it was hard to make any judgment of what he had looked like beyond the mere physical facts his features were strong a trifle sharp his lips narrow his brow wide intelligence and charm could have made him attractive ill temper or a streak of greed or cruelty could equally have made him ugly so much lay in the expression now gone was this james treadwell only someone from the stourbridge household could tell him beyond doubt do you want to see the clothes robb asked watching his face please but they told him no more than robb himself had there was only one likely conclusion the man had been standing upright when someone had hit him a powerful blow which had sent him forward onto his knees possibly even stunned him senseless for a while the knees of his breeches were stained and torn as if he had crawled a considerable distance it was difficult to be certain of anything about the person who had delivered the blow the weapon had not been found but it must have been long heavy and rounded and swung with great force could a woman have done that do you think monk asked then immediately wished he had not he should not look for robb to offer him the comfort that it could not have been miriam why should she do such a thing she could be a victim too they simply had not found her yet but if she was alive where was she if she was free to come forward and was innocent surely she would have and why had she left the stourbridge house in the first place may i see the coat he requested looking at robb before he answered of course robb replied he did not answer as to whether he thought a woman could have dealt the blow it was a foolish question and monk knew it a strong woman angry or frightened enough with a heavy object at hand could certainly have hit a man sufficiently hard to kill him especially with a blow as accurate as this one they left the morgue and went out into the sun again walking briskly along the pavement robb seemed to be in a hurry glancing once or twice at his watch it was apparently more than a simple desire to be away from the presence of death which urged him on monk would have freed robb from the necessity of showing him the carriage and horses if he felt he could overlook them but they were the deciding factor whether to bring harry or lucius stourbridge all the way to hampstead and distress them with identifying the body it would certainly cause them additional anguish robb was going at such a pace he stepped out into the street almost under the wheels of a hansom and monk had to grasp him by the arm to stop him robb flushed and apologized have you an appointment monk enquired this is only a courtesy you are doing me i can wait the horses are in a stable about a mile away robb answered watching the traffic for a break so they could cross its not exactly an appointment the subject seemed to embarrass him a coach and four went by ladies inside looking out a flash of pastels and lace it was followed by a brewers dray drawn by shire horses with braided manes and feathered feet their flanks gleaming they tossed their heads as if they knew how beautiful they were monk and robb seized the chance to cross behind them on the farther side robb drew in breath looking straight ahead of him my grandfather is ill i drop in to see him every so often just to help hes getting a little his features tightened and still he did not look at monk strictly speaking he was taking police time to go home in the middle of the day monk smiled grimly he had no happy memories of the police hierarchy he knew his juniors had been afraid of him with just cause which was painful to him now he had seen it in their nervousness in his presence the expectation of criticism just or not the notwellenoughconcealed dislike his own superior had been another matter runcorn was the only one he could recall and between them there had been friendship once long ago but for years before the final quarrel which had led to monks dismissal there had been nothing but rivalry and bitterness he felt his own body tighten but he could not help it wed better go and see him he answered ill get a pie or a sandwich and eat it while you do whatever you have to do for him ill tell you what i know about treadwell if this is him itll help robb considered it only for a second before he accepted the old man lived in two rooms in a house about five minutes swift walk from the police station inside the house was shabby but clean and robb deliberately made no apology what monk thought did not matter to him all his emotions and his attention were on the old man who sat hunched up in the one comfortable chair his shoulders were wide but thin now and bowed over as if his chest hurt when he breathed his white hair was carefully combed and he was shaved but his face had no color and it cost him a great effort that his grandson should have brought a stranger into his sanctuary how do you do sir monk said gravely thank you for permitting me to eat my pie in your house while i speak with sergeant robb about the case we are working on it is very civil of you not at all the old man said huskily obliged to clear his throat even for so few words you are welcome he looked at robb anxiously monk sat down and busied himself with the pie he had bought from a barrow on the way keeping his eyes on it so as to not appear to be aware of robb helping the old man through to the privy and back again washing his hands for him and heating some soup on the stove in the corner which seemed to be burning even in the heat of midsummer as if the old man felt cold all the time monk began to talk to mask the sounds of the old mans struggle to breathe and his difficulty swallowing the soup and the slices of bread robb had buttered for him and was giving to him a little at a time he had already thought clearly how much he would say of luciuss request for the time being he would leave out references to miriam it was a great deal less than the truth he would be deliberately misleading robb but until he knew more himself to speak of her would have set robb on her trail instantly and that would not be in her interestyet mr lucius stourbridge told me treadwell had taken the coach without permission in the middle of the afternoon of the day he was killed he began he took another mouthful of the pie it was good full of meat and onions and he was hungry when he had swallowed it he went on he lives with his parents in bayswater is it his coach or theirs robb asked offering his grandfather another slice of bread and waiting anxiously while the old man had a fit of coughing spitting up bloodstreaked phlegm into a handkerchief robb automatically passed him a clean handkerchiefand a cup of water which the old man sipped without speaking it was a good question and to answer it monk was forced to be devious a family vehicle not the best one that was true if not the whole truth why you and not the police robb asked monk was prepared for that because he hoped to recover it without the police being involved he said smoothly treadwell is the nephew of their cook and he did not want any criminal proceedings robb was very carefully measuring powder from a twist of paper making certain he used no more than a third and then rewrapping what was left and replacing it on the cabinet shelf he returned to the table and mixed water into the dose he had prepared then held the glass to the old mans lips monk glanced at the shelf where the paper had been replaced and noticed several other containers a glass jar with dried leaves presumably for an infusion a vial of syrup of some sort and two jars with more paper twists of powder so much medicine would cost a considerable amount he recalled noticing robbs frayed cuffs carefully darned the worn heels of his boots an overstitched tear in the elbow of his jacket he was taken by surprise with how hard compassion gripped him for the difficulty of it for the pain and then felt a surge of joy for the love which inspired it he found himself smiling robb was wiping the old mans face gently he then turned to his own meal of bread and soup which was now rapidly getting cold do you know anything else about this treadwell he asked beginning to eat quickly perhaps he was hungry more probably he was aware of the amount of time he had been away from police business apparently not entirely satisfactory monk replied remembering what harry stourbridge had told him only kept on because he is the cooks nephew many families will go to considerable lengths to keep a really good cook especially if they entertain he smiled slightly as he said it robb glanced at him quickly and a scandal wouldnt help i understand but if this is your man im afraid it cant be avoided he frowned doesnt throw any light on who killed him though does it what was he doing here why didnt whoever killed him take the coach its a good one and the horses are beauties no idea monk admitted every new fact only makes it harder to understand robb nodded then turned back to his grandfather he made sure the old man was comfortable and could reach everything he would need before robb could come home again then he touched him gently smiled and took his leave the old man said nothing but his gratitude was in his face he seemed better now that he had had his meal and whatever medicine robb had given him they walked the three quarters of a mile or so to the stable where the horses and the carriage were being housed robb explained to the groom in charge who monk was monk needed only to glance at the carriage to remove any doubt in his own mind that it was the stourbridges he examined it to see if there were any marks on it or anything left in the inside which might tell him of its last journey but there was nothing it was a very well kept cleaned polished and oiled family coach it had slight marks of wear and was about ten years old the manufacturer was the one whose name henry stourbridge had given him the description answered exactly the horses were also precisely as described where exactly were they found monk asked again cannon hall road robb replied its yours isnt it that was barely a question he knew the answer from monks face and the body on the path to number five green man hill its a row of small houses close onto the heath and of course youve asked them about it that too was a statement not a question robb shrugged of course no one is saying anything monk was not surprised whether they did or not few people admitted to knowing anything about a murder ill need the body identified formally robb said and ill have to speak to major stourbridge of course ask him all i can about treadwell he did not even bother to add if it is him ill go to cleveland square and bring someone monk offered he wanted to be the one to tell harry and lucius and preferably to do it without robb present he could not avoid the sergeants being there when they identified the body thank you robb accepted ill be at the morgue at four monk took a hansom back to bayswater and when the footman admitted him he asked if he could speak to major stourbridge he would prefer if possible to tell the major without luciuss having to know until it was necessary perhaps it was also cowardice he did not want to be the one to tell lucius he was shown into the withdrawing room with french doors wide open onto the sunlit lawn harry stourbridge was standing just inside but monk could see the figure of his wife in the garden beyond her pale dress outlined against the vivid colors of the herbaceous border you have news mr monk stourbridge said almost before the footman had closed the door from the hall he looked anxious his face was drawn and there were dark smudges under his eyes as if he had slept little it would be cruel to stretch out the suspense it was hard enough to have to kill the hope struggling in him as it was i am sorry it is not good monk said bluntly he saw harry stourbridges body stiffen and the last faint touch of color drain from his skin i believe i have found your coach and horses he continued and the body of a man i am almost certain is treadwell there is no sign whatever of mrs gardiner no sign of miriam stourbridge looked confused he swallowed painfully where was this mr monk do you know what happened to treadwell if it is he hampstead just off the heath im very sorry it seems treadwell was murdered stourbridges eyes widened robbery perhaps but if so what for he wouldnt be carrying money would he have you missed anything from the house no no of course not or i should have told you but why else would anyone attack and kill the poor man we dont know we the police at hampstead i traced the carriage that far then went to ask them monk explained a young sergeant called robb he told me he was working on a murder and i realized from his description that it could be treadwell also the carriage and horses were found half a mile away quite undamaged i have looked at them and from what you told me they appear to be yours i am afraid you will need to send someone to identify themand the bodyto be certain of course stourbridge agreed i will come myself he took a step forward across the bright sunlit carpet but you have no idea about miriam not yet im sorry verona was walking towards them across the grass her curiosity too powerful to allow her to remain apart stourbridge squared his shoulders as she came in through the door what is it she asked him only glancing at monk you know something that was a conclusion not a question is it miriam monk searched her expression for the slightest trace of relief or false surprise and saw none not yet stourbridge answered before monk could but it appears he may have found treadwell may she picked up the inference instantly looking from her husband to monk you did not approach him speak with him why what has happened he has met with misfortune stourbridge put in i am about to accompany mr monk to see what else may be learned i shall tell you of course when i return there was finality in his voice sufficient to tell her it was useless pressing any further questions now monks relief at not having to tell lucius what he had discovered was shortlived they were crossing the hall towards the front door when lucius came down the stairs his face pale eyes wide what have you found he demanded fear sharp in his voice is it miriam where is she what has happened to her stourbridge turned and put up his hands as if to take lucius by the shoulders to steady him but lucius stepped back his throat was too tight to allow him to speak and he gulped air i dont know anything about mrs gardiner monk said quickly but i may have found treadwell i need someone to identify him before i can be certain stourbridge put his hand on luciuss arm there was nothing to indicate that miriam was with him he said gently we dont know what happened or why stay here i will do what is necessary but be discreet until we are sure there is no purpose in distressing cook lucius recalled with an effort that he was not the only one to be affected even bereaved he looked at monk treadwell is dead i think it is treadwell monk replied but he was found alone and the coach is empty and undamaged a fraction of the color returned to luciuss cheeks im coming with you there is no need stourbridge began then seeing the determination in his son and perhaps realizing it was easier to do something than simply to wait he did not protest any further it was a miserable journey from bayswater back to hampstead they took the stourbridges remaining carriage driven now by the groom and rode for the most part in silence lucius sitting upright with his back to the way they were going his eyes wide and dark consumed in his own fears stourbridge sat next to monk staring ahead but oblivious of the streets and the houses they were passing once or twice he made as if to say something then changed his mind monk concentrated on determining what he would tell robb if the body proved to be treadwell and he had no real doubt that it was it was also impossible to argue whether or not it was murder the body whosever it was had not come by such an injury by any mischance to conceal such information as his flight with miriam gardiner and the fact that she had gone without explanation and was still missing would now be a crime also it would suggest that they had some fear that she was implicated nothing they said afterwards would be believed unless it carried proof not that either harry or lucius stourbridge would be remotely likely to hide the truth they were both far too passionately involved to conceal anything at all their first question to robb would be regarding anything he would know about miriam they were so convinced of her entire innocence in anything wrong beyond a breach of good manners that they would only think of how she might be implicated when it was too late how would monk then explain to robb his own silence about the other person in the carriage he had not so far even mentioned her they jolted to a stop as traffic ahead of them thickened and jammed the streets all around drivers shouted impatiently horses stamped and whinnied jingling harnesses lucius sat rigid still unspeaking stourbridge clenched and unclenched his hands they moved forward again at last monk would tell robb as little as possible all they knew for certain was that miriam had left at the same moment as treadwell how far they had gone together was another matter should he warn stourbridge and lucius to say no more about miriam than they had to he looked at their tense faces each staring into space consumed in their fears and decided that any advice would only be overridden by emotion and probably do more harm than good if they remembered it to begin with then forgot it would give the impression of dishonesty he kept silent also they reached the morgue at ten minutes past four robb was already there pacing restlessly up and down but he made no comment on the time as they alighted they were all too eager to complete the business for which they had come to do more than acknowledge each other with the briefest courtesies and then follow robb inside the morgue attendant drew the sheet back from the body showing only the head lucius drew in his breath sharply and seemed to sway a little on his feet stourbridge let out a soft sigh he was a soldier and he must have seen death many times before and usually of men he had known to a greater or lesser extent but this was a man of his own household and murder was different from war war was not an individual evil soldiers expected to kill and be killed frequently they even respected their enemies there was no hatred involved the violence was huge and impersonal it did not make the pain less or the death or the bereavement less final but death in war was mischance this was different a close intended and covert evil meant for this man alone is it your coachman sir robb asked but he could not help being aware that the question was unnecessary the recognition was in both their faces yes it is stourbridge said quietly this is james treadwell where did you find him the morgue attendant drew back the sheet to cover the face in the street sir robb replied leading them away from the table and back towards the door on the path to one of a row of houses on green man hill about half a mile or so from here robb was sympathetic but the detective in him was paramount are you aware of his knowing anyone in this area what stourbridge looked up oh no i dont think so he is a nephew of our cook i can ask her i have no idea where he went on his days off was it one of his days off when he disappeared sir no did he have your permission to use your coach sir stourbridge hesitated a moment before replying he looked across at lucius then away again no he did not i am afraid the circumstances of his leaving the house are somewhat mysterious and not understood by any of us sergeant we know when he left but nothing more than that you knew he had taken your coach robb pointed out but you did not report it to the police it is a very handsome coach sir and exceptionally well matched horses worth a considerable amount major stourbridge has already mentioned that treadwell was related to his cook monk interrupted who is a longstanding servant of the family he wished to avoid scandal if possible he hoped treadwell would come to his senses and return even with a reasonable explanation lucius could bear it no longer my fiancee was with him he burst out mrs miriam gardiner it was to find her that we employed mr monks services treadwell is beyond our help poor soul but where is miriam we should be turning all our skill and attention to searching for her she may be hurt in danger his voice was rising out of control as his imagination tortured him robb looked startled for a moment then his jaw hardened he did not even glance at monk do i understand mrs gardiner left your house in the carriage with treadwell driving he demanded we believe so stourbridge answered before lucius could speak no one saw them go he seemed to have appreciated something of the situation in spite of monks silence but we have not heard from her since nor do we know what has happened to her we are at our wits end with worry we must look for her lucius cut across them treadwell is dead and miriam may be in danger at the very least she must be in fear and distress you must deploy every man you can to search for her robb stood still for a moment surprise taking the words from him then slowly he turned to monk his eyes narrow and hard you omitted to mention that a young woman was a passenger in the carriage when treadwell was murdered and that she has since disappeared why is that mr monk monk had foreseen the question though there was no excuse that was satisfactory and robb would know that as well as he did mrs gardiner left with treadwell he replied with as honest a bearing as he could we have no idea when she left him lucius was staring at him his eyes wide and horrified sophistry robb snapped reality monk returned with equal harshness this was five days ago if anything happened to mrs gardiner we are far too late to affect it now except by careful thought and consideration before we act he was acutely conscious of lucius and of harry stourbridge their emotions filled the air if she met with violence as well she would have been found long before now he did not glance at either of them but kept his eyes level on robb if she was kidnapped then a ransom will be asked for and it has not so far if she witnessed the murder then she may well have run away for her own safety and we must be careful how we look for her in case we bring upon her the very harm she fears he drew in his breath and until major stourbridge identified the body as that of treadwell we did not know that it was anything more than a domestic misunderstanding between mr stourbridge and mrs gardiner lucius stood appalled stourbridge looked from one to the other of them we know now he said grimly the question is what we are to do next discover all the facts that we can monk answered him and then deduce what we can from them robb bit his lip his face pale he turned to lucius you have no idea why mrs gardiner left your home no none at all lucius said quickly there was no quarrel no incident at all which sparked it mrs gardiner was standing alone watching the croquet match when without warning or explanation she simply left with treadwell she left in the carriage stourbridge corrected him she could hardly have driven it herself a flash of irritation crossed robbs face and then disappeared as if he had remembered their distress had mrs gardiner any previous acquaintance with treadwell perhaps through the cook no lucius said instantly she had met no one in the house before i first took her there where did you meet mrs gardiner on hampstead heath why it is natural enough that he should bring her back here she lives on lyndhurst road robb pursed his lips that is about three quarters of a mile from where the carriage was found and rather more from where treadwells body was i assume you have already been to her home to see if she was there of course no one has seen her since she left to come to bayswater lucius answered it is the first place we looked please tell us what you know of treadwells death i beg you they were outside in the street again now lucius stood breathing deeply as if trying to clear his lungs of the choking air of the morgue with its close smell of death even so he did not take his eyes from robbs face we know nothing except that he was murdered robb replied we did not even know his name until you gave it to us although from his clothes we assumed his occupation was there nothing found in the carriage stourbridge asked with a frown no marks or stains to indicate where it had been what about the horses are they hurt no they were lost confused aware that something was wrong there was nothing to indicate they had bolted the harness was not broken the reins were still tied to the bar as if the driver had stopped then climbed down rather than fallen the carriage itself has no scratches or marks but those of ordinary use stourbridge turned questioningly to monk there is nothing further you can do here now monk assured him thank you for coming to identify treadwell perhaps you had better return home and inform your family and of course the cook she is bound to be distressed as soon as i learn anything more i will tell you lucius stood still the answer must be here he insisted desperately loath to leave without something further accomplished stourbridge touched his elbow perhaps but mr monk will find it more easily if we do not hamper him lucius did not move come stourbridge said gently we shall only make it more difficult reluctantly still half disbelieving lucius bade goodbye and permitted himself to be led away you realize i shall have to find this woman robb shoved his hands deep in his pockets staring grimly at monk he looked guarded careful his shoulders hunched a little at best she may be witness to the murder at worst a victim herself it was unarguable monk said nothing or she may be guilty herself robb went on that blow could have been struck by a woman if she were frightened enough or angry enough perhaps you will now be frank and tell me what you know of this mrs gardiner since mr stourbridge seems to have hired you to find her presumably you know a great deal more than you have so far told me there was no evading it now and perhaps it was the only way to help lucius stourbridge whatever the truth was one day he would have to face at least part of it some details might be kept from him but not the essence if miriam gardiner were involved in the murder of treadwell it would be public knowledge sooner or later monk could not protect him from that even if she were no more than a witness and unless treadwell had set her down somewhere before he reached the heath that seemed an unavoidable conclusion it was plain in robbs face now as he looked grimly at monk ignoring the traffic passing by them and the people on foot having to walk around monk told robb the outline of his interview with lucius stourbridge and his visit to bayswater he gave no more detail than was necessary to be honest and none of his own impressions except that he had believed what he had been told so far robb looked thoughtful biting his lips and no one gave you any idea why mrs gardiner should have run off in this way no where did treadwell serve before bayswater where was he born monk felt himself flush with annoyance they were obvious questions and he had not thought to ask them it was a stupid oversight he had concentrated on miriam thinking of treadwell only as someone to drive the coach for her it was instinctive to try to defend himself but there was nothing to say which would not make his omission look worse i dont know the words were hollow an open failure robb was tactful he even seemed faintly relieved and about her he asked this time monk could answer and did as fully as he knew robb thought for several moments before he spoke again so a relationship between mrs gardiner and this coachman is unlikely but it is not impossible it seems she turned to him to take her away from the stourbridge house at least he looked at monk nervously and you still have no idea why none robb grunted i cannot stop you looking for her also of course and perhaps finding her before i do but if she is involved in this crime even as a witness and you assist her i shall charge you his young face was set his lips tight of course monk agreed i would in your place that was unquestionably true he had a suspicion from what he had learned of himself and the past that robb was being gentler with him than he had been with others he smiled bleakly thank you for your civility i expect well meet again good day monk arrived home at fitzroy street a little after seven and found dinner ready and hester waiting for him it was extremely satisfying the house was clean and smelled faintly of lavender and polish there were fresh flowers on the table a white cloth with blue crossstitch patterns on it and crockery and silverware hester served cold game pie with crisp pastry and hot vegetables then an egg custard with nutmeg grated over the top and lastly cheese and crusty bread there were even a few early strawberries to finish he sat back with a feeling of immense wellbeing to watch hester clear away the dishes and was pleased to see her return some twentyfive minutes later ready to sit down and talk with him for the rest of the evening he wanted to tell her about treadwell and about robb and his grandfather did you find the coach yet she asked he leaned back in the chair crossing his legs yes and i found treadwell also he saw her eyes widen then the knowledge came into her face that there was far more to what he said she understood the tragedy before he put it into words she did not ask him but waited i went to the local police station to see if they had seen the coach the sergeant was occupied with a murder case but he spared me a few minutes he knew she would leap to the conclusion before he told her treadwell she swallowed not miriam too her voice was strained with expectation of pain no he said quickly theres no sign of her at all i would not have had to mention her except that i brought major stourbridge to identify treadwell and lucius insisted on coming as well of course they had to ask robb about her robb is the sergeant yes he described him for her trying to bring to life in words both the gentleness he had seen in the young man and the determination and a little of the edge of his nervousness his need to succeed he saw in her face that he had caught her interest she had understood that there was far more he had not yet told her how was treadwell killed she asked with a blow over the head with something hard and heavy did he fight no it was as if he was taken by surprise where was he found she was leaning forward now her attention wholly absorbed on the path of a small house on green man hill just off the heath thats close to the hospital she said quietly one or two of our parttime nurses live around there i doubt he was going to see a nurse he said dryly but it brought to mind his visit with robb to the old man and the poverty in which they lived robbs return home would be so different from his own no wife with a fine meal ready and a quiet evening in the last of the sun he would find a sick old man who needed caring for washing feeding cleaning often and who was always either in distress or close to it money must be scarce the medicines alone would be expensive and perhaps hard to come by what she said softly as if reading his thoughts or at least his emotions he told her about his lunchtime visit his feelings pouring through his words in a kind of release he had not realized how much it had cost to contain them within himself until now that he could share them with her with the certainty that she understood he could sense her response as surely as if she had answered every sentence although she did not interrupt at all only when he was finished did she speak ill go and see him perhaps the hospital can he did not allow her to complete the words no you wont he did not even know why he said it except that he did not want robb to think he had interfered implying that he was not looking after the old man adequately for someone else to go in unasked would be an intrusion hester stiffened the whole angle of her body changed i beg your pardon her voice was cool now was the time to make sure she understood him and it was plain between them where the bounds of authority lay you are not to interfere he stated clearly he did not explain why his reasons were good but that was not the point if he explained now she would require an explanation every time it would be inappropriate why she asked her eyes bright and challenging he had not intended to allow an argument in fact this was precisely what he had meant to avoid i am not going to discuss it he replied ive told you that is sufficient he rose to his feet to signal the end of the matter robb would be offended he might very easily feel monk believed his care of his grandfather was not good enough or worse he might feel some implied pressure because he was using police time to go home and attend to the old man hester rose also her voice was low and very precise each word spoken carefully are you telling me whether i may or may not do what i believe to be right william you may do anything that is right he said with a tiny smile of relief because she had offered him a route of escape always this is not right you mean i may do what you believe to be right she challenged you may he agreed you do not have to the choice is yours and with that he went out into the office leaving her in the middle of the floor furious it was not what he wanted at all but it was a victory that mattered there were any number of reasons why he must be master in his own home for the happiness of both of them when her temper cooled she would appreciate that he sat in the room alone for over an hour but she did not join him at first he missed her then he became irritated she was childish she could not expect to have her own way in everything but she always had he remembered with considerable disquiet how she had governed her own life in the past how willful she had been even the hospital authorities could not tolerate herand did not she was opinionated in everything and not loath to express these opinions even at the leastopportune momentsand with a wit which made them even more offensive to some he had laughed when he had not been on the receiving end it was less funny when he was not that his own tongue was not equally sharp and every bit as well informed that was one of the reasons she could accept marriage to him because he was more than her equal well occasionally but she must not be allowed to sulk that was unacceptable he stood up and went to find her this could not continue she was sitting at the table writing she looked up when he came in ah good she said with a smile youve come to tell me more about it i thought you would the kettle is on would you like a cup of tea and there is cake as well he thought of the night to come and lying beside her warm slender body either rigid and turned away from him or gentle and willing in his arms more than that deeper in his soul he thought of all that they had shared that mattered above any petty battle of wills or convention of behavior the issue could wait until another time there would certainly be other battles dozens of them perhaps hundreds yes he agreed sitting down on the other chair tea would be nice thank you and cake obediently with a little smile she rose to make it in the morning monk left home to continue his search for miriam gardiner only now there was the added difficulty that he must do so without at the same time leading robb to her he did not underestimate robbs intelligence he had already had the chastening experience of being outthought in conversation and the memory still stung horses were intelligent animals and very much creatures of habit if treadwell had driven them to hampstead before then they were likely to have returned to the same place accordingly the still summer morning at seven oclock found monk standing in the sun on lyndhurst road studying its tidy house fronts with their neat gardens and whitened steps he knew miriams address from lucius stourbridge naturally it was the first place he had enquired but all his questions had elicited only blank ignorance and then growing alarm that might still be where robb would begin monk stood with the lazy sun warming his shoulders and the earlymorning sounds of kitchen doors opening and closing the occasional whack of a broom handle beating a carpet errand boys feet were loud on the cobbles as was the uneven step of one of them who was carrying a heavy bucket of coal the only thought crowding his mind was where had miriam been when james treadwell was murdered had she been present if she had had anyone else or had she killed him herself the surgeon had said it seemed a single extremely heavy blow but not impossible to have been inflicted by a woman given that she had used the right weapon and treadwell had not died straightaway but crawled from wherever it had happened presumably looking for help neither robb nor the police surgeon had offered any suggestion as to where the crime had taken place but it could not have been far away had miriam struck him once and then fled had she taken the coach driving it herself if so why had she abandoned it in the street so close by perhaps she had panicked and simply run as the blind instinctive thing to do possibly she was unused to horses and did not know how to drive or had there been a third person there had miriam witnessed the murder and fled perhaps for her own survival or had she not been there at all he would learn nothing standing in the sun while the world woke up and busied itself around him he walked forward and up the step to the nearest door he knocked on it and the maid answered looking startled and ready to tell any errant tradesman where his appropriate entrance was and not to be so impertinent as to come to the front then she saw monks face and her eyes traveled down his smart coat to his polished boots and she changed her mind yes sir she said curiously absentmindedly pushing her hand through her hair to tidy it out of her eyes masters not up yet im afraid then she realized that was a little too revealing i mean e int ad is breakfast yet monk made himself smile at the girl im sure you can help me without disturbing the household im afraid i am lost i dont know the area very well i am looking for a mrs miriam gardiner i believe she lives somewhere near here he knew perfectly well that she lived about five houses along but he wanted to learn all he could from someone who almost certainly would have noticed her and heard all the belowstairs gossip if indeed there had been some relationship between her and treadwell then they might have been less guarded here away from cleveland square mrs gardiner oh yeah she said cheerfully she came farther out onto the step and swung around pointing four doors up that way she lives or mebbe its five number eight just along there anyow yer cant miss it would you know if she is at home now he asked without moving cor luv yer no i wouldnt i int seen er fer a week ner more i eard as she were gettin married again an good for er i says would that be an elderly gentleman who lives about a mile from here monk assumed an ingenuous air dunno im sure the girl replied shouldnt a thought so though comes in a right smart carriage e does matched pair like nobodys business step fer step they goes like they was machines same color monk asked with interest color dont matter she replied with illconcealed impatience size an pace is wot makes em ride well know something about horses he observed me pa were a coachman she said none better if i says so as shouldnt he smiled at her quite genuinely something in her pride in her father pleased him it was simple and without selfconsciousness seen them about quite often i suppose was that coachman much good fair she replied with careful judgment not near as good as me pa too eavyanded have you seen him lately id like a word with him he thought he had better give some reason for all the questions i int seen im fer a few days now she shook her head as if it puzzled her but es around ere often enough i seen im in the high street i recognize them orses goin towards the eath you mean not to mrs gardiners house he said with surprise to a public house perhaps int none up that way she replied e must a knowd someone thank you thank you very much he stepped back good day she stood on the path smiling as he walked away then went back into the house to continue with her far less interesting duties he was speaking to a gardener busy pulling weeds when he saw robb turn the corner of the street and come towards him frowning deep in thought his hands were in his pockets and from the concentration in his face monk surmised he was mulling over something that caused him concern it was as well for monk that he was otherwise robb would almost certainly have recognized him and that was something he did not wish robb had to be searching for miriam just as diligently as he was monk must find her first even if only to give her time to prepare what she would say he thanked the gardener turned on his heel and strode away as fast as he could without drawing undue attention to himself he went down the first side street he came to robb did not pass him damn he must have stopped to speak to the same gardener it was the obvious thing to do then the man would also tell him of seeing the carriage drive by regularly over the last year or more and robb would ask who it was that had just been talking to him and the gardener would say that he had given him the same information even if robb had not recognized the wellcut jacket and the square set of his shoulders robb would know it was monk who else would it be what had james treadwell been doing here other than collecting and returning miriam to her home after visiting with lucius stourbridge had he relatives here was there a woman or more than one or some form of business had it anything to do with miriam or not a vehicle like that would be remembered by anyone who knew horses this was not an area with many stables or mews where they could be kept out of sight most people here used public transport hansoms or even omnibuses short journeys would be made on foot he spent the next three hours combing the neighborhood asking boot boys errand boys and a scullery maid about the houses he stopped a man delivering coal for kitchen fires which were kept burning to cook on even on such a hot summer day his face black sweat trickling through the coal dust that caked his skin twice more he only narrowly avoided running into robb he spoke to a boy selling newspapers and a man with a tray of ham sandwiches from whom he purchased what was going to have to serve him for a late luncheon most of them were happy to admit they knew miriam gardiner at least by sight and smiled when they said it as if the memory were pleasant but they knew that treadwell had been murdered and none of them wished to be associated with that however loosely yes they had seen him in the past but no not lately certainly not on the night he had met his death they gazed back at monk with blank eyes and complete denial he could only hope robb met with the same the only thing left to do was move closer to where the body had been found and try again it was a matter of searching for the kind of person who was in a position to observe the comings and goings and who might feel free to speak of them without involving himself in something which could only be unpleasant servants caught gossiping were invariably in trouble the advantage he had over robb was that he was not police but being a civilian also held disadvantages he could only persuade he could oblige nothing he walked slowly along the pavement in the sun it was a pleasant neighborhood with rows of small respectable houses inside the front parlors would be neat and stuffy seldom used filled with paintings and samplers with godfearing messages on them possibly a picture of the family posed selfconsciously in their sunday best life would be conducted mostly in the kitchen and bedrooms prayers would be said every morning and night the generations would be listed in the family bible which was probably opened once a week sunday morning would be very sober indeed although saturday night might get a little tipsyfor the men anyway he tried to think what treadwell would do when he got to hampstead did he meet friends perhaps a woman why not it would certainly be very foolish for him to form a friendship with a woman in the stourbridge house or close enough for others to become aware of it backstairs gossip had ruined more than a few men in service had he come to buy or to pay for something or to settle or collect an old debt or had it been simply to escape his daily life of obedience to someone else here for an hour or two he would have been his own master monk crossed the street still strolling gently because he had reached no decision a young woman passed him she was wearing the starched uniform and simple dress of a nursemaid and she had a little girl by the hand every now and again the child took a little skip the ribbon in her hair bobbing and the young woman smiled at her far away in the distance probably on the heath a barrel organ played if treadwell had come here he would not have left the carriage and horses standing unattended even if he had merely stopped for a drink he would have had to leave them in some suitable place such as an ostlers yard there was a shop across the road ahead of him he was not more than a quarter of a mile from miriam gardiners house this would be an excellent place to start he increased his pace now he had a specific purpose he opened the door and a bell clanked rustily somewhere inside an elderly gentleman appeared from behind a curtain and looked at monk hopefully yes sir lovely day int it what can i get for you sir tea candles half a pound of mint humbugs perhaps he waved a hand at the general clutter around him which apparently held all these things and more or a penny postcard ball of string maybe you need or sealing wax ball of string and sealing wax sounds very useful monk agreed and the humbugs would be excellent on such a warm day thank you the man nodded several times satisfied and began to find the articles named mrs gardiner said you would have almost anything i might want monk remarked watching the man carefully oh did she the man replied without looking up now theres a nice lady if you like happy to see her marry again and thats not a lie widowed too young she was oh theres the sealing wax he held it up triumphantly its a nice color that is not too orange dont like it to be too orange reds better i suppose youve known her a long time monk remarked casually nodding back in approval of the shade of the wax bless you only since she first came here as a girl and thats not a lie the man agreed poor little thing monk stiffened what should he say to encourage more confidences without showing his own ignorance or curiosity the man found the string and came up from his bending with a ball in each hand there you are sir he said triumphantly his face shining which would you prefer this is good string for parcels and the like and the others softer better for tying up plants dont cut into the stems you see ill take both monk answered his mind racing and two sticks of the sealing wax as you say its a good color good good and the mint humbugs never forget the mint humbugs he laid the string on the counter and disappeared below it again presumably searching for more sealing wax monk hoped it was not the humbugs down in the dusty recesses i hadnt realized she was so young when it happened monk observed hoping he sounded more casual than he felt bless you no more than twelve or thirteen and thats not a lie the man answered from his hands and knees where he was searching in the cupboards under the counter he pulled out a huge box full of envelopes and linen paper poor little creature terrible small she was not a soul in the world so it seemed not then but of course our cleo took her in he pulled out another box of assorted papers monk did not care in the slightest about the sealing wax but he did not want to interrupt the flow good woman cleo anderson heart of gold whatever anybody says the man continued vehemently please dont go to trouble monk was abashed by the work he was causing and he had what he wanted i dont need more wax i merely liked the color mustnt be beaten the shopkeeper mumbled from the depth of the cupboard thats what they said at trafalgar and waterloo no doubt cant have a customer leaving dissatisfied i suppose you know mr treadwell also monk tried the last question not as i recall ah here it is i knew i had some more somewhere half a box of it he backed out and stood up his shoulders covered in dust a lidless cardboard box in one hand he beamed at monk here you are sir how much would you like three sticks thank you monk replied wondering what on earth he could use it for is there a good ostlers yard near here the man leaned over the counter and pointed leftwards waving his arm about half a mile up that way and one street over cant miss it up towards mrs andersons it is but youd know that knowing mrs gardiner an all thatll be tenpence hapenny altogether sir if you please oh an here are the humbugs thatll be another tuppence if you please monk took his purchases thanked him and paid then set out towards the ostlers yard feeling pleased with himself he needed to find miriam the details of her youth were of value only inasmuch as they either explained her extraordinary behavior or indicated where she was now the ostlers yard was precisely where the shopkeeper had pointed yes an old man said sucking on a straw he was bowlegged and smelled of the stable yard horse sweat hay and leather e come ere often right andsome pair they was perfick match pace fer pace good with horses was he monk enquired casually not as id say good the ostler qualified fair more like it he looked at monk through narrowed eyes waiting for him to explain himself monk made a grimace of disgust not what he told me thats why i thought id check dont make no matter now the ostler spat out the straw dead poor swine not that id much time fer im saucy bastard e were always full o lip but i wouldnt wish that on im yer not from round ere or yerd o knowd e were dead murdered e were on mrs andersons footpath practically an er a good woman an all looked after my annie she did summink wonderful he shook his head nuffink werent too much trouble for er monk seized the chance a very fine woman he agreed took in mrs gardiner too i believe when she was just a child the ostler selected himself another straw and put it in his mouth oh yeah found her wandering around out of er wits they did babblin like a lunatic an scarce knew er own name poor thing it were cleo anderson wot took er in an cleaned er up and raised er like she was er own shame that nogood braggart got isself killed on her doorstep that kind o trouble nobody needs cant prevent accidents monk said sententiously but his mind was wondering what could have happened to the young miriam to cause her such agony of mind he could imagine it only too vividly remembering his own fear after the accident the horrors that lay within himself had she experienced something like that did she also not know who she was was that what terrified her and drove her away from lucius stourbridge who loved her so much the ostler spat out his straw werent no haccident he said derisively like i told yer e were murdered it over the ead e were he left his horses here quite often monk observed recalling himself to the present i told you that too didnt i course e did best place fer miles this is int nuthin abaht orses i dont know as is worth knowin he waited for monk to challenge him monk smiled and glanced at the nearest animal i can see that he said appreciatively it shows and your judgment of treadwell is probably much what id concluded myself an arrogant piece of work the ostler looked satisfied he nodded thats wot i told that policeman wot come round ere askin treadwell werent much good i told im yer can learn a lot abaht a man by the way e andles an orse if yer know wot ter look fer you know yer a bit pleased wif yerself an all monk smiled ruefully he knew it was true the ostler grinned back pleased there was no offense monk thanked him and left digesting the information he had gained not only about treadwells being here but about miriams strange early life and the coincidence of treadwells being murdered on the doorstep of the woman who had found miriam and had taken her in years before and of course robb had had the same idea monk must be extremely careful he did not inadvertently lead him right to miriam out in the street again he walked slowly he did not put his hands in his pockets that would pull his suit out of shape he was too vain for that why was he so fearful of leading robb to miriam the answer was painful because he was afraid she was involved in treadwells death even if indirectly she was hiding from lucius but she was hiding from the police as well why what was treadwell to her beyond the driver of stourbridges carriage what did he knowor suspect it was time he went to see cleo anderson he did not want to run into robb so he approached cautiously aware that he was a conspicuous figure with his straight square shoulders and slightly arrogant walk he was already on green man hill when he saw robb crossing the street ahead of him and he stopped abruptly bending his head and raising his hands as if to light a cigar then he turned his back making a gesture as if to shelter a match from the wind without looking up in spite of the intense temptation he strolled away again and around the first corner he came to he stopped and to his annoyance found he was shaking this was absurd what had it come to when he was scuttling around street corners to keep from being recognized by the police and a sergeant at that a short handful of years before sergeants all over london knew his name and snapped to attention when they heard it in rediscovering himself after the accident he had witnessed just how deeply the fear of him was rooted people cared what he thought of them they wanted to please him and they dreaded his contempt earned or not how much had changed he felt himself ridiculous standing there on the footpath pretending to light an imaginary cigar so robb would not see his face and yet the man he had been then in hindsight gave him little pleasure robb would have feared him possibly respected his skills but that fear would have been based in the power he had had and his will to use itand to exercise the sharp edge of his tongue he was still impatient at times sarcastic he still despised cowardice hypocrisy and laziness and took no trouble to conceal it but he equally despised a bully and felt a sharp stab of pain to think that he might once have been one if robb had gone to see cleo anderson either with regard to miriam or simply because treadwell had been found on her pathway then there was no point waiting there for him to leave it might be an hour or two better to go and buy himself a decent supper then return in the early evening when robb would have gone back home probably to minister to his grandfather monk ate well then filled in a little more of the waiting time asking further questions about miriam he pretended he had a sister who had recently married and was considering moving into the area he learned more than he expected and miriams name cropped up in connection with a botanical society the friends of a missionary group in africa a circle of women who met every other friday to discuss works of literature they had enjoyed and the rota of duties at the nearest church he should have thought of the church he kicked himself for such an obvious omission he would repair that tomorrow altogether by the time he stood on cleo andersons doorstep in the earlyevening sunlight the shadows so long across the street that they nearly engulfed his feet he was feeling as the ostler had remarked pleased with himself considering that cleo anderson had already sacrificed a great deal of her evening answering the questions of sergeant robb she opened the door to monk with remarkable courtesy it occurred to him that she might have believed him to be a patient after all caring for the sick was her profession it took her only a moment to see that he was a stranger and unlikely to belong to the immediate neighborhood nevertheless she did not dismiss him summarily her eyes narrowed a trifle yes love what can i do for you she asked keeping her weight where she could slam the door if he tried to force his way he stood well back deliberately good evening mrs anderson he replied he decided in that moment not to lie to her my name is william monk mr lucius stourbridge has employed me to find miriam gardiner as you may be aware she has disappeared from his house where she was a guest and he is frantic with concern for her he stopped seeing the anxiety in her face her rapid breathing and a stiffening of her body but then considering treadwells corpse had been found on her path she could hardly fail to fear for miriam unless she already knew that she was safe not only from physical harm but from suspicion also patently she did not have any such comfort can you help me he said quietly for a moment she stood still making up her mind then she stepped back pulling the door wider youd better come in she invited him reluctantly he followed her into a hallway hardly large enough to accommodate the three doors that led from it she opened the farthest one into a clean and surprisingly light room with comfortable chairs by the fireplace a row of cupboards lined one wall all the doors closed and with brassbound keyholes none of the keys were present mr stourbridge sent you the thought seemed to offer her no comfort she was still as tense her hands held tightly half hidden by her skirts he had walked miles and his feet were burning but to sit unasked would be rushing her and illmannered he is terrified some harm may have come to her he answered especially in light of what happened to the coachman treadwell in spite of all her effort of control she drew in her breath sharply i dont know where she is then she steadied herself deliberately waiting a moment or two i havent seen her since she left to go and stay in bayswater she told me all about that o course she looked at him levelly he had the strong feeling that she was lying but he did not know to what extent or why there was fear in her face but nothing he recognized as guilt he tried the gentlest approach he could think of mr stourbridge cares for her profoundly he would act only in her best interest and for her welfare her voice was suddenly thick with emotion and she choked back tears i know that she took a shaky breath hes a very fine young gentleman she blinked several times but that doesnt alter nothin god knows she seemed about to add something else then changed her mind and remained silent you were the one who found miriam the first time werent you he said gently with respect rather than as a question she hesitated yes but that was years back she was just a child twelve or thirteen she was a look of pain and defiance crossed her face bin in an accident dunno what appened to er ysterical in a state like you never seen nobody around to claim er or care for er i took er in course i did poor little thing her eyes did not move from monks nobody ever asked for er nor come lookin i expected someone every day then it were weeks an months an nobody came so i just took care of er like she were mine perhaps she caught something in his eyes an understanding some of the defiance eased from her she were scared alf out of er wits poor little thing she went on didnt remember what happened at all cleo anderson had taken miriam in and raised her until she had made a respectable and apparently happy marriage to a local man of honorable reputation then miriam had been widowed with sufficient means to live quite contentedly until she had met lucius stourbridge out walking in the sun on hampstead heath but it was what had happened one week ago that mattered and where she was now did you know james treadwell he asked her her answer was immediate without a moments thought no it was too quick but he did not want to challenge her he must leave her room to change her mind without having to defend herself so you were all the family miriam had after the accident he allowed his very real admiration to fill his voice the tenderness in her eyes in her mouth was undeniable if she had permitted herself at that moment she would have wept but she was a strong woman and well used to all manner of tragedy thats true she agreed quietly and she was the nearest thing to a child i ever had too and nobody could want better so you must have been happy when she married a good man like mr gardiner he concluded o course an e were a good man bit older than miriam but loved er e did an she were proper fond o im it must have been very pleasant for you to have had her living so close she smiled o course but i don mind where she lives if shes appy an she loved mr lucius like nothin i ever seen er ole face lit up when she jus spoke is name this time the tears spilled down her cheeks and it was beyond her power to control them what happened mrs anderson he said almost in a whisper i dunno he had not really expected anything else this was a woman protecting the only child she had nurtured and loved but you must have seen treadwell even in the distance when miriam came back to visit you while she was staying in bayswater he insisted she hesitated only a moment i seen a coachman but thats all that might be true perhaps treadwell had crawled here because he had heard miriam say cleo was a nurse it was conceivable it was no more than that but was it likely who had killed treadwell and why why here what did you tell sergeant robb he asked she relaxed a fraction her shoulders eased under the dark fabric of her dress a plain almost uniform dress such as he had seen hester wear on duty he was surprised at the stab of familiarity it caused inside him same as im tellin you she answered i avent seen miriam since she went off to stay with mr lucius an is family i dont know where she is now an ive no idea what happened to the coachman or ow e got killed nor why except ive known miriam since she were a girl an ive never known er to lose er temper nor lash out at anyone an id stake my life on that monk believed her at least for the last part he accepted that she thought miriam innocent he very much doubted that she had no idea where miriam was if all were well with miriam she would unquestionably not have fled from the stourbridge house as she had nor have remained out of touch with lucius if she were in trouble whatever its nature surely she would have turned to cleo anderson the person who had rescued her cared for her and loved her since that first time i hope you wont have to do anything so extreme he said gravely then he bade her goodnight without asking anything further he knew she would not answer at least not with the truth he bought a sandwich from a peddler about a block away making conversation with him as he ate it then he took an omnibus back towards fitzroy street and was glad to sit down cramped and lurching as the conveyance was he let his thoughts wander where could miriam go she was frightened she trusted no one except perhaps cleo certainly she did not trust lucius stourbridge she would not want to be in unfamiliar territory yet she would have to avoid those who were known to be her friends a fat woman next to him was perspiring freely she mopped her face with a large handkerchief a small boy blew a pennywhistle piercingly and his mother showed sharp disapproval to no effect an elderly man in a bowler hat sucked air through a gap in his teeth monk glared at the boy with the whistle and he stopped in midblow the man with the gap in his teeth smiled in relief miriam would go to someone she could trust someone cleo could trust perhaps who owed her a favor for past kindness cleo was a nurse if she was even remotely like hester she could count on the trust and the unquestioning discretion also of a good many people that was where to begin with those cleo anderson had nursed he sat back and relaxed keeping his eye on the child in case he thought to blow his whistle again it was already warm and still by five minutes before nine when monk began the next day the rag and bone mans voice echoed as he drove slowly away from the heath towards the south the dew was still deep in the shade of the larger trees but the open grass was dusty and the dawn chorus of the birds had been over for hours monk did not bother to pursue those patients with large families and naturally those whose illness had ended in death he learned of all manner of misfortune and of kindness cleo andersons reputation was high few had a harsh word to say of her miriam also had earned a share of approval it seemed often enough she had been willing to help in the duties of care especially after she had been widowed and no longer had her time filled with seeing to the wellbeing of mr gardiner monk followed every trail that seemed likely to lead to where miriam might be now by late morning he had crossed sergeant robbs path twice and was wondering if robb was equally aware of him surely he must be by deduction even if he had not actually seen monk a little after midday he came around the corner of prince arthur road and stopped abruptly ten yards ahead of him robb was glancing at his watch anxiously and in reading the time he looked reluctantly once at a house on the farther side then biting his lip set off at a very rapid pace the opposite way for a moment monk was confused then he realized robb was going in the direction of his home his grandfather would have been alone since early in the morning almost helpless certainly needing food and in this warm weather above all fresh water to drink and assistance with his personal needs robb would never forget that whatever the urgencies or the requirements of his job monk was moved with an acute pity for him and also for the sick old man sitting alone day after day dependent on a young man desperate to do his job and torn between two duties but monks first duty was towards miriam gardiner because that was what lucius stourbridge had hired him for and what he had given his word to do robb had far more resources than he had in information given to the police his own local knowledge and in his power to command cooperation they wished the same thing to find miriam gardiner monk because it was his final goal robb to learn from her what she knew of treadwells murder perhaps even to charge her with complicity in it it was imperative monk find her first he sauntered slowly over towards the house robb had eyed and had then left with such reluctance he had no idea who lived there or what robb had hoped to find but there was no time to investigate more carefully this was his only chance to gain the advantage he knocked on the door and stepped back waiting for it to be answered the maid who peered out at him could not have been more than fourteen or fifteen years old but she was determined to make a good impression yes sir he smiled at her good afternoon time was short mrs gardiner asked me if i could carry a message to your mistress if she is in he wished he had some way of knowing the family name it would have sounded more convincing for a moment the girl looked blank but she obviously wished to be helpful are yer sure yer got the right ouse sir theres no one but old mr ornchurch ere oh he was confounded what had robb wanted with old mr hornchurch her face brightened mebbe she meant the ousekeeper mrs whitbread as comes in every day an cooks an does fer mr ornchurch she was took bad the winter before last an it were mrs gardiner wot looked after er he could feel the sweat of relief prickle on his skin he swallowed before he could catch his breath yes of course thats what i should have said perhaps it would be more convenient if i were to speak to mrs whitbread at her home can you tell me how to get there from here the people miriam would turn to would be the ones she had helped in their time of need the girl looked dubious mebbe ill ask er she don like nobody callin on er at ome reckon as when yer orff yer wanna be private like of course he agreed still standing well back from the step im sure you could simply give her the message if you would be so kind im sure i could do that she agreed obviously relieved he pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and a pencil and wrote tell sergeant robb nothing about miriam then folded the note twice turning the ends in and gave it to the girl be sure to give it to her straightaway he warned and if the police come here be very careful what you say her eyes widened i will she promised never say nothin to the rozzers thats wot one ol man tol me thats the best known nothin seen nothin eard nothin me very wise he nodded smiling at her again thank you he said and stepped back and turned to leave he would wait until mrs whitbread finished her duties and then follow her he had real hope that she might lead him to miriam for the meantime he would find something to eat and stay well out of robbs way when he returned to see mrs whitbread himself he sauntered quite casually along the pavement next to a small space of open grass and bought a beefandonion sandwich from a stall it was fresh and he ate it with considerable enjoyment he bought a second and enjoyed that as well he wondered how robb had traced mrs whitbread that was a good piece of detection it commanded his respect and he gave it willingly he liked robb and admired the young mans care for his grandfather he must stay within sight of mr hornchurchs house so he could see when the housekeeper left but not so close that robb when returning would observe him he expected robb to come back the way he had seen him leave so he was jolted by considerable surprise when he heard robbs voice behind him and he swung around to see him only a yard away his face grim his mouth pulled tight waiting for me inspector monk he said coldly monk felt as if he had been slapped in one sentence robb had shown that he had learned monks history in the police and his reputation both for skill and for ruthlessness it was there in robbs face now as he stood in sunlight dappled by the trees his eyes guarded challenging monk could see the anger in himand something else which he thought might be fear was there any point in lying he did not want to make an enemy of robb for practical reasons as well as emotional ones in fact he could not afford to the first concern was miriam her freedom even her life might depend upon this and he had no idea whether she was guilty of anything or not she might have killed treadwell on the other hand she might be in danger herself terrified and running he knew no more of the truth now than he had when lucius stourbridge had walked into his rooms a few days before he shifted his weight to stand a little more casually he raised his eyebrows actually id really been hoping to avoid you he said truthfully robbs mouth curled downward you thought id come back the way i left i would have if i hadnt seen you and i admit that was only chance but i know this area better than you do i have the advantage i wondered if youd follow me it would seem the obvious thing to do if you had no ideas yourself there was a contempt in his voice that stung why did you wait here for me i suppose you already knew i would be going to my grandfather monk was startledand surprised to find himself also hurt he had not earned that from robb certainly he was trying to beat robb to miriam but that was what lucius stourbridge had hired him for robb would not have expected him to do less of course i knew where you were going monk answered keeping his voice level and almost expressionless but the reason i didnt go after you was because i wasnt following you in the first place does it surprise you so much that my investigations should bring me to the same place as yours no robb said instantly you have a wide reputation inspector monk he did not elaborate as to its nature but the expression in his eyes told it well leaving monk no room to hope or to delude himself memories of runcorn flooded back of his anger always there thinly suppressed under his veneer of selfcontrol the fear showing through the expectation that somehow whatever he did monk would get the better of him undermine his authority find the answer first make him look foolish or inept the fear had become so deep over the years it was no longer a conscious thought but an instinct like wincing before you are struck after the accident monk had heard fragments about himself here and there and had pieced them together learned things he had wished were not true the cruel thing was that in the last year or so surely they no longer were his tongue was still quick certainly he was intolerant he did not suffer foolsgladly or otherwise but he was not unjust robb was judging him on the past apparently he said aloud his voice cold he also knew his reputation for skill then you should not be surprised that i came to the same conclusion you did and found the same people without having to trail behind you robb dug his hands into his pockets and his shoulders hunched forward his body tightening there was contempt and dislike in his face but also the awareness of a superior enemy and a sadness that it should be so a disappointment you have an advantage over me mr monk you know my one vulnerability you must do about it whatever you think fit but i will not be blackmailed into stepping aside from pursuing whoever murdered james treadwellwhether it is mrs gardiner or not he looked at monk unblinkingly his brown eyes steady monk felt suddenly sick surely he had never been a person who would descend to blackmailing a young man because he took time off his professional duty to attend to the far deeper duty of love towards an old man who was sick and alone and utterly dependent upon him he could not believe he had ever been like thatnot to pursue any thief or killer there were other ways and certainly not to climb up another step on the ladder of preferment he found his mouth dry and words difficult to form what did he want to say he would not plead it would be both demeaning and useless what you tell your superiors is your own business he replied icily if you tell them anything at all personally i never had such a regard for them that i thought it necessary to explain myself my work spoke for me he sounded arrogant and he knew it but what he said was true he had never explained himself to runcorn nor ever intended to he saw the flash of recognition in robbs face and belief and youll find plenty of sins ive committed monk went on his voice biting but youll not find anyone who knew me to stoop to blackmail youll not find anyone who damned well thought i needed to slowly robbs shoulders relaxed he still regarded monk carefully but the hostility faded from his eyes as the fear loosened its grip on him he licked his lips im sorry perhaps i underestimated your ability that was as far as he would go towards an apology it was not ability monk cared about it was honor but there was no point pursuing that now this was all he was going to get the question was how to remain within sight of the house so he could follow mrs whitbread when she left and yet at the same time elude robb so he did not follow them both and of course that only mattered if the maid at the door did not give robb the same information she had given to monk albeit unwittingly he looked at robb a moment longer then smiled steadily bade him farewell and turned and walked away in the opposite direction from the house he would have to circle around and come back extremely carefully mrs whitbread left at a quarter to five robb was nowhere to be seen as monk followed her at a discreet distance he felt his weariness suddenly vanish his senses become keen and a bubble of hope form inside him they had not gone far perhaps a mile and a quarter before mrs whitbread a thin spare woman with a gentle face turned in at a small house on kemplay road and opened the front door with a key monk waited a few moments looking both ways and seeing no one then he crossed and went to the door he knocked after a minute or two the door was opened cautiously by mrs whitbread yes he had given much consideration to what he was going to say it was already apparent miriam did not wish to be found either by the police or by lucius stourbridge if she had trusted lucius in this matter she would have contacted him long before either she was afraid he would betray her to the police or she wanted to protect him good evening mrs whitbread he said firmly i have an urgent message from mrs andersonfor miriam i need to see her immediately cleo anderson was the one name both women might trust she hesitated only a moment then pulled the door wider youd better come in she said quickly you never know whos watching i had the rozzers round where i work just today he stepped inside and she closed the door i know it was i who sent them to you you didnt tell them anything course not she replied giving him a withering look wouldnt trust them an inch cant afford to he said nothing but followed her down the passage and around the corner into the kitchen standing at the stove facing them eyes wide was the woman he had come to find he knew immediately it was miriam gardiner she was just as lucius had described barely average height softly rounded figure a beautifully proportioned gentle face but with an underlying strength at first glance she might have seemed a sweetnatured woman given to obedience and pleasing those she loved but there was an innate dignity to her that spoke of something far deeper than mere agreeableness something untouchable by anything except love even in those few moments monk understood why lucius stourbridge was prepared to spend so much heartache searching for her regardless of the truth of james treadwells death mrs gardiner he said quietly i am not from the police but nor am i from mrs anderson i lied about that because i feared you would leave before i could speak to you if you knew i came from lucius stourbridge she froze oblivious of the pots on the stove steaming till their lids rattled in the silence that filled the room her terror was almost palpable in the air monk was aware of mrs whitbread beside him he saw the fury in her eyes her body stiff lips drawn into a thin line he was grateful the skillet was on the far wall beyond her reach or he believed she might well have struck him with it i havent come to try to take you back to bayswater he said quietly facing miriam or to the police if you would prefer that i did not tell mr stourbridge where you are then i will not i shall simply tell him that you are alive and unhurt he is desperate with fear for you and that will offer him some comfort although hardly an explanation miriam stared back her face almost white an anguish in it that made him feel guilty for what he was doing and frightened for what he might discover he does not know what to believe he said softly except that you could and would do no intentional evil she drew in her breath and her eyes spilled over with tears she wiped the moisture away impatiently but it was a moment before she could control herself enough to speak i cannot go back it was a statement of absolute fact there was no hope in her voice no possibility of change i can try to keep the police from you he replied as if it were the answer to what she had said but i may not succeed they are not far behind me mrs whitbread walked around him and went over to the stove taking the pans off it before they boiled over she looked across at monk with bitter dislike miriam stepped out of her way farther into the middle of the room what happened monk asked as gently as he could she coughed a little clearing her throat her voice was husky is cleomrs andersonall right yes there was no purpose in pointing out cleo andersons danger if robb felt she was concealing information or even that it was not coincidence that had taken treadwell to her front path miriam seemed to relax a little a faint tinge of color returned to her cheeks where did you last see treadwell he asked her lips tightened and she shook her head a tiny fraction not so much a denial to him as to herself he kept his voice low patient as devoid of threat as he could youll have to answer sometime if not to me then to the police he was murdered beaten over the head he stopped she had turned so ashenpale he feared she was going to faint he lunged forward and caught her by the arms steadying her pushing her sideways and backwards into the kitchen chair for a moment supporting her weight until she sank into it get out mrs whitbread commanded furiously you get out of here she reached for the rolling pin or the skillet to use on him he stood his ground but wary of her put the kettle on he ordered sending me away isnt going to answer this when the police come and they will theyll not come in friendship as i do all they will want will be evidence and justiceor what they believe to be justice miriam closed her eyes it was all she could do to breathe slowly in and out or to keep consciousness mrs whitbread reluctantly turned and filled the kettle putting it on the hob she eyed monk guardedly before she took out cups a teapot and the round tin caddy then she went to the larder for milk her heels tapping on the stone floor monk sat down opposite miriam what happened he asked where was treadwell when you last saw him was he alive yes she whispered opening her eyes but they were filled with horror so deep the words gave him no comfort at all were you there when he was killed she shook her head barely an inch do you know who killed him or why she said nothing mrs whitbread came back with a jug of milk in her hand she glared at monk but she did not interrupt she crossed the floor and tipped a little boiling water into the pot to warm it who killed treadwell monk repeated and why miriam stared at him i cant tell you she whispered i cant tell you anything i cant come with you please go away i cant helptheres nothingnothing i can do there was such a terrible hopeless pain in her voice the argument died on his lips the kettle started to shrill mrs whitbread lifted it off the stove and turned to monk go now she said levelly her eyes hard theres nothing for you here tell lucius stourbridge whatever you have to but go if you come back miriam wont be here theres plenty others wholl hide her if mr stourbridge is the friend he says he is hell leave well enough alone you can see yourself out she still held the kettle steam pouring out of its spout it wasnt exactly a threat but monk did not misunderstand the determination in her he rose to his feet took a last glance at miriam then went to the door then he remembered robb and changed his mind the back kitchen door probably led to an area for coal or coke and then an alleyway ill tell mr stourbridge you are alive and well he said softly no more than that but the police wont be far behind me i know that for certain ive been dodging them for the last two days mrs whitbread understood his thought she nodded go left she ordered youll come to the street again watch for the ash cans was that all she said hester was incredulous when he recounted to her what had happened they were in the comfortable room where he received clients and which also served as sitting room the windows were open to the warm evening air drifting in there was a rustle of leaves from a tree close by and in the distance the occasional clip of hooves from the traffic on the street yes he answered looking across at her she was not sewing as other women might have been she did needlework only as necessity demanded she was concentrating entirely upon what he was saying her back straight her shoulders square her eyes intent upon his face all the confusion and tragedy he was aware of could not stifle the deep well of satisfaction within him that underlay everything else she infuriated him at times they still disagreed over countless things he could have listed her faults using the fingers of both hands and yet as long as she was there he would never be alone and nothing was beyond bearing what was she like she asked he was startled like yes she said impatiently she didnt give you any explanations she didnt tell you why she ran away from the stourbridges party you did ask her i suppose he had not asked by that point he already knew she would not tell him you didnt hesters voice rose an octave she refused to tell me anything he said clearly except that she was not there when treadwell was killed i dont think she even knew he was dead when i told her that she was so horrified she was almost incapable of speech she all but fainted so she knows something about it hester said instantly that was an unwarranted leap of deduction and yet he had made exactly the same one he looked across at her and smiled bleakly so you have learned no new facts she said theres the fact that mrs whitbread was prepared to fight to defend her and risk the police coming after her instead he pointed out and the fact that almost certainly robb will find her sooner or later he did not want to tell hester about robbs opinion of him it was painful a dark thing he preferred she did not know so what was she like she asked again he did not make any evasions or comments on the obscurity of feminine logic ive never seen anyone more afraid he said honestly or more anguished but i dont believe she will tell meor anyone elsewhat happened or why she is running certainly she wont tell lucius stourbridge what are you going to do her voice was little more than a whisper and her eyes were full of pity he realized he had already made his decision i will tell stourbridge that i found her and she is alive and well and that she says she had no part in treadwells death but i will not tell him where she is i daresay she will not be there by the time i report to him anyway i warned her that robb was close behind me he did not need to add the risk he took in so doing hester knew it poor woman she said softly poor woman it was the sixth day of monks enquiry into miriam gardiners flight hester had gone to sleep thinking about her she wondered what tragedy had drawn her to such an act that she could not speak of it even to the man she was to marry but it was not that which woke her shaking and so tense her head throbbed with a stiff sharp pain she had an overwhelming sense of fear of something terrible happening which she was helpless to prevent and inadequate to deal with it was not a small thing or personal to herself but of allconsuming proportions beside her monk was asleep his face relaxed and completely at peace in the clear early light he was as oblivious of her as if they had been in separate rooms different worlds it was not the first time she had woken with this feeling of helplessness and exhaustion and yet she could not remember what she had been dreaming either now or before she wanted to wake monk talk to him hear him say it was all of no importance unreal belonging to the world of sleep but that would be selfish he expected more strength from her he would be disappointed and she could not bear that she lay staring at the ceiling feeling utterly alone because it was how she had woken and she could not cast it away there was something she longed to escape from and she knew that was impossible it was everywhere around her the light through the chink in the curtains was broadening across the floor in another hour or so it would be time to get up and face the day fill her mind with that it was always better to be busy there were battles worth fighting there always were she would speak to fermin thorpe again the man was impossible to reason with because he was afraid of change afraid of losing control and so becoming less important it would probably mean more of the interminable letters few of which ever received a useful answer how could anyone write so many words which when disentangled from their dependent clauses and qualifying additions actually had no meaning florence nightingale was confined to her homesome said even to her bedand spent nearly all her time writing letters of course hers were highly effective in the four years since the end of the war she had changed an enormous number of things particularly to do with the architecture of hospitals first naturally her attention had been upon military hospitals but she had won that victory in spite of a change of government and losing her principal ally now she was bending her formidable will towards civilian hospitals and just as hester was to the training of nurses but it was a battle against stubborn and entrenched interests that held great power fermin thorpe was merely one of many a typical example of senior medical men throughout the country and poor florences health had declined ever since her return hester found that hard to accept even to imagine in scutari florence had seemed inexhaustiblethe last sort of woman on earth to succumb to fainting and palpitations unexplained fevers and general aches and weaknesses and yet apparently that was now the case several times her life had been despaired of her family was no longer permitted to visit her in case the emotion of the occasion should prove too much for her devoted friends and admirers gave up their own pursuits to look after her until the end should come and make her last few months on earth as pleasant as possible time and again this had happened and lately if anything she seemed to be recovered and bursting with new and vigorous ideas she had proposed a school for training nurses and was systematically attacking the opposition it was said nothing delighted her as much as a set of statistics which could be used to prove the point that clean water and good ventilation were necessary to the recovery of a patient hester smiled to herself as she remembered florence in the hot turkish sun determinedly ordering an army sergeant to bring her his figures on the dead of the past week their date of admittance to the hospital and the nature of their injuries and cause of death the poor man had been so exhausted he had not even argued with her one pointless task was much like another to him only his pity for his fellows and his sense of decency had made him reluctant to obey florence had tried to explain to him her pale face alight eyes brilliant that she could learn invaluable information from such things deductions could be made lessons learned mistakes addressed and perhaps corrected people were dying who did not need to distress was caused which could have been avoided the army like fermin thorpe did not listen that was the helplessness which overwhelmed herinjury disease and death all around too few people to care for the sick ignorance defeating so much of even the little they could have done what an insane monstrous waste what a mockery of all that was good and happy and beautiful in life and here she was lying warm and supremely comfortable in bed with monk asleep beside her the future stretched out in front of her with as bright a promise as the day already shining just beyond the curtain it would be whatever she made of it unless she allowed the past to darken it old memories to cripple her and make her useless she still wanted to wake monk and talk to himno that was not true what she wanted was that he should talk to her she wanted to hear his voice hear the assurance in it the will to fightand win she would have liked to get up and do something to keep herself from thinking but she would disturb him if she did and that would be the same thing as having deliberately woken him so she lay still and stared at the patterns of sunlight on the ceiling until eventually she went back to sleep again when she woke the second time it was to find monk waking her gently she felt as if she had climbed up from the bottom of a well and her head still hurt she smiled at him and forced herself to be cheerful if he noticed any artificiality about it he did not say so perhaps he was thinking of miriam gardiner already and still worrying about what he could do to help her and what he would say to lucius stourbridge it was midmorning as she was coming down the main corridor when she encountered fermin thorpe oh good morning missmrs monk he said coming to a halt so that it was obvious he wished to speak with her how are you today he continued immediately so that she should not interrupt him by replying with regard to your desire that women should be trained in order to nurse i have obtained a copy of mr j f souths book published three years ago which i am sure will be of interest to you and enlighten you on the subject he smiled at her meeting her eyes very directly they were passed by a medical student whom he ignored an indication of the gravity of his intent you may not be familiar with who he is so i shall tell you so you may correctly judge the importance of his opinion and give it more weight he straightened his shoulders slightly and lifted his chin he is senior consulting surgeon at saint thomass hospital and more than that he is president of the college of surgeons and hunterian orator he gave the words careful emphasis so she should not miss any part of their importance i quote for you missmrs monk he ishis voice became very distinct not at all disposed to allow that the nursing establishments of our hospitals are inefficient or that they are likely to be improved by any special institution for training as he further points out even sisters in charge of wards do and can only learn by experience he smiled at her with increasing confidence nurses themselves are subordinates in the position of housemaids and need only the simplest of instructions two nurses passed them faces flushed with exertion sleeves hitched up hester opened her mouth to protest but he continued raising his voice very slightly to override her i am perfectly aware of miss nightingales fund for training young women he said loudly but i must inform you madam that only three surgeons and two physicians are to be found among its supporters that surely is an unfailing mark of the regard in which it is held by professional men who are the most highly qualified and experienced in the country now mrs monkhe pronounced her name with satisfaction at having remembered iti trust you will turn your considerable energies towards the true welfare of both the nurses here and the patients and attend to their cleanliness their sobriety and their obedience to do what they are commanded both punctually and exactly good day and without waiting for her reply which he seemingly took for granted in the affirmative he strode away purposefully towards the operating theater satisfied he had dealt with the subject finally hester was too furious to speak for the first few moments then when she could have spoken no words seemed adequate to express her disgust she marched in the opposite direction towards the physicians waiting room there she found cleo talking to an old man who was obviously frightened and doing his best to conceal it he had several open ulcers on both his legs which must have been acutely painful and looked as if they had been there for some time he smiled at cleo but his hands were clenched till his knuckles were white and he sat rigidly upright you need them dressed regularly cleo said gently gotta keep them clean or theyll never heal up ill do it for you if you come here and ask for me i cant come ere every day he answered his voice polite but with absolute certainty int possible miss isnt it now she regarded him thoughtfully looking down at the worn boots and threadbare jacket well i suppose ill have to come to you then how far is it an why would you be doing that he asked dubiously because those sores arent going to get any better otherwise she replied tartly i int askin no favors he said bristling i dont want no nurse woman comin into my ouse wotll the neighbors think o me cleo winced that youre damn lucky at your age to be pulling a nicelooking woman like me she snapped back at him he smiled in spite of himself but yer cant come all the same she looked down at him patiently call yourself a soldier and cant take orders from someone who knows better than you doand make no mistake im your sergeant wen it comes ter them sores he drew in his breath then let it out again without answering well cleo demanded you going to tell me where you live or waste me time having to find out church row he said reluctantly and im going to walk up and down the whole lot asking for you am i cleo said with raised eyebrows number twentyone good like drawin teeth it is he was not sure whether she was joking or not he smiled uncertainly she smiled back at him then saw hester and came over to her trying to look as if she were not out of composure im not going to do it in hospital time she said in a whisper poor old soul fought at waterloo he did an look at the state of him her expression darkened and she forgot the appropriate deference to a social superior anger filled her eyes all for soldiers we was when we thought them french was gonna invade us and we could lose now fortyfive years on we forgotten all about how fit we was and who wants to care for some old man with sores all over his legs whos got no money an talks about wars we dont know nothing about hester thought vividly of the men she had known in scutari and sebastopol and the surgeons tents after that chaotic charge at balaclava they had been so young and in such terrible pain it was their ashen faces that had filled her dreams the previous night she could see them sharp in her minds eye those that had survived would be old men in forty years time would people remember them then or would a new generation be accustomed to peace and resentful and bored by old soldiers who carried the scars and the pain of old wars see that hes cared for hester said quietly thats what matters do it whenever you wish cleo stared back at her eyes widening a little uncertain for a moment whether to believe her they barely knew each other here they had one purpose but they went home to different worlds those debts cannot ever be understood hester answered her let alone paid cleo stood still i was at scutari hester explained oh it was just a single word less than a word but there was understanding in it and profound respect cleo nodded a little and went to the next patient hester left the room again she was in no mood now to see that moral standards were observed or that any nurse was clean neat punctual and sober as she went back along the corridor she was passed by a nurse arriving with her shawl still on youre late hester said tartly dont do it again the woman was startled no miss she said obediently and hurried on head down pulling off the shawl as she went just outside the apothecarys room hester passed a young medical student unshaven and with his jacket flapping open you are untidy sir she said with equal tartness how do you expect your patients to have confidence in you when you look as if you had slept in your clothes and come in with the first post if you aspire to be a gentleman then you had better look like one he was so startled he did not reply to her but stood motionless as she swept past him and on to the surgeons waiting room she spent the morning attempting to comfort and hearten the men and women awaiting care she had not forgotten florence nightingales stricture that the mental pain of a patient could be at least equal to the physical and that it was a good nurses task to dispel doubt and lift spirits wherever possible a cheerful countenance was invaluable as were pleasant conversation and a willingness to listen with sympathy and optimism at the end of the morning hester sat down at the staff dining room table with gratitude for an hours respite within fifteen minutes callandra joined her for once her hair was safely secured within its pins and her skirt and welltailored jacket matched each other only her expression spoiled the effect she looked deeply unhappy what is it hester asked as soon as callandra had made herself reasonably comfortable in the hardbacked chair but had not yet begun her slice of veal pie which seemed to hold little interest for her there is more medicine gone callandra said so quietly she was barely audible there is no possible doubt i hate to think that anyone is systematically stealing the amounts we are dealing with but there can be no other explanation her face tightened her lips in a thin line just think what thorpe will make of it apart from anything else ive already had words with him this morning hester replied ignoring her own plate of cold mutton and new potatoes he was quoting mr south at me i didnt even have a chance to reply to him not that i had anything to say now i want to ask him if we couldnt make some sort of particular provision for the men who fought for us in the past and who are now old and ill callandra frowned what sort of provision i dont know hester grimaced i suppose this is not a fortunate time to suggest we provide their medicine and bandages from the hospital budget we already do callandra said with surprise only if they come here hester pointed out some of them cant come every day they are too old or ill or lame to use an omnibus and a hansom costs far too much even if they could climb into one of them who could give them medicines at home callandra asked curiosity and the beginning of understanding in her eyes us hester replied instantly it wouldnt need a doctor only a nurse with experience and confidencesomeone trained and trustworthy callandra added purposefully hester sighed the specter of the stolen medicines would not leave they could not keep the knowledge of it from fermin thorpe much longer it was ugly dishonest an abuse of every kind of trust both of the establishment of the hospital and of the other nurses who would all be branded with the same stigma of thieving it was also a breach of honor towards the patients for whom the medicines were intended its a circular argument isnt it she said with a thread of despair until we get trained women who are dedicated to an honorable calling and are treated with respect and properly rewarded we wont be able to stop this sort of thing happening all the time and as long as it does people especially those like thorpeand that seems to be most of the medical establishmentwill treat nurses as the worst class of housemaid callandra pulled her mouth into a grimace of disgust i dont know any housemaid who wouldnt take that as an insultpossibly even give noticeif you compared her with a nurse which is a complete summary of what we are fighting hester replied taking half a potato and a nice piece of cold mutton the nightingale school is just about to open callandra made a visible effort to look more hopeful but i believe they had great trouble finding suitable applicants a very high moral standard is required and total dedication of course the rules are almost as strict as a nunnery they dont call them sisters for nothing hester answered with a flash of humor but there were other issues pressing on her mind she had thought again of sergeant robbs grandfather sitting alone unable to care for himself dependent upon robb to take time from his work it must be a burden of fear and obligation to him and how many other old men were there ill and poor now who were victims of wars the young did not remember and old women too perhaps widows of men who had not come home or those who were unmarried because the men who would have been their husbands were dead she leaned a little over the table would it not be possible to create a body of some sort who could visit those people at least see to the more obvious troubles advise when a doctor was needed the look in callandras face stopped her you are dreaming my dear she said gently we have not even achieved proper nurses for the poor law infirmaries attached to the workhouses and you want to have nurses to visit the poor in their homes you are fifty years before your time but its a good dream what about some form of infirmary especially for men who have lost their health fighting our wars hester asked isnt that something at least honor demands if nothing else if honor got all it demanded this would be a very different world callandra ate the last of her pie perhaps enlightened selfinterest might have a greater chance of success how hester asked instantly callandra looked at her the best nursing reforms so far have been within army hospitals due almost entirely to miss nightingales work she was thinking as she spoke her brow furrowed nw buildings have been designed with cleaner water better ventilation and far less crowded wards i know hester disregarded her plate waiting the suggestion which would link the two i am sure mr thorpe would like to be thought of as enlightened callandra continued hester grimaced but did not interrupt again without taking any real risks callandra concluded a poor law infirmary for old soldiers would seem a good compromise of course it would except that it would have to be called something else a good many soldiers would rather die than be seen as accepting parish charity and they shouldnt have to we owe them that much at least she pushed her chair back and stood up but i shall be very tactful when i speak to mr thorpe hester callandra called after her urgently but hester was already at the door and if she heard her she showed no sign of it a moment later callandra was staring at the empty room impossible thorpe said without hesitation quite out of the question there are workhouses to care for the indigent i am not talking about the indigent mr thorpe hester kept her voice level but it required effort i am thinking of men who obtained their injuries or damage to their health fighting in the peninsula war or at great battles like quatre bras or waterloo he frowned quatre bras what are you talking about he asked impatiently it was immediately before waterloo she explained knowing she sounded patronizing it was not a matter of fighting to extend the empire then we were fighting to save ourselves from invasion and becoming a subject people i do not require a history lesson mrs monk he said irritably they did their duty as we all do i am sure that for a young woman there is a certain glamour attached to the uniform and one makes heroes of them no one makes a hero of someone else mr thorpe she corrected him i am concerned with the injured and ill who need our help and i believe have a right to expect it i am sure that as a patriot and a christian you will agree with that a variety of emotions flickered across his face conflicting with each other but he would not deny her assessment of him even if he suspected it contained a powerful element of sarcasm of course he agreed reluctantly i shall take it under advisement i am sure it is something we would all wish to do if it should prove possible his face set in a mask of finality he would no longer argue with her he would simply lie certainly he would consider itindefinitely she knew she was beaten at least in this skirmish as many times as she came to him he would smile agree with her and say he was exploring avenues of possibility and she would never prove him wrong she had an overwhelming insight into the obstruction faced by florence nightingale and why she had taken to her bed with exhaustion fever difficulties of the digestion and such a fire of the mind as to consume the strength of her body hester smiled back at fermin thorpe i am sure you will succeed she lied as well a man who is skilled enough to run a hospital the size of this one so very well will be able to exert the right influence and put forward all the moral and social arguments to persuade others of the rightness of such a cause if you could not then you would hardly be the man for hampstead would you she would not have dared say such a thing were she dependent upon his goodwill for earning a roof over her headbut she was not she was a married woman with a husband to provide for her she was here as a lady volunteerlike callandranot a paid worker it was a wonderful feeling almost euphoric she was free to battle him unhampered as she most certainly would the flush in his cheeks deepened i am glad you appreciate my position mrs monk he said with a tight jaw i have not always been so certain that you were fully mindful that i do indeed run this hospital i am sorry for that she answered one has but to look around one to see the standard of efficiency he blinked aware of the double meaning implied his tone was infinitely condescending i am sure you are a goodhearted woman but i fear your lack of understanding of finance hampers your judgment as to what is possible for instance the cost of medicines is far greater than you probably appreciate and we are unfortunate in suffering a considerable degree of pilfering from morally unworthy staff he opened his eyes very wide if you were to direct your attentions towards the honesty and sobriety of the nurses here we would lose far less and consequently then have more to give to the sick who rely upon us turn your energies towards that mrs monk and you will do the greatest service honesty that will save the sick from their diseases and the morally destitute from the wages of sin both spiritual and temporal he smiled he was well satisfied with that hester made a tactical retreat before he could further pursue the question of missing medicines she had already made up her mind to call upon old mr robb to see if there was anything she could do to help him she could not forget monks description of his distress and that was at least one thing she could accomplish regardless of fermin thorpes power it was a fine summer afternoon and not a long walk to the street where monk had said robb lived she did not know the number but only one enquiry was necessary to discover the answer the houses were all clean and shabby some with whited steps others merely well swept she debated whether to knock or not from what monk had said the old man could not rise to answer and yet to walk in unannounced was a terrible intrusion into the privacy of a man too ill to defend even his own small space she settled for standing in the doorway and calling out his name she waited a few moments in silence then called again who is it the voice was a deep soft rumble my name is hester monk she had so very nearly said latterly she was not used to her new name yet my husband called on you the other day she must not make him feel pitied a suitable case for charity it would be so easy to do with a careless phrase he spoke of you so well i wished to call upon you myself your husband i dont remember he started to cough and it became worse so quickly that she abandoned politeness pushed the door open and went in the room was small and cluttered with furniture but it was clean and as tidy as possible when it was occupied all the time and the necessities of life had to be kept available she went straight over to the sink and found a cup filled it with water from the ewer standing on the bench and took it over to him holding it to his lips there was little else she could do for him his body shuddered as he gasped for breath and she could hear the rattling of phlegm in his chest but it was too deep for him to bring up after a minute or two the coughing subsided more rapidly than she had expected and he took the water from her gratefully sipping it and letting it slide down his throat he handed her back the cup sorry miss he said huskily touch o the bronchitis silly this time o the year it can happen any time if you are subject to it she answered smiling at him sometimes in the summer its worse harder to get rid of youre surely right he agreed nodding slightly he was still pale and his cheeks were a little flushed she guessed he probably had a low fever what can i do for you miss if youre looking for my grandson he isnt here hes a policeman and hes at work very good he is too a sergeant his pride was obvious but far more than that a kind of shining certainty that had nothing to do with the nature of his grandsons work but everything to do with the nature of the man it was you i came to see she reminded him she must find a reason he would accept my husband said you were a sailor and had seen some great dayssome of the most important battles in englands history he looked at her sideways an what would a young lady like you want with stories of old battles what was over and won before you were even born if they were over and lost id be speaking french she replied meeting his eyes with a laugh well i spose thats true still you know that without coming all the way here to see me he was faintly suspicious of her young women of educated speech and good manners did not casually call on an old and ill sailor who from the contents of the room was having desperate trouble finding sufficient money merely to eat let alone buy fuel for the winter a portion of the truth was the best answer perhaps not as irrelevant as it first seemed i was an army nurse in the crimea she told him i know more about war than you may think i dont imagine ive seen as many battles as you have but ive seen my share and closer than id wish ive certainly been part of what happens afterwards suddenly she was speaking with urgency and the absolute and fiercely relevant truth and there is no one i know with whom i can discuss it or bring back the miseries that still come into my dreams no one expects it in a woman they think it all better forgotten easier but it isnt always he stared at her his eyes wide they were clear pale blue they had probably been darker when he was young well now did you really and you such a slip of a thing he regarded her rather too slender body and square thin shoulders but with admiration not disapproval we found at sea sometimes the wiry ones outlasted the great big ones like a side o beef i reckon strength when it comes to it is all a matter o spirit youre quite right she agreed would you like a hot drink now i can easily make one if you would it might ease your chest a little then in case he thought she was patronizing him she added i should like very much to talk with you and i cant if you are taken with coughing again he understood very well what she was doing but she had softened the request sufficiently youre a canny one he smiled at her pointing to the stove kettles over there and tea in the tin little milk in the larder maybe could be were out till michael comes home again doesnt matter she replied standing up its all right without milk if it isnt too strong she was scalding the pot ready to make the tea when the door opened and she turned to see a young man standing just inside the room he was of average height slender with very handsome dark eyes at this moment he was obviously angry who are you he demanded coming farther in and what are you doing he left the door open behind him as if for her to leave the more easily hester monk she replied looking at him squarely i called upon mr robb to visit with him we have much in common and he was kind enough to listen to me in order that he might speak with more comfort he permitted me to make a cup of tea the young man looked at her with total disbelief from the expression in his eyes one might have presumed he thought she was there to steal the meager rations on the shelf behind her what on earth could you have in common with my grandfather he said grimly its all right michael the old man intervened id fairly like to watch her take you on reckon as she might have the best of youwith her tongue any road crimean nurse she is seen more battles than you havelike me she dont mean no harm michael looked uncertainly at the old man then back at hester she respected his protectiveness of his grandfather and hoped she would have done the same had she been in his place and she was unquestionably an intruder but the elder robb should not be treated like a child even if he was physically all but helpless she must refrain from defending his judgment now though the words were on the end of her tongue the old man looked at hester a glint in his eye wouldnt mind getting another cup would you miss of course not hester said demurely lifting the last cup from its hook on the shelf that served as a dresser she finished scalding the pot put in a meager portion of leaves then poured on the boiling water keeping her back to michael she heard the door close and his footsteps across the floor he came up behind her his voice very low did monk send you here no she was about to add that monk did not send her anywhere but on reflection that was not true he had frequently sent her to various places to enquire into one thing or another so far as i know he has no idea i am here i remembered what he said to me of mr robb and i felt that i wished to visit him i have no intention of taking anything that belongs to you sergeant robb or of doing your grandfather any harm either by meddling or by patronizing him nor am i interested in your police concerns with mrs gardiner he blushed painfully but his eyes remained sharp and steady and considerable animosity showed in them you are direct to a fault maam she smiled suddenly yesi know would you rather i beat around the bush a little more i can go back and make ten minutes of obscure conversation if you wish well perhaps five no i would not in spite of himself his voice rose i whatever else he had been about to say was cut short by the old mans beginning to cough again he had struggled forward half out of his chair and he was in considerable distress his face flushed and already beads of sweat on his lip and brow michael swung around and rushed towards him catching him in his arms and easing him back into the chair for the moment hester was completely forgotten the old man was fighting for breath trying desperately to drag the air into his damaged lungs his whole body racked with violent spasms he brought up great gobbets of phlegm dark yellow and spotted with blood hester had already guessed how seriously ill he was but this was agonizing confirmation she wished that there was something she could do but at least until the coughing subsided he was beyond all assistance except the physical support michael was giving him if they had been at the hospital she could have got him a tiny dose of morphine which would have calmed the wrenching lungs and given him the opportunity to rest sherry and water would have been good as a restorative she looked around the shelves to see what there was her mind racing to think of a way of giving him what he lacked without hurting his pride she knew perfectly well that anxiety could make people ill that fear could destroy the passion to survive humiliation and the conviction that one was useless a burden to those one loved had precipitated the death of many a person who might well have recovered had he perceived himself as valuable she saw bread and cheese three eggs a carefully covered piece of cold beef some raw vegetables and a slice of pie it was not much to feed two men perhaps michael robb bought his lunch while on duty on the other hand he very possibly sacrificed much of his own welfare to care for his grandfather but in such a way that the old man was unaware of it there was a closed cupboard and she hesitated reluctant to intrude any further was there some way that she could get kristian beck to come and visit mr robb and then prescribe morphine for him he was too old and his illness too far progressed for treatment to accomplish anything beyond alleviating his distress but surely that was a side of medicine which was just as important many things could not be cured no nurse worth her calling abandoned such cases what was there she could find in the meantime even hot tea alone might soothe as soon as he could master himself enough to drink it then she saw a small jar of clear honey she poured a cup of tea for him added the honey and sufficent cold water to make it drinkable and carried it over waiting for a moments ease in his coughing then she stepped in front of michael and held the cup to the old mans lips take a sip she told him it will help fumblingly he obeyed and perhaps the honey soothed the spasms of his throat because his body eased and he began to relax sipping again and then again it seemed as if for the moment at least the attack was over she took the cup away and set it down then went back to the sink and found a bowl that would serve for washing poured the rest of the water from the kettle into it and automatically put more on to heat she added a little cold tested it with her hand and with a cloth and a towel returned to the old mans chair he was exhausted and very pale but far calmer the fact that he had been for a while unable to control himself was obviously an embarrassment to him michael stood anxiously aware of the older mans emotions angry and protective this should have been private and hester was an intruder hester wrung out the cloth in the hot water and gently bathed the old mans face then his neck then as he did not protest unfastened his shirt and took it off very aware of michaels eyes on her wringing out the cloth every few moments she bathed the old mans arms and body all the time she did not speak and neither did they once michael had ascertained what she was doing and that his grandfather was eased by it rather than further discomforted he went to find a clean shirt and returned carrying it it was roughdried but it smelled fresh and was quite soft to the touch hester helped the old man into it then took away the bowl of water and emptied it outside down the drain she came back into the room to find john robb smiling at her the hectic color fading from his cheeks and michael still guarded but less aggressive thank you miss robb said a little anxiously im real sorry to have put you out you didnt she smiled i still hope in time we may talk and you will tell me tales of things ive only imagined i can that he agreed with a return of enthusiasm another day michael said sharply youre tired im all right robb insisted dont you worry yourself michael i told you this lady heres one o them crimean nurses so i reckon she knows all she needs to about the sick you go back to your watch lad i know theres important things only you can do he looked at him steadily his voice getting stronger a touch of old authority back again dont you be worrying michael looked at hester frowning a little his lips drawn tight i appreciate your kindness mrs monk he hesitated the battle within him clear in his face and im sure my grandfather will enjoy your company and i his hester replied i shall look forward to coming by whenever i am able to i am frequently at the hospital not far away it is no journey at all thank you he must be sensitive to what a relief it would be to the old man to have company and assistance he could look forward to without the anxiety of knowing that he was keeping michael from his job and that every minute spent there was in some essence a risk for michael but the young policeman was still angry beneath the gratitude for all its sincerity it is not a trouble hester repeated michael moved towards the door indicating that she should go with him goodbye grandpa he said gently ill try not to be late dont worry robb assured him ill be all right they were brave words and he said them as if they could be true although they all knew they might not be just outside on the step michael lowered his voice and fixed hester with an intense stare youre a good nurse mrs monk and i surely appreciate the way you look after him better than i can and you didnt make him feel like its charity youve got a way with you i suppose that comes from being out at the war and all that it also comes from liking him she replied honestly there was no indication in his eyes as to whether he believed her but dont be thinking anything you do here will make a difference because it wont he went on levelly i wont stop looking for miriam gardiner and when i find her which i will if shes guilty of killing james treadwell ill arrest her and charge her whatever you do for my grandfather his face tightened even more his voice a little hoarse and whether you tell the police station or not he colored slightly and if that insults you im sorry im used to being insulted sergeant robb she replied surprised at how much the suggestion hurt but i admit this is a totally new manner of saying my work is worthless incompetent or generally of morally questionable nature i didnt mean he began then bit the words back the pink deepening in his cheeks yes you did she contradicted him making the most of his embarrassment but i suppose i can understand it you must feel very vulnerable coming away from your post to care for your grandfather i swear to you that i have no motive for being here except to offer him some care according to my profession and to talk with him over old memories i can share with no one who has not had the experiences from which they spring you must believe me or not as circumstances prove me and without waiting to see his response she turned and went back in through the door leaving it ajar behind her for the warm air to come in she was only half aware of michaels footsteps as he walked away she remained far longer than she had originally intended to begin with she had talked comparatively little answering a few questions about what life had been like for her in the hospital at scutari and even describing florence nightingale robb was interested to hear about her what she looked like her demeanor her voice even her manner of dress such was her reputation that the smallest details held his attention hester was happy to answer feeling memory so sharp she could almost smell the blood and vinegar again and the sickening odor of gangrene and the other acrid stenches of disease she could feel the summer heat and hear the buzzing of flies as if the mild english sun coming in through the windows were the same and it would be a turkish street outside halfway through the afternoon he fell asleep and she was able to stand up and tidy the kitchen space a little ready to prepare him another cup of tea should he want it she would certainly welcome one herself milk or no milk to go with it she considered going out to purchase some but decided not to it would be a slight to his hospitality a small and needless hurt tea was perfectly adequate without she tried the closed cupboard to see if there was anything in it which might help him should he have another attack any herbal leaves such as camomile to settle the stomach or feverfew to help headache or even a little quinine to reduce temperatures she was pleased to find all those things and also a small packet that suggested morphine to her a taste on a moistened finger confirmed it this was quite a respectable medicine cabinet too accurate to his needs to have been collected by an amateur or by chance and too expensive to have been purchased out of a police sergeants pay except by the most desperate economies elsewhere she closed the cupboard silently and stood facing the room her mind whirling morphine was one of the principal medicines missing from the hospital she had assumed as everyone else had that it was being taken for addicts who had been given it for pain and now could not survive without it but perhaps it was being taken to heal the sick who could not come to the hospital people like john robb certainly that was still theft but she could not find it in herself to disapprove of it the questions that burned in her mind were who had brought them and did michael robb know was that even in part the cause of his concern at her being here she did not believe it intelligence told her it was possible instinct denied it without consideration the old man himself so peacefully asleep in the afternoon sun undoubtedly must know who had brought them but would he know they might be stolen he might guess but she thought it unlikely she would not ask him there was no decision to make the question did not arise that she should pursue it she sat down and waited patiently until he should awaken then she would make him tea again with a little more honey it would be a good idea to bring him a further supply to make up for what she had drunk herself he awoke greatly refreshed and delighted to find her still there he started to talk straightaway not even waiting while she served tea and brought it for them both you asked about my sailing days he said cheerfully well o course the greatest o them was the battle werent it he looked at her expectantly his eyes bright the battle she asked turning around to face him cmon girl theres only one battle for a sailoronly one battle for englandreally for england like she smiled at him oh you mean trafalgar course i mean trafalgar youre teasin me arent you youve gotta be you were at trafalgar really she was impressed and she allowed it to show in her voice and her eyes surely i was never forget that if i live to be a hundred which i wont great day that was an terrible too i reckon theres bin none other like it nor wont be again she poured the water onto the tea what ship were you on why the victory o course he said it with pride in his voice so sharp and clear that for a moment she could hear in it the young man he had been over half a century before when england had been on the brink of invasion by napoleons armies and nothing stood between them and conquest except the wooden walls of the british fleetand the skill and bravado of horatio nelson and the men who sailed with him she felt a stirring of the same pride in herself a shiver of excitement and knowledge of the cost because she too had seen battle and knew its reality as well as its dream she brought the tea over to him and offered him a cup he took it and his eyes met hers over the rim i was there he said softly i remember that morning like it were yesterday first signal come in about six that was on the nineteenth of october enemy had their tops yards hoisted least thats what we heard later then they were coming out o port under sail half past nine and bright light over the sea when we heard it on the victory he shook his head all day we tacked and veered around toward gibraltar but we never saw em visibility was pooryou got to understand that weather gettin worse all the time under closereefed topsails we were an too close to cadiz she nodded sipping her tea not interrupting admiral gave the signal to wear and come northwest back to our first position next day that was you see yes i see i know the battle was on the twentyfirst he nodded again appreciation in his face by dawn o the twentyfirst the admiral had it exactly right twentyone miles north by west o cape trafalgar we were and to windward o the enemy his eyes were smiling shining blue like the sea that historic day i can smell the salt in the air he said softly screwing up his face as if the glare of the water blinded him still ordered us into two columns and make full sail she did not speak he was smiling his tea forgotten made a notch on me gun i did like the man next to me he was an irishman i remember the admiral came around to all of us he asked what we were doin the irishman told him we were making a mark for another victory like all the others just in case he fell in the battle nelson laughed an said as he would make notches enough in the enemys ships about eleven in the morning the admiral went below to pray and wrote in his diary as we learned afterwards then he came up to be with us all that was when he had the signal run up he smiled and shook his head as if some thought consumed him he was going to say nelson confides but lieutenant pascoe told him that expects was in the popham code an he didnt have to spell it out letter by letter so what he sent was england expects that every man will do his duty he gave a little shrug looking at her to make sure she knew how those words had become immortal he saw it in her face and was satisfied i dont really know what happened in the lee column he went on still looking at her but his eyes already sea blue and far away his inner vision filled with the great ships sails billowing in the wind high up masts that scraped the sky coming around to face the enemy men at the ready muscles taut silent by their guns the decks behind them painted red not to show the blood when the slaughter began she could see in his eyes and the curve of his lips the memory of a sharper light than this english summer the pitch of the deck as the ship hit the waves the waiting and then the roar and slam of cannon fire the smell of saltpeter the sting of smoke in the eyes and nose you cant imagine the noise he said so softly it was almost a whisper make them train engines they got now sound like silence gunner i was an a good one nobody knows how many broadsides we fired that day but it was about half past one that the admiral was hit pacing the quarterdeck he was with the captaincaptain hardy he screwed up his face there was some idiots as says he was paradin with a chest full o medals they havent been in a sea battle anyway when he was at sea he never dressed like that shabby he was wore an ordinary blue jacket like anyone else he wore sequin copies of his orders but if you ever spent time at sea youd know they tarnish in a matter o days he shook his head in denial again and you couldnt hardly see anybody to make em out clear during a battle smoke everywhere could miss your own mother not a dozen feet from you he stopped for a few minutes to catch his breath hester thought of offering him more tea fresh and hot but she could see that memory was more important so she sat and waited he resumed his story telling her of the knowledge of victory and the crushing grief felt by the entire fleet when they knew nelson was dead then of the other losses the ships and the men gone the wounded the securing of the prizes and then the storm which had arisen and caused even further devastation he described it in simple vivid words and his emotion was as sharp as if it had all happened weeks before not fiftyfive years he told of putting nelsons body in a cask of brandy to preserve it so it could be buried in england as he had wished just a little man he was up to my chin no more he said with a fierce sniff funny that we won the greatest victory at sea eversaved our country from invasion an we came home with flags lowered like we lostbecause he were dead he fell silent for some time she rose and boiled the kettle again resetting the tray and making a light supper for him with a piece of pie cut into a thin slice and hot tea after he had eaten with some pleasure he told her of nelsons funeral and how all london had turned out to wish him a last farewell buried in a special coffin he was he added with pride plain an simple like death or the sea made from wood taken from the wreckage of the french flagship at the battle of the nile pleased as punch when hallowell gave it to him way back he was kept it all those years laid in the painted hall in greenwich hospital first mourners come on january fourth he smiled with supreme satisfaction prince o wales hisself he took a deep breath and let it out in a rasping cough but held up his hand to prevent her from interrupting him laid there four days while all the world went by to pay their respects then we took him up the river on wednesday morning the coffin was placed on one of the royal barges made for king charles ii an all covered over in black velvet with black ostrich plumes and went in a flotilla up to london eleven other barges there were all the livery companies with their banners flying never seen so much gold and color stiff wind that day too fired the guns every minute all the way up to whitehall stairs he stopped again blinking hard but he could not keep the tears from spilling over and running down his cheeks next day we took him to saint pauls great procession but mostly army only navy there was us from the victory herself his voice cracked but it was from pride as well as grief i was one of them what carried our battle ensigns we opened them up now and again so the crowd could see the shot holes in them they all took their hats off as we passed it made a sound like the noise of the sea he rubbed his hand across his cheek there isnt anything id take this side o heaven to trade places with any man alive who wasnt there i wouldnt understand it if you did she answered smiling at him and unashamed to be weeping too he nodded slowly youre a good girl you know what it means dont you that was a statement not a question he drew in his breath as if to thank her then knew it was unnecessary even inappropriate it would have implied debt and there was none before she could say anything in answer the door opened and michael robb came in only then did she realize how long she had been there it was early evening the shadows of the sun were long across the floor and touched with a deeper color she felt a warmth of selfconsciousness wash up her face automatically she stood up michaels disapproval and alarm were too obvious to hide he saw the tears on the old mans face and turned to glare at hester i had the best afternoon in years robb said gently looking up at his grandson she kept me real company we talked about all sort o things ive got a kind o peace inside me come sit down and have a cup o tea you look like your feet hurt boy and youre mortal tired michael hesitated confusion filling his face he looked from one to the other of them then finally accepted that his grandfather was telling the truth about his pleasure and hester really had given him a rare gift of companionship unspoiled by duty or the seeking of recompense a wide smile of relief lit his face cutting through the weariness and showing for a moment the youth he wanted to be yes he agreed vehemently yes i will he turned to hester thank you mrs monk his eyes shadowed im sorry i found miriam gardiner hester felt a sudden coldness inside the sweetness of the moment before was gone i had to arrest her for treadwells murder he finished watching her to see her reaction why she protested why on earth would miriam gardiner murder the coachman if she wanted to escape from lucius stourbridge for whatever reason all she had to do was have treadwell leave her somewhere he would never have known where she went after that she drew in her breath and if she simply went somewhere near her home lucius would know more about that than treadwell anyway michael looked as if the answer gave him no pleasure barely even any satisfaction he would probably dearly like to have taken off his boots which were no doubt tight and hot after the long day but her presence prevented him the most obvious reason is that treadwell knew something about her which would have ruined her prospects of marriage into the stourbridge family he answered i daresay she loved young mr stourbridge but whether she did or not theres a great deal of money to it more than shell even have seen in her life hester wanted to protest that miriam had no regard for the money but she did not know if that was true she had impressions feelings but barely any real knowledge she walked over to the kettle refilled it from the ewer which was now almost empty and set it on the stove again im sorry michael said wearily sinking into the chair its too plain to ignore the two of them left the stourbridge house together they came as far as hampstead heath his body was found and she ran away surely any innocent person would have stayed or at least come back and reported what had happened she thought quickly what if they were both attacked by someone else and she was too afraid of that person to tell anyone what happened he looked at her doubtfully so afraid that even when we arrested her she still wouldnt say his voice denied his belief in it do you know this miriam gardiner girl robb asked looking at hester sadly no no i havent met her she was surprised that that was true since she felt so strongly about it it defied sense i i just know a little about her i suppose i put myself in her place a little in her place michael echoed what would make you leave a man beaten dying but still alive and run away never to come forward until the police hunted you down and then give no explanation even when you were arrested for killing him i dont know she admitted reluctantly i cant think of anything but that doesnt mean there couldnt be a reason shes protecting someone the old man said shaking his head womenll do all sorts to protect someone they love ill lay you odds girl if she didnt kill him herself she knows who did michael glanced at hester could be she was having an affair with treadwell he said pursing his lips could be he tried to force her to keep it going and she wanted to end it because of stourbridge hester did not argue anymore reason was all on his side and she had nothing to marshal against it she turned her attention to the kettle when she arrived home monk was already there and she was startled to see that he had prepared cold game pie and vegetables for dinner and it was set out on the table she realized how late it was and apologized with considerable feeling she was also deeply grateful she was hot and tired and her boots felt at least a size too tight what is it he asked seeing the droop in her shoulders and reading her too well to think it was only weariness theyve found miriam she replied looking up at him from where she had sat down to unlace her boots he stood still in the doorway staring at her they arrested her she finished quietly michael robb thinks she killed treadwell either because he knew something about her which would have ended her chance of marrying lucius or because she was having an affair with him and wanted to end it his face was grave the lines harder how do you know that she realized the necessity for explanation a little late i was visiting his grandfather because he is seriously ill when sergeant robb came home and robb just told you this his eyes were wide and steady he knew i was your wife oh he hesitated and do you think miriam killed treadwell he was watching her trying to read not only her words but her feelings he looked strangely defeated as if he had felt the same unreasoning hope that miriam could be innocent it was very sweet not to be alone in her sense of disappointment even disillusion she took her boots off and wriggled her feet then stood up and walked over to him she smiled and kissed him lightly on the cheek thank you for the dinner he grinned with satisfaction dont make a habit of it he said smugly she knew better than to reply she walked a step behind him to the table monk was unable to rid his mind of the thought of miriam gardiners arrest he slept deeply but when he awoke the memory of her distress twisted his thoughts until he had no choice but to determine to see her in case there might be any difficulty with the prison authorities he lied without compunction meeting the jailers gaze with candor and saying he was her legal adviser with whom of course she was entitled to consult monk found her sitting alone in a cell her hands folded in her lap her face pale but so composed as to be in a way frightening there was no anger in her no will to fight no outrage at injustice she seemed neither pleased nor displeased to see him as if his presence made no difference with regard to anything that mattered the cell door clanged behind him and he heard the heavy bolt shoot home the floor was perhaps five paces by five black stone the walls whitewashed a single high aperture was heavily glassed letting in light but not color the sky beyond could have been blue or gray the air was stuffy smelling of decades perhaps centuries of anger and despair mrs gardiner he began he had rehearsed what to say to her but now it seemed inadequate intelligence was needed even brilliance if he was to help her in this dreadful situation of confusion and pain and yet all that seemed natural or remotely appropriate was emotion i hoped robb would not find you but since he has please allow me to do what i can to help she looked at him blankly her face almost expressionless you cannot help mr monk i mean that as no reflection upon your abilities simply that my situation does not allow it he sat down facing her what happened he asked urgently do you know who killed treadwell she kept her eyes averted staring into some dark space that only she could see do you know he repeated more sharply there is nothing i can tell you which will help mr monk there was finality in her voice no lift of hope not even of argument she had no will to fight did you kill him he demanded she lifted her head slowly her eyes wide before she spoke he knew what she was going to say no then who did she looked away again his mind raced the only reason for her silence must be to protect someone had she any conception of what it was going to cost her did treadwell threaten you he asked no but there was no surprise in her voice or in the profile of her face whom was she protecting cleo anderson who had been almost a mother to her some other lover from the past or a relative of her first husband was he threatening someone else blackmailing you he persisted all sorts of arguments sprang to his lips about not being able to help her if she would not help herself but they died unspoken because it was too painfully apparent she had no belief that help was possible was treadwell blackmailing you about something in your life here in hampstead no she lifted her head again there was nothing to blackmail me about tears filled her eyes emotion had broken through the ice of despair for a few moments then it withered again the stark cell with its wooden cot and straw mattress the bare walls and stifling air were hardly real to her her world was within herself and her own pain surely she had not yet even imagined what would follow if she did not present some defense either she had some reason for attacking treadwell or else it was simply someone else who had killed him the only other alternative was that she had not even been present and had no idea what had happened then why did she not say so he looked at her hunched figure where she sat half turned away from him unresponsive miriam he put out his hand and touched her her body was rigid miriam what happened why did you leave the stourbridge house was it something to do with treadwell no there was a driving core of emotion in her voice no she repeated it had nothing to do with treadwell he was merely good enough to drive me you simply asked him and he agreed he said with surprise did he not require some reason not reason recompense you paid him my locket it doesnt matter that she would part so easily with a personal item of jewelry was a measure of how desperate she had been he wondered what had become of the locket it had not been with treadwells clothes had his murderer taken it where is it now he asked did you take it back she frowned where is it isnt it with him with his body no she lifted her shoulders very slightly less than a shrug then i dont know but it doesnt matter dont waste your effort on it mr monk maybe it will find its way to someone who will like it i would rather it were not lost down some drain but if it is i cant help it now what should i put my effort into miriam she did not answer for so long he was about to repeat himself when at last she spoke comfort lucius without warning her composure broke and she bent her head and covered her face sobs shaking her body he longed to be able to help her she was alone vulnerable facing trial and almost certainly one of the ugliest of deaths impulse overcame judgment he reached out and took hold of her arm words wont comfort him when you are in the dock or when the judge puts on his cap and sentences you to hang tell me the truth while i can do something about it why did you leave the stourbridge house or if you wont tell me that at least tell me what happened in hampstead who killed treadwell where were you why did you run away who are you afraid of it took her several moments to master herself again she blew her nose then still avoiding meeting his eyes she answered in a low choked voice i cant tell you why i left only that i had to what happened in hampstead is that treadwell was attacked and murdered i think perhaps it was my fault but i did not do it that i swear i never injured anyone with intent she looked at him her eyes redrimmed please tell lucius that mr monk i never willfully harmed anyone i want him to believe that her voice trailed off into a sob he already believes that he said more gently it is not lucius you have to be concerned about i doubt he will ever think ill of you it is the rest of the world especially sergeant robb and then whatever jury he brings you before and he will unless you give some better account did you see who attacked treadwell at least answer me yes or no yes but no one would believe me even if i would say and i will not she spoke with finality there was no room to imagine she hoped to be dissuaded she did not care what monk thought and he knew it from everything about her from the slump of the body to the lifelessness of her voice try me he urged desperately tell me the truth and let me decide whether i believe it or not if you are innocent then someone else is guilty and he must be found if he isnt you will hang i know did you think i didnt understand that he had wondered fleetingly if she was of mental competence if perhaps she was far more frail than lucius had had any idea but the thought had lasted only moments will you see lucius or major stourbridge he asked no she pulled away from him sharply for the first time real fear in her voice no i wont if you have any desire to help me then do not ask me again i wont he promised you give me your word she stared at him her eyes wide and intense i do but i warn you again that no one can help you until you tell the truth if not to me would you tell a lawyer someone who is bound to keep in confidence whatever you say regardless of what it is a smile flickered over her face and vanished it would make no difference whatever it is the truth itself that wounds mr monk not what you may do with it thank you for coming i am sure your intention was generous but you cannot help please leave me to myself she turned away again dismissing him he had no alternative but to accept he stood up hesitated a moment longer without purpose then called the jailer to let him out just outside the gates he encountered michael robb robb looked tired and it was obscurely pleasing to monk that there was no air of triumph in him they stood facing each other on the hot dusty footpath youve been to see her robb said stating what was obvious between them she wont tell you anything monk said not in answer but as a statement of fact she wont speak to anyone she wont even see stourbridge robb looked him up and down from his neat cravat and the shoulders of the wellcut jacket to the tips of his polished boots do you know what happened he asked raising his eyebrows no monk replied robb put his hands in his pockets deliberately casual even sloppy by contrast i shall find out he promised no matter how long it takes me i will know what happened to treadwellor enough to make a prosecution theres something in his past or hers that made this happen he was watching monks face as he spoke weighing his reaction trying to read what he knew you will have to monk agreed wryly all you have at the moment is suspicionnot enough to hang anyone on robb winced almost imperceptibly just a stiffening of his body it was an ugly word an ugly reality i will his voice was very soft treadwell may have been an evil man for all i know deserving some kind of retribution but the day we allow the man in the street to decide that for himself without trial without answering to anyone then we lose the right to call ourselves civilized then law belongs to the quickest and the strongest not to justice we arent a society anymore he was selfconscious as he said it daring monk to laugh at him but he was proud of it also monk hoped he had never done anything in the past which made robb imagine he would mock that decision he would probably never know a dray rumbled noisily past them i wont stand in your way he answered levelly none of us could afford private vengeance he wondered if robb had any idea how true that was shed be better if she told us robb frowned cant you persuade her of that otherwise ill have to dig for it go through all her life all her friends her first husband everything thats one of the things about murder monk nodded and lifted his shoulders very slightly you have to learn more about everybody than you want to know all the secrets that have nothing to do with the crime as well as those that do innocent people are stripped of their masks of pretense sometimes of decently covered mistakes theyve long since mended you have to know everything the victim ever did that could make someone take the last terrible step of killing him creep as close as his skin till you see every blemish and can read the hatred that destroyed him of course youll know treadwell and youll come to pity himand probably hate him as well people passed by and they ignored them have you solved a lot of murders robb asked it was not a challenge there was respect and curiosity in his face yes monk answered him some i understood and might have done the same myself others were so coldblooded so consumed in self it frightened me that another human being i had talked with stood beside could have hidden that evil behind a face which looked to me like any other robb stared at him for several seconds neither of them moved oblivious of the noisy street around them i think this is going to be one of the first robb said at last i wish it werent i wish i werent going to find some private shame in mrs gardiners life that treadwell was blackmailing her about threatening to ruin the happiness shed found but i have to look and if find it i have to bring it to evidence that was a challenge monk thought how young he was and he wondered what evidence he had foundor lostwhen he was that age and for that matter what he would do now if he were in robbs place but he was not he had no further interest in the case his task was over not very satisfactorily of course you do he answered there are hundreds of judgments to make you have to check which are yours and which arent good day sergeant robb robb stood facing him in the sun good day mr monk its been an interesting experience to meet you he looked as if he was about to add something more then changed his mind and went on past monk towards the prison gate monk had no duties in the case now even moral obligation took him no further miriam had refused to explain anything either of her flight from cleveland square or what had happened in hampstead there was nothing more he could do hester was still at the hospital although it was now late monk sat at his desk writing letters his mind only half on them and was delighted when the doorbell rang only when he answered it and saw lucius stourbridge did his heart sink should he express some condolence for the situation lucius had hired him to find miriam and he had done so the result had been catastrophic even though it was none of his doing lucius looked haggard his eyes darkringed his cheeks pale beneath his olive skin giving him a sallow almost gray appearance he was a man walking through a nightmare i know you have already done all that i asked of you mr monk he began even before monk could invite him inside and that you endeavored to help mrs gardiner even concealing her whereabouts from the police but they found her nevertheless and arrested her the words were so hard for him to say that his voice cracked and he was obliged to clear his throat before he could continue for the murder of treadwell he swallowed i know she cannot have done such a thing please mr monk at any cost at all up to everything i have please help me prove that he stood still on the front doorstep his body rigid hands clenched eyes filled with his inner agony it is not the cost mr stourbridge monk answered slowly fighting his common sense and everything his intelligence told him please come in it is a matter of what is possible i have already spoken to her he continued as lucius followed him into the sitting room she will not tell me anything of what occurred all she would say was that she did not kill treadwell of course she didnt lucius protested still standing we must save her from he could not bear to use the word we must defend her i i dont know how or he trailed off but i know your reputation mr monk if any man in london can help it is you if you know my reputation then you know i will not conceal the truth if find it monk warned even if it is not what you wish to hear lucius lifted his chin it may not be what i wish to hear mr monk but it will not be that miriam killed treadwell in any unlawful way i believe it was someone else but she dares not say so because she is afraid of him either for herself or for someone else his voice shook a little but if she brought about his death herself then it was either an accident or she was defending herself from some threat which was too immediate and too gross to endure monk held very little hope of such a comfortable solution if that was the case why had miriam not simply said so she would not be blamed for defending her virtue more sharply etched in his mind were the images of treadwells head and his scarred knees but no other injury at all he had not been involved in a struggle with anyone he had been hit one mighty blow which had caused him to bleed to death within his skull in a very short while during that time he had crawled from wherever the attack had taken place probably seeking help he knew the area perhaps he even knew cleo anderson was a nurse and had tried to reach her had miriam simply watched him crawl away without making any attempt to help why had she not at least reported the incident if she was in any way justified hiding was not the action of an honorable woman the victim of an attack herself further and perhaps even more damning what could she possibly have had at hand with which to inflict such a blow and how had treadwell if he had been threatening her had his back to her mr stourbridge he said grimly i have no idea whether i can find the truth of what happened if you wish i can try but i hold far less hope than you do that it will be anything you can bear to believe the facts so far do not indicate her innocence lucius was very pale then find more facts mr monk by the time you have them all they will prove her honor i know her it was a blind statement of belief and his face allowed no argument no appeal to a lesser thing like reason monk would like to have asked him to wait and thus give himself time to consider all the consequences but there was no time robb would be looking already the crown would prosecute as soon as it had sufficient evidence whether it was the whole story or not there was nothing on which to mount any defense are you quite sure he tried one more time useless as he knew it yes lucius replied instantly i have twenty guineas here and will give you more as you need it anything at all just ask me he held out a soft leather pouch of coins thrusting it at monk monk did not immediately take the money the first thing will be your practical help if treadwells death was not caused by miriam then it is either a chance attack which i cannot believe or it is to do with his own life and character i will begin by learning all i can about that it will also keep me from following sergeant robbs footsteps and perhaps appearing to him to be obstructing his path additionally if i do learn anything i have a better chance of keeping the option of either telling him or not as seems to our best advantage yes yes lucius agreed obviously relieved to have some course of action at last what can i do he gave a tiny shrug i tried to think of what manner of man treadwell was and could answer nothing i saw him almost every day hes dead killed by god knows whom and i cant give an intelligent answer i didnt expect you to tell me from your observation monk assured him i would like to speak to the other servants then discover what i can of treadwells life outside bayswater i would rather learn that before the police if i can of course lucius agreed thank you mr monk i shall be forever in your debt if there is anything monk stopped him please dont thank me until i have earned it i may find nothing further or worse still what i find may be something you would have been happier not to know i have to know lucius said simply until tomorrow morning mr monk good day mr stourbridge monk replied walking towards the door to open it for him monk was in the house in cleveland square by ten oclock the next morning and with luciuss help he questioned the servants both indoor and outdoor about james treadwell they were reluctant to speak of him at all let alone to speak ill but he read in their faces and in the awkwardness of their phrases that treadwell had not been greatly likedbut he had been respected because he did his job well a picture emerged of a man who gave little of himself whose sense of humor was more founded in cruelty than goodwill but who was sufficiently sensible of the hierarchy within the household not to overstep his place or wound too many feelings he knew how to charm and was occasionally generous when he won at gambling which was not infrequently no maid reported any unwelcome attentions nothing had gone missing he never blamed anyone else for his very few errors monk searched his room which was still empty as no replacement for him had yet been employed all his possessions were there as he had left them it was neat but there was a book on horse racing open on the bedside table a halfopen box of matches beside the candle on the windowsill and a smart waistcoat hung over the back of the upright chair it was the room of a man who had expected to return monk examined the clothes and boots carefully he was surprised how expensive they werein some cases as good as his own treadwell certainly had not paid for them on a coachmans earnings if the money had come from his gambling then he must have spent a great deal of time at itand been consistently successful it seemed unpleasantly more and more likely that he had had another source of income one a good deal more lucrative monk did enquire without any hope if perhaps the clothes were handmedowns from either lucius or harry stourbridge he was not surprised to learn that they were not such things went to servants of longer standing and remained with them as far as miriam gardiner was concerned he learned nothing beyond what he had already been told she was unused to servants and therefore had not treated the coachman with the distance that was appropriate but that was equally true for all the other household staff no one had observed anything different with regard to treadwell without exception they all spoke well of her and seemed confused and grieved by her current misfortune monk spent the following day in hampstead and kentish town as he had told lucius he would he walked miles asked questions till his mouth was dry and his throat hoarse he arrived home after nine oclock when it was still daylight but the heat of the afternoon was tempered by an evening breeze the first thing he wanted to do was to take his boots off and soak his burning feet but hesters presence stopped him it was not an attractive thing to do and he was too conscious of her to indulge himself so instead after accepting her welcome with great pleasure he sat in the coolness of the office which doubled as a sitting room a glass of cold lemonade at his elbow his boots still firmly laced and answered her questions expensive tastes far more than stourbridge paid him at least three times as much hester frowned gambling gamblers win and lose he seems to have had his money pretty regularly but more than that he only had one day off a fortnight gambling to that extent needs time she was watching him closely her eyes anxious unexpectedly she did not prompt him he was surprised i considered a mistress with the means to give him expensive gifts he continued but in going around the places where he spent his time off he seems to have had money and purchased the things himself he enjoyed spending money he wasnt especially discreet about it so you think it was come by honestly her eyes widened no i think he was not afraid of anyone discovering the dishonesty in it he corrected it wasnt stolen there are other dishonest means available to a coachman what the answer was obvious why was she deliberately not saying it he looked back at her trying to fathom the emotion behind her eyes he thought he saw reluctance and fear but it was closed in she was not going to share it with him he felt excluded it was startlingly unpleasant a sense of loneliness he had not experienced since the extraordinary night she had accepted his proposal of marriage he was uncertain how to deal with it candor was too instinctive to him the words were the only ones to his tongue blackmail he replied oh she looked at him so steadily he was now doubly sure she was concealing her thoughts and that they were relevant to what they were discussing yet how could she know anything about treadwell she had been working at the hospital in hampsteadhadnt she it seems the obvious possibility he said trying to keep his voice even that or theft which he had little time for he lived in at the stourbridges and they have nothing missing he liked to live well on his time off eat expensively drink as much as he pleased go out to music halls and pick up any woman that took his fancy she did not look surprised only sad and if anything more distressed i see do you no i meant that i follow your reasoning it does look as if he might have been blackmailing someone he could not bear the barrier he broke it abruptly aware that he might be hurt by the answer what is wrong hester her back stiffened a little and her chin came up i dont know who he was blackmailing or even that he was but i fear i might guess it is something i have learned in the course of caring for the sick therefore i cannot tell you im sorry it was very plain in her face that indeed she was sorry and equally plain that she would not change her position he hurt for her he ached to be able to help being shut out was almost like a physical coldness he must protect her from being damaged by it herself that was a greater danger than she might understand hesterare you aware of any crime committed not morally she answered instantly nothing has been done that would offend the sensibilities of any christian person except a policeman he concluded without hesitation her eyes widened are you a policeman no thats what i thought not that it makes any difference it would be dishonorable to tell you even if you were i cant he said nothing it was infuriating she might hold the missing piece which would make sense of the confusion she knew it also and yet she would not tell him she set her belief in trust in her own concept of honor before even her love for him it was a hard thing and beautiful like clean light it did not really hurt he was quite sure he wanted it to be so he was almost tempted to press her to be absolutely certain she would not yield but that would embarrass her she might not understand his reason or be quite sure he was not disappointed or worse childishly selfish william yes do you know something anyway no why you are smiling oh he was surprised am i no i dont know anything i suppose i am just happy he leaned forward and much to her surprise kissed her long and slowly with increasing passion the following day was the eleventh since monk had first been approached by lucius stourbridge to find his fiancee now she was in prison charged with murder and monk had very little further idea what had happened the day of her flight he had still less idea what had occasioned it unless it was some threat of disclosure of a portion of her past which she believed would ruin either her or someone she loved and it seemed she would tell no one even trial and execution appeared preferable what secret could be so fearful he could not imagine any even though as he took a hansom to the hampstead police station his mind would not leave it alone he arrived still short of nine oclock to be told that sergeant robb had been working until dark the previous evening and was not yet in monk thanked the desk sergeant and left walking briskly in the sun towards robbs home he had no time to waste even though he feared his discoveries if he made them would all be those he preferred not to know perhaps that was why he hurried good news could be savored bad should be bolted like eviltasting medicine the anticipation at least could be cut short and hope was painful there was little he wanted to tell robb only his discoveries about treadwells extravagant spending habits he had debated whether to mention the subject or not it gave miriam a powerful motive if she were being blackmailed but a man who would blackmail one person might blackmail others therefore there would be other suspects perhaps one of them had lain in wait for him and miriam had fled the scene not because she was guilty but because she could not prove her innocence it was a slender hope and he did not believe it himself what if there was an illegitimate child somewhere miriams and treadwells or simply that he knew of one that would be enough to ruin her marriage to lucius stourbridge but was any blackmail worth the rope or had she simply panicked and now believed all was lost that was only too credible he could not alone pursue all the other possible victims treadwell might have had that required the numbers of the police and their authority he reached robbs home and knocked on the door it was opened after several minutes by robb himself looking tired and harassed he greeted monk civilly but with a further tightening of the tension inside him what is it be as brief as you may please i am late and i have not yet given my grandfather his breakfast monk would like to have helped but he had no skills that were of use he felt the lack of them sharply i have learned rather more about james treadwell and i thought i should share it with you let me tell you while you get breakfast monk offered robb accepted reluctantly monk excused himself to the old man then sitting down recounted what he had discovered over the previous two days as he did so and michael prepared bread and tea and assisted his grandfather monks eyes wandered around the room he noticed the cupboard door open and the small stack of medicines still well replenished and that there were eggs in a bowl on the table by the sink and a bottle of sherry on the floor michael did very well by his grandfather it must cost him every halfpenny of his sergeants wages monk knew what they were and how far they went it was little enough for two especially when one of them needed constant care and expensive medicines michael cleared away the plate and cup and washed them in the pan by the sink his back to the room the old man looked at monk good woman your wife he said gently never makes it seem like a trouble comes here and listens to my tales with her eyes like stars seen the tears running down her cheeks when i told her about the death o the admiral an how we came home to england with the flags lowered after trafalgar she loved hearing it monk said sincerely he could imagine hester sitting in this chair the vision so clear in her mind that the terror and the sorrow of it moved her to tears she must have been here some considerable time to hear such a long account seen a good bit o battle herself she has the old man said with a smile told me about that calm and quiet as you like but i could see in her eyes what she really felt you can you know people whove really seen it dont talk that much just sometimes you need to an i could see it in her was that true hester needed to speak of her experiences in the crimea even now she shared it with this old man she barely knew rather than with him or even callandra but then they had not seen war they could not understand and this man could most of the time horror was best forgotten occasionally it broke the surface of the mind and had to be faced he knew that himself sensing the ghosts of his past who were no more than shadows to him she must have come several times he said aloud the old man nodded drops by every day maybe just for half an hour or so to see how i am not many people care about the old and the sick if theyre not their own no monk agreed with a strangely sinking knowledge that that was true it had not been said in selfpity but as a simple statement he could imagine hesters anger and her pity not just for john robb but for all the untold thousands he represented when he spoke it was from instinct did she ask you about other sailors and soldiers you mean old men like me yes she did didnt she tell you im afraid i wasnt paying as much attention as perhaps i should have been robb smiled and nodded he too had not always listened to women he understood she would care monk continued hating himself for the thoughts of missing medicines and blackmail that were in his mind and that he could not ignore shes a good nurse puts her patients before herself like a good soldier duty first thats right the old man nodded his eyes bright and soft shes a real good woman i seen a few good nurses come around now and again to see how you are monk was aware of what he was doing but he had to do it and bring medicines of course robb agreed cant go an get em myself and young michael here wouldnt know what i needed would he he was unaware of anything wrong he was speaking of kindness he had received the darkness was all in monks mind michael finished cleaning and tidying everything so he would have as little as possible to do if he managed to slip home in the middle of the day he left a cup of water where the old man could reach it and a further slice of bread and checked once more that he was as comfortable as he could make him then he turned to monk i must go to the police station ill consider what you said there could have been somebody else there when treadwell was killed but theres no evidence of it or of who it was and why did miriam gardiner run why doesnt she tell us the truth now monk could think of several answers but they were none of them convincing nor did they disprove her guilt the fear that was forming in his own mind he liked even less but he could no longer evade it he rose and took his leave of the old man wishing him well and feeling a hypocrite then followed michael robb out into the sunny noisy street a hundred yards along they parted robb to the left monk to the right towards the hospital he was now almost convinced he knew the cause of hesters anxiety and why she could not share it with him medicines had been disappearing from the hospital when medicines disappeared in this way they were often stolen either to feed the addiction of the thief or to sell hester had been to john robbs house several times and must have observed the medicine cupboard the old man had been quite candid in saying that the medicines were brought to him by a nurse it was so easy from that to conclude that the thefts were not selfishly motivated far from it someone was taking medicines to treat the old and the sick who were too poor to purchase them for themselves john robb had no idea apart from the guilt and the danger involved his pride would never have allowed him to accept help at such a risk he accepted it because he believed it was already paid for hester had been very precise about the words she used in denying knowledge of a crimenot morally legally it most certainly was the question was could treadwell have known why not he came to hampstead on most of his days off his body had been found on the path to the house of a nursecleo anderson monk remembered her vividly her defense of miriam and her denial of knowing where she was after her flight from cleveland square he hated having to pursue this but the conclusion was inescapable it was cleo anderson whom treadwell had been blackmailing and it was anything but chance that he had been found on her path perhaps he had crawled there deliberately knowing he was dying determined to the last to incriminate her and find some kind of both justice for himself and revenge his body would inevitably lead the police to her perhaps after all miriam had had nothing to do with the murder but knowing why cleo had stolen the medicines and owing her a debt of gratitude for her past kindness she could not earn her own release at the cost of cleos implication that would explain her silence the debt was too great monk found himself increasing his pace dodging between pedestrians out strolling in the warm midmorning peddlers offering sandwiches toffee apples and peppermint drinks and traders haggling over a good bargain he barely saw them the noise muted into an indistinguishable buzz he wanted to get this over with he walked up the hospital steps and in at the wide front entrance almost immediately he was greeted by a young man in a waistcoat and rolledup shirtsleeves stained with blood good morning sir he said briskly is it a physician or a surgeon you require what can we do for you sir monk felt a wave of panic and quashed it with a violent effort thank god he had need of neither the stoicism of those whose pain brought them here earned his overwhelming admiration i am in good health thank you he said quickly i should like to see lady callandra daviot if she is here i beg your pardon the young man looked nonplussed it had obviously never occurred to him that anyone should wish to see a woman any woman rather than a qualified medical man i should like to see lady callandra daviot monk repeated very distinctly or if she is not here then mrs monk where may i wait he hated the place the gray corridors smelled of vinegar and lye and reminded him of other hospitals the one where he had awoken after the accident not knowing who he was the panic of that had long since receded but it was too easily imagined again oh try that way the young man waved airily in the general direction of the physicians waiting room then turned on his heel and continued the way he had been going monk went to the waiting room where half a dozen people sat around tense with apprehension too ill or too anxious to speak to one another mercifully callandra appeared after only a few moments william what are you doing here i presume you wish to see hester i am afraid she is out she has goneshe hesitatedto see a patient old and ill and poor i imagine he replied dryly she knew him too well she caught the edge of deeper meaning in his voice what is it william she demanded although he had naturally risen to his feet and he was some eight inches taller than she she still managed to make him feel as if he should respond promptly and truthfully i believe you have been missing certain medicines from the apothecarys rooms it was a statement hester never called you in on the matter she was amazed and openly disbelieving no of course not why have you solved the problem i dont think you need to concern yourself with it she answered severely at least certainly not yet why because it is a nurse who has taken them that was only half intended to be a challenge but it sounded like one we do not know who it is she replied and since you agree that hester did not ask you to investigate for us why are we discussing the matter you can have no interest in it you are wrong unfortunately i do have his voice dipped the previous moments confrontation suddenly changed to sorrow i wish i could leave it alone it is not the fact that you are missing them that concerns me it is the chance that whoever took them may have been blackmailed over the thefts even though i believe she put them to the best possible use blackmail callandra stared at him in dismay yes and murder im sorry she said nothing but the gravity in her face showed her fear and he felt that it also betrayed her guess as to what else lay beyond the thefts to the steady draining away of supplies over months perhaps years to help those she perceived to be in need it was a judgment no individual had the right to make and yet if no one did who would care and who would break the rules in order to show that they should be changed do you know who it is he asked she looked him straight in the eye i have not the slightest idea she replied they both understood it was a lie and that she would not change it he did not really expect her to nor would he have been pleased if she had and neither has hester she added firmly no i thought not he conceded with the ghost of a smile but you can give me an estimate as to how much and of which sorts she hesitated surely you would prefer to do that yourself than for me to have to ask someone else he said without blinking she realized it was a threat very barely disguised he would carry it through no matter how much he would dislike it yes she capitulated come with me and i will give you a list it is only a guess of course of course he agreed monk worked the rest of that day and most of the following one first with callandras list of medicines then seeing whom cleo anderson had visited and what illnesses afflicted them he did not have to ask many questions among the sick and the poor they were only too happy to speak well of a woman who seemed to have endless time and patience to care for their needs and who so often brought them medicines the doctor had sent no one questioned it or doubted where she had obtained the quinine the morphine or the other powders and infusions she brought they were simply grateful the more he learned the more monk hated what he was doing time and again he stopped short of asking the final question which could have produced proof he wrote nothing down he had nothing witnessed and took no evidence of anything with him on the afternoon of the second day he turned his attention to cleo anderson herself her home her expenses what she purchased and where it had never occurred to him that she might ask any return for either the care she gave or the medicines she provided even so he was startled to find how very frugal her life was even more so than he would have expected from her nurses wages her clothes were worn thin and washed of almost all color they fitted poorly and presumably had been given to her by grateful relatives of a patient who had died her food was of the simplestagain often provided in the homes of those she visited bread oatmeal porridge a little cheese and pickle it seemed she frequently ate at the hospital and appeared glad of it the house was her own a legacy from better times but falling into disrepair and badly in need of reroofing no one knew her to drink or to gamble so where did her money go monk had no doubt it went into the pocket of james treadwell at least so long as he had been alive since his death just two weeks before cleo anderson had purchased a secondhand kitchen table and a new jug and bowl and two more towels something she had not been known to do in several years monk was in the street outside her house a little before half past four when he saw michael robb coming towards him walking slowly as if he was tired and his feet were sore he was obviously hot and he looked deeply depressed he stopped in front of monk were you going to tell me he asked there was no need for explanation monk did not know whether he would have told him or not but he was quite certain he hated the fact that robb knew perhaps it was inevitable and when he had wrestled with it and grieved over it he would have told him but he was not ready to do that yet i have no proof of anything he answered that was uncharacteristically vague for him usually he faced a truth honestly however bitter this hurt more than he had foreseen i have robb said wearily enough to arrest her please dont stand in my way at least we will release miriam gardiner you can tell mr stourbridge hell be relieved not that he ever thought her guilty yes monk knew lucius would be happy but it would be shortlived because miriam had chosen to face trial herself rather than implicate cleo anderson her grief would be deep and probably abiding the police believed miriam was a material witness to the crime who had not offered them the truth even when pressed she was a woman apparently not guilty of murder but quite plainly in a state close to hysteria and not fit to be released except into the care of some responsible person who would look after her and also be certain that she was present to appear in court on the witness stand as the law demanded lucius and his father were the obvious and willing candidates it was passionately against her will she stood whitefaced in the police station turning from robb to monk please mr monk i will give any undertaking you like pledge anything at all but do not oblige me to go back to cleveland square i will gladly work in the hospital day and night if you will allow me to live there the police station superintendent looked at her gravely then at robb i think robb began but the superintendent did not wish to hear his opinion you are obviously distressed he said to miriam speaking slowly and very clearly mr stourbridge is to be your husband he is the best one to see that you are given the appropriate care and to offer you comfort for the grief you naturally feel upon the arrest of a woman who showed you kindness in the past you have suffered a great shock you must rest quietly and restore your strength miriam swung around to gaze at monk her eyes were wild as if she longed to say something to him but the presence of others prevented her he could think of no excuse to speak to her alone major stourbridge and lucius were just beyond the door waiting to take her back to cleveland square there was a constable on one side of her and the desk sergeant on the other their intention was to support her in case she felt faint but in effect they closed her in as if she were under restraint there was nothing he could do helplessly he watched her escorted from the room the door opened and lucius stourbridge stepped forward his face filled with tenderness and joy behind him harry stourbridge smiled as if the end of a long nightmare was in sight miriam tripped staggered forward and had to be all but carried by the constable and the sergeant she flinched as lucius touched her hester was home before monk and was looking forward to his coming but when he came in through the door and she saw his face she knew instantly that something was very seriously wrong he looked exhausted his skin was pale and his dark hair limp and stuck to his brow in the heat alarm welled up inside her what is it she demanded urgently he stood in the middle of the floor he lifted his hand and touched her cheek very lightly i know what it is you couldnt tell me and why im sorry i had to pursue it she swallowed it the stolen medicines he answered who took them and why and where did they go its a far more obvious cause for blackmail she tried not to understand pushing the realization away from her the medicines couldnt have anything to do with miriam gardiner not directly but one leads to the other his eyes did not waver and she knew that he was quite certain of what he said what what connection she asked whats happened there was no purpose in suggesting he sit down or rest in any fashion until he had told her and neither of them pretended cleo anderson stole the medicines to treat the old and the sick he answered her softly somehow treadwell knew of it and he was blackmailing her perhaps he followed miriam maybe she unintentionally let something slip and he pieced together the rest cleos involved do you know that she was confused her mind whirling if treadwell was blackmailing cleo anderson then why would miriam kill him to protect her it doesnt explain why she left cleveland square what about lucius stourbridge why didnt she go back to him and explain something she trailed off none of it really made sense miriam didnt kill treadwell he told her the police let her go she was defending cleo because of old loyalties and probably because she believed in her cause as well that isnt enough she protested why did she leave cleveland square in the middle of the party why wouldnt she allow lucius to know where she was i dont know he admitted she was released into his care and she looked as if she were going to an execution she begged not to be but they wouldnt listen to her a frown creased his face and there was pain etched more deeply than the weariness for a moment i thought she was going to ask me to help her but then she changed her mind they all but carried her out she heard the edge of pity in his voice she felt it herself and she was angered that the police authorities should consider that miriam needed to be released into anybodys care she should have been permitted the dignity of going wherever she wished and with whomever she was no longer charged with anything but far more immediate and closer to her own emotions was her concern for cleo anderson what are we to do to help her she took for granted that he would monk was still standing in the middle of the room hot tired dusty and with aching feet remarkably he kept his temper nothing it is a private matter between them now i mean cleo she said miriam has other people to care for her anyway she is not accused of a crime yes she is complicity in concealing treadwells murder even though she says she did not know he was dead she is almost certainly a witness to the attack the police want her to testify she waved her hand impatiently she did not know miriam gardiner but she did know cleo and what she had done for old john robb and others like him so shell have to testify it wont be pleasant but shell survive it if shes worth anything at all her first concern will be for cleo and ours must be too what can we do where should we begin his face tightened theres nothing we can do he replied briefly moving away from her and sitting down in one of the chairs the way his body sank the sudden release at the last moment betrayed his utter weariness i found miriam gardiner and she is returned to her fiance i wish it were not cleo anderson who is guilty but it is the best i could do was stop short of finding any proof of it but robb will hes a good policeman and his fathers involved he was angry with himself for his emotions and it showed in his face and the sharp edge to his voice she stood in the center of the floor cool and fresh in a printed cotton dress with wide skirts and a small white collar it was pretty and it all seemed terribly irrelevant it was almost a sin to be comfortable and so happy when cleo anderson was in prison and facing the long drop into darkness at the end of a rope there must be something she knew she should not argue with him especially now when he was exhausted and probably very nearly as distressed about this as she was but her selfcontrol did not extend to sitting patiently and waiting until a better time i dont know what but if we look maybe he threatened her perhaps there was some degree of selfdefense she cast about wildly for a better thought maybe he tried to coerce her into committing some sort of crime that could be justified so she committed murder instead he said sarcastically she blushed hotly she wanted to swear at him use some of the language she had heard in the barracks in sebastopol but it would be profoundly unladylike she would despise herself afterwards and more important he would never look at her in the same way again he would hear her words in his ears every time he looked at her face even in moments of tenderness when she most fiercely desired his respect the ugliness would intrude all right it wasnt a very good idea she conceded but it isnt the only one he looked up at her in some surprise not for her words in themselves but for the meekness of them she knew what was in his mind and blushed the more hotly this was ridiculous and most irritating i wish i could help her he said gently but i know of no way and neither do you leave it alone hester dont meddle she regarded him steadily trying to judge how surely he meant what he said was it advice or a command there was no anger in his face but neither was there any hint that he would change his mind it was the first time he had forbidden her anything that mattered to her she had never before found it other than slightly amusing that he should exercise a certain amount of authority and she had been quite willing to indulge him this was different she could not abandon cleo even to please monk or if it came to the worst and it might even to avoid a serious quarrel with him to do so would make it impossible to live with herself all happiness would be contaminated and if for her then for him also how would she explain that to him it was the first real difficulty between them the first gulf which could not be bridged by laughter or a physical closeness she saw the shadow in his face he understood if not in detail then at least in essence perhaps you could enquire he suggested cautiously but you will have to be extremely careful or you will make things worse i dont imagine the hospital authorities will look on her kindly it was retreat made gracefully and so discreetly it was barely perceptible but very definitely a retreat all the same the rush of gratitude inside her was so fierce she felt dizzy a darkness had been avoided she wanted to throw her arms around him and hold him feel the warmth and the strength of his body next to hers the touch of his skin she almost did until intelligence warned her that it would be clumsy it would draw attention to his retreat and that would be small gratitude for it instead she lowered her eyes oh yes she said gravely i shall have to be very careful indeedshould i make any enquiry actually at the moment i cant think of anything to ask i shall merely listen and observe for the time being he smiled with the beginning of satisfaction he was aware of her gratitude to him and she knew he was it was even a sense of obligation for the immense weight lifted and he knew that also she could either be annoyed or see the funny aspect of it she chose the latter and looked at him smiling he smiled back but only for a moment it was still delicate ground she prepared dinner cold ham and vegetables and hot apple pie with cream sitting at the table and sharing it with considerable pleasure she asked him a little more about miriam and the stourbridge family he obviously considered hard before answering and waited several minutes eating the last of his pie and accepting a second serving all the facts i know seem to mean nothing he said at last they have made miriam more welcome than one might have foreseen considering that she has no money or family connections and she is to marry their only son everything i can observe supports their assertion that they are fond of her and accept that she is the one woman who can make him happy whether she will give him an heir or not but she is young enough but she did not have any children in her marriage to mr gardiner hester pointed out that would make the possibility less likely i am sure they have considered that he took more cream pouring it liberally over the pie and eating with unconcealed pleasure she watched with relief she was still an unconfident pastry cook and she had had no time even to look for a woman to come in during the days it was something she really must attend to and soon a wellordered domestic life was halfway not only to monks happiness but to her own she did not wish to have to spend either time or emotional energy upon the details of living she would make enquiries tomorrow unless of course she was too busy with matters at the hospital and with whatever might be done for cleo anderson that was immeasurably more important even if they ate sandwiches from a peddler cleo anderson callandra said are you sure it was a protest against the truth rather than a real question hester was alone with dr beck and callandra for a few moments in the surgeons waiting room kristian stood a yard away from callandra but any careful observer would have seen the silent communication between them there was never a meeting of eyesalmost the opposite an awareness on a deeper level i had no idea he said softly what risks she was taking all the time how long have you known he was looking at hester i dont really know she was still being overcareful as if sergeant robb were just beyond the door at least not with evidence of course not kristian said twisting his lips a little no one wishes to find evidence you were quite right not to tell anyone of it poor woman his hands clenched more tightly by his sides it is profoundly wrong that any person should have to take such risks to assist the poor and the sick its monstrous callandra agreed without looking at him but we must help there has to be a way what does william say hester had no intention of repeating the conversation merely the conclusion and that slightly altered that we should be extremely careful in making any enquiries she replied more than careful kristian agreed thorpe would be delighted to brand all nurses as thieves he will do callandra cut across him her face pinched with unhappiness hell know soon enough no doubt the police will be here to ask questions is there anything we can conceal hester looked from one to the other of them she had no idea what good it would do it was instinctive rather than rational if they convicted cleo anderson of murdering treadwell a bottle or two of morphine one way or another was hardly going to make a difference she knew the moment the words were out that it was foolish what proof do they have that it was she kristian asked more levelly the first shock was wearing off possibly he was blackmailing her but then he may have blackmailed others as well she was hardly on an income to provide him with much unless she gave him morphine callandra said with quiet sadness and he sold it that would be worth a great deal more hester had not even thought of that she did not believe cleo would sell morphine herself but she could understand the necessity if treadwell had been pressing her for money but what had made the difference that suddenly on that particular night that she had resorted to murder desperation or simply opportunity why was she accepting cleos guilt even in her own mind but what evidence kristian repeated did anyone see her did she leave anything behind at the scene is there anything which excludes another person no simply that his body was found on the path near her house and he had crawled there from wherever he was attacked hester could see the reasoning all too clearly it was assumed at first that he had been trying to get help now they will be thinking it was no coincidence but he was deliberately pointing towards her kristian frowned you mean they met somewhere close by she attacked him left believing him dead but still conscious he crawled after her callandras face pulled tight with distress why not hester loathed saying it but it was there in the air between them he came to blackmail her and she had reached the point of desperationperhaps she had nothing more to pay himand either she intended it before she went to kill him or it happened on the spur of the moment and where was miriam callandra asked then her expression quickened or did he drop miriam wherever she wished to be and go back to cleo anderson that would explain why miriam did not know he was dead hester shook her head whatever the answer is it does not help cleo now they looked at each other grimly and none could think of anything hopeful to say matters only seemed worse when an hour or so later hester and callandra were summoned to the office of an extremely angry fermin thorpe and were ordered by him to assist sergeant robb in his enquiries robb stood uncomfortably to the side of thorpes desk looking first at thorpe himself then at callandra lastly and unhappily at hester im sorry maam he seemed to be addressing both of them id rather not have had to place you in this position but i need to know more about the medicines mr thorpe here says are missing from your apothecarys room i didnt know about it until this morning thorpe said furiously his face pink it should have been reported to me at the very first instance somebody will answer for this i think first we had better see precisely what is provable mr thorpe callandra said coldly it does not do to cast accusations around freely before one is certain of the facts it is too easy to ruin a reputation and too difficult to mend it again when one discovers mistakes have been made she stared at him defiantly daring him to contradict her thorpe was very conscious of his position as a governor of the hospital and of his innate general superiority however he also had an acute social awareness and callandra had a title albeit a courtesy one because of her late fathers position he decided upon caution at least for the meantime of course lady callandra we do not yet know the entire situation he looked sideways at robb i assure you sergeant i shall do all within my power to be of assistance we must get the facts of the matter and put an end to all dishonesty i shall assist you myself it was what hester had feared it would be so much easier to make light of the losses even to mislead robb a little if thorpe were not there she had no idea what the apothecary would do where his loyalties lay or how frightened he would be for his own position thorpe hesitated and hester realized with a lurch of hope that he did not know enough about the medicines to conduct the search and inventory without assistance perhaps one of us might fetch mr phillips she offered and perhaps come with you to make notes for our own needs after all we shall have to attend to the matter and see that it does not happen again we need to know the truth of it even more than sergeant robb does thorpe grasped the rescue indeed mrs monk suddenly he found he could remember her name without the usual difficulty she smiled at it but did not remark before he could change his mind she glanced at callandra then led the way out of the office and along the wide corridor towards the apothecarys room she knew callandra would fetch mr phillips and possibly even have a discreet word with him as to the effects upon all of them of whatever he might say presumably he would not yet know of the charge against cleo anderson far less the motive attributed to her she did not dare look at sergeant robb he might too easily guess callandras intention it was not a great leap of foresight they walked briskly one behind the other and she stopped at the apothecarys door naturally thorpe had a key as he had to all doors he opened the door and stepped in and they followed behind crowding into the small space it was lined with cupboards right up to the ceiling each had its brassbound keyhole even the drawers beneath the shelf i am afraid i do not have keys to these thorpe said reluctantly but as you may see it is all kept with the utmost safety i do not know what more we can do except employ a second apothecary so that there is someone on duty at every moment obviously we may require medicines at night as well as during the day and no one man can be available around the clock however diligent who has keys at night now robb asked when mr phillips leaves he passes them to me thorpe replied with discomfort and i give them to the senior doctor who will remain here at night from your wording i assume that is not always the same person robb concluded no we do not operate during the night seldom does one of the surgeons remain dr beck does on occasion if he has a particularly severe case more often it will be a student doctor he seemed about to add something then changed his mind perhaps he felt the whole hospital under accusation because one of its nurses had been given the opportunity to steal which had resulted in murder he would have liked to distance himself from it and it was plain in his expression who gives the medicine during the night robb asked thorpe was further discomfited the doctor on duty not a nurse robb looked surprised nurses are to keep patients clean and comfortable thorpe said a trifle sharply they do not have medical training or experience and are not given responsibilities except to do exactly as they are told he did not look at hester robb digested that information thoughtfully and without comment before he could formulate any further questions the apothecary entered closely followed by callandra who avoided hesters eye ah thorpe said with relief phillips sergeant robb here believes that a considerable amount of medicine has gone missing from our supplies stolen by one of our nurses and that this fact has provided the motive and means for her to be blackmailed he cleared his throat we need to ascertain if this is true and if it is precisely what amounts are involved how it was taken and by whom he had effectively laid the fault if not the responsibility at phillipss door phillips did not answer immediately he was a large man rather overweight with wild dark hair and a beard severely in need of trimming hester had always found him to be most agreeable and to have a pleasing if somewhat waspish sense of humor she hoped he was not going to get the blame for this and she would be painfully disappointed in him if it were too easy to pass it onto cleo have you nothing to say man thorpe demanded impatiently not without thinking about it carefully phillips replied sir he added if theres medicine really missing rather than just wastage or a miscount or somebodys error in writing what they took then its a serious matter of course its a serious matter thorpe snapped theres blackmail and murder involved murder phillips said with a slight lift of surprise in his voice but only slight over our medicines theres been no theft that size i know that for sure over a period of time thorpe corrected him or so the sergeant thinks phillips fished for his keys and brought out a large collection on a ring first he opened one of the drawers and pulled out a ledger how far back sir he asked robb politely i dont know robb replied try a year or so that should be sufficient dont rightly know how i can tell phillips obligingly opened the ledger to the same month the previous year he scanned the page and the following one everything tallies here an theres no way we can know if it was what we had then in the cupboards doesnt look like anyones altered it anyway id know if they had and id have told mr thorpe thorpe stepped closer and turned the pages of the ledger himself examining from that date to the present there were quite obviously no alterations made to the entries it told them nothing the checking in of medicines was all made in the one hand the withdrawals in several different hands of varying degrees of elegance and literacy there were a few misspellings robb looked at them are these all doctors he asked of course thorpe replied tartly you dont imagine we give the keys to the nurses do you if the wretched woman has really stolen medicines from this hospital then it will be sleight of hand while the doctors back was turned perhaps attending to a patient taken suddenly ill or while he was otherwise distracted it is a perfectly dastardly thing to do i trust she will be punished to the fullest extent of the law as a deterrent to any other person tempted to enrich herself at the expense of those in her care could just be wastage phillips observed his eyes wide looking from thorpe to robb not easy to measure powders exact close enough o course but over a couple o dozen doses yer could be out a bit ever considered that sir you couldnt blackmail anybody over that robb replied but his expression indicated that he said it with reluctance there must be more if there is nothing in the past that is provable now would you check your present stocks exactly against what is in your books of course phillips had very little choice nor for that matter had robb they stood silently while phillips went through his cupboards weighing measuring and counting watched impatiently by thorpe anxiously by callandra and with unease by robb hester wondered if robb had even a suspicion that his grandfathers suffering had been treated by this very means with medicine stolen not for gain but out of compassion by cleo anderson whom he now sought to prove guilty of murdering treadwell she looked at his earnest face and saw pity in it but no doubt no tearing of loyalties not yet was cleo guilty if treadwell was a blackmailer was it possible she had believed him the lesser victim rather than the patients she treated it was hard to believe but it was not impossible the quinine seems a bit short phillips remarked as if it were of no great moment could be bad measuring i suppose or someone took a few doses in a crisis an forgot to make a note of it how far short thorpe demanded his face dark damn it man you can be more exact than that what do you mean a bit youre an apothecary you dont dose a patient with a bit about five hundred grains sir phillips answered very quietly thorpe flushed deep pink good god thats enough to dose a dozen men this is very serious indeed youd better see what else is missing look at the morphine phillips obeyed that measurement was even farther short hester was not surprised it was the obvious treatment for pain as quinine was for fever cleo must have administered it under supervision often enough over the years to have an excellent idea of how much to give and in what circumstances certainly hester herself did thorpe turned to robb i regret sergeant but it seems you are perfectly correct we are missing a substantial amount of medicine and it is impossible any random thief could have taken it it has to be one of our nurses hester drew breath to point out that it had only to be someone within the hospital staff over the last few years but she knew that would be pointless thorpe would not entertain the idea of any of the doctors doing such a thing and she had no desire to try to shift the blame onto phillips perhaps it had been cleo anderson in fact if hester was honest she had no doubt it was the reason for it they had misunderstood and she did not wish to draw their attention to that because it would make no difference whatever to the charge with cleo in prison who would now care for the old and ill she had visited with medicines to give them respite from distress specifically what of john robb callandra handed sergeant robb the note she had made of the missing medicines and the amounts he took it and put it in his pocket thanking her he looked at phillips again over what period has this been missed mr phillips cant say sir phillips replied instantly havent had occasion to check in that detail for some time could have been careless measuring perhaps even someone spilled something his black eyes were bland his voice reasonable more likely careless noting down of what was given out proper but in the heat of a bad night or something of a crisis got to make an allowance medicine is an art mr thorpe not an exact science god damn it man thorpe exploded dont tell me how to conduct the practice of medicine in my own hospital phillips did not reply nor did he seem particularly disturbed by thorpes anger which had the effect of both heightening it and confusing thorpe into momentary silence he had not expected an apothecary to be indifferent to him phillips turned to robb if there is anything else i can do for you sergeant im sure mr thorpe would want me to just tell me and before you ask ive got no suspicions of any o the nurses not in that way some o them drink a spot too much porter on an empty stomach but then i daresay half o london does that from time to time specially as porter is included in the wages like youll find me round an about most any day except sunday and without asking anything further he handed the keys to thorpe and went out impertinent oaf thorpe swore under his breath but honest robb asked hester saw the abhorrence in thorpes face he would dearly like to have paid phillips back for his arrogance and here was an ideal opportunity given him on the other hand to admit he had employed an apothecary of whom he had doubts would be a confession of his own gross incompetence but just in case temptation should prove too powerful hester answered for him of course sergeant she said with a smile do you imagine mr thorpe would have permitted him to remain in such a responsible position if he were not trustworthy in every way if a nurse is a little tipsy it is one thing she may spill a pail of water or leave a floor unswept if an apothecary is not above reproach people may die quite thorpe agreed hastily with a venomous look at hester then with a considerable effort to alter his expression he turned to robb please question anyone you wish to i doubt you will find any proof that this wretched woman stole the quinine and morphine if there were any we should know of it ourselves i presume you have her in custody yes sir we have thank you sir robb bade them goodday and left hester glanced at callandra then excused herself also she had other matters to attend to and urgently hester had no difficulty in obtaining permission to visit cleo anderson in her cell she simply told the jailer that she was an official from the hospital where cleo worked and it was necessary to learn certain medical information from her in order for treatments to continue in her absence it transpired that the jailer knew cleoshe had nursed his mother in her final illnessand he was only too pleased to repay the kindness in any way he could indeed he seemed embarrassed by the situation and hester could not guess from his manner whether he thought cleo could be guilty or not however word had spread that the charge was that she had killed a blackmailer and he had a very low regard for such people possibly sufficiently low that he was not overly concerned by the death of one of them the cell door shut with the heavy echoing sound of metal on metal sending a shiver of memory through hester bringing back her own few hideous days in edinburgh when she was where cleo sat now alone and facing trial and perhaps death cleo looked at her in surprise her face was pale and she had the bruised staring look of someone deeply shocked but she seemed composed even resigned hester could not recall if she had felt like that she believed she had always wanted to fight that inside herself she was screaming out against the injustice there was too much to live for not to struggle always far too much but then she had not killed mary farraline even if cleo had killed treadwell because he had been blackmailing her over the medicines it was a highly understandable action not excusable perhaps but surely any god worth worshiping would find more pity than blame for her maybe she did not believe that at least not now at this moment facing human justice can i help you hester said aloud is there anything i can bring for you clothes soap a clean towel rather better food what about your own spoon or cup cleo smiled faintly the very practicality of the suggestions contrasted with what she had expected she had anticipated anger blame pity curiosity she looked puzzled ive been in prison hester explained i hated the soap and the scratchy towels its a little thing and i wanted my own spoon i remember that but they let you go cleo looked at her with anxiety so sharp it was close to breaking her composure and they let miriam go is she all right hester sat in the chair leaning forward a little she liked cleo more with each encounter she could not watch her distress with any impartiality at all or think of her fate with acceptance yes they let her go home she was watching hester intently no with lucius and major stourbridge she searched cleos face for anything that would help her understand why miriam had dreaded it she saw nothing no flicker of comprehension however swiftly concealed was she all right cleo said fearfully it seemed cruel to tell her the truth but hester did not know enough to judge which lies would do least harm no she answered i dont think so not from what my husband said she would far rather have gone anywhere else at alleven remained in prisonbut she was not given the choice the police could not hold her because there was no charge anymore but it was obvious to everyone that she was deeply distressed and since she is a witness to much of what happened they have a certain authority over where she should go cleo said nothing she stared down at her hands folded in her lap hester watched her closely do you know why she ran away from cleveland square and why she had to be all but dragged back there cleo looked up quickly nono i dont she wouldnt tell me hester believed her the confusion and distress in her eyes were too real dont answer me whether you took the medicines or not she said quietly i know you did and i know what for cleo regarded her thoughtfully for several moments before she spoke whats going to happen to them miss theres nobody to look after them the ones with family are better off than those who havent but even they cant afford what they need or they dont know what it is they get old and their children move on leaving them behind the young dont care about trafalgar an waterloo now a few years an theyll forget the crimea too those soldiers are all the thing now because theyre young and handsome still we get upset about a young man with no arms or no legs or insides all to pieces but when they get old we cant be bothered we say theyre going to die soon anyway wots the point in spending time and money on them there was no argument to make of course it was not true everywhere but in too many instances it was what about john robb sailor from the victory at trafalgar hester asked consumption by the sound of him cleos face tightened and she nodded i dont think he has long his grandson does everything he can for him but that isnt much he cant give him any ease without the morphine she did not ask but it was in her eyes willing hester to agree hester knew what that would involve she would have to give him the morphine herself it would involve her in the theft but to refuse would compound the old mans suffering and his sense of being abandoned when he understood he would also know that his suffering was of less importance to her than keeping herself from risk alleviating pain was all right as long as the cost was smalla little time even weariness but not personal danger yes of course the words were out of her mouth before she had time to weigh what she was committing herself to do thank you cleo said softly a momentary gleam in her eyes as if she had seen a light in enclosing darkness and i would like the soap and the spoon if it is not too much trouble of course hester brushed them aside as already done what she really wanted was to help with some defense but what was there she realized with bitterness that she was half convinced that cleo had killed treadwell have you got a lawyer to speak for you a lawyer what can he say it wont make no difference the tone of her voice was flat as if she had suddenly been jerked back to the harshness of the present and her own reality not john robbs there was a closed air about her excluding hester from her emotions till she felt rebuffed an intruder was cleo still somehow defending miriam gardiner or was she guilty and believed she deserved to die did you kill treadwell hester said abruptly cleo hesitated was about to speak then changed her mind and said nothing hester had the powerful impression that she had been going to deny it but she would never know and asking again would be useless the mask was complete was he blackmailing you she asked instead cleo sighed yeah course he was do most things for money that one i see there did not seem much else to say she had resolved without question or doubt that she would do all she could to help cleo it was a matter of thinking what that would be already oliver rathbones name was in her mind cleo grasped her wrist holding hard startling her dont tell the sergeant she said fiercely it cant change what he does and she blinked her face bruised with hurt and dont tell old mr robb why im not there tell him something else anything perhaps by the time they try me and well he may not have to know he could be gone hisself by then ill tell him something else hester promised probably that youve gone to look after a relative or something thank you cleos gratitude was so naked hester felt guilty she was on the edge of saying that she intended to do far more but she had no idea what it could be and to raise hope she could not fulfill was thoughtlessly cruel ill come back with the soap she promised and the spoon then she went to the door and banged for the jailer to let her out the next thing she did she expected to be the most difficult and it was certainly the one of which she was most afraid she felt guilty even as she walked up the steps and in through the hospital door she returned the stare of two young medical students too directly as if to deny their suspicion of her then she felt ridiculous and was sure she was blushing she had done nothing yet she was no different from the person she had been yesterday or this morning when she had been perfectly happy to confront fermin thorpe in his office and rack her brain to defend cleo anderson would callandra in turn have to rack her brain tomorrow to defend her and yet she could not escape it quite apart from her fondness for john robb she had given cleo the promise she had tried to form a plan but so much depended upon opportunity it was impractical to try stealing phillipss keys and unfair to him added to which he really was extremely careful with them and might be the more so now how long would she have to wait for a crisis of some sort to present a chance the apothecarys room open and unattended or phillips there but his back turned she was suddenly furious with herself she had been alone with cleo and not had the wits to ask her how she had accomplished it she had just blithely promised to do the same without the faintest idea how to go about it it was very humbling to realize her own stupidity she stood in the middle of the passage and was still there when kristian beck reached her hester he said with concern are you all right she recalled herself swiftly and began speaking with the idea only half formed in her mind i was wondering how cleo anderson managed to steal the morphine phillips is really very careful i mean how do you think it happened in practical detail he frowned does it matter why did he ask was he indifferent to the thefts was he so certain cleo was guilty that the details did not matter or was it even conceivable that he had some sympathy with her i dont want to prove it she answered steadily meeting his eyes with complete candor i would like above all things to disprove it but failing that at least to understand she is charged with murdering treadwell he said softly the jury cannot excuse that whatever they privately feel there is no provision or law for murdering blackmailers or for stealing medicine even if it is to treat the old and ill for whom there is no other help the lacerating edge in his voice betrayed his own feelings too clearly i know that she said in little above a whisper i should still like to know exactly how she did it he stood in silence for several moments she waited part of her wanted to leave before it was too late but escaping would be only physical morally and emotionally she was still trapped and that was trivial compared with cleoor john robb what do you think she took kristian asked at length she swallowed morphine for an old man who has consumption it wont cure him but it gives him a little rest very understandable he answered i hope she gave him some sherry in water as well i believe so good i need a few things from the apothecary myself ill go and get the keys you can help me if you would and without waiting for her answer he turned sharply and strode off he came back a few minutes later with the keys and opened the door he went inside and left her to follow him he started to unlock various cupboards and take out leaves for infusions cordials and various powders he passed several of them to hester while he opened bottles and jars then closed them again when he had finished he ushered her out relocked the door took some of the medicines back from her then thanked her and left her standing in the corridor with a small bottle of cordial and a weeks dosage of morphine plus several small paper screws of quinine she put them quickly into her pockets and went back towards the front door and out of it she felt as if dozens of eyes were boring holes in her back but actually she passed only one nurse with a mop and bucket and fermin thorpe himself striding along with his face set hardly recognizing her john robb was delighted to see her he had had a bad night but was a trifle better towards late afternoon and the loneliness of sitting in his chair in the empty house even with the sun slanting in through the windows had made him melancholy his face lit with a smile when he recognized her step and even before she entered the room he was tidying the little space around him and making ready for her how are you he said the moment she came through the door im very well she answered cheerfully he must never know about cleo if there was any way it could be prevented she could not warn michael without explaining to him the reason and that would place him in an impossible situation he would then have either to benefit indirectly from the thefts which he would find intolerable or else have to testify against cleo from his own knowledge that would also be unbearable for the old mans sake as well as his own such disillusion and sense of betrayal might be more than his old and frail body could take and then michaels guilt would be crippling im very well indeed she said firmly how are you i hope you are well enough to share a cup of tea with me i brought some you might like to try and a few biscuits she smiled back at him of course it was all an excuse so you will tell me more stories of your life at sea and the places you have been to you were going to describe the indies for me you said how brilliant the water was like a cascade of jewels and that you had seen fishes that could fly oh bless you girl i have an all he agreed with a smile an more than that too you put the kettle on an ill tell you all you want to know of course she walked across the room and pulled the biscuits and tea out of the bag they were in filled the kettle from the jug and set it on the stove then with her back to him took out the cordial bottle and placed it on the shelf half behind a blue bag of sugar then she slipped the morphine out of her other pocket and set it underneath the two thin papers that were left from cleos last visit was it very hot in the indies she asked you wouldnt believe it girl he replied felt as if the sea itself were on the boil all simmerin an steamin the air were so thick it clogged up in your throat like you could drink it i think you could drink it here too when it gets cold enough she said with a laugh aye an i bin north too he said enthusiastically great walls of ice rising out o the sea you never seen anything like it girl beautiful an terrible they was antheyd freeze your breath like a white fog in front of you she turned and smiled at him then began to make the tea mrs anderson had to go away for a little while someone in her family ill i think she scalded the pot tipped out the water then put the fresh leaves in and poured the rest of the water from the kettle she asked me to come and see you i think she knew id like that i hope its all right with you he relaxed looking at her with undisguised pleasure sure its all right then you can tell me some o the places youve bin about them turks an the like although ill miss cleo good woman she is nothin ever too much trouble an i seen her so tired she were fit to drop i hope as her family appreciates her a lie was the only thing im sure they will she said without a shadow in her voice and ill get a message to her that youre fine you do that girl an tell her i was asking after her i will suddenly she found it difficult to master herself it was ridiculous to want to cry now nothing had changed she sniffed hard and blew her nose then set out the rest of the things for tea and opened the bag of biscuits she had bought him the best she could find they looked pretty on the plate she was determined this should be a party she did not broach the subject with monk until after they had eaten they were sitting quietly watching the last of the light fade beyond the windows and wondering if it was time to light the gas or if it would be pleasanter just to allow the dusk to fill the room naturally she had no intention whatever of even mentioning john robb let alone telling monk that she was taking over his care from cleo apart from the way he would react to such information the knowledge would compromise him there was no need for both of them to tell lies what can we do to help cleo anderson she said taking it for granted that there was no argument as to whether they would he lifted his head sharply she waited everything weve done so far has made it worse he said unhappily the best service we can do the poor woman is to leave the case alone if we do that she may well be hanged hester argued and that would be very wrong treadwell was a blackmailer she is guilty of a crime in law maybe but no sin we have to do something humanity requires it i discover facts hester he said quietly everything ive found so far indicates that cleo killed him i may sympathize with herin fact i do god knows in her situation i might have done the same she could see memory of the past sharp in his face and knew what he was thinking she remembered joscelin grey also and the apartment in mecklenburgh square and how close monk had come to murder then but that would not excuse me in law he continued nor would it alter anything the judge or jury could do if she did kill him there may be some mitigation but she will have to say what it is then i could look for proof of it if there is any she was hesitant to ask him about oliver rathbone there was too much emotion involved old friendship old love and perhaps pain she did not know how much she had not seen rathbone since her marriage but she remembered with a vividness so sharp she could see the candlelight in her minds eye and smell the warmth of the inn dining roomthe night rathbone had very nearly asked her to marry him he had stopped only because she had allowed him to know obliquely that she could not accept not yet and he had let the moment pass its not only what happened she began almost tentatively its the interpretation the argument if you like monk regarded her gravely before replying there was no criticism in his face but an acute sadness some plea of mitigation dont you think you are holding out a false hope to her that could be true but we must try mustnt we we cant just give in without a fight what do you want to do she said what he expected we could ask oliver she took a breath we could at least set it before him for his opinion she made it a question she could see no change in his expression no anger no stiffening of course he agreed but dont expect too much she smiled no just to try hester woke in the dark feeling the movement as monk got out of bed downstairs there was a banging on the front door not loud just sharp and insistent as of someone who would not give up monk pulled his jacket on over his nightshirt and hester sat up watching him go out of the bedroom in bare feet she heard the door open and a moment later close again she saw the reflection of the hall light on the landing ceiling as the gas was lit she could bear it no longer she slipped out of bed and put on a robe she met monk coming up the stairs a piece of paper in his hand his face was bleak with shock his eyes dark what is it she said with a catch in her breath verona stourbridge his voice shook a little shes been murdered just the same way as treadwell a single powerful blow to the head with a croquet mallet his fist closed over the white paper robb asked me to go it took monk nearly a quarter of an hour to find a hansom first striding down fitzroy street to the tottenham court road then walking south towards oxford street he had left hester furious at being excluded but it would be in every way inappropriate for him to have taken her she could serve no purpose except to satisfy her own curiosity and she would quite obviously be intrusive she had not argued just seethed inside because she felt helpless and as confused as he was it was a fine night a thin film of cloud scudded over a bright moon the air was warm the pavements still holding the heat of the day his footsteps were loud in the near silence a carriage rumbled by out of percy street and crossed towards bedford square the moonlight shining for a moment on gleaming doors and the horses polished flanks whoever had murdered verona stourbridge it had not been cleo anderson she was safely locked up in the hampstead police station what could this new and terrible event have to do with the death of james treadwell he could see pedestrians on the footpath at the corner of oxford street two men and a woman laughing he tried to picture mrs stourbridge on the one occasion he had met her he could not bring back her features or even the color of her eyes only the overriding impression he had had of a kind of vulnerability underneath the poised manner and the lovely clothes was a woman who was acquainted with fear or perhaps that was only hindsight now that she was dead murdered it had to be one of her own family or a servantor miriam but why would miriam kill her unless she truly was insane he turned the corner and walked along the edge of the footpath on oxford street watching the road all the time for sight of a cab he could recall miriam only too easily the wide eyes the sweep of her hair the strength in her mouth she had behaved without any apparent reason but he had never met anyone who had given him more of a sense of inner sanity of a wholeness no outside force could destroy maybe that was what madness was something inside you which the reality of the world did not touch a hansom slowed down and he hailed it giving the stourbridge address in cleveland square the driver grumbled about going so far and monk ignored him climbing inside and sitting down engulfed in silence and thought again he reached the stourbridge house paid the driver and went up the steps it was after one oclock in the morning all the surrounding houses were in darkness but here the hall and at least four other rooms blazed with light between the edges of imperfectly drawn curtains there was another carriage outside waiting presumably it was the doctors the butler answered the door the moment after monk knocked and invited him in with a voice rasping with tension the man was whitefaced and his body beneath his black suit was rigid and very slightly shaking he must have been told to expect monk because without seeking any instruction he showed him into the withdrawing room three minutes later robb came in closing the door behind him he looked almost as if he had been bereaved himself the sight of monk seemed to cheer him a little thank you he said simply its its the last thing i expected why should anybody attack mrs stourbridge his voice rose with desperate incomprehension he looked exhausted and there was a stiffness about him that monk recognized as fear this was not the sort of crime he understood or the kind of people he had ever dealt with before he knew he was out of his depth begin with the facts monk said calmly more confidence in his manner than he felt tell me exactly what you know who called you what time what did they say robb looked slightly startled as if he had expected to begin with the body and accounts of where everyone was a little before midnight he began steadying himself but still standing maybe quarter to a constable banged on my door to say thered been a murder in bayswater that was part of my case and the local police said i should come straightaway they had a cab waiting i was on my way in not more than five minutes he started moving about restlessly looking at monk then away again he told me it was mrs stourbridge and as soon as i knew that i sent the beat constable around to get you he shook his head i dont understand it it cant be cleo anderson this time he faced monk was i wrong about mrs gardiner and shes done this too why it makes no sense if the local police were called monk said thoughtfully and they sent for you then the body must have been found about eleven oclock thats over two hours ago who found her and where was she major stourbridge found her robb answered she was in her bedroom it was only chance that he went in to say something to her after hed said goodnight and all the family had retired he said hed forgotten to mention something about a cousin coming to visit and just wanted to remind her poor man went into the bedroom and saw her crumpled on the floor and blood on the carpet did he move her monk asked it would have been a natural enough thing to do he says he half picked her up robbs voice tightened as if his throat was too stiff to let him speak properly sort of cradled her in his arms i suppose for a moment he half hoped she wasnt dead he swallowed but its a pretty terrible wound looks like one very hard blow the croquet mallets still there lying on the floor beside her at least thats what they told me it was ive never seen one before monk tried not to visualize it and failed his mind created the crumpled figure and the broken bone and the blood he says he laid her back where she was robb added miserably what was she wearing monk asked er a nightgown or a dress monk pressed robb colored faintly a long whitish sort of robe i think it could be a nightgown he was transparently uncomfortable discussing such things they belonged in the realms where he felt a trespasser where was she lying exactly monk asked what do you think she was doing when she was struck was it from behind or in front robb thought for a moment she was lying half on her side about six feet away from the bed looked as if she had been talking to someone and turned away from them and they struck her from behind at least thats what i would guess it fits she had her back to them youre sure if the major didnt move her too much yes the wound is at the back on one side a bit couldnt hit someone like that from the front his eyes widened a little so considering it was in her bedroom she would hardly turn her back on anyone she was frightened of his lips pulled tight not that i ever held out hope it was a burglar theres no sign of anyone forcing their way in nothing broken too early for burglars anyway nobody breaks into a house when half the household is still up and about it was one of them wasnt it that was less than half a question looks as if the local police worked that out monk said dryly not surprised they wanted to be rid of this have you asked where everyone in the house was yet only major stourbridge he seems to have a good command of himself but hes as white as a ghost and looks pretty poorly to me he said he was in bed hed dismissed his man for the night and was about to put out the light when he remembered this cousin whos coming seems mrs stourbridge wasnt very fond of him he was wondering whether to write tomorrow morning and say it wasnt convenient what time was mrs stourbridge last seen alive i dont know her maid is being looked after by the housekeeper and i havent spoken with her yet he glanced around the spacious room where they were talking even in the dim light of one lamp there was a warmth to it the glow reflected on silver frames and winked in the faceted crystal of a row of decanters im not used to this kind of people having to do with violence he said miserably questioning them its more often a matter of burglary and asking the servants about strangers being by and not locking up properly this kind of thing doesnt happen very often in anybodys house monk replied but its best to ask now before they have time to forgetor talk to each other and think up any lies only one of thems going to lie robb began monk snorted people lie for all sorts of reasons and about things they think have nothing to do with the case youd better see the maid hysterics or not you need to know what time mrs stourbridge was left alone and alive or if she was expecting anyone what she said how she seemed anything the woman can tell you will you stay if you want the maid was sent for and came supported by the butler and looking as if she might buckle at the knees any moment her eyes were redrimmed and she kept dabbing her face with a handkerchief which was now little more than a twisted rag she had been guided to one of the armchairs and the butler was permitted to remain robb began his questions he was very gentle with her as if he himself was embarrassed yes sir she gulped mrs stourbridge went to bed about ten oclock or a little after i laid out er clothes for tomorrow a greenanwhite dress for the morning she was going to visit a picture gallery her eyes filled with tears what time did you leave her robb asked she sniffed fiercely and made an attempt to dab her cheeks with the wet handkerchief about quarter to eleven was she already in bed monk interrupted she looked at him with surprise im sure youll remember if you think for a moment he encouraged its rather important is it yes it matters whether she was expecting someone to call on her or not oh yes i see no i dont she wouldnt hardly expect a thief whod break in an kill her no one broke in pearl what are you saying she was aghast her hands tightened in her lap till the handkerchief tore robb took charge of the situation again we are saying it was someone already in the house who killed mrs stourbridge it it never is she shook her head no one ere would do such a thing we int murderers now she was both frightened and affronted yes it was robb insisted the local police and your own butler and footman have made a thorough search no one broke in now tell me all you know of everyones comings and goings from the time you left the dinner table until now she replied dutifully but nothing she had to say either incriminated anyone or cleared them the maid assigned to miriam was of no greater help she had seen miriam to her bed even earlier and had no idea whether she had remained there or not she had been excused and gone up to her own room in the attic mrs gardiner was extremely easy to work for and she could not believe any ill of her no matter what anyone said people who couldnt speak well shouldnt speak at all nor could any of the other servants swear to the movements of any of the family however the maids knew the time of each others retiring the cook whose room was nearest the stairs down was a light sleeper and the second stair creaked she was certain no one had passed after she had gone up at a quarter to eleven at last monk forced himself to go and look at the body a local constable was on duty on the landing outside the door he was tired and unhappy he showed them in without looking past them verona stourbridge lay as if eased gently onto her back halfway between the chest of drawers and the bed it must have been where her husband had laid her when he realized he could do nothing more for her and at last let her go the carpet was soaked dark with blood about a foot away from her head it was easy to see where she had originally fallen her hands were limp and there was nothing in either of them she was wearing a robe over her nightgown it looked like silk and when monk bent to touch it he knew instantly that it was soft expensive and beautiful he wondered if he would ever be able to buy hester anything like that this one would be thrown away after the case was closed no one would ever want to wear it again he stood up and turned to robb member of the family robb said hoarsely yes monk agreed why robb was bewildered why would any of them kill her her husband do you think or lucius he took a deep breath or miriam gardiner but why would she well look for the reason afterwards monk answered lets go and speak to major stourbridge robb turned reluctantly and allowed monk to lead the way harry stourbridge met them in the library he was fully dressed in a dark suit his fair hair was poking up in tufts and his eyes were sunken into the bones of his head as if the flesh no longer had life or firmness he did not speak but looked from robb to monk and then back again please sit down major stourbridge robb said awkwardly he did not know whether the man was a bereaved husband with whom he should sympathize or a suspect who deserved his hostility and contempt stourbridge obeyed his legs seemed to fold under him and he hit the seat rather too hard robb sat opposite him and monk took the third chair in the group in a low husky voice stourbridge retold the story of the forgotten message of leaving his own room and going along the corridor seeing and hearing no one else of knocking on his wifes door and going in monk stopped him was the light on sir no not the main light just the bracket on the wall he turned to look at him with a lift of interest does that mean something she sleeps with it like that doesnt like the dark just enough to see by a glow no more but enough if she were speaking with someone monk persisted yes i suppose so if it were someone she knew well one would not receive he stopped uncertainty filling his face again we have already ascertained that it was not any of the servants robb said quietly that leaves only the family and mrs gardiner stourbridge looked as if he had been struck again that is not ppossible he stammered no one would he stopped he was a man experienced in war the violence and pain of battle and the horror of its aftermath there was little that could shock or astound him but this had cut deep into his emotion in a way the honesty of battle never could he turned to monk there was nothing monk could alter but he could ease the manner of dealing with it reality was a kind of healingand the beginning of exerting some control over the chaos we need to speak to everyone he said looking at stourbridge and meeting his eyes once we have eliminated the impossible we will have a better idea of what happened what oh yes i see i dont think i can be of much help he seemed to focus a little more clearly i believe aiden retired quite early to his room he had a number of letters to write he has been away from his home for a while verona verona relied on him rather a lot they have always been close i he took a deep breath and mastered himself with difficulty i was away a great deal during the early years of our marriage military duties he looked beyond monk into some distance within his memory a young army wife does not have an easy time i was often posted to places where it was unsuitable for her to accompany me no facilities for women you see we were fighting moving about she didnt lack courage but she hadnt the physical strength she he blinked fiercely she lost several babies early stages lucius was long waited for she was thirtyfive we had all but given up his voice cracked she longed for a child so much monk was loath to interrupt him even though he was wandering far from the point he had known and loved her perhaps it was necessary to him to bring her back even in words to try to make others see her as he had when i was in egypt and the sudan he went on which i was quite a lot aiden would be with her mrs gardiner robb asked stourbridge jerked up his head no noi cannot believe it of her monk could not either and yet the alternatives were little easier of course it was possible stourbridge himself was lying but then anyone might be what time did she retire he asked perhaps you had better tell me the pattern of the whole evening from sitting down to dinner again stourbridge looked not at either of his listeners but into the distance between them miriam did not dine with us she said she felt unwell and would have a tray sent up to her room i dont think she cared whether she ate or not she did it to oblige us and perhaps to avoid discussing the subject or causing lucius to try to persuade her in fact she would not speak to him except in company they had quarreled robb asked quickly no he shook his head that is the thing i do not understand nor does he there has been no quarrel at all she speaks to him in the gentlest manner but will not explain why she left nor what happened to treadwell and since the anderson woman has been arrested that question is no longer at issue he frowned creasing up his face she merely sits in her room and refuses to do or say anything beyond the barest civility she is deeply distressed over mrs anderson monk interposed she was in every sense except the literal a mother to her perhaps the only one she knows stourbridge looked down at the floor i forgot of course she must be distressed beyond words but i wish she would turn to us for comfort and not grieve by herself we are at our wits end to know how to help her no one can help monk replied it must simply be borne please describe what happened during dinner any conversation of importance especially any differences of opinion however trivial stourbridge looked up at him thats just it there were no differences it was most agreeable there was no shadow upon our lives except miriams silence what did you discuss robb was watching him then looking at monk stourbridge shrugged very slightly with no more than half a gesture egypt as i recall verona came out there to see me once it was marvelous we saw such sights together she loved it even the heat and the food she was unaccustomed to and the strange ways of the native people he smiled she kept a diary of it all especially of the voyage back down the nile she allowed me to read some of it when i came here again she shared it with lucius too had she been able to remain he would have been born in egypt i think it was that knowledge which made him so keen to go there himself it was almost as if he could remember it through her eyes he stopped abruptly the color rising in his cheeks im sorry im sure that is far more detail than you require i just remembered how close we were it was all so normal is that all monk pressed seeking for something which could have precipitated the terrible violence he had seen egypt sounded such a harmless subject something impersonal which any cultured family might have discussed pleasantly around the table as far as i recall aiden said something about the political news but it was a mere observation on the foreign secretary and his own feelings about the question of the unification of germany it was all he shook his head of no importance verona retired to bed aiden to write letters lucius walked in the garden for a while i dont know when he came in but doubtless the footman would they questioned him further but he could add nothing which explained the emotions that had exploded in his wifes bedroom nor any fact which implicated anyone or precluded them robb did not put words to his question but it was clear in his face that he was struggling with the issue of whether stourbridge himself could have killed his wife monk was torn with the same indecision he profoundly believed that he had not but he was afraid it was his loyalty to a client and his personal liking for the man which were forming his judgment there was nothing he had seen or heard that night which proved him innocent there was a knock on the door robb rose and opened it aiden campbell came in he was very pale and his hands shook a little his eyes were unnaturally bright and his body stiff he moved clumsily surely harry didnt call you into this he asked looking at monk with surprise no sergeant robb asked me to come since i am already acquainted with some of the circumstances concerning the household monk replied ohi see well i suppose that is sensible enough he conceded coming a little farther into the room anything that can be done to get this over as rapidly as possible my family is suffering profoundly first mrs gardiners inexplicable behavior and now thisthis tragedy to my poor sister we hardly know which way to turn lucius is he stopped worsnip tells me you have found no indication of intruders is that correct yes sir robb answered and i regret to say all your household staff are also accounted for what aiden turned to monk that is true mr campbell monk agreed whoever killed mrs stourbridge it was one of her family im sorry or it was mrs gardiner aiden said quickly she is not family mr monk not yet and i fear after the events of the last two weeks it were better that she not become so it was a pity that the police saw fit to release her into luciuss custody it would have been far better if she had gone back to her own people mrs anderson is the only one she has monk pointed out and she is presently in the hampstead jail accused of murdering james treadwell then someone else should have been found aiden protested she lived in hampstead for twenty years she must have other friends there was a moments silence i apologize aiden said quietly clenching his jaw and looking down that was uncalled for this has been a terrible night his voice broke i was very close to my sister all my life now my brotherinlaw and my nephew are in the utmost distress and there is nothing i can do to help them he lifted his head again except assist you to deal with this as rapidly as possible and leave us to begin a decent mourning robb looked wretchedly uncomfortable his rawness at murder showed clearly in his young face monk was also sharply aware that robb could not afford to fail he needed his job not only for himself but to provide for his grandfather the shadows of weariness streaked his skin and it obviously cost him an effort to stand straightbacked we will do everything we can to solve this crime as quickly as we can sir he promised but we must go according to the law and we must be right in the end now if you would like to recount the evening as you remember it sir of course from what time how about when you all sat down to dinner aiden sank into the large chair opposite where robb and monk were standing then they also sat he told them largely what harry stourbridge had varying only in a description here and there he had been asleep when harry stourbridge had awakened him to tell him of the terrible thing that had happened he fancied that his man gibbons could substantiate most of it well robb asked when aiden had gone and closed the door behind him not much help is it none at all monk agreed cant see any reason why he should lie according to stourbridge he was on the best possible terms with his sister and always had been i cant see any money in it robb added disconsolately if mrs stourbridge had had any of her own before her marriage it would belong to her husband since then and lucius would inherit it when his father dies along with the title and lands monk did not bother to answer and if mrs stourbridge gave campbell any financial gifts or support that would end at her death no i cant see any reason for him to be anything except exactly what he says wed better see lucius this was the interview monk was dreading the most perhaps because lucius had been his original client and so far he had brought him only tragedy one appalling disaster after another and now it could appear as if he suspected lucius of murder as well or suspected miriam which lucius might feel to be even worse and yet what alternative was there the murderer was someone in the houseand not a servant not that he had seriously considered the servants when lucius came he was haggard his eyes were sunken with shock staring fixedly from redrimmed lids and his dark complexion was bleached of all its natural warmth he sat down as if he feared his legs might not support him he did not speak but waited for monk not regarding robb except for a moment monk had never flinched from duty no matter how unpleasant he tended rather to attack it more urgently as if anger at it could overcome whatever pain there might be can you tell us what happened this evening from the time you sat down to dinner and anything before that if it was remarkable in any way he began no luciuss voice was a little higher than usual as if his throat was so tight he could barely force the words through it it was the most ordinary dinner imaginable we talked of trivia entirely impersonal it was mostly about egypt a ghost of dreadful humor crossed his face my father was describing karnak and the great hall there how massive it is beyond our imagining we speculated a while on what happened to a whole lost civilization capable of creating such beauty and power then he spoke of the valley of the kings he described it for us the depth of the ravines and how insignificant one feels standing on their floor staring up at a tiny slice of sky so vivid blue it seems to burn the eyes he said it was a place to force one to think of god and eternity whether one were disposed to or not all those ancient pharaohs lying there in their huge sarcophagi with their treasures of the world around themwaiting out the millennia for some awakening to heaven or hell he knew a little of their beliefs it was a strange mystical conversation my mother had been there to visit him before i was born she was so lonely in england without him his voice was so choked with tears he was obliged to stop robb waited a few moments before he spoke and there were no disagreements he asked at length lucius swallowed no none what is there to disagree about and mrs gardiner was not at the table luciuss face tightened no she was not well she is terribly distressed about mrs anderson who was in every way a mother to her for most of her life how could she not be i wish there were something we could do to help of course we will find the best lawyer to represent her but it looks terribly as if she is guilty i would do anything to protect miriam from it but what is there he looked back at monk as if he still hoped monk might think of something you have already done all you can monk agreed unless mrs anderson herself can say something in mitigation and so far she has refused to say anything at all but tonight we have another issue to deal with and that will not involve her he saw lucius wince please continue you were all together until your mother retired quite early lucius braced himself yes no one wanted to move there was no point in separating he said wearily we talked a little of politics i cant remember what something to do with germany no one was particularly interested it was just something to say i went for a walk in the garden it was peaceful and i preferred to be alone i was thinking he did not need to explain what troubled him did you see anyone as you came in or went upstairs monk asked him only the servants and miriam i went to her room but she would not do more than bid me goodnight i didnt see anyone else did your man assist you to undress or lay your clothes out for the next day no i sent him to bed i didnt need him and i preferred to be alone i see did you hear anything after that any sound movement a cry footsteps no at least not that i recall monk thanked him lucius seemed about to ask something further then changed his mind and rose stiffly to his feet when he had gone robb turned to monk they had learned nothing more no one was implicated nor excluded from suspicion robb ran his hand through his hair his fingers closing so he pulled at it one of them killed her it couldnt have been an accident and not possibly a suicide we had better see miriam gardiner monk said grimly robb shot him a look of helplessness and frustration then rose and went to the door to send the maid for miriam she looked a shadow of the woman she had been even when monk had found her frightened and hiding her body was skeletal as if she had barely eaten since then her dress hung on her shoulders so the bones showed through the thin clothes and her bosom was scarcely rounded her skin had no color at all and her beautiful hair had been dressed with little attention she looked as if she was a stranger to any kind of rest of mind or body she moved jerkily and refused to be seated when robb asked her her hands were clenched and shaking she seemed not to blink but to stare fixedly as though her attention was only partly here robb looked at monk desperately then as monk said nothing he began to question her she replied in a voice that was unnaturally calm that she knew nothing at all she had taken dinner in her room and had not left it except to go to the bathroom she had seen no one other than the servant who had ministered to her personal needs she had no idea what had happened she had never quarreled with mrs stourbridge or with anyone else she refused to say anything further and no matter how either robb or monk pressed her she did not yield a word she walked away stiffly swaying a little as if she might lose her balance did she do it robb asked as soon as the door was closed i have no idea monk confessed he hated the thought but she appeared to be in a state of suppressed hysteria almost as if she moved in a trance a world of her own connected only here and there with reality he judged that if there was one more pressure however slight she would lose control completely was that what had happened had she for some reason or other gone to see mrs stourbridge in her bedroom and something however innocently or well meant had precipitated an emotional descent into insanity had verona stourbridge made some remark about cleo anderson suggesting miriam leave the past and its griefs behind and miriam had reacted by releasing all the terror and violence inside her in one fearful blow but where had the croquet mallet come from one did not keep such things in a bedroom whoever had killed verona stourbridge had brought it and it could only be as a weapon the murder was premeditated he said as much aloud i know robb admitted i know but she still seems the most likely one well have to go farther back than i thought ill start again with the servants its here whatever it is the reason the jealousy or the fear or the rage its in this house it has to be they worked all night asking probing going back over detail after detail they were so tired the whole house seemed to be a maze going around and around itself like a symbol of the confusion within monks throat was dry and he felt as if there were sand in his eyes the cook brought them a tray of tea at three oclock in the morning and another at a quarter to five this time with roast beef sandwiches they again questioned mrs stourbridges maid the woman looked exhausted and terrified but she spoke quite coherently i dont know nothing to her discredit not really she said when robb asked her about miriam shes always bin very civil far as i know monk seized on the hesitation reading the indecision in her face you must be frank he said gravely you owe mrs stourbridge that what do you mean not really what were you thinking about when you said that still she was reluctant monk looked at her grimly until she flushed and finally answered well i was thinking of that time i brought back mrs stourbridges clean petticoats to hang them up like an i found mrs gardiner sitting at mrs stourbridges dressing table and she had one of mrs stourbridges necklaces on she said as mrs stourbridge had said she could borrow it but she never said nothing to me as anyone could and and mrs stourbridges diary was lying open on her bed an thats a thing ive never seen before did she explain that too no i never asked i see she looked wretched and seemed glad to escape when they excused her it was half past five robb stood facing the window and the brilliant sunlight as the first noises of awakening came in from the street a horse and cart rolled by somewhere on the farther side of the road there were footsteps on the pavement a door opened and closed he turned back to the room his face was pale and he looked exhausted and miserable ive got to arrest her he said flatly seems she couldnt wait to get her hands on the pretty things or to pry into mrs stourbridges affairs i wish that wasnt so money does strange things to some people she didnt have to hurt verona stourbridge to have that monk pointed out no one objected to the marriage perhaps she did robb said his back stiff his head high he was determined to stand up to monk on the issue because he believed it it was a testing ground between them and he was going to prove his own authority perhaps mrs stourbridge knew whatever it was treadwell knew or even that miriam killed him monk drew in his breath to argue but each protest died on his lips they were empty and he knew it no one else had any reason or motive to harm verona stourbridge and there was no physical evidence to implicate any of them miriam was already deeply involved in the murder of james treadwell and strangely enough she had not defended herself in any coherent way any jury would find it easy enough to believe that she had set out deliberately to charm lucius a wealthy and naive young man he was handsome and intelligent enough but not worldly wise and might be easily duped by a woman older than he and well practiced in the ways of pleasing then she had seen the luxury of the life she could expect but through an unforeseeable misfortune the coachman knew something of her past which was so ugly it would have spoiled her dream he had blackmailed her her mentor and accomplice also blackmailed for theft by the same wretched coachman either helped her kill him or hid her afterwards and obscured the evidence of the crime he had no choice but to charge her the family was shattered harry stood whitefaced stammering incoherent assurances that he would do all he could to help her he looked as if he hardly knew what he was saying or doing he kept turning to lucius as if he would protect him and then realized he was helpless to make any difference at all monk had never felt more pity for any man but he did not believe that even oliver rathbone could do anything to relieve this tragedy the most compassionate thing would be to deal with it as quickly as possible to prolong the suffering was pointless miriam herself seemed the least surprised or distressed she accepted the situation as if she had expected it and made no protest or appeal for help she did not even deny the charge she thanked harry stourbridge for his behavior towards her then walked uprightly quite firmly a step or two ahead of robb out to the front door she hesitated as if to speak to lucius then changed her mind at the doorway monk looked back at the three men as they stood in the hall harry and lucius were paralyzed aiden campbell put his arm around lucius as if to support him it was after seven in the morning by the time monk returned home it was broad daylight and the streets were full of traffic the hiss of wheels the clatter of hooves and people shouting to each other he went in at his own door and closed it behind him all he wanted to do was wash the heat and grime off himself then sink into bed and sleep all day he was barely across the room when hester appeared dressed in blueandwhite muslin and looking as if she had been up for hours what happened she said instantly you look terrible the kettle is on would you like breakfast or are you too tired just tea he answered following her into the kitchen and sitting down his legs ached and his feet were hot and so tired they hurt his head throbbed he wanted somewhere cool and dark and as quiet as possible she made the tea and poured it for him before asking any further and then it was by a look not words she was struck once with a croquet mallet he told her there was enough evidence to prove it had to be one of the family or miriam gardiner there was no reason for any of the servants to do it she sat across the small table from him her face very solemn and for her she asked the obvious whatever treadwell knew of her verona stourbridge knew it as well or else she deduced it from something miriam said im sorry the best you can say of her is that she has lost her mind the worst that she deliberately planned to marry lucius and assure herself of wealth and social position for the rest of her life and indirectly of course for cleo anderson as well when treadwell threatened that plan either alone or with cleos help she killed him and then later when verona threatened it she killed her too it makes a hideous sense but do you believe it she asked searching his face i dont know not easily but logic forces me to accept it that was the truth but he was reluctant to say it when miriam had denied it he had more than believed her he had liked her and felt compelled to go farther than duty necessitated in order to defend her but he was not governed by emotion he must let reason be the last determiner hester sat silently for several minutes sipping her own tea i dont believe cleo anderson was part of killing anyone for gain she said at last i still think we should help her do you he looked at her as closely as his weariness and sense of disillusion would allow he saw the bewilderment in her the confusion of thought and feelings and understood it precisely are you sure you are not looking for a spectacular trial to show people the plight of men like john robb old and ill and forgotten now that the wars they fought are all won and we are safe she drew in her breath to deny it indignantly then saw in his eyes that he was a step ahead of her well i wouldnt mind if something were to draw peoples s attention to it she conceded but i wasnt using cleo i believe she took the medicines to give to those who needed them not for any profit for herself and if she killed james treadwell at least in part he deserved it and when did it become all right for us to decide that someone deserves to die she glared at him he smiled and stood up slowly it was an effort he was even more tired than he had thought and the few moments relaxing had made it worse what are we going to do she stood up also coming towards him almost as if she would block his way to the door she hasnt any money she cant afford a lawyer never mind a good one and now miriam is charged as well there is no one to help her you cant expect lucius stourbridge to he knew what she wanted that they should go to oliver rathbone and try to persuade him to use his professional skill free of charge to plead for cleo anderson because of their past friendshiplove would not be too strong a word at least on rathbones partshe would also probably rather that monk asked him so that it did not appear that she was abusing his affection oliver rathbone was the last person of whom he wanted to ask any favors no matter on whose behalf was it guilt because he had asked hester to marry him before rathbone had knowing that rathbone also loved her that was ridiculous rathbone had had his opportunity and failed to take it for whatever reason monk was not responsible perhaps it was a certain guilt because he had seized a happiness that he knew rathbone would have treasured or in some ways would have been more worthy of there was too often a fear at the back of his mind that rathbone could have made her happier given her things monk never couldnot only material possessions and security or social position but emotional certainties he would not have loved her more but he might have been a better man to share her life with an easier one a man who would have caused her less fear or doubt less anxiety at the very least she would have known rathbones past there were no ghosts no black regions or forgotten holes she was waiting for an answer her brow furrowed her chin lifted a little because she knew he did not want to even if she could not guess why he would not let rathbone beat him i think we should ask rathbones opinion he said slowly and quite distinctly and if he is willing his help hell take up a lost cause every now and again if the issue is good enough im sure we could persuade him this one is he smiled with a downward twist of his lips and the appearance of sir oliver rathbone in court to defend a nurse accused of theft and murder will ensure that the newspapers give it all the attention we could wish she smiled very slowly her body relaxing thank you william i knew you would say that he had not known it but if she thought so well of him he was certainly not going to argue now go to sleep she urged ill waken you in time to go to vere street and see oliver before the end of the day he grunted too tired to argue that tomorrow would do and climbed slowly up the stairs monk hated presenting himself at rathbones chambers on vere street without an appointment and fully expected to be turned away if he was received he was certain it would be because hester was with him he would rather she had not come but he could understand her insistence she wanted to be there not simply to add her own thoughts and words to the story and to try her own persuasion if monks should fail but because she would feel cowardly if she sent monk and did not go herself it would seem as if she wanted a favor of rathbone but had not the courage to face him to ask it therefore they stood in the outer office and explained to the clerk that they had no appointment but they were well acquainted with sir oliver which he knew and had a matter of some urgency to lay before him it was the end of the afternoon and the last client was presently in sir olivers rooms with him it was a fortunate time some fifteen minutes passed by monk found it almost impossible to sit still he glanced at hester and read the misgiving in her face and equally the determination cleo andersons life was worth a great deal more than a little embarrassment at twenty minutes past five the client left and rathbone came to the door he looked startled to see them his eyes flew to hester and there was a sudden warmth in them and the faintest flush on his narrow cheeks he forced himself to smile but there was not the usual humor in it he came forward hester how nice to see you you look extremely well we are sorry to intrude hester replied with an equally uncertain smile but we have a case that is so desperate we know of no one else who would have even a chance of success in it rathbone half turned to monk for the first time since the wedding their eyes met then monk had been the bridegroom now he was the husband the last barrier had been crossed there was a new kind of intimacy from which rathbone was forever excluded rathbones eyes were startlingly magnificently dark in his fair face everything that had passed through monks mind he read in them he held out his hand monk shook it feeling the strength and the coolness of rathbones grip then you had better come in and tell me rathbone said calmly his voice held no trace of emotion he was supremely courteous what effort of pride or dignity that had cost him monk could only guess he and hester followed into rathbones familiar office and sat down in the chairs away from the desk it was a formal visit but not yet an official one the late sun poured in through the window making bright patterns on the floor and shining on the gold lettering on the books in their mahogany case rathbone leaned back and crossed his legs as always he was immaculately dressed but with an understated elegance and the ease of someone who knows he does not have to try what is this case he enquired looking at each of them in turn monk was determined to answer first before hester could speak and make it a dialogue between herself and rathbone with monk merely an onlooker a nurse has been stealing medicines from the north london hospital where hester is now assisting lady callandra he had no need to explain that situation rathbone knew and admired callandra she doesnt want the medicines for herself or to sell but to give to the old and poor that she visits who are in desperate need many of them dying laudable but illegal rathbone said with a frown his interest was already caught and his concern precisely monk agreed somehow a coachman named james treadwell learned of her thefts and was blackmailing her how he learned is immaterial he comes from an area close by and possibly he knew someone she was caring for he was found dead on the path close to her doorway she has been charged with his murder physical evidence rathbone said with pressed lips his face already darker brows drawn down none all on motive and opportunity the weapon has not been found but that is not all rathbones eyes widened incredulously theres more and worse monk replied some twenty years ago mrs anderson found in acute distress a girl of about twelve or thirteen years old she took her in and treated her as her own he saw rathbones guarded expression and the further spark of interest in his eyes miriam grew up and married comfortably monk continued she was widowed and then fell deeply in love with a young man lucius stourbridge of wealthy and respectable family who more than returned her feelings they became engaged to marry with his parents approval then one day for no known reason she fled with the said coachman back to hampstead heath the night of his death i presume rathbone said with a twisted smile just so monk agreed at first she was charged with his murder and would say nothing of her flight its reason or what happened except to deny that she killed him and she wasnt charged rathbone was surprised yes she was then when a far better motive was found for the nurse she was released and the worse that you have to add rathbone asked monks shoulders stiffened last night i had a message from the young policeman on the caseincidentally his grandfather is one of those for whom the nurse stole medicinesto ask me to go to the family home in cleveland square where the mother of the young man had just been found murdered in what seems to be exactly the same manner as the coachman on hampstead heath rathbone shut his eyes and let out a long slow breath i hope that is now all not quite monk replied they have arrested miriam and charged her with the murder of stourbrldges mother and miriam and cleo as being accomplices in murder for gain there is considerable money in the family and lands rathbone opened his eyes and stared at monk have you completed this tale to date yes hester spoke for the first time leaning forward a little her voice urgent please help oliver i know miriam may be beyond anything anybody can do except perhaps plead that she may be mad but cleo anderson is a good woman she took medicine to treat the old and ill who have barely enough money to survive john robb the policemans grandfather fought at trafalgaron the victory he and men like him dont deserve to be left to die in pain that we could alleviate we asked everything of them when we were in danger when we thought napoleon was going to invade and conquer us we expected them to fight and die for us or to lose arms or legs or eyes i know rathbone held up his slender hand know my dear you do not need to persuade me and a jury might well be moved by such things but a judge will not he wont ask them to decide whether a blackmailer is of more or less value than a nurse or an old soldier simply did she kill him or not and what about this other woman the younger one what possible reason or excuse did she have for murdering her prospective motherinlaw we dont know hester said helplessly she wont say anything is she aware of her position that if she is found guilty she will hang she knows the words monk replied whether she comprehends their meaning or not i am uncertain i was there when she was arrested and she seemed numb but she left with the police with more dignity than i have seen in anyone else i can recall he felt foolish as he said it it was an emotional response and he disliked having rathbone see him in such a light it made him vulnerable he was about to add something to qualify it defend himself but rathbone had turned to hester and was not listening do you know this nurse he asked yes she said unhesitatingly and i know john robb i have been to a few of the patients she visited i can and will testify that the medicines were used for them and that no return of any kind was asked rathbone forbore from saying that that would be of no legal help the sympathy of the jury would not alter her guilt and was unlikely to mitigate the sentence anyway was hanging so very much worse than a lifetime spent in the coldbath fields or some other prison like it he stayed silent for several moments considering the question and neither monk nor hester prompted him i presume she has no money this nurse rathbone said at last and the family are hardly likely to wish to defend her monk felt anger harsh inside him so it was all a matter of payment so she is unlikely to have anyone to represent her already rathbone concluded there will be no professional ethics to break if i were to go and visit her i can at least offer my services and then she may accept or decline them as she wishes and who is going to pay you monk asked with a lift of his eyebrows rathbone looked straight back at him i have done sufficiently well lately that i can afford to do it without asking payment he replied levelly i imagine she will have no means to pay you either monk felt an unaccustomed heat rise up his cheeks but he knew the rebuke was fair he had earned it thank you hester said quickly rising to her feet her name is cleo anderson and she is in the hampstead police station rathbone smiled with a dry twist of humor as if there were a highly subtle joke which was at least half against himself dont thank me he said softly it sounds like a challenge which ought to be attempted and i know no one else fool enough to try it oliver rathbone sat in his office after monk and hester had gone aware that he had made an utterly impetuous decision which was most unlike him he was not a man who acted without consideration which was part of the reason why he was probably the most brilliant barrister currently practicing in london it might also be why he had allowed monk to ask hester to marry him before he had asked her himself no that was not entirely true he had been on the verge of asking her but she had very delicately allowed him to understand that she would not accept it had been to save his feelings and the awkwardness between them that would have followed but then if he were honest the reason she would not accept him might easily have been her sense of his uncertainty monk would never have allowed his head to rule his heart that was what rathbone both admired in him and despised there was something ungoverned in monk something even dark and yet he had come with hester to try to persuade rathbone to take the hopeless case of defending a nurse certainly guilty of theft and almost as certainly guilty of murder that could not have been easy for him rathbone leaned back farther in his chair and smiled a little as he remembered the look on hesters face the stiffness in her body he could imagine her thoughts monk would have done it for hesters sake and he would know that rathbone knew it also he was surprised how sharp the pain was on seeing hester again hearing the passion in her voice as she spoke of cleo anderson and the old sailor john robb that was just like her full of pity and anger and courage bound on some hopeless cause not listening to anyone who told her the impossibility of it and he had agreed to helpin fact to undertake some kind of defense he would be a fool to pretend it would be less than that now he had begun she would not allow him to stopnor would he allow himself he would never admit to monk that he would quit a fight before he had either won it or lost monk would understand defeat and forgive it and respect winner or loser alike he had tasted bitterness too often himself not to understand but he would not forgive surrender and rathbone would always want to be all that hester expected of him so now he was committed to a case he could not win and probably could not even fight in any adequate manner he should have been angry with himself not analytical and even in a faraway sense amused he should have felt hopeless but already his mind was beginning to explore possibilities beginning to think to plan to wonder about tactics both women had been charged with conspiracy and murder the penalty would unquestionably be death rathbone had a justifiably high opinion of his own abilities but the obstacles in this case seemed insuperable it was extremely foolish to have such a will to win in fact it was a classic example of a mans allowing his emotions not merely to eliminate his judgment but to sweep it away entirely he called his clerk in and enquired about his appointments for the next two days there was nothing which could not be either postponed or dealt with by someone else he duly requested that that be done and left for his home his mind absorbed in the issue of cleo anderson miriam gardiner and the crimes with which they were charged in the morning he presented himself at the hampstead police station he informed them that he was the barrister retained by cleo andersons solicitor and that he wished to speak with her without delay sir oliver rathbone the desk sergeant said with amazement looking at the card rathbone had given him rathbone did not bother to reply the sergeant cleared his throat yes sir if youll come this way ill take yer ter the cells sir he was still shaking his head as he led the way back through the narrow passage and down the steps and finally to the iron door with its huge lock the key squeaked in the lock as he turned it and swung the door open eres yer lawyer ter see yer he said the lift of disbelief in his voice rathbone thanked him and waited until he had closed the door and gone cleo anderson was a handsome woman with fine eyes and strong gentle features but at the moment she was so weary and ravaged by grief that her skin looked gray and the lines of her face dragged downwards she regarded rathbone without comprehension andwhat worried him morewithout interest my name is oliver rathbone he introduced himself i have come to see if i can be of assistance to you in your present difficulty anything you say to me is completely confidential but you must tell me the truth or i cannot be of any use he saw the beginning of denial in her face he sat down on the one hard chair opposite where she was sitting on the cot i have been retained by miss hester latterly too late he realized he should have said mrs monk he felt the heat in his face as he was obliged to correct himself she shouldnt have cleo said sadly her face pinched emotion raw in her voice shes a good woman but she doesnt have money to spend on the likes o you im sorry for your trouble but theres no job for you here he was prepared for her answer she told me that you took certain medicines from the hospital and gave them to patients who you knew were in need of them but were unable to pay cleo stared at him he had not expected a confession if that were so it would be theft of course and illegal he continued but it would be an act which many people would admire perhaps even wish that they had had the courage to perform themselves maybe she agreed with a tiny smile but its still theft like you said do you want me to admit it would it help miriam if i did that was not my purpose in discussing it mrs anderson he held her gaze steadily but a person who would do such a thing obviously placed the welfare of other people before her own as far as i can see it was an act a series of acts for which she expected no profit other than that of having done what she believed to be right and of benefit to others for whose welfare she cared possibly she believed in a cause she frowned why are you saying all this youre talking about ifs and maybes what do you want he smiled in spite of himself that you should accept that occasionally people do things without expecting to be paid because they care not only people like yousometimes people like me too a flush of embarrassment spread up her cheeks and the line of her mouth softened im sorry mr rathbone i didnt mean to insult you but with the best will in the world you cant clear me of thieving those medicines unless you find a way to blame some other poor soul whos innocentand if you did that how would i go to y maker in peace thats not how i work mrs anderson he did not bother to correct her as to his title it seemed remarkably unimportant now if you took the medicines i have two options either to plead mitigating circumstances and hope that they will judge you from the charity of your intent rather than the illegality of your act or else to try to misdirect their attention from the theft altogether and hope that they concentrate on other matters other matters she shook her head theyre saying as i killed treadwell because he was blackmailing me over the medicines you cant misdirect anybody away from that and was he she hesitated something inside her seemed to crumple she took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh yes he waited for her to say more but she remained silent how did he find out about the medicines he asked i suppose it wasnt hard she stared ahead of her a shadow of selfmockery in her expression lot o people could have if theyd wanted to think about it and watch i took stuff to about a score o the old ones who were really in a bad way i dont know why i talk about it in the pastthey still are an heres me sittin here useless she looked up at him theres nothing you can do mr rathbone all the questions in the world arent going to make any difference i took the medicines and itll be easy enough to prove treadwell worked it out i dont know how there was no argument to make he heard footsteps along the corridor outside but they continued on and no one disturbed them he wondered briefly if the jailers here sympathized with her even were it possible they might sooner have had the law turn a blind eye to her thefts maybe they had little time for a blackmailer it was academic only a wish the power was not in their hands maybe it was a thought each would have had individually and never dared voice she was regarding him earnestly her eyes anxious mr rathbonedont let them go talking to all the people i took medicines to its bad enough they wont get any help now i dont want them to know they were part of a crime even though they never understood it he wished there was some way he could prevent that from happening but it would soon enough become common knowledge the trial would be written up in all the newspapers told and retold by the running patterers and in the gossip on every street corner what should he tell her she was waiting a flicker of hope in her face he regarded her almost as if he had not seen her before not been speaking to her forming judgments those last ten minutes she had risked her own freedom taken her own leap of moral decision in order to help the old and ill who could not help themselves she had faced the most painful of realities and dealt with it she did not deserve the condescension of being lied to she would know the truth eventually anyway i cant stop them mrs anderson he said gently startled by the respect in his own voice and theyll know anyway when it comes to trial that is perhaps the only good thing about this whole affair all london will hear of the plight of our old people to whom we owe so muchand choose not to pay we may even hope that a few will take up the fight to have things changed she looked at him hope and denial struggling in her face she shook her head pushing the thought away and yet unable to let go completely dyou think so it is worth fighting for he smiled very slightly but my first battle is for you how long have you been paying treadwell and how much her voice hardened and the pity vanished from her eyes five yearsan i paid him all i had except a couple of shillings to live on rathbone felt a tightening around his heart and he asked you for more the night of his death how much her voice sank to a whisper she hesitated a moment before answering at all never saw him the night he died thats gods truth he asked the question whose answer he did not want to hear and possibly he would not believe do you know who did she answered instantly her voice hard no i dont miriam told me nothing except it wasnt her but she was in a terrible state frightened half out of her mind an like the whole world had ended for her she leaned towards him half put out her hand then took it back not because the emotion or the urgency was any less simply that she dared not touch him never mind about me mr rathbone i took the medicines you cant help me but help miriam please thats what i want if youre my lawyer like you said youll speak up for her she never killed him i know heri raised her since she was thirteen shes got a good heart an she never deliberately hurt anyone but somebodys hurt her so bad shes all but dead inside help herplease id go to the rope happy if i knew she was all right he met her eyes and felt his throat choke he believed her it was a wild statement she might have no real conception of what it would be like when the moment came when the judge put on his black cap and later when she was alone in the end walking the short corridor towards the trap in the floor and the short drop then it would be too late but he still believed her she had seen much death there could be little of loneliness or pain that she was not familiar with mrs anderson i am not sure there is anything i can do but i promise i will not secure any leniencyor indeed any defensefor you at miriam gardiners expense and i will certainly do all i can to secure her acquittal if she wishes it and you do i do she said with fierce intensity and if she argues with youfor metell her that is my wish ive had a good life with lots of laughter in it and done the things i wanted to shes very young its your profession to convince people of things you go and convince her of that will you i can only work within the facts but i will try he promised now if there is anything more of that night you can tell me please do i dont know anything else of that night she protested i wish i did then maybe i could help either one of us i knew nothing until the police came because someone had reported finding a body on the pathway when was that what time he interrupted her about an hour after dark i didnt look at the clock i suppose miriam must have left the party in late afternoon and it would be close on dark by the time the carriage got as far as the heath i dont know where he was attacked but i heard say he crawled from there to where they found him and when did you see miriam gardiner next morning early about six or something like that shed been out on the heath all night and looked like the devil had been after her like shed been in a fight he asked quickly were her clothes torn dirty stained with mud or grass something inside her closed she was afraid he was trying to implicate miriam no only like shed been running praps or frightened was that a lie he had no way of knowing he recognized that she was not going to tell him any more he rose to his feet the fact that she had withdrawn her trust at least as far as miriam was concerned did not alter his admiration for her or his intent to do all he could to find some way of helping i shall go and speak with mrs gardiner he told her please do not discuss this with anyone else i shall return when i have something to tell you or if i need to ask you anything further you have my word i shall take no steps without your permission thank you she answered ii am grateful mr rathbone will you tell mrs monk that too and yes nonothing else he banged on the door and the jailer let him out he walked away along the dim corridor with a fluttering fear inside him as to what else she might have been going to say to hester she was a woman prepared to go to any lengths make any sacrifice for what she believed to be right and to save those she loved no wonder hester was keen in her defense in the same place she might so easily have done the same things he could picture hester with just this blind loyalty sacrificing herself rather than denying the greater principle was that what cleo had been going to saysome instruction or warning to hester about the medicines was it a request or was hester already doing it even now he felt sick at the thought his stomach knotted and sweat broke out on his skin what could he do to help her if she was caught he could not even think clearly about cleo anderson whom he had never seen before today start with miriam gardiner that was the only thing usually he would have told himself that the truth was his only ally always to know the truth before he began but in this case he was afraid there were truths he might prefer not to knowthough he was uncertain which they were he would have looked the other way if only he was certain which way that was rathbone was allowed in to see miriam but not as easily as when he had been to see cleo anderson the atmosphere was different cleo was in police cells a local woman known to the menby repute if not personallyto be undoubtedly a good woman one whose life they valued far more than that of any blackmailing outsider miriam was in prison accused of murdering her prospective motherinlaw in order to inherit money the sooneror possibly because the unfortunate motherinlaw was aware of some scandal in her past which would have prevented the marriage greed was an altogether different matter miriam was not at all as he had expected it was not until he saw her that he realized he had pictured in his mind some rather brashly handsome boldeyed woman with accomplished charm who would quickly try to win him to her cause instead he found a small woman a little too broad of hip with a fair tired face full of inner quietness and a strength which startled him she maintained a deep reserve even after he had explained to her who he was and the exact circumstances and reasons for his having come it is good of you to take the time sir oliver she said so softly he had to lean forward to catch her words but i dont believe you can help me she did not meet his eyes and he was aware that in a sense she had already dismissed him if he could not appeal to her mind he would have to try her emotions he sat down in the chair opposite her and crossed his legs as if he intended to make himself comfortable have they told you that you and mrs anderson are to be charged together with conspiracy in the murders of treadwell and mrs stourbridge she stared at him her eyes wide and troubled thats absurd how can they possibly think mrs anderson had anything to do with mrs stourbridges death she was in their own prison at the time you must be mistaken i am not mistaken they know all that they are saying that they believe you and mrs anderson planned from the beginning that you should marry lucius stourbridge thus gaining access to a very great deal of money some now far more later on major stourbridges death whenever that might be why should he die she protested he is quite young not more than fifty and in excellent health he could have another thirty years or more he sighed the mortality rate among those who seem to stand in the way of your plans is very high mrs gardiner they would not consider his age or his health to be matters which would deter you she closed her eyes that is hideous studying the lines of her face of her mouth and the way it tightened the sadness and the momentary surprise and anger in her he could not believe she had even thought of harry stourbridges death until this moment and now that she did the idea hurt her but he could not afford to be gentle that is what they are accusing you ofyou and mrs anderson together unless you accuse each other which neither of you has done you will both either stand or fall she looked up at him slowly searching his eyes his face trying to read him you mean i am to defend myself if i do not wish cleo to suffer with me yes exactly that it is completely untrue i loved lucius she swallowed and he could almost feel the pain in her as if it had been in himself i had no thought of anything but marrying him and being happy simply to be with him had he been a pauper it would have made not the slightest difference he felt she was telling the truth and yet why had she hesitated why had she spoken of her love for lucius in the past was that because the love had died or simply the hope james treadwell was blackmailing mrs anderson over the medicines she stole from the hospital to treat her patients was he blackmailing you also her head jerked up her eyes wide she seemed about to deny it vehemently then instead she said nothing mrs gardiner he said urgently leaning forward towards her if i am to help either of you then i must know as much of the truth as you do i am bound to act in your interest and believe me when i say that the outlook could not be worse for either of you than it already is whatever you tell me it cannot harm you now and it may help in the end when it comes to trial i shall take your instructions or at the very worst if i cannot do that then i shall decline the case i cannot betray you if i did so i should be disbarred and lose not only my reputation but my livelihood both of which are of great value to me nowwas james treadwell blackmailing you or not she seemed to reach some decision no he wasnt he could not know anything which would harm me except i suppose a connection with cleo and the medicines but he never mentioned it i had no idea he was blackmailing her if i had i would have tried to do something about it what could you do he tried to keep the edge from his voice she gave a tiny halfhearted shrug i dont know i suppose if i had told lucius or major stourbridge they might have dismissed him without references and made certain it was very hard for him to find new employment would that not have driven him to expose mrs anderson in retaliation he asked perhaps then she stiffened and twisted around to stare at him her face bleached with horror you think i killed him to protect cleo did you no i didnt kill himfor any reason the denial was passionate ringing with anger and hurt neither did cleo then who did her expression closed again shutting him out she averted her eyes who are you protecting if it isnt mrs anderson he asked very gently is it lucius she shivered glanced up at him then away again did treadwell injure you in some way and lucius fought with him and it went further than he intended no she sounded as if the idea surprised her it had seemed to him so likely an answer he was disappointed that she denied it and startled at himself for believing her for no better reason than the intonation of her voice and the angle and stiffness of her body do you know who killed him mrs gardiner he demanded with sudden force she said nothing it was as good as an admission he was frustrated almost beyond bearing he had never felt more helpless even though he had certainly dealt with many cases where people accused of fearful crimes had refused to tell him the truth and had in the end proved to be innocent morally if not legally nothing in his experience explained miriam gardiners behavior he refused to let it go if anything he was even more determined to defend both miriam and cleo not for hester and certainly not to prove himself to monk but for the case itself for these two extraordinary devoted and blindly stubborn women and perhaps because he would not rest until he knew the truth and maybe also for the principle did mrs stourbridge know anything about treadwell or about cleo anderson he pursued again she was surprised no i cant imagine how she could i didnt tell her and i can hardly think that treadwell would tell her himself he was a she stopped she seemed to be torn by emotions which confused her pulling one way and then another anger pity horror despair rathbone tried to read what she was feeling even to imagine what was in her mind and failed utterly there were too many possibilities and none of them made sense entirely he was a man who did evil things she said quietly at last as much to herself as to him but he was not without virtue and he is dead now poor soul i dont think mrs stourbridge knew anything about him except that he drove the carriage quite welland of course that he was related to the cook why was she killed she winced i dont know she did not look at him as she said it her voice was flat the tone of it different he knew she was lying who killed her i dont know she repeated lucius no this time she turned to look at him eyes dark and angry were you with him she said nothing you werent then how do you know he did not again she said nothing it was the same person who killed both people she made a very slight movement he took it for agreement has it anything to do with the stolen medicines no suddenly she was completely frantic again no it has nothing to do with cleo at all please sir oliver defend her now she was pleading with him she is the best person i have ever known the only thing she has done against the law is to take medicines to treat the ill who cannot afford to buy them she made nothing for herself out of it her face was flushed how can that be so wrong that she deserves to die for it if we were the christian people we pretend to be she wouldnt have had to take them we would care for our own old and sick we would be grateful to those who fought to protect us when we needed it and wed be just as keen to protect them now please dont let her suffer for this its nothing to do with her she didnt kill treadwell and she couldnt possibly have killed mrs stourbridge her voice was tight with fear and strain almost strangled in her throat ill say i killed them both if it will free her i swear it he put his hand on her arm noit would only condemn you both say nothing if you will not tell me the truth at least do not lie to me i will do anything i can for both of you i accept that mrs anderson could not have killed mrs stourbridge and i believe you that you did not kill treadwell if there is another answer i shall do everything in my power to find it she shook her head fractionally you can she whispered just dont let them hang cleo she only took the medicinesthats all rathbone had a late luncheon at his club where he knew he would be left in complete solitude should he wish itand he did then he took a hansom out to the north london hospital intending to see hester he was not looking forward to it and yet it was necessary to do so he had not seen her alone since her marriage but he had always known that it would be painful to him he sat in the cab as it clipped smartly through the streets unaware of the other passing vehicles even of where he was as they moved from one neighborhood to another as they changed eventually from stonefacaded houses to the green stretch of the heath he had changed his mind a dozen times as to what he would say to her what manner he would adopt every decision was in one way or another unsatisfactory when he reached the hospital paid the cabbie and alighted he walked up the steps and met her without having had time to prepare himself she was coming along the wide corridor at a brisk purposeful walk her head high she was wearing a very plain blue dress with a small white lace collar almost like a kind of uniform on anyone else it might have been a little forbidding but it was how he always visualized her as a nurse determined about something ready to start some battle or other the familiarity of it almost took his breath away no amount of imagining this moment could stab like the reality the sunlight in the corridor the smell of vinegar footsteps in the distance all were printed indelibly in his mind oliver she was startled to see him and pleased he could detect none of the roar of emotion in her that he felt himself but then he should not have expected it she was happy he wanted her to be and part of him could not bear it he made himself smile if he lost his dignity they would both hate it i was hoping to see you i trust i am not interrupting you have news of some sort she searched his face he must think only of the case they had a common cause one that mattered as fiercely as any they had ever fought the lives of two women depended on it very little he replied moving a step closer to her he caught a warmth a faint air of some perfume about her he ached to move closer still she was so different now so much less vulnerable than before and yet in so many ways she was exactly the same the will to battle was there the stubbornness the unreason the laughter he had never completely understood the arbitrariness that exasperated and fascinated him there was a very faint flush on her cheeks as if she guessed some part of his thoughts he looked away from her avoiding her eyes pretending to be thinking deeply of legal matters i have been to see both cleo anderson and miriam gardiner both deny either conspiracy or murder but miriam at least is lying to me about the murders she knows who committed them but i believe her when she says it is not she i have not met lucius stourbridge hester was startled do you believe he could be guilty of killing his own mother i dont think so but it would seem to have been someone in the family or else miriam gardiner he reasoned she looked up and down the corridor come into the waiting room here there is no one needing it at the moment we can speak more easily she opened the door and led him in he closed it trying to force his emotions out of his consciousness there were far more important issues between them major stourbridge he asked or the brother aiden campbell she looked miserable i dont know i cant think of any reason why they would hurt either mrs stourbridge or still less treadwell but he was a blackmailer if he would blackmail cleo then maybe he would blackmail others as well william says he seemed to spend more money than he could have had from cleo so there will have been other victims lucius perhaps she said quietly that would explain why miriam is prepared to defend him even at the price of being condemned for it herself it was possible it would explain miriams refusal to tell the truth but he still found it hard to believe i cannot think of anything we could argue which would convince a jury of that especially in the face of miriams denial he said watching hester and she would not let me try i have promised not to act against her wishes a smile touched the corners of hesters lips and then vanished i would have assumed as much i would like you to be able to defend miriam but i am more concerned with cleo anderson i hope she did not kill treadwell but she cannot have killed mrs stourbridge i am absolutely sure she would not have conspired for miriam to marry lucius or anyone else for money that part of it is simply impossible even to put to a good cause he asked gently to put to any cause at all it would be revolting to her she loves miriam what kind of a woman would have her daughter marry for money thats prostitution hester my dear it is the commonest practice in civilization or out of it for that matter parents have sold their daughters in marriage and considered it as doing all parties a service since time immemoriallonger since prehistory isnt that the same she said tartly actually no i believe time immemorial is in the middle of the twelfth century it hardly matters no it doesnt cleo would not sell her daughter and she certainly would not conspire to murder someone who got in the way if you knew her as i do you wouldnt even have thought of it he did not believe it either but it was what a jury would believe that mattered he pointed that out to her i know she said miserably staring at the floor but weve got to do something to help i refuse to hide behind an intricacy of the law as if it excused one from fighting he found himself smiling but there was no laughter in it no light at all except irony murder is not an intricacy of the law my dear she looked at him with utter frankness all the old friendship warm in her eyes and suddenly he was short of breath the final bit of denial of his emotions slipped away he forced his mind back to the law and cleo anderson how much medicine is missing and exactly what she looked apologetic we dont know but its a lota few grains a day i should think i cant give you precise measurements and i wouldnt if i could you would rather not know perhaps you are right he admitted i wont ask again when the matter comes to court who is likely to testify on the thefts only fermin thorpe willinglyor at least not willingly but for the prosecution she amended hes going to hate having to say that anything went missing from his hospital he wont know whether to make light of it and risk being thought trying to cover it up or to condemn it and be seen on the side of the law all quivering with outrage at the iniquity of nurses either way hell be furious at being caught up in it at all is he not likely to defend one of his staff the look in her face was eloquent dismissal of any such prospect i see he concluded and the apothecary phillips hell cover all he caneven to risking his own safety but theres only so much he can do i see i will speak with a few of the other nurses if i may and perhaps mr phillips then i shall go and see sergeant robb it was early evening by the time rathbone had made as thorough an examination of the hospital routine as he wished to and had come to the regrettable conclusion that it required considerable forethought and some skill and nerve to steal medicines on a regular basis the apothecary was very careful in spite of his unkempt appearance and erratic sense of the absurd better opportunities occurred when a junior doctor was hurried confused by a case he did not understand or simply a little careless rathbone formed the opinion that in all probability phillips was perfectly aware of what cleo had been doing and why and had either deliberately connived at it or at the very least had turned a blind eye against all his training he found himself admiring the man for it and quite intentionally ceased looking for evidence to support his theory consequently it was after seven oclock by the time he went looking for sergeant robb and was obliged to ask for his address at home in order to see him he found the house quite easily but in spite of michael robbs courtesy he felt an intruder a glance told him he had interrupted the care of the old man who sat in the chair in the center of the room his white hair brushed back off his brow his broad shoulders hunched forward over a hollow chest his face was pale except for two spots of color on his cheeks the sight of him gave a passionate and human reality to the work cleo anderson was prepared to risk so much for rathbone was startled to find himself filled with anger at the situation at his own helplessness to affect it and at the world for not knowing and not caring it was with difficulty that he answered michael robb in a level voice good evening sergeant i am sorry to intrude into your home and at such an uncivil hour if i could have found you at the police station i would have what can i do for you sir oliver michael asked he was courteous but wary rathbone was of both a class and a profession he was unused to dealing with except in court where the duty of their offices prescribed the behavior for both of them he was acutely conscious of his grandfather sitting tired and hungry waiting to be assisted but he was by nature as well as occupation a gentlemannered man i have undertaken to defend mrs anderson against the charge of murder rathbone replied with a faint selfdeprecating smile he could not pretend to anyone he hoped for much success and he did not wish robb to think him a fool the question of theft is another matter im sorry michael said and there was sincerity in his face as well as his voice took no pleasure in charging her but i cant withdraw it i understand that it provides the motive for the murder of treadwell are you talking about cleo anderson the old man interrupted looking from one to the other of them michaels face tightened and he shot rathbone a look of reproach yes grandpapa rathbone had the strong impression that if michael could have escaped with a lie about it he would have done so to protect the old man from knowledge which could only hurt had he any knowledge how much he also was compromised did he guess the debt he owed cleo anderson the old man looked at rathbone and youre going to defend her young man he regarded rathbone up and down from his beautifully made boots and tailored trousers to his coat and silk cravat and whats an officertype gentleman with a title an all doing defending a woman like mrs anderson who int got two pence to rub together he cared about cleo too much to be in awe of anyone his faded eyes met rathbones without a flicker i dont want payment mr robb rathbone answered i undertook it as a favor to a friend mrs monk i believe you know her he saw the flash of recognition and of pleasure in the old mans face and felt a warmth within himself and i am continuing out of regard for mrs anderson herself now that i have met her michael was looking at him with anxiety rathbone knew what he feared perhaps better than he did himself he feared the same thing and even more keenly he did not have to look at the cabinet shelf in the far corner to be aware of the medicines that first cleo had brought and now he was terrified hester would continue to bring there was no point in asking her not to and he was in no position to forbid herhe doubted even monk would succeed in that altogether it would be wiser not to try it would provoke a quarrel and waste time and energy they all needed to address the problem rather than fight each other the chances of success in dissuading hester in his opinion did not exist he preferred for legal reasons as well as his own fastvanishing peace of mind not to know what was in that cabinet or how it got there michael half glanced at the cabinet then averted his gaze if the thought came to his mind he forced it away just now he was too torn by his needs to allow himself to think it so youre going to stand up an speak for her the old man asked rathbone yes i am rathbone replied the elder robb screwed up his face his voice was hoarse whispering what can you do for her young man be honest with me rathbone was candid i dont know i believe she took the medicines i dont believe she murdered treadwell even though he was blackmailing her i think there is something of great importance that we have not imagined and i am going to try to find out what it is that why you came to speak to michael yes then youd best get on with it i can wait for me supper he turned to his grandson you help this fellow we can eat later thank you rathbone acknowledged the gesture but i should feel more comfortable if you were to continue as you would have i think i passed a pie seller on the corner about a hundred yards away would you allow me to fetch us one each and then we can eat and discuss at the same time michael hesitated only a moment glancing at the old man and seeing his flash of pleasure at the prospect then he accepted rathbone returned with the three best pies he could purchase wrapped in newspaper and kept hot and they ate together with mugs of tea michael was the police officer in charge and it was his duty to gather evidence and to present it in court a few years earlier he would also have risked being sued for false arrest had the case failed not as witness for the crown but in a personal capacity and faced jail himself could he not pay the fine even so he seemed as keen as his grandfather to find any mitigating evidence he could for cleo anderson old john robb was convinced that if she had killed treadwell then he had thoroughly deserved it and if the law condemned her then the law was wrong and should be overturned his faith that rathbone could do that was fueled more by hope than realism michael did not argue with his grandfather his desire to protect him from more pain was so evident rathbone was greatly moved by it nevertheless when he left as dusk was falling he had learned nothing that was of help to him everything simply confirmed what he already knew from hester he walked briskly along the footpath in the warm evening air the smells of the day sharp around him horse manure dry grass and dust from the heath now and then the delicacy of meat and onions or the sharpness of peppermint from one peddler or the other there was the sound of a barrel organ playing a popular song in the distance and children shouting he hailed the first hansom that passed him and gave the driver his address then instantly changed his mind and directed him instead to his fathers home in primrose hill it was almost dark when he arrived he walked up the familiar path with a sense of anticipation even though he had taken no steps to ensure that his father was home let alone that it was convenient for him to call the sweetness of mown grass and deep shadow engulfed him and a snare of honeysuckle so sharp it caught in his throat almost like a taste as he walked around the house and across the lawn to the french doors he saw that the study light was on henry rathbone had not bothered to draw the curtains and oliver could see him sitting in the armchair henry was reading and did not hear the silent footsteps or notice the shadow his legs were crossed and he was sucking on his pipestem though as usual the pipe itself had gone out oliver tapped on the glass henry looked up then as he recognized his son his lean face filled with pleasure and he beckoned him in oliver felt the ease of familiarity wash over him like a warmth unreasonably some of his helplessness left him although he had not even begun to explain the problem let alone address it he sat down in the big chair opposite his fathers leaning back comfortably for a few moments neither of them spoke henry continued to suck on his empty pipe outside in the darkness a nightbird called and the branches of the honeysuckle with its trumpetshaped flowers waved in the slight wind a moth banged against the glass i have a new case oliver said at length i cant possibly win it henry took his pipe out of his mouth then you must have had a good reason for taking it or at least one that appeared good at the time i dont think it was a good one oliver was pedantic as his nature inclined he had learned exactness from henry and he never measured what he said to him it was part of the basis of their friendship it was compelling they are not the same henry smiled not in the slightest he agreed monk asked me to oliver added henry nodded there was a moral imperative oliver said justifying the choice he did not want his father to think it was because of monk still less because of hester i see are you going to tell me what it is of course oliver moved and crossed his legs comfortably he gave a succinct outline of the cases against both cleo anderson and miriam gardiner then he waited while henry sat deep in thought for several moments outside it was now completely dark except for the patch of luminous moonlight on the grass just short of the old apple tree at the end of the lawn and you assume that this woman cleo anderson did not kill the coachman henry said at last even in a manner for which there might be some mitigating circumstancesor possibly a struggle in which he died accidentally oliver thought for a moment before answering the truth was that that was exactly what he had accepted cleo had said she was not present and he had believed her he still did yes yes i am assuming that he agreed she never denied taking the medicines i have no proof of exactly how she did it or any of the circumstances i have deliberately avoided finding them henry made no comment how is monk involved he asked instead rathbone explained and hester henry asked his voice gentle oliver had not forgotten how fond his father was of hester nor his unspoken desire that oliver should marry her he sometimes feared hesters regard for him was at least in part the affection she had for henry and the desire to belong to a family in which she could know the safety her own had not given her her father had shot himself after a financial disgrace visited upon him at the end of the crimean wr by a man who had traded upon their friendship in order to cheat hesters mother had died shortly afterwards largely of grief hester had spoken of it only once unless she had done so more often to henry when oliver was not there perhaps needing to share the burden this was a topic of conversation he was dreading he had deliberately avoided it as long as possible even to the extent of not coming to primrose hill but meeting his father in the city where private conversations were too liable to interruption now it could no longer be deferred hester seems very well he answered expressionlessly at least he thought he had but judging by henrys face perhaps he deluded himself of course she is deeply concerned for this nurse both personally and in principle he added feeling the warmth rush up his cheeks henry nodded i can imagine that she is consumed with her usual fire he did not say anything about olivers motives for accepting what seemed a hopeless case he was the only person who induced oliver to make explanations of himself where none had been asked for it matters oliver said urgently leaning forward a little he looked at henry at his lean and slightly stooped form his hair very gray and imagined what he would feel if he had been a soldier or a sailor instead of a mathematician if he were broken in body bewildered and alone unable to afford the care he needed stripped of the dignity of old age and left only with its helplessness it was so painful it caught his breath now the battle was for john robb for henry for all those affected by injury and age or who would be in time to come it matters far more than any one person he said passionately more than cleo anderson or even than hester or winning for its own sake if we allow this injustice without doing all we can against it what are we worth henry regarded him gravely all the humor gone from his eyes very little he said quietly but emotion will not win for you oliver it is an excellent driving force the best and it will keep your courage high anger at injustice has righted more wrongs than most other things and it is one of the great creative forces in a civilized society he shook his head but in order not to replace one enemy with another albeit innocently intended you must use your intelligence you told me that you are certain that both mrs anderson and mrs gardiner are lying to you you cannot go into court without knowing at least what the lie isand why they are telling it at the risk of their own deaths the reason must be a very powerful one indeed i know that oliver agreed and i have racked my brain to think what it could be is it the same reason for each i dont even know that henry sat thoughtfully elbows on the arms of his chair fingers steepled together i assume that you warned each of them that not only her own life but the life of the other rests upon the verdict therefore they each have a compelling reason for not telling you the truth from what you say it seems possible that mrs anderson does not know it but certainly mrs gardiner does why would a woman hang for a crime she did not commit he looked very steadily at oliver only because the alternative to her is worse what could be worse than hanging oliver asked i dont know that is what you must find out the hanging of someone you love oliver said as much to himself as to henry is lucius stourbridge guilty henry asked him i dont know oliver replied i dont know why he could kill either treadwell or his own mother treadwell is easier henry said thoughtfully the man may have threatened mrs gardiner or threatened the marriage either through mrs anderson or in some other way he was a blackmailer much is possible it is far more difficult to think of any motive for lucius to have killed his mother ive searched for one oliver admitted ive found nothing it would be extraordinary if the two murders were not connected henry pursued drawing his brows together what elements do they have in common treadwell himself and miriam gardiner oliver replied and the nature of the attacks and the unknown henry added one must always include the possibility of a factor we have not considered perhaps something outside our knowledge entirely from what you have told me so far it seems this may be the case here proceed with logic eliminate what is impossible and then examine what is left no matter how ugly it may be i have a feeling oliver that this case may stretch your compassion to its limits and require more of you than you had thought to give i am sorry i appreciate that this is not easy for you especially considering hesters involvement in it her involvement makes no difference as soon as the words were on his lips he knew that they were untrue and quite certainly that henry knew it also but it was difficult to withdraw them henry shook his head so minutely it was barely a movement at all it makes no difference to the issues oliver amended what he really meantthe aloneness the knowledge of having held something precious and having let it slip through his fingers because he would not commit his passions fully enough the regretwas all there between them unsaid henry knew him well enough that truth was not necessary and lies were not only impossible but damaging henry understood as well as he did that hester made all the difference in the world to the way he felt about it to know he would continue to fight regardless of what he himself might lose in reputation selfesteem or money henry was smiling oliver knew in that moment that he approved much as he revered the law himself and understood the dedication of a man to his chosen field to his principles that superseded any individual he also understood that to do all these things without caring was a kind of death to the heart he would rather oliver fought because he cared and lost than won with all the rewards but without belief they sat in silence for another half hour or so then oliver rose and took his leave henry strolled with him down the lawn in the darkness heavy with the scent of wet grass to look at the moonlight reflected on the leaves in the orchard then walked back up again towards the road it did not need to be said that tomorrow oliver must begin to prepare a sensible case to defend his clients and to look for whatever alternative was so hideous miriam gardiner would rather hang than have it revealed and if oliver found it where did his loyalty lie then to miriam or to the truth but after they had parted and oliver walked towards the main thoroughfare he felt a strength restored inside him a balance returned he had faced certain lies and no longer allowed them to govern him five weeks later cleo anderson and miriam gardiner sat in the dock accused of conspiracy and murder the courtroom was packed to suffocation people sitting so close to one another that when they moved in discomfort the sound of fabrics rubbing together was audible the shuffling and squeaking of boots were broken by a cough and the occasional murmur when the business of calling to order reading the charge and pleadings had been accomplished robert tobias opened for the prosecution he was a man rathbone had faced several times before and to whom he had lost as often as he had won tobias was of a fraction less than average height slender in his youth and now at sixty still supple and straightbacked he had never been handsome strictly speaking but his intelligence and the power and beauty of his voice made him remarkableand both intimidating and attractive more than one society lady had begun by flirting with him for her own entertainment and ended by caring for him more than she wished to eventually being hurt he was a widower who intended to retain his freedom to do as he chose he smiled at rathbone and called his first witness sergeant michael robb rathbone watched as robb climbed the short staircase to the witness stand and faced the court he looked unhappy and extraordinarily young he must have been in his midtwenties but he had the scrubbed and brushed look of a child sent off to sunday school and who would far rather be almost anywhere else tobias sauntered out into the middle of the open space of the floor with the jury on one side the witness ahead of him and the judge to his right high up against the wall in his magnificent seat surrounded by panels of softly gleaming wood and padded red velvet sergeant robb tobias began politely this whole case is very distressing no decent man likes to imagine two women especially when one is young and agreeable to look upon and the other is entrusted with the care of the sickhe lifted his hand very slightly towards the dockwould be capable of conspiring together to commit coldblooded murder for gain fortunately it is not your task nor mine either to determine if this is indeed what happened he turned with a graceful gesture to face the jury and gave a little bow in their direction it is the awful duty of these twelve good men and true and i do not envy them justice is a mighty weight it takes a strong man a brave man an honest man to bear it rathbone was tempted to interrupt this piece of blatant flattery but he knew tobias would be only too happy if he did he remained in his seat nodding very slightly as if he agreed tobias turned back to robb all we need from you is a simple exact account of the facts you know may we begin with the discovery of the body of james treadwell robb stood to attention rathbone wondered if it was as apparent to the jury as it was to him how much robb disliked his task would they imagine it was repugnance for the crime or would they know as he did that it was a deeper knowledge of complex tragedy right and wrong so inextricably mixed he could not single out one thread how did people judge on instinct intelligence previous knowledge and experience emotion how was evidence interpreted how often he had seen two people describe a single chain of events and draw utterly different conclusions from it robb began by talking with bare almost schoolboy simplicity of having been called out to see the dead body of a man who had apparently died of a blow to the head so you decided immediately that he was the victim of murder tobias said with surprise and evident satisfaction he barely glanced at rathbone as if he half expected to be interrupted and took it as a sign of rathbones foreknowledge of defeat that he was not robb breathed in deeply from the kind of marks on his clothes sir i didnt think hed fallen off a coach or carriage or been struck by one that maybe didnt see him in the dark very perceptive of you you judged the matter of great seriousness right from the outset death is always serious robb answered of course but murder has a gravity that accident does not it is a dark and dreadful thing a violation of our deepest moral order accident is tragic but it is mischance murder is evil robbs face was pink with respect sir i thought you said you and i were not here to judge just to establish the facts if you dont mind sir id prefer to stick to that there was a murmur around the court rathbone allowed himself to smile indeed he could not help it tobias controlled his temper with grace but it cost him an effort rathbone could see it in the angle of his shoulders and the pull of the cloth in his expensive coat i stand corrected he conceded by all means let us have the bare facts will you describe this dead man that you found was he young or old in good health or ill let us see him through your eyes sergeant robb let us feel as you did when you stood on the pavement and stared down at this man so lately alive and full of hopes and dreams and so violently torn from them he spread his arms wide in invitation take us with you robb stared at him glumly never once did he lift his glance towards the two women sitting whitefaced and motionless in the dock nor did he look beyond tobias and rathbone to search the audience for other faces familiar to him monk or hester he was fairly ordinary it was difficult to tell his height lying down he had straight hair strong hands callused as if hed held reins often enough any signs of a fight tobias cut in any bruises or cuts as if he had tried to defend himself i saw none just the grazes on his handsfrom crawling i shall naturally ask the surgeon also but thank you for your observation exactly where was this poor man sergeant on the pathway between number five and number six on green man hill near hampstead heath and which way was he facing towards number five and is that where he was killed i dont think so he looked to have crawled some distance his trouser knees were all torn and muddy and his elbows in places how far can you tell no at least two or three hundred yards maybe more i see what did you do then sergeant step by step tobias drew from robb the account of finding the carriage and the horses and presuming they were connected with the dead man then he led him through monks arrival seeking someone answering the dead mans description how very interesting tobias said with triumph presumably you took this mr monk to look at your corpse yes sir and did he identify him no sir he couldnt say but he fetched two gentlemen from bayswater who said he was james treadwell who had been their coachman and the names of these gentlemen major harry stourbridge and his son mr lucius stourbridge there was a rustle of movement in the court as peoples attention was caught several straightened in their seats the same lucius stourbridge who is the son of mrs verona stourbridge and who was engaged to marry mrs miriam gardiner more movement in the gallery two women craned forward to stare at the dock yes sir robb answered and when was treadwell last seen alive and by whom reluctantly robb told of miriams flight from the garden party monks duplicity on the matter and how first monk had tracked down miriam and then how robb had himself there was nothing rathbone could do to stop him most interesting tobias said sagely and did mrs gardiner give you a satisfactory account of her flight from bayswater and any reason for this most strange behavior no sir did she tell you who had killed treadwell i assume you did ask her i did and no she did not give me any answer except to say she did not do it and did you believe her rathbone half rose to his feet the judge glanced at him tobias smiled perhaps that could be better phrased sergeant robb did you subsequently arrest mrs gardiner for the murder of james treadwell yes i did tobias raised his eyebrows but you have not charged her with it robbs face was tight and miserable shes charged with conspiracy that you should be sad about such a fearful tragedy is very proper sergeant tobias observed staring at him but you seem more than that you seem reluctant as if you do this against your will why is that sergeant robb rathbones mind raced should he object that this was irrelevant personal he had intended to use robbs high opinion of cleo his knowledge of her motives as his only weapon in mitigation now tobias had stolen it he could hardly object now and then raise it himself later even if he did so obliquely tobias himself would then object there was nothing he could do but sit quietly and try to keep his face from betraying him sergeant tobias prompted robb lifted his chin a little glaring back i am reluctant sir mrs anderson is well known in our community for going around visiting and helping the sick especially them thats old and poor night and day she did it as well as working in the hospital she couldnt have cared for them better if theyd been her own but you arrested her for murder robb clenched his jaw i had to we found evidence that treadwell was blackmailing her this time rathbone did stand up my lord yes yes the judge agreed pursing his lips mr tobias you know better than this if you have evidence present it in the proper way tobias bowed smiling he had no cause to worry and he knew it he turned back to robb in the witness stand this high regard you have for mrs anderson sergeant is it all upon local hearsay or can you substantiate it from any knowledge of your own i have it from knowledge of my own robb said wretchedly she came regular to see my grandfather who lives with me tobias nodded slowly he seemed to be weighing his words judging what to say and what to leave unsaid rathbone looked across at the faces of the jury there was one man in particular middleaged earnest who was watching tobias with what seemed to be understanding he turned to robb and there was pity clear in his face tobias did not ask if cleo had brought medicines or not it was not necessary the jury had perceived it already they would not want to see the sergeant embarrassed tobias was a superb judge of nature there was nothing rathbone could do the day proceeded while tobias drew out all the rest of the evidence piece by piece from an unwilling robb he told how at least in part by following monk he had learned of the missing medicines of cleos own poverty and that she was being blackmailed by treadwell it provided her with a motive for murder that anyone could understand only too well the jury sat somberly shaking their heads and there seemed as much pity in their faces as blame that would change when miriam became involved rathbone knew it as well as he knew darkness followed sundown but there was no protest or argument he could make tobias was precisely within all the rules and had laid his plans perfectly there was nothing for rathbone to do but endure it and hope the second day was no better robb finished his testimony and rathbone was given the opportunity to question him but there was nothing for him to ask if he remained silent he would appear to have surrendered already without even the semblance of a fight as if he had no belief in his clients and no hope for them and yet tobias had touched on every aspect of robbs knowledge of the case and there was nothing to challenge everything he had said was true and not open to kinder or more favorable interpretation to have him repeat it would not only look ineffectual it would reinforce it in the jurys minds he rose to his feet thank you my lord but mr tobias has asked of sergeant robb everything that i would have it would be selfindulgent of me to waste the courts time asking the sergeant to repeat it for me he sat down again tobias smiled the judge nodded to him unhappily he seemed to find the case distressing and looked as if he would very much rather have had someone else there in his place but he would see justice done he had spent his life in this cause tobias called the minister from the church in hampstead a genial man who looked uncomfortable in such surroundings but gave his evidence with conviction he had known cleo anderson for thirty years he had had no idea she had committed any crime whatsoever and found this news difficult to comprehend he apologized for expressing such bewilderment however human frailty was his field of experience tobias sympathized with him and how long have you known miriam gardiner he asked since she first came to hampstead the vicar replied then under tobiass gentle encouragement he told the story of miriams first appearance in acute distress at about thirteen years old how cleo had taken her in and cared for her while seeking her family this had proved impossible and miriam had remained with cleo until her marriage to mr gardiner a moment tobias interrupted him could you describe mr gardiner for us please his age his appearance his social and financial standing the vicar looked a trifle startled rathbone was not he knew exactly what tobias was doing establishing a pattern of cleos and miriams loyalty to each other of miriams marrying a man with a prosperous business and then sharing her good fortune with her original benefactress who had become as a mother to her he did it extremely well painting a picture of the woman and child struggling in considerable hardship their closeness to one another the happiness of miriam on finding a worthy man albeit older than herself but gentle and apparently devoted to her it had not been a great romance but a good stable marriageand certainly all that a girl in miriams position might have hoped for a love match with a man her own age and class would not have brought her much material status or security tobias made his point well and delicately again there was nothing whatever rathbone could call into question had miriam shared her new good fortune with cleo anderson naturally the vicar replied what loving daughter would not just so tobias agreed and let the matter rest when the court was adjourned for the day rathbone went immediately to see miriam she was alone in the police cells her face drawn her eyes dark she did not ask him why he had not crossexamined and her silence made it harder for him he had no idea if she had even hoped for anything or how much she understood it was so easy when he was accustomed to the flow of a trial and its hidden meanings to assume that others were as aware he would have liked to allow her the mercy of remaining unaware of how serious her situation was but he could not afford to he drew in his breath to ask her the usual question as to her feelings or to offer some words of encouragement true or not but they would be empty and a waste of precious time and emotion it would make almost a greater division between them if that was possible honesty his honesty was all they had mrs gardiner you must tell me the truth i was silent today because i have no weapon to use against tobias he knows it but if make a show of fighting him and lose then the jury will know it as well now they think i am merely biding my time but i am walking blindly i dont know what he may know that i dont or what he may discoverwhich is worse she turned half away from him nothing there is nothing he can discover he can discover who killed james treadwell he said sharply the time for any consideration of feeling was past the rope was already overshadowing not only her but cleo also she turned slowly to look at him i doubt that sir oliver they would not believe it even if i were to tell them and i wont believe me it would cause far greater injury than it would ever heal i have no proof and all the evidence you have as you have said is against me the cells were warm even stuffy but he felt chilled in spite of it it is my task to make them believe it he feared even as he said it that she had closed her mind and was not listening to him at least allow me to try he was sounding desperate he could hear it in the stridency of his voice i am sorry you dont believe me she said softly but it is true that it would cause more pain than any good it would do at least accept that i have thought long and very hard about it before i have made this decision i do understand that i will hang i have no delusion that some miracle is going to save me and you have not lied to me or given me any false sense of comfort for that i thank you her gratitude was like a rebuff reminding him of how little he had actually done he was going to be no more than a figurehead barely fulfilling the requirements of the law that she be represented the prosecution need not have called in tobias the merest junior could have presented this case and beaten him he found he was shaking his hands clenched tight it is not only you who will hangcleo anderson will as well her voice choked i know but what can i do she looked at him her eyes swimming with tears i will testify that i was there and that it was not she who killed him if you want but who would believe me they think we are conspirators anyway they expect me to defend her i cant prove she wasnt there and i cant prove he wasnt blackmailing her or that she didnt take the medicines she did what she said was true someone killed treadwell he picked his words carefully trying to hurt her enough to make her tell him at last if it was not either you or cleo the only person i can think of that you would die to defend is lucius stourbridge her eyes widened and the last vestige of color fled from her face she was too horrified to respond if you will hang for him he went on that is your choice but is he really worth cleo andersons life as well does she deserve that from you she swung around to face him her eyes blazing her lips drawn back in a snarl of such ferocity he was almost afraid of her small as she was and imprisoned in this police cell lucius had nothing to do with it i am not defending treadwells murderer if i could see him hang i would tie the rope with my own hands and pull the trapdoor and watch him drop she took a deep gasping breath i cant god help me there is nothingnothing i can do now go away and leave me at least to solitude if not to peace other questions beat in his mind but his fury and his despair robbed him of the words he longed to be able to help her not to increase his own reputation or to defend his honor but simply to ease the pain he could see and even feel as he watched her she was only a yard away from him and yet an abyss existed between what she experienced and what he understood he had no idea at all how he could cross that space they could have been in separate countries he did not even know what else he felt anger fear that she was guilty fear that she was not and he would fail her and she would be destroyed by the wheels of the law he was supposed to guide or by pity even a kind of admiration because quite without reason he believed there was something noble in her something beautiful and strong he left walking out of the cells blind to the heat of the late afternoon and the passersby the chatter of voices wheels hooves all the clamor of everyday living he hailed a cab and gave the driver monks address in fitzroy street he barely spared thought to how little he wanted to go into the house that hester shared with monk it seemed secondary now a wound to deal with at another time i pleaded with her he said pacing back and forth in the front room where monk received clients monk was standing by the mantelpiece even though the fire was unlit the evening being far too mild to require one hester was sitting upright on the edge of the big armchair staring at him her face furrowed in concentration but she knows she will hang and still refuses to tell me who killed treadwell he threw his arms wide almost banging against the high back of the other chair lucius stourbridge monk said unhappily he is the only one she would hang forapart from cleo no it isnt rathbone said quickly i assumed that also she denied it with furyat me not at whoever did kill treadwell she said she would willingly hang him herself if she could but no one would believe her and she would not tell me any more monk stared at him in bewilderment rathbone wanted an answer above all things at this moment but it was a very small satisfaction to see monk just as confused as he was they both looked at hester that leaves either harry stourbridge or aiden campbell she said thoughtfully i suppose treadwell could have been blackmailing harry stourbridge he had been in the house for several years he drove the carriage maybe major stourbridge went somewhere or did something he would pay to hide what about the brother campbell rathbone asked monk shook his head unlikely he lives in wiltshire somewhere only came up for the engagement party i did check and as far as the other servants knew he barely saw treadwell he had his own carriage and driver and no one ever saw him go anywhere near the mews while he was staying there and treadwell never went to wiltshire in his life and as for campbells killing mrs stourbridge they were very close everyone agreed on that had been ever since they were children even close siblings can quarrel rathbone pointed out of course monk agreed a touch sharply staring down at the polished fender where his foot was resting but no one with enough coldblooded nerve to murder rather than pay blackmail is going to kill the sister who is his only link with a fortune the size of the stourbridges now she is dead he has no claim at all he is not especially close to either harry or lucius they are friendly enough but they will not continue veronas generosity another blind alley hester bit her lip then we must find out if it was major stourbridge however unpleasant if that is the truth we should know it it would make sense rathbone admitted pushing his hands into his pockets and taking them out again immediately he had been taught not to put his hands in his pockets in boyhood because it looked casual and pulled his clothes out of shape he turned to monk yes monk agreed not to the likelihood but to accepting the task before rathbone could ask him i should have pursued it before i didnt look at the stourbridges either ofthem i dont know what you can find in a day or two rathbone said wretchedly im going in with nothing i have no other reasonable suspect to offer the jury only person or persons unknown nobodys going to believe that when cleo and miriam have perfect motives and every appearance of guilt they may be guilty monk reminded him or one of them may perhaps in conspiracy with someone else in the stourbridge household rathbone said with some sarcasm that has to be miriam and why for the love of heaven i dont know monk said angrily but there is obviously some critical feature about the whole story that we havent foundeven if it is only the reason both women would rather hang than tell the truth wed better damned well discover what it is hester looked from monk to rathbone how long can you prolong the trial oliver we seem to spend our time asking him to sing songs while we scramble to find something vital monk said bitterly ill start tomorrow morning as soon as its light but i dont even know where to look what can i do to help hester asked more to rathbone than to monk i wish i knew the lawyer confessed cleo admits to taking the medicines there is nothing we can do to mitigate that except show how she used them and we already have all the witnesses we need for that we have dozens of men and women to swear to her diligence compassion dedication sobriety and honesty in all respects except that of stealing medicines from the hospital we even have people who will swear she was chaste modest and clean it will achieve nothing she was still paying treadwell blackmail money and he had all but bled her dry the only decent meals she ate were those given her either at the hospital or by the people she visited she even dressed in castoff clothes left her by the dead hester sat silently steeped in misery i must go home rathbone said at last perhaps a good night of sleep will clear my mind sufficiently to think of something he bade them goodnight and left acutely conscious of loneliness he would lie by himself in his smooth linen sheets monk would lie with hester in his arms the clear moonlit night held no magic for him tobias was in an expansive mood when he called his first witness the next day but he was careful not to exaggerate his manner he was too clever to alienate a jury by seeming to gloat over his triumph although rathbone sitting at his table thought his care unnecessary as things were going at present and from all future prospect tobias could hardly lose whatever he did neither hester nor monk was in the court nor was callandra daviot all of the stourbridge family had yet to testify and therefore were forbidden to be present in case anything they heard should influence what they themselves would say tobiass first witness was the stourbridges groom he took great care to establish his exact position in the household and his sofar blameless reputation he left no avenue however small for rathbone to call into question either his honesty or his power of observation rathbone was quite satisfied that he should do so he had no useful argument to make and no desire to try to blacken the mans character it was always a bad exercise in that it offended the jurors to malign a person who was no more than a witness and in no way involved in a crime and it had the great advantageindeed at the moment the only advantagein that it took time all that he showed by it unquestionably was that treadwell had on a number of occasions driven miriam from bayswater back to her home in hampstead or had collected her he had also once or twice delivered messages or gifts from lucius to her in the early days of the courtship before lucius himself had done so undoubtedly treadwell knew her home and had spent time in the area next tobias called the keeper of the local inn the jack straws castle inn on the corner of north end hill and spaniards road who swore that treadwell had stopped there on more than a few occasions had a pint of ale and played darts or dominoes gambled a little and struck up casual conversation with the locals yes he had seemed to ask a lot of questions at the time the landlord had taken it for concern for his employer who was courting a woman who lived in the area the landlord of the bull and bush farther up on golders hill said much the same as did two locals from the hare and hounds a short walk farther along there he had asked more particularly about miriam gardiner and cleo anderson yes he was free with his money as if he knew there would be more where that had come from what sort of questions did he ask tobias enquired innocently about her general reputation the witness replied was she honest sober that kind of thing and chaste tobias asked yesthat too did you not think that impertinent of the coachman yes i did when i caught him at it i told him in no uncertain terms that mrs gardiner was as good a woman as hed be likely to find in all hampsteadand a damn sight too good for the likes of him he glanced at the judge beggin yer pardon me lud did he explain why he asked such questions never saw him again the man said with satisfaction he glanced up at the dock and gave both women a deliberate smile miriam attempted to return it but it was a ghost on her ashen face cleo nodded to him very slightly merely the acknowledgment courtesy demanded it was a small gesture but kindly meant you would be glad to see mrs gardiner happily married again after losing her first husband so young tobias observed conversationally i was glad and thats the truth so were everyone else as knew er did you know the late mr gardiner well knew im in passing like a very decent sort o gent indeed but quite a lot older than his wifehis widow the mans face darkened what are you tryin ter say tobias shrugged what did james treadwell try to say nothing now the man was plainly angry you did not like him tobias pressed i did not no love for blackmailers no i avent nor as any man fit ter walk an breathe gods good air filth they are tobias nodded a feeling shared by many he glanced up at the dock then back to the witness box rathbone knew perfectly well what he was doing but he was helpless to stop him of course tobias smiled deprecatingly treadwell may have been asking his questions about mrs gardiner in loyal interest of his employer mr stourbridge in order to prevent him from making an unfortunate marriage did that possibility occur to you it may not have been for purposes of blackmail at all rathbone stood up at last my lord the witness is not in a position to know why treadwell asked questions and his opinion is surely irrelevant unless mr tobias is implying he may have had some part in treadwells death there was a sharp stir in the courtroom and one of the jurors jerked up his head quite the judge agreed mr tobias do not imperil your case by wandering too far afield i am sure your point has already been taken james treadwell asked questions in the neighborhood regarding mrs gardiners character and reputation is that all you wish us to know for the moment my lord tobias thanked his witness and turned invitingly to rathbone again there was nothing for him to ask the witness had already made it plain he admired miriam and was partisan in her favor as far as he was concerned treadwell had met with a fate he deserved it would not help either miriam or cleo to hear him say so again i have nothing to ask this witness rathbone said tobias proceeded to call the stourbridges servants to tell their account of the day of the party and miriams stillunexplained departure with treadwell the parlormaid had seen it all and told of it simply and obviously with great unhappiness at last rathbone had something to ask miss pembroke he said with a slight smile moving into the center of the floor and looking up at her where she stood high in the witness stand you have told very clearly what you saw you must have had a view of mrs gardiner with no one blocking your way yes sir i did you said she seemed about to faint as if she had suffered a great shock and then after she had recovered herself she turned and ran even fled from the garden towards the stables is that correct yes sir the judge frowned rathbone hurried on before he should be cautioned to come to the point did anyone speak to her pass her anything you mean a glass sir i didnt see no one no i meant rather more like a message something to account for her shock and from what you describe even terror no sir no one came that close to her and i dont think she had a glass you are not certain about the glass but you are sure no one spoke to her or passed her anything yes i am have you any idea what caused her to run away tobias rose no the judge said to him bluntly miss pembroke is an observant girl she may very well know what happened it has been my experience that servants frequently know a good deal more than some of us would believe or wish to believe he turned to the witness stand do you know what caused mrs gardiners flight miss pembroke if you do this is the appropriate time and place to say so whether it was a confidence or not no sir i dont know an thats the truth but i never seen anyone look as dreadful as she did that day she looked like shed seen the living dead she did do you know where treadwell was during the party rathbone asked in the stables sir same as always so mrs gardiner went to himhe did not come to her must be thank you that is all i have to ask you but not all i have tobias cut in quickly striding forward from his table you were on the lawn mixing with the guests in your capacity as parlormaid were you not yes sir i were carrying a tray of lemonade parkin had the champagne is it easy to carry a tray loaded with glasses its all right when youre used to it gets heavy and you offered them to those guests whose glasses were empty yes sir so you were not watching mrs gardiner all the time no sir naturally could she have received some message either in words or on paper that you were unaware of i suppose she could is it possible miss pembroke that this was the best time for her to catch treadwell alone and with no duties or responsibilities which would prevent him from driving her from cleveland square is it possible miss pembroke that she knew the working of the household sufficiently well that she was aware she would find treadwell in the mews with the carriage available and had planned in advance to meet him there and drive to a lonely place where she imagined they could do as they pleased together unobserved and where she intendedwith the help of her foster motherto get rid once and for all of the man who was blackmailing them both rathbone shot to his feet but the protest died on his lips tobias shrugged i only ask if its possible he said reasonably miss pembroke is an observant young woman she may know i dont she protested i dont know what happened i swear your loquacity seems to have ended in confusion the judge said acidly to tobias he turned to the jury you will note that the question has gone unanswered and draw your own conclusions sir oliver have you anything to add oliver had not tobias was unstoppable his rich voice seemed to fill the court and there was hardly an eye which was not upon him he called the ladys maid who had seen miriam in verona stourbridges room and drew from her a highly damaging account of miriams trying on the jewelry and apparently having read the diary do you know what is in the diary tobias asked the girls eyes widened in horror no sir i do not her tone carried bitter resentment that he should suggest such a thing of course not he agreed smoothly one does not read another persons private writings i wondered perhaps if mrs stourbridge had confided in you ladies can become extremely close to their maids she was considerably mollified well well i know she put in her feelings about things she used to go back and read again some from years ago when she was in egypt she did that just the day before she died poor lady she looked tearful and tobias gave her a moment or two to compose herself againand to allow the jury to gather the full import of what had been saidbefore he continued he then went on to elicit a picture of miriam as gentle charming biddable struggling to fit into a household with a great deal higher social status than she was accustomed to and unquestionably a great deal more money it was a portrait quite innocent and touching until finally he turned to the jury a lovely woman striving to better herself he said with a smile for the sake of the man she lovesand met by chance out walking on hampstead heath his face darkened his arms relaxed until his shoulders were almost slumped or a clever greedy woman blessed with a pretty face ensnaring a younger man unworldlywise and doing everything she could suppressing her own temper and will to charm him into a marriage which would give her and her foster mother a life of wealth they could never have attained in their own station he barely paused for breath or to give rathbone the chance to object an innocent woman caught in a dreadful web of circumstances or a conniving woman overtaken by an equally coldblooded and greedy coachman who saw his chance to profit from her coming fortune but had fatally miscalculated her ruthlessnessand thus met not with payment for his silence as to her past perhaps their past relationship with each other perhaps he was even the means of their meetingfar other than by chance instead he met with violent death in the darkness under the trees of hampstead heath rathbone raised his voice cutting across him scathingly and without reference to the judge treadwell certainly seems to have been a villain but neither you nor i have proved him a fool why in heavens name would he threaten to expose miriam gardiners pastwhich neither you nor i have found lacking in virtue of any kind before she had married into the stourbridge family he spread his hands as if in bewilderment she had no money to pay him anything surely he would have waited until after the weddingindeed done everything in his power to make sure it took place he became sarcastic if as you suggest he even helped engineer the meeting between mr stourbridge and mrs gardiner then it strains the bonds of credibility that he would sabotage his own work just as it was about to come to fruition his point was valid but it did not carry the emotional weight of tobiass accusation the damage had been done the jurys minds were filled with the image of a scheming and duplicitous woman manipulating a discarded lover into a position where she could strike him over the head and leave his murdered body on the heath was it chance or was it treadwells dying attempt to implicate his murderers that he used the last of his strength to crawl to the footpath outside cleo andersons door tobias demanded his voice ringing with outrage and pity gentlemen i leave it to you the court adjourned with miriam and cleo all but convicted already rathbone paced the floor of his rooms resisting the temptation to call monk and see if he had made any progress so many times they had faced together cases that seemed impossible he could list them all in his mind but in this one he had no weapons at all and he did not even know what he believed himself he still was not prepared to accept that either cleo or miriam was guilty let alone both but there was very little else that made senseexcept lucius or harry stourbridge and if that were so no wonder miriam looked crushed beyond imagining any solution or that even rathbone could convince the court of the truth it all depended on monks finding somethingif he even knew where to lookand collecting enough evidence to prove it and on rathbones being able to prolong the case another three days at the very outside two days seemed more likely he spent the evening thinking of tactics to give monk more time every trick of human nature or legal expertise it was all profoundly unpromising tobias called harry stourbridge as his first witness of the morning he treated him with great deference and sympathy not only for the loss of his wife but for the disillusion he had suffered in miriam many seats were empty in the court the case had lost much of its interest for the public they believed they knew the answer it was common garden greed a pretty woman ambitious to improve herself by the ageold means of marrying well it was no longer scandalous simply sordid it was a beautiful day the sun was shining and there were better things to do than sit inside listening to what could be accurately predicted harry stourbridge looked ten years older than the age rathbone knew him to be he was a man walking in a nightmare to which he could see no end i am sorry to force you to endure this tobias said gently i will keep it as brief as possible and i am sure sir oliver will do the same please do not allow loyalty or compassion to direct your answers this is a time and place when nothing but the truth will serve stourbridge said nothing he stood like an officer in front of a courtmartial standing stiffly to attention facing forward head high we have already heard sufficient about the croquet party from which mrs gardiner fled i shall not trouble you to repeat it i turn your attention instead to the tragic death of mrs stourbridge i need to ask you something about the relationship between your wife and mrs gardiner believe me i would not do it if there were any way in which i could avoid it still stourbridge made no reply it seemed to unnerve tobias very slightly rathbone saw him shift his weight a little and straighten his jacket how did mrs stourbridge regard mrs gardiner when your son first brought her to cleveland square she thought her a very pleasant young woman and when your son informed you of his intention to marry her we were both happy that he had found a woman whom he loved and whom we believed to return his feelings wholeheartedly tobias pursed his lips you did not regret the fact that she was markedly older than himself and from a somewhat different social background how did you imagine she would be regarded by your friends how would she in time manage to be lady of your very considerable properties in yorkshire did those things not concern your wife of course stourbridge admitted but when we had known mrs gardiner for a few weeks we were of the opinion that she would manage very well she has a natural grace which would carry her through and she and lucius so obviously loved each other that that gave us much happiness and the question of grandchildren an heir to the house and the lands which are i believe entailed without an heir they pass laterally to your brother and to his heirs is that not so it is he took a deep breath hands still by his sides as if he were on parade any marriage may fail to provide an heir one may only hope i do not believe in governing the choice of wife for my son i would rather he were happy than produced a dozen children with a woman he could not love and share his heart with as well as his bed and did mrs stourbridge feel the same tobias asked many women care intensely about grandchildren it is a deep need he left it hanging in the air unfinished for the jury to conclude for themselves i do not believe my wife felt that way stourbridge replied wretchedly rathbone gained the impression there was far more unsaid behind his words but he was a private man loathing this much exposure of his life he would add nothing he was not forced to step by step tobias took him through miriams visits to cleveland square her demeanor on each of them her charm and her eagerness to learn it was obvious to all that harry stourbridge had liked her without shadow of equivocation he was shattered by her betrayal not only for his son but for himself he seemed still unable to grasp it throughout harry stourbridges evidence rathbone glanced every now and again up at the dock and saw the pain in miriams face she was a person enduring torture from which there was no escape she had to sit still and abide it in silence never once did he catch a member of the jury looking at either miriam or cleo they were completely absorbed in stourbridges ordeal as he studied them he saw in each both pity and respect once or twice there was even a sense of identification as if they could put themselves in his place and would have acted as he had felt as he had rathbone wondered in passing if any of them were widowers themselves or had sons who had fallen in love or married less than fortunately he could not choose jurors they had to be householders of a certain wealth and standing and of course men it had never been possible he could have had people who would identify with miriam or cleo so much for a jury of ones peers in the afternoon tobias quietly and with dignity declined to call lucius stourbridge to the stand it was an ordeal he did not need to inflict upon a young man already wounded almost beyond bearing the jury nodded in respect they would not have forgiven it of him if he had rathbone would have done the same and for the same reasons tobias called the last witness aiden campbell his evidence was given quietly with restraint and candor yes she had great charm he said sadly i believe everyone in the household liked her including your sister mrs stourbridge the question remained unanswered campbell looked very pale his skin was bleached of color and there were shadows like bruises under his eyes he stood straight in the witness stand but he was shaking very slightly and every now and again he had to stop and clear his throat it was apparent to everyone in the courtroom that he was a man laboring under profound emotion and close to losing control of himself tobias apologized again and again for obliging him to relive experiences which had to be deeply distressing for him i understand campbell said biting his lip justice requires that we follow this to its bitter end i trust you will do it as speedily as you may of course tobias agreed may we proceed to the days immediately leading to your sisters death campbell told them in as few words as possible without raising his voice of miriams last visit to cleveland square after her release from custody and from the charge of having murdered treadwell according to him she was in a state of shock so deep she hardly came out of her room and when she did she seemed almost to be in a trance she was civil but no more she avoided lucius as much as possible not even allowing him to comfort her over her fearful distress on cleo andersons account she was devoted to mrs anderson tobias stressed yes there was no expression in campbells face except sadness it is natural enough mrs anderson had apparently raised her as a daughter since she was twelve or thirteen she would be an ungrateful creature not to have been we respected it in her of course tobias agreed nodding please continue reluctantly campbell did so describing the dinner that evening the conversation over the table about egypt their returning and each going about their separate pursuits and mrs gardiner did not dine with you no tell us mr campbell did your sister say anything to you that evening or earlier about her feelings regarding the murder of treadwell and the accusation against mrs gardiner rathbone rose to object but he had no legal grounds indeed no moral grounds either he was obliged to sit down again in silence campbell shook his head if you are asking if i know what happened or why no i do not verona was distressed about something she was certainly not herself any of the servants will testify to that indeed they already had although of course campbell had not been in court at the time since he had not yet appeared himself i believe she had discovered something his voice grew thick emotion all but choking him it is my personal belief although i know nothing to support it that before she died she knew who had killed treadwell and exactly why i think that is why she returned alone to her room in order to consider what she should do about it he closed his eyes it was a fatal decision i wish to god she had not made it he had said very little really he had brought out no new facts and he had certainly not accused anyone and yet his testimony was damning rathbone could see it in the jurors faces there was no purpose in rathbones questioning campbell there was nothing for him to say nothing to elaborate nothing to challenge it was friday evening he had two days in which to create some kind of defense and nothing whatever with which to do itunless monk found something and there was no word from him when the court rose he considered pleading with miriam one more time and abandoned the idea it would serve no purpose whatever the truth was she had already convinced him that she would go to the gallows rather than tell it instead he went out into the september afternoon and took a hansom straight to primrose hill he did not expect his father to offer any answers he went simply for the peace of the quiet garden in which to ease the wounds of a disastrous week and to prepare his strength for the week to come which promised to be even worse while rathbone was sitting helplessly in the courtroom monk began his further investigations into the details of treadwells life he had already asked exhaustively at the stourbridges house and generally in the area around cleveland square no one had told him anything remotely helpful treadwell had been tediously ordinary he began instead in kentish town where treadwell had grown up it was a long task and he held little hope of its proving successful in time he began to fear that miriam gardiner was guilty as charged and that poor cleo anderson had been drawn into it because of her love for the girl she had rescued she had refused to recognize that beneath the charm and apparent vulnerability miriam had grown into a greedy and conniving woman who would not stop even at murder in order to get what she wanted love could be very blind no mother wanted to see evil in her child and the fact that cleo had not borne miriam would make no difference to her his earlier pity for miriam hardened to anger when he thought of the grief it would bring to cleo when she was faced with facts she could no longer deny to herself miriam may not have asked to be loved or to be believed in but she had accepted it it carried a moral responsibility and she had failed it as badly as anyone could the deception was worse than the violence he walked the streets of kentish town going from one public house to another asking questions as discreetly as the desperately short time allowed twice he was too open too hasty and earned a sharp rebuff he left and began again farther along more carefully by sundown he was exhausted his feet hurt merely to the touch he took an omnibus home monk would earn no further money in this case but he simply cared passionately to learn the truth lucius stourbridge would have continued to pay him indeed he had still implored monk to help only a week earlier but monk had refused to take anything further from him for something he was all but certain he could not accomplish the young man had lost so much already to have given him hope he could not justify would be a cruelty for which he would despise himself hester looked at his face as he came in and did not ask what he had learned her tact was so uncharacteristic it told him more of his own disappointment and how visible it was than he would have admitted on the second day he gained considerably more knowledge he came closer to hampstead and discovered a public house where they knew treadwell rather well from there he was able to trace a man to whom treadwell had lost at gambling since treadwell was dead the debt could not be collected someone ought to be responsible the man said angrily his round eyes sharp and a little bloodshot int there no law you shouldnt be able to get out of money you owe just bydyin monk looked knowledgeable well usually you would go to a mans heirs he said gravely but i dont know if treadwell had any he left it hanging as a question nah the man said in disgust answer to nobdy that one have a drink monk offered he might be wasting his time but he had no better avenue to follow ta dont mind if i do the man accepted reece he held out a hand after rubbing it on his trouser leg monk took a moment to realize it was an introduction then he grasped the hand and shook it monk he responded ow do reece said cheerfully ill ave a pint o mild ta when the pints had been ordered and bought monk pursued the conversation did he owe you a lot ill say reece took a long draft of his ale before he continued near ten pound monk was startled it was as much as a housemaid earned in six months that choked yer eh reece observed with satisfaction e played big did treadwell and lost big monk agreed he cant have lost like that often did he win as well sometimes liked ter live igh on the og e did wine women and the orses must a won sometimes i suppose but were am i gonna get ten quid you tell me that what id like to know is where treadwell got it monk said with feeling he certainly didnt earn it as a coachman wouldnt know reece said with fading interest he emptied his glass and looked at monk hopefully monk obliged coachman were e reece said thoughtfully well i guess as e ad suffink on the side then dunno wot a very ugly thought came into monks mind concerning cleo andersons theft of medicines especially morphine hester had said a considerable amount might have gone over a period of time maybe not all of it had ended in the homes of the old and ill anyone addicted to such a drug would pay a high price to obtain it it would be only too easy to understand how cleo could have sold it to pay treadwell or even have given it to him directly for him to sell the idea gave him no pleasure but he could not get rid of it he spent the rest of the day investigating treadwells offduty hours which seemed to have been quite liberal and found he had a considerable taste for selfindulgence but there appeared to be several hours once every two weeks or so which were unaccounted for and monk was driven to the conclusion that this time may have been used either for selling morphine or for further blackmail of other victims the last thing monk did late in the evening was to go and visit cleo herself telling the jailer that he was rathbones clerk he had no proof of such a position but the jailer had seen them together earlier and accepted it or possibly his compassion for cleo made him turn a blind eye monk did not care in the slightest what the reason was he took advantage of it cleo was surprised to see him but there was no light of hope in her eyes she looked haggard and exhausted she was almost unrecognizable from the woman he had met only a month or so before her cheeks were hollow her skin completely without color and she sat with her shoulders sagging under the plain dark stuff of her dress monk was caught off guard by his emotions on seeing her she stirred in him an anger and a sense of outrage at futility and injustice more passionate than he had expected if he failed in this he was going to carry the wound for a very long time perhaps always there was no time to waste in words of pity or encouragement and he knew they would be wasted because they could have no meaning do you know if treadwell was blackmailing anyone else apart from you he asked her sitting down opposite her so he could speak softly and she could hear him no why do you think they couldve killed him there was almost hope in her voice not quite she did not dare honesty forbade him to allow it enough possibility to raise a need to know how much you paid him exactly he answered i have a pretty good record of how much he spent over the last two or three months of his life if you paid him all of it then you must have been taking morphine to sell as well as to give to patients her body stiffened her eyes wide and angry i didnt and i never gave him any either we have to prove it he argued have you got any records of your pay from the hospital of all the medicine you took and the people to whom you gave it noof course i havent but you know all the patients you visited with medicine he insisted yes then dictate their names to me their addresses too and what medicine you gave them and for how long she stared at him for a moment then obeyed was this going to be worth anything or was he simply finding a way of occupying time so he could delude himself he was working to save her what could he achieve with lists who would listen or care regardless of what likelihood he could show proof was all the court would entertain in their own minds they believed cleo and miriam guilty they would have to be forced from that conviction not merely shown that there was another remote possibility cleo finished dictating the list there were eighteen names on it thank you he read it over how much do you earn at the hospital seven shillings a week she said it with some pride as if for a nurse it was a good wage he winced he knew a constable earned three times that how long do you work the question was out before he thought twelve or fifteen hours a day she replied and how much did you pay treadwell her voice was tired her shoulders slumped again five shillings a week the rage inside him was icecold filling his body sharpening his mind with a will to lash out to hurt someone so this could be undone so it would never happen again not to cleo and not to anyone but he had no one to direct the anger towards the only offender was dead already only the victim was still left to pay the price he was spending a lot more than that he said quietly his words coming between clenched teeth i need to know where it came from she shook her head i dont know he just came to me regularly and i paid him he never mentioned anyone else but he wouldnt it was on the edge of monks tongue to ask her again if she had given him any morphine to sell but he knew the answer would be the same he rose to his feet and bade her goodbye hating being able to make no promises nor even speak any words of hope at the door he hesitated wondering if he should ask her about miriam but what was there to say she looked up at him waiting in the end he had to ask could it have been miriam no she said immediately she never did anything he could have made her pay for not even to protect you he said quietly she sat perfectly still it was transparent in her face that she did not know the answer to thatbelieve possibly even certainlybut not know monk nodded i understand he knocked for the jailer to let him out he arrived home still turning the matter over and over in his mind there was another source he said to hester over the dinner table but it could have been miriam which wont help at all and if it wasnt she asked if we could show it was someone else theyd have to consider it no they wouldnt he answered quietly watching her face show her disappointment not unless we could bring that person to court and prove that he or she was somewhere near the heath that night alone weve got two days before rathbone has to begin some defense what else have we her voice rose a little in desperation nothing he admitted then lets try i cant bear to sit here not doing anything at all what do we know they worked until long after midnight noting every piece of information monk had gathered about treadwells comings and goings over the three months previous to his death when it was written on paper it was easier to see what appeared to be gaps we need to know exactly what his time off was hester said making further notes im sure there would be someone in the stourbridge household who could tell you monk thought it was probably a waste of time but he did not argue he had nothing else more useful to do he might as well follow through with the entire exercise do you know how much medicine was taken he asked then before she could deny it added or could you work it out if you wanted to no but i expect phillips could if it would help do you think it really would probably not but what better idea have we neither of them answered with the obvious thing acceptance that the charge was true perhaps it had not been with deliberate greed or for the reasons tobias was saying but the end result was all that counted ill go tomorrow to the hospital and ask phillips hester said briskly as if it mattered and ill go as well and find all the people on your list and see what medicines they have you see if you can account for that time of treadwells she stared at him very directly defying him to tell her it was useless or to give up heart he knew from the very brittleness of her stare the anger in her that she was doing it blindly against hope not with it in the morning monk left early to go out to bayswater and get the precise times that treadwell was off duty and see if he could find any indication of where else he might have been who could have paid him the huge difference between what they could account for and what he had spent he pursued it slowly and carefully to the minutest detail because he did not want to come to the end of it and have it proved to him what he already knew that it would be of no use whatever in trying to save cleo andersonor miriam gardiner either hester went straight to the hospital fortunately even though it was a saturday she knew phillips would be there usually he took only sundays off and then quite often just the morning still she had to search for over half an hour before she found him and then it was only after having asked three different medical students interrupting them in a long enthusiastic and detailed discussion of anatomy which was their present preoccupation brilliant one of them said his eyes wide were very fortunate to be here my cousin is studying in lincoln and he says they have to wait weeks for a body to dissect and all the diagrams in the world mean almost nothing compared with the real thing i know another agreed and thorpe is marvelous his explanations are always so clear probably the number of times hes done it the first retorted excuse me hester said again sharply do you know where mr phillips is phillips is he the one with red hair bit of a stammer phillips the apothecary she kept her temper with difficulty i need to speak with him the first young man frowned at her looking at her more closely now you shouldnt be looking for medicines if one of the patients is i dont want medicines she said i need to speak with mr phillips do you know where he is or not the young mans face hardened no actually i dont one of the other young men relented for whatever personal reason hes down in the morgue he answered the new assistant got taken a little faint gave him a bit of something to help hes probably still there thank you she said quickly thank you very much and she all but ran along the corridor out of the side entrance and down the steps to the cold room belowground which served to keep the bodies of the dead until the undertaker should come to perform the formalities hello mrs monk youre looking a little peaked phillips said cheerfully what can i do for you im glad i found you she turned and regarded the young man whitefaced who sat on the floor with his legs splayed out are you all right she asked him he nodded embarrassed just got a scare phillips said with a grin one o them corpses moved and young jake ere near fainted away nobody told im corpses sometimes passes wind gases dont stop son just cos youre dead jake scrambled to his feet running his hands through his hair and trying to look as if he was ready for duty again hester looked at the tables there were two bodies laid out under unbleached sheets not as many lately phillips remarked following her glance good she said nonot died here brought in for the students he corrected old thorpes in a rare fury cant get em where do they come from god knows resurrectionists he said with black humor jake was staring at him openmouthed he let out a sigh between his teeth dyer mean it he said hoarsely grave robbers like no of course i dont you daft haporth phillips said shaking his head get on with your work he turned to hester what is it mrs monk all the light vanished from his face have you seen cleo anderson is there anything we can do for er apart from hope for a miracle work for one she said bleakly she turned and led the way back up the stairs he followed close behind and when they were outside in the air he asked what she meant someone else was being blackmailed as well we are almost sure she explained stopping beside him treadwell spent a lot more money than cleo gave him or he earned hope lit in his face you mean that person could have killed him how do we find out who it was he looked at her confidently as if he had every faith she would have an answer i dont know ill settle at the moment just for proving he has to exist she looked at him very steadily if you had to no if you wanted to could you work out exactly how much medicine has gone missing in say the four months before treadwells death perhaps if i had a really good reason to he said guardedly i wouldnt know that unless i understood the need not knowing isnt going to help she told him miserably not charging her with theft wont matter if they hang her for murder his face blanched as if she had slapped him but he did not look away what good can you do he asked very quietly i really care about cleo shes worth ten of that pompous swine in his oakpaneled office he did not need to name thorpe she shared his feelings and he knew it he was watching her for an answer hoping i dont really knowmaybe not a great deal she admitted but if i know how much is missing and how much reached the patients she treated if they are pretty well the same then he got money from someone else of course theyre the same what do you think she did give it to him to sell he was indignant almost angry if i were being blackmailed out of everything i earned except about two shillings a week id be tempted to pay in kind she answered him he looked chastened his lips thinned into a hard line im glad somebody got that scheming sod he said harshly i just wish we could prove it wasnt poor cleo or come to that anyone else he was doing the same thing to how are we going to do that he looked at her expectantly tell me exactly how much medicine went over the few months before his death as nearly as you can that wont tell us who the other person isor people my husband is trying to find out where treadwell went that might lead us to them he looked at her narrowly is he any good at that very good indeed he used to be the best detective in the police force she said with pride oh whos the best now i havent the slightest idea he left then in case phillips should think him dishonest she added he resented some of the discipline he cant abide pomposity either especially when it is coupled with ignorance phillips grinned then the grin vanished and he was totally serious again ill get you a list o those things i could tell you pretty exact if it helps itll help she spent the rest of the day and into the early evening trudging from one house to the next with monks list of cleos patients and phillipss list of the missing medicines she was accustomed to seeing people who were suffering illness or injury nursing had been her profession for several years and she had seen the horror of the battlefield and the disease which had decimated the wounded afterwards she had shared the exhaustion and the fear herself and the cold and the hunger nevertheless to go into these homes bare of comfort because everything had been sold to pay for food and warmth to see the pain and too often the loneliness also was more harrowing than she had expected these men were older than the ones she had nursed in the crimea their wounds were not fresh they had earned them in different battles different wars still there was so much that was the same it hurled her back those short four years and old emotions washed over her almost to drowning time and again she saw a dignity which made her have to swallow back tears as old men struggled to hide their poverty and force their bodies disabled by age and injury to rise and offer her some hospitality she was walking in the footsteps of cleo anderson trying to give some of the same comfort and failing because she had not the means rage burned inside her also no one should have to beg for what he had more than earned she loathed asking for information about the medicine they had had nearly all of them knew that cleo was being tried for her life all hester could do was tell the truth every last man was eager to give her any help he could to open cupboards and show her powders to give her daybyday recounting of all he had had she would have given any price she could think of to be able to promise them it would save cleo but she could only offer hope and little enough of that when she arrived home at quarter past ten monk was beginning to worry about her he was standing up unable to relax in spite of his own weariness she did notice that he had taken his boots off where have you been he demanded she walked straight to him and put her head on his shoulder he closed his arms around her holding her gently laying his cheek to her brow he did not need her to explain the emotion she felt he saw it in her face and understood its wrong she said after a few minutes still holding on to him how can we do it we turn to our bravest and best when we are in danger we sacrifice so muchfathers and brothers husbands and sonsand then a decade a generation later we only want to forget whats the matter with us he did not bother to answer to talk about guilt or debt or the desire to be happy without remembering that others have purchased it at a terrible priceeven resentment and simple blindness and failure of imagination they had both said it all before what did you find she said at last straightening up and looking at him im not sure he replied do you want a cup of tea yes she went towards the kitchen but he moved ahead of her ill bring it he smiled i wasnt asking you to fetch one for meeven though ive probably walked as far as you have and to as little purpose she sat down and took off her boots as well it was a particular luxury something she would only do at home and it was still very sweet to realize this was her home she belonged there and so did he when he returned with the tea and she had taken a few sips she asked him again what he had learned a lot of treadwells time is unaccounted for he replied trying his own tea and finding it a trifle too hot he had a few unusual friends one of his gambling partners was even an undertaker and treadwell did a few odd tasks for him enough to earn him the kind of money were looking for she did not know whether she wanted the answer to be yes or no not remotely he replied just driving a wagon presumably because he was good with horses and perhaps knew the roads he probably did it as a favor because of their friendship this young man seems to have given him entry to cockfights and dog races when he wouldnt have been allowed in otherwise they even had a brothel or two in common hester shrugged it doesnt get us any further does it she tried to keep the disappointment out of her voice monk frowned thoughtfully i was wondering how treadwell ever discovered about cleo and the medicines in the first place she was about to dismiss it as something that hardly mattered now when she realized what he meant well not from miriam she said with conviction from any of cleos patients he asked how could treadwell coachman to major stourbridge in bayswater and gambler and womanizer in kentish town come to know of thefts of morphine and other medicines from a hospital on hampstead heath she stared at him steadily a first tiny stirring of excitement inside her because somewhere along the chain of events he crossed it it has to bebut where she held up her fingers ticking off each step patients fall ill and go to the hospital where cleo gets to know of them because she works there as a nurse which has nothing to do with treadwell he answered unless one of them was related to him or to someone he knew well they are all old and live within walking distance of the hospital she pointed out most of them are alone the lucky few with a son or daughter or grandchild like old john robb treadwells family was all in kentish town monk said that much i ascertained his father is dead and his mother remarried a man from hoxton and none of them have anything to do with miriam gardiner she went on so he didnt meet them driving her she held up the next finger cleo visits them in their homes and knows what they need she steals it from the hospital by the way im sure the apothecary knew but turned a blind eye hes a good man and very fond of her she smiled slightly very fond indeed he regards her as something of a saint i think she is the only person who really impresses phillips fermin thorpe certainly doesnt she recalled the scene in the morgue he even teased the new young morgue attendant that thorpe was buying his cadavers for the medical students from resurrectionists poor boy was horrified until he realized phillips was teasing him resurrectionists monk said slowly yesgrave robbers who dig up corpses and sell them to medical establishments for i know what resurrectionists are he said quickly leaning forward his eyes bright are you sure it was a joke well its not very funny she agreed with a frown but phillips is like thata bit wry i like himactually i like him very much hes one of the few people in the hospital i would trust then suddenly she realized what monk was thinking you mean oh william you think he really was buying them from resurrectionists he was the other person treadwell was blackmailing but how could treadwell know that not necessarily that he was blackmailing him he said grasping her hand in his urgency treadwell was friendly with this undertaker what could be simpler than to sell a few bodies that could have been the extra driving he was doing delivering corpses for fermin thorpeat a very nice profit to himself wonderful she breathed out with exquisite relief it was only a chink of light in the darkness but it was the very first one at least it might be enough for oliver to raise doubt she smiled with a twist and even if he isnt guilty i wouldnt mind seeing thorpe thoroughly frightened and embarrassedi wouldnt mind in the slightest im sure you wouldnt he agreed with a nod although we mustnt leap too quickly why not theres hardly time to waste i know but treadwell may not have blackmailed thorpe the money may all have come from selling the bodies then let thorpe prove it that should be interesting to watch his eyes widened very slightly you really do loathe him dont you i despise him she said fiercely he puts his own vanity before relieving the pain of those who trust him to help them she made it almost a challenge as if monk had been defending him he smiled at her im not trying to spare him anything i just want to use it to the best effect i dont know what that is yet but we will only get one chance i want to save my fire for the target that will do the most good for cleoor miriam not just the one that does the most harm to thorpe or the one that gives us the most satisfaction i see she did she had been indulging in the luxury of anger and she recognized it yes of course just dont leave it too long i wont he promised believe mewe will use it on sunday monk returned to the undertaker to pursue the details of treadwells work for him and to find proof if indeed he had taken bodies to the hampstead hospital and been handsomely paid for it if he were to use it either in court or to pressure thorpe for any other reason then he must have evidence that could not be denied or explained away hester continued with her visits to the rest of cleos patients just to conclude the list of medicines she was uncertain if it would be any use but she felt compelled to do it and regardless of anything else she wanted to go and see john robb again it was over a week since she had last been and she knew he would be almost out of morphine he was failing the pain growing worse and there was little she could do to help him she had some morphine left taken with phillipss connivance and she had bought a bottle of sherry herself it was illogical to give it to him rather than anyone else but logic had no effect on her feelings she found him alone slumped in his chair almost asleep but he roused himself when he heard her footsteps he looked paler than she had ever seen him before and his eyes more deeply sunken she had nursed too many dying men to delude herself that he had long left now and she could guess how it must tear michael robb to have to leave him alone she forced her voice to be cheerful but she could not place the barrier between them of pretending that she could not see how ill he was hello she said quietly sitting opposite him im sorry ive been away so long ive been trying to find some way of helping cleo and i think we may have succeeded she was aware as she spoke that if she embroidered the truth a little he would probably not live long enough to know he smiled and raised his head thats the best news you could have brought me girl i worry about her all the good she did and now this has to happen wish i could do something to helpbut i think maybe all i could do would make it worse he was watching her waiting for her to reply dont worry nobody will ask you she answered him she was sure the last thing the prosecution would do willingly would be to draw in the men like john robb who would indeed show that cleo had handed on the medicines because they would also show so very effectively why the sympathies of every decent man in the jury would be with cleo perhaps some of them had been in the army themselves or had fathers or brothers or sons who had their outrage at what had happened to so many old soldiers would perhaps outweigh their sense of immediate justice against the killer of a blackmailing coachman tobias would not provoke that if he could help it hester herself would be delighted if it came out into the public hearing but only if it could be managed other than at cleos expense so far she had thought of no way he looked at her closely but i was one she took those medicines forwasnt i she took them for a lot of people hester answered honestly eighteen of you altogether but you were one of her favorites she smiled just as youre mine he grinned as if she were flirting with him his pleasure was only too easy to see in spite of the tragedy of the subject they were discussing his eyes were misty but some o those medicines she took were for me werent they he pressed her yes you and others and where are you getting them now girl id sooner go without than have you in trouble too i know you would but theres no need to worry the apothecary gave me these that was stretching the truth a little but it hardly mattered ill make you a cup of tea and well sit together for a while i brought a little sherrynot from the hospital i got it myself she stood up as she said it dont need milk this timewell give it a bit of heart thatd be good he agreed then well talk a bit you tell me some o those stories about florence nightingale and how she bested those generals and got her own way you tell a good story girl ill do that she promised going over to the corner which served as kitchen pouring water into the kettle then setting it on the hob when it was boiled she made the tea putting the sherry fairly liberally into one mug and leaving the morphine on the shelf so michael would find it that evening she returned with the tea and set one mug the one with the sherry for him the one without for herself he picked up his mug and began to sip slowly so tell me about how you outwitted those generals then girl tell me the things youre doing better now because o the war an what you learned she recounted to him all sorts of bits and pieces she could remember tiny victories over bureaucracy making it as funny as possible definitely adding more color than there had been at the time he drank the tea then set down the empty mug go on he prompted i like the sound o your voice girl takes me back she tried to think of other stories to tell ones that had happy endings and perhaps she rambled a bit inventing here and there now and then he interrupted to ask a question it was warm and comfortable in the afternoon sun and she was not surprised when she looked up and saw his eyes closed it was just the sort of time to doze off certainly she was in no way offended he was still smiling at the last little victory she had recounted much added to in retrospect she stood up and went to make sure he was warm enough since the sunlight had moved around and his feet were in shadow it was only then that she noticed how very still he was there was no labored breathing no rasp of air in his damaged lungs there were tears already on her cheeks when she put her fingers to his neck and found no pulse it was ridiculous she should have been only glad for him but she was unable to stop herself from sitting down and weeping in wholehearted weariness in fear and from the loss of a friend she had come to love she had washed her face and was sitting in a chair still opposite the old man when michael robb came home in the late afternoon he walked straight in not at first sensing anything different she stood up quickly stepping between him and the old man then he saw her face and realized she had been weeping he went very pale hes gone she said gently i was heretalking to him we were telling old stories laughing a little he just went to sleep she moved aside so he could see the old mans face the shadow of a smile still on it a great peace settled over him michael knelt down beside him taking his hand i should have been here he said hoarsely im sorry im so sorry if you had stayed here all the time who could have earned the money for you both to live on she asked he knew thathe was so proud of you he would have felt terribly guilty if hed thought you were taking time away from your work because of him michael bent forward the tears spilling over his cheeks his shoulders shaking she did not know whether to go to him touch him if it would comfort or only intrude instinct told her to take him in her arms he seemed so young and alone her mind told her to let him deal with his grief in private instinct won and she sat on the floor and held him while he wept when he had passed through the first shock he stood up and went and washed his face in water from the jug then boiled the kettle again without speaking to her he made more tea is that your sherry he asked yes take what youd like he poured it generously for both of them and offered her one of the mugs they did not sit down there was only one vacant chair and neither wanted to take it thank you he said a little awkwardly i know you did it for him not for me but im still grateful he stopped wanting to say something and not knowing how to broach it she sipped the tea and waited im sorry about mrs anderson he said abruptly i know she assured him she took all the medicines for the old and ill didnt she it was not a question yes i could prove that if i had to including my grandfather that too was a statement yes she met his eyes without flinching he looked vulnerable and desperately unhappy she did it because she wanted to she believed it was the right thing to do she went on theres still morphine there now he said softly is there i will take it away in the lords namebe careful mrs monk there was real fear for her in his face no censure she smiled no need anymore will you be all right yesi will thank you she hesitated only a moment longer then turned and went outside the last of the sun was on the footpath and the street was busy on sunday evening rathbone went to fitzroy street to see monk he could stand the uncertainty no longer and he wanted to share his anxiety and feel less alone in his sense of helplessness resurrectionists he said incredulously when hester told him of their beliefs regarding treadwells supplementary income not exactly monk corrected him actually the bodies were never buried just taken straight from the undertakers to the hospital he was sitting in the large chair beside the fire the september evenings were drawing in it was not yet cold but the flames were comforting hester sat hunched forward hugging herself her face washed out of all color she had told monk of john robbs death quite simply and without regret knowing it to be a release from the bonds of a failing body but he could see very clearly in her manner that she felt the loss profoundly saves effort monk said looking across at rathbone why bury them and then have to go to the trouble and considerable risk of digging them up again if you can simply bury bricks in the first place and treadwell carried them rathbone wanted to assure himself he had understood are you cerain yes if i had to i could call enough witnesses to leave no doubt and was he blackmailing fermin thorpe monk looked rueful that i dont know certainly ive no proof and i hate to admit it but it seems unlikely why would he he was making a very nice profit in the business the last thing he would want would be to get thorpe prosecuted the truth of that was unarguable and rathbone conceded it have we learned anything that could furnish a defense i have nowhere even to begin hester stared at him miserably and shook her head no monk said wretchedly we could probably get thorpe to get rid of the charges of theftat least to drop themand i would dearly enjoy doing it but it wouldnt help with the murder we dont have anything but your skill he looked at rathbone honestly and there was a respect in his eyes which at any other time rathbone would have found very sweet to savor as it was all he could think of was that he would have given most of what he possessed if he could have been sure he was worthy of it at seven oclock on monday morning rathbone was at the door of miriams cell a sullen wardress let him in she had none of the regard or the pity for miriam that the police jailer had had for cleo the door clanged shut behind him and miriam looked up she was a shadow of her former self she looked physically bruised as if her whole body hurt there was no time to mince words i am going into battle without weapons he said simply i accept that you would rather sacrifice your own life at the end of a rope than tell me who killed treadwell and verona stourbridgebut are you quite sure you are willing to repay all cleo anderson has done for you by sacrificing hers also miriam looked as if she was going to faint she had difficulty finding her voice ive told you sir oliver even if you knew no one would believe you i could tell you everything and it would only do more harm dont you think i would do anything on earth to save cleo if i could she is the dearest person in the world to meexcept perhaps lucius and i know how much i owe her you do not need to remind me as though i were unaware if i could hang in her place i would if you can bring that about i will be forever in your debt i will confess to killing treadwellif it will help looking into her wide eyes and ashen face he believed her he had no doubt in his mind that she would die with dignity and a quiet heart if she could believe she had saved cleo that did not mean cleo was innocent in fact only that miriam loved her and perhaps that she believed the death sufficiently understandable in the light of treadwells own crimes i will do what i can he said quietly i am not sure if that is worth anything she said nothing but gave him a thin wraith of a smile the trial resumed in a halfempty court rathbone was already in his seat when he saw hester come in push her way past the court usher with a swift word to which he was still replying as she left him and come to rathbones table what is it he asked looking at her pale tense face whats happened i went to cleo this morning she whispered leaning close to him she knows miriam will hang and there is nothing you can do unless the truth is told she knows only a part of it but she cannot bear to lose miriam whomever else it hurtseven if it is lucius and miriam never forgives her what part rathbone demanded what truth does she know for gods sake hester tell me ive got nothing put cleo on the witness stand ask her how she first met miriam she thinks it is something to do with that something so terrible miriam cant or wont remember it but theres nothing to lose now thank you impulsively he leaned forward and kissed her on the cheek not giving a damn that the judge and the entire court were watching him tobias gave a cough and a smile the judge banged his gavel hester blushed fiercely but with a smile returned to her seat are you ready to proceed sir oliver the judge asked courteously yes my lord i am i call mrs cleo anderson there was a murmur of interest around the gallery and several of the jurors shifted position more from emotional discomfort than physical cleo was escorted from the dock to the witness stand she stood upright but it was obviously with difficulty and she did not look across at miriam even once in a soft unsteady voice she swore to her name and where she lived then waited with palpable anxiety for rathbone to begin rathbone hated what he was about to do but it did not deter him mrs anderson how long have you lived in your present house on green man hill quite plainly she understood the relevance of the question even though tobias evidently did not and his impatience was clear as he allowed his face to express exasperation about thirty years cleo replied so you were living there when you first met mrs gardiner rathbone asked yes it was little more than a whisper the judge leaned forward please speak up mrs anderson the jury needs to hear you im sorry sir yes i was living there how long ago was that tobias rose to his feet this is old history my lord if it will be of any assistance to sir oliver and to saving the courts time and not prolonging what can only be painful rather than merciful the crown concedes that mrs anderson took in mrs gardiner when she was little more than a child and looked after her with devotion from that day forward we do not contest it nor require any evidence to that effect thank you rathbone said with elaborate graciousness that was not my point if you are as eager as you suggest not to waste the courts time then perhaps you would consider not interrupting me until there is some good reason for it there was a titter of nervous laughter around the gallery and distinct smiles adorned the faces of at least two of the jurors a flush of temper lit tobiass face but he masked it again almost immediately rathbone turned back to cleo mrs anderson would you please tell us the circumstances of that meeting cleo spoke with a great effort it was painfully apparent that the memory was distressing to her and she recalled it only as an act of despair rathbone had very little idea why he was asking her only that hester had pressed him to and he had no other weapon to use it was a night in september the twentysecond i think it was windy but not cold she swallowed her throat was dry and she began to cough at the judges request the usher brought her a glass of water then she continued old josh wetherall from two doors down came beating on my door to say there was a young girl a child crying on the road near in hysterics he said an covered all over in blood he was beside himself with distress poor man and hadnt an idea what to do to help she took a deep breath no one moved or interrupted her even tobias was silent although his face still reflected impatience of course i went to see what i could do cleo continued anyone would but i suppose he thought i might know a bit more being a nurse and all and the child rathbone prompted cleos hands gripped the rail in front of her as if she needed its strength to hold her up josh was right she was in a terrible state would you describe her for us rathbone directed her ignoring tobias leaning forward to object we need to see it as you saw it mrs anderson she stared at him imploringly denial in her eyes in her face even in the angle of her body we need to see her as you did mrs anderson please believe me it is important he was lying he had no idea whether it meant anything or not but at least the jury were listening emotions caught at last cleo was rigid shaking she was hysterical she said very quietly the judge leaned forward to hear but he did not again request her to raise her voice no one in the body of the court moved or made the slightest sound rathbone nodded indicating she should continue ive never seen anyone so frightened in my life cleo said not to rathbone or to the court but as if she were speaking aloud what was indelibly within her she was covered in blood her eyes were staring but im not sure she saw anything at all she staggered and bumped into things and for hours she was unable to speak she just gasped and shuddered id have felt better if she could have wept again she stopped and the silence lengthened but no one moved even tobias knew better than to intrude how was she injured rathbone asked finally cleo seemed to recall her attention and looked at him as if she had just remembered he was there how was she injured rathbone repeated you said she was covered in blood and obviously she had sustained some terrible experience cleo looked embarrassed we dont know how it happened not really for days she couldnt say anything that made sense and the poor child was so terrified no one pressed her she just lay curled over in my big bed hugging herself and now and then weeping like her heart was broken and she was so frightened of any man coming near her we didnt even like to send for a doctor but the injuries rathbone asked again what about the blood cleo stared beyond him she was only wearing a big cotton nightgown there was blood everywhere right from her shoulders down she was bruised and cut yes cleo looked for the first time across at miriam and there were tears on her face desperately miriam mouthed the word no mrs anderson rathbone said sharply where did the blood come from if you are really innocent and if you believe miriam gardiner to be innocent only the truth can save you this is your last chance to tell it after the verdict is in you will face nothing but the short days and nights in a cell too shortand then the rope and at last the judgment of god tobias rose to his feet rathbone turned on him do you quarrel with the truth of that mr tobias he demanded tobias stared at him his face set and angry mr tobias the judge prompted no of course i dont tobias conceded sitting down again rathbone turned back to cleo i repeat mrs anderson where did the blood come from you are a nurse you must have some rudimentary knowledge of anatomy do not tell us that you did nothing to help this bloodsoaked terrified child except give her a clean nightshirt of course i helped her cleo sobbed the poor little mite had just given birthand she was only a child herself stillborn i reckoned it was is that what she told you she was rambling she hardly made any sense in and out of her wits she was she got a terrible fever and we werent sure we could even save her often enough women die of fever after giving birth especially if theyve had a bad time of it and she was too youngfar too young poor little thing rathbone was taking a wild guess now so far this was all tragic but it had nothing to do with the deaths of either treadwell or verona stourbridge unless of course treadwell had blackmailed miriam over the child but would lucius care would such a tragedy be enough to stop him from wanting to marry her or his family from allowing it rathbone had done her no service yet he had nothing to lose by pressing the story as far as it could go you must have asked her what happened he said grimly what did she say if nothing else the law would require some explanation what about her own family what did they do mrs anderson with this injured and hysterical child whose story made no sense to you cleos face tightened and she looked at rathbone more defiantly i didnt tell the police what was there to tell them i asked her her name of course and if she had family whod be looking for her she said there was no one and who was i to argue with that she was one of eight and her familyd placed her in service in a good house and the child rathbone had to ask what manner of man gets a twelveyearold girl with child she would have been twelve when it was conceived did he abandon her cleos face was ashen rathbone did not dare look at miriam he could not even imagine what she must be enduring having to sit in the dock and listen to this and see the faces of the court and the jury he wondered if she would look at harry or lucius stourbridge or aiden camp bell who were sitting together in the front of the body of the court perhaps this was worse than anything she had yet endured but if she were to survive if cleo were to survive it was necessary mrs anderson he never cared for her cleo said quietly she said he raped her several times that was how she got with child one of the jurors gasped another clenched his fist and banged it short and hard on the rail in front of him it must have hurt but he was too outraged even to be conscious of it lucius started to his feet and then subsided again helpless to know what to do but the child was stillborn rathbone said in the silence i reckoned so cleo agreed and what was miriam doing alone on the heath in such a state cleo shook her head as if to deny the truth drive it away tobias was staring at her as if aware of him she looked again at rathbone imploringly but it was for miriam not for herself he was absolutely sure of that what did she say he asked cleo looked down when she spoke her voice was barely audible that she had fled from the house with a woman and that the woman had tried to protect her and the woman had been murdered out there on the heath rathbone was stunned his imagination had conjured many possibilities but not this it took him a moment to collect his wits he did not mean to look at miriam but in spite of himself he did she was sitting whitefaced with her eyes shut she must have been aware that every man and woman in the room was staring at her and felt that her only hiding place was within herself he saw in her face pain almost beyond her power to bearbut no surprise she had known what cleo was going to say that more than anything else made him believe it absolutely whether it had happened or not whether there was any woman whether it was the illusion of a tormented and hysterical girl in the delirium of fever miriam believed it to be the truth rathbone looked at hester and saw her wideeyed amazement also she had known there was somethingbut not this he asked the question the whole court was waiting to hear answered and was this womans body found mrs anderson no you did look of course we did we all looked every man in the street but you never found it no and miriam couldnt take you to it againi presume you asked her it is hardly a matter you could let slip she looked at him angrily of course we didnt let it slip she said it was by an oak tree but the heath is full of oaks when we couldnt find anything in a week of looking we took it she was out of her wits with all that had happened to her people see all sorts of things when theyve been ill let alone in the grief of having a dead childand her only a child herself her contempt for him rang through her words and he felt the sting of it even though he was doing what he must tobias was sitting at his table shaking his head so you assumed she had imagined at least that part of her experienceher nightmareand you let it drop he pressed yes of course we did it took her months to get better and when she was we were all so glad of it we never mentioned it again why should we nobody else ever did no one came looking for anybody the police were asked if anyone was missing and what about miriam did you tell the police you had found her after all she was only thirteen herself by then of course we told them she wasnt missing from anywhere and they were only too pleased that someone was looking after her and she remained with you yes she grew up a beautiful girl she said it with pride her love for miriam was so plain in her face and her voice no words could have spoken as clearly when she was nineteen mr gardiner started courting her very slow very gentle he was with her we knew he was a good bit older than she was but she didnt mind and that was all that mattered if he made her happy that was all i cared and they were married yes a while later and a very good husband he was to her too and then he died yes very sad that was died young even though he was older than her of course took an attack and was gone in a matter of days she missed him very badly until she met lucius stourbridge yesbut that was three years after but she had no children with mr gardiner no her voice was torn that was one blessing she wasnt given only the good lord knows why it happens more often than youd think tobias rose to his feet with exaggerated weariness my lord we have listened with great indulgence to this life story of miriam gardiner and while we have every sympathy with her early experiences whatever the truth of them may be it all has no bearing whatever to the death of james treadwell or that of verona stourbridgeexcept as it may regrettably have provided the wretched treadwell with more fuel for his blackmailing schemes if he knew of this first child of mrs gardiners perhaps he felt the stourbridge family would be less willing to accept hera victim of rape or whatever else it may have been a look of distaste passed across the judges face but tobiass point was unarguable and he knew it sir oliver he said questioningly it does seem that you have done more to advance mr tobiass case than your own have you further points to put to your client rathbone had no idea what to say he was desperate yes my lord if you please then proceed but make it pertinent to the events we are here to try yes my lord he turned to cleo did you believe that she had been raped mrs anderson or do you perhaps think she was no better than she should be and she was thirteen cleo said furiously twelve when it happened of course i believed she had been raped she was half out of her mind with terror of whom the man who raped herthen nine months afterwards why because he tried to kill her cleo shouted rathbone feigned surprise she told you that yes and what did you do about it there was a man somewhere near the heath who had raped this girl you took in and treated as your own and then he subsequently tried to murder herand you never found him in gods name why not cleo was shaking gasping for breath and rathbone was afraid he had driven her too far i believed shed been rapedor seduced cleo said in a whisper but god forgive me i thought the attack was all jumbled up in her mind because of having a dead baby poor little thing until rathbone said urgently raising his voice until she came running to you again close to hysteria and terrified and there was really a dead body on the heath this timejames treadwell who was she running from mrs anderson the silence was total a juror coughed and it sounded like an explosion was it james treadwell rathbone threw the question down like a challenge no then whom silence the judge leaned forward if you wish us to believe that it was not james treadwell mrs anderson then you must tell us who it was cleo swallowed convulsively aiden campbell if she had set off a bomb it could not have had more effect rathbone was momentarily paralyzed there was a roar from the gallery the jurors turned to each other exclaiming gasping the judge banged his gavel and demanded order my lord rathbone said raising his voice may i ask for the luncheon adjournment so i can speak with my client you may the judge agreed and banged the gavel again the court will reconvene at two oclock rathbone left the courtroom in a daze and walked like a man half blind down to the room where miriam gardiner was permitted to speak with him she did not even turn her head when the door opened and he came in the jailer remaining on the outside was it aiden campbell you were running from he asked she said nothing sitting motionless head turned away why he persisted what had he done to you silence was he the one who attacked you originally his voice was growing louder and more shrill in his desperation for heavens sake answer me how can i help you if you wont speak to me he leaned forward over the small table but still she did not turn you will hang he said deliberately i know she answered at last and cleo anderson he added noi will say i killed treadwell too i will swear it on the stand theyll believe me because they want to none of them wants to condemn cleo it was true and he knew it as well as she did youll say that on the stand yes but it is not true this time she turned and met his eyes fully you dont know that sir oliver you dont know what happened if i say it is so will you contradict your own client you must be a foolit is what they want to hear they will believe it he stared back at her momentarily beaten he had the feeling that were there any heart left alive in her she would have smiled at him he knew that if he did not call her to testify then she would ask the judge from the dock for permission to speak and he would grant it there was no argument to make he left and had a miserable luncheon of bread which tasted to him like sawdust and claret which could as well have been vinegar rathbone had no choice but to call aiden campbell to the stand if he had not then most assuredly tobias would have at least this way he might retain a modicum of control the court was seething with anticipation word seemed to have spread during the luncheon adjournment because now every seat was taken and the ushers had had to ban more people from crowding in the judge called them to order and rathbone rose to begin i call aiden campbell my lord campbell was whitefaced but composed he must have known that this was inevitable and he had had almost two hours to prepare himself he stood now facing rathbone a tall straight figure tragically resembling both his dead sister and his nephew lucius who was sitting beside his father more like a ghost than a living being every now and again he stared up at miriam but never once had rathbone seen miriam return his look mr campbell rathbone began as soon as campbell had been reminded that he was still under oath an extraordinary charge has been laid against you by the last witness are you willing to respond to this i am campbell interrupted in his eagerness to reply i had hoped profoundly that this would never be necessary indeed i have gone to some lengths to see that it would not for the sake of my family and out of a sense of decency and the desire to bury old tragedies and allow them to remain unknown in the present where they cannot hurt innocent parties he glanced at lucius and away again his meaning was nakedly apparent mrs anderson has sworn that miriam gardiner claimed it was you she was running away from when she fled the party at cleveland square is that true rathbone asked campbell looked distressed yes he said quietly he shook his head a fraction i cannot tell you how deeply i had hoped not to have to say this i knew miriam gardiner miriam speake as she was thenwhen she was twelve years old she was a maid in my household when i lived near hampstead there was a rustle of movement and the startled sound of indrawn breath around the room campbell looked across at harry stourbridge and lucius im sorry he said fervently i cannot conceal this any longer miriam lived in my house for about eighteen months or something like that of course she recognized me at the garden party and must have been afraid that i would know her also and tell you he was still speaking to harry stourbridge as if this were a private matter between them obviously you did not tell them rathbone observed bringing his attention back to the business of the court why would it trouble her so much that she would flee in such a manner as if terrified rather than merely embarrassed surely the stourbridge family was already aware that she came from a different social background was this so terrible campbell sighed and hesitated several moments before replying rathbone waited there was barely a movement in the courtroom mr campbell the judge prompted campbell bit his lips yes my lord it pains me deeply to say this but miriam speake was a loose woman even at the age of twelve she was without moral conscience there was a gasp from harry stourbridge lucius half rose in his seat but his legs seemed to collapse under him im sorry campbell said again she was very pretty very comely for one so young and i find it repugnant to have to say so but very experienced again he was interrupted by an outcry from the gallery several jurors were shaking their heads a couple of them glanced towards the dock with grim disappointment rathbone knew absolutely that they believed every word he himself looked up at miriam and saw her bend her ashen face and cover it with her hands as if she could not endure what she was hearing in calling aiden campbell rathbone had removed what ghost of a defense she had had he felt as if he had impaled himself on his own sword everyone in the room was watching him waiting for him to go on hester must be furious at this result and pity him for his incompetence the pity was worse tobias was shaking his head in sympathy for a fellow counsel drowning in a storm of his own making campbell was waiting rathbone must say something more nothing he could imagine would make it worse at least he had nothing to lose now and therefore also nothing to fear this is your opinion mr campbell and you believe that mrs gardiner now a very respectable widow in her thirties was so terrified that you would express this unfortunate view of her childhood and ruin the prospective happiness of your nephew hardly unreasonable tobias interrupted what man would not tell his sister whom he loved that her only son was engaged to marry a maid no better than a whore but he didnt rathbone exclaimed he told no one in fact you first heard him apologize to his brotherinlaw this moment for saying it now he swung around why was that mr campbell if she was such a woman as you describeshould i say such a childwhy did you not warn your family rather than allow her to marry into it if what you say is true it is true campbell said gravely the state she was in that mrs anderson described fits regrettably with what i know of her his hands gripped the rail of the witness box in front of him he seemed to hold it as if to steady himself from shaking he had difficulty finding his voice she seduced one of my servants a previously decent man who fell into temptation too strong for him to resist i considered dismissing him but his work was excellent and he was bitterly ashamed of his lapse from virtue it would have ruined him at the start of his life he stopped for a moment rathbone waited i did not know at the time campbell went on with obvious difficulty but she was with child she had it aborted there was an outcry in the courtroom a woman shrieked there was a commotion as someone apparently collapsed the judge banged his gavel but it made little impression miriam made as if to rise to her feet but the jailers on either side of her pulled her back rathbone looked at the jury to a man their faces were marked deeply with shock and utter and savage contempt the judge banged his gavel again i will have order he said angrily otherwise the ushers will clear the court tobias looked across at rathbone and shook his head when the noise subsided and before rathbone could speak campbell continued that must be the reason that she was bleeding when mrs anderson found her wandering around on the heath he shook his head as if to deny what he was about to say somehow reduce the harshness of it at first i didnt want to put her out either she was so young i thoughtone mistakeand it had been a rough abortion she was still he shrugged then he raised his head and looked at rathbone but she kept on always tempting the men flirting with them setting one against the other she enjoyed the power she had over them i had no choice but to put her out there was a murmur of sympathy around the court and a rising tide of anger also one or two men swore under their breath two jurors spoke to each other they glanced up at the dock the condemnation in their faces was unmistakable a journalist was scribbling furiously tobias looked at rathbone and smiled sympathetically but without hiding his knowledge of his own victory he asked no quarter for himself when he lost and he gave none i wish i had not had to say that campbell was looking at rathbone i hesitated to tell harry before because at first i was not even totally sure it was the same person it seemed incredible and of course she had aged a great deal in twentythree years i didnt want to think it was her you understand that i suppose i finally acknowledged that it had to be when i saw that she also recognized me there was nothing for rathbone to say nothing left to ask it was the last result he could have foreseen and presumably hester would feel as disillusioned and as empty as he did himself he sat down utterly dejected tobias rose and walked into the middle of the floor swaggering a little beating oliver rathbone was a victory to be savored even when it had been ridiculously easy mr campbell there is very little left for me to ask you have told us far more than we could have imagined he looked across at rathbone i think that goes for my learned friend as much as for me however i do wish to tidy up any details that there may be in case mrs gardiner decides to take the stand herself and make any charges against you as suggested by mrs andersonwho may be as unaware of mrs gardiners youthful exploits as were the rest of us campbell did not reply but waited for tobias to continue mrs gardiner fled when she realized that you had recognized herat least that is your assumption yes did you follow her no of course not i had no reason to you remained at the party not specifically at the party i remained at cleveland square i was very upset about the matter i moved a little farther off in the garden to be alone and think what to do and what to say when the rest of the family would inevitably discover that she had gone and what did you decide mr campbell to say nothing campbell answered i knew this story would hurt them all profoundly they were very fond of miriam lucius was in love with her as only a young and idealistic man can be i believe it was his first love he left the sentence hanging allowing each man to remember his own first awakenings of passion dreams and perhaps loss i see tobias said softly only god can know whether that decision was the right one but i can well understand why you made it i am afraid i must press you further on just one issue yes the coachman james treadwell why do you think she left with him he was the servant in the house she knew the best campbell replied i gather he had driven her from hampstead a number of times i shall not speculate that it was anything more than that very charitable of you tobias observed considering your knowledge of her previous behavior with menservants campbell narrowed his lips but he did not answer tell me tobias continued how did this wretched coachman know of mrs andersons stealing of hospital supplies i have no idea campbell sounded surprised then his face fell he shook his head noi dont believe miriam told him she was conniving manipulative greedybut no unless it was by accident not realizing what he would do with the information would it not be the perfect revenge tobias asked smoothly her marriage to lucius stourbridge is now impossible because she knows you will never allow it treadwell is ruining her friend and benefactress to whom she must now return in rage and defeat and even desperation she strikes out at him what could be more natural i suppose so campbell conceded tobias turned to the judge my lord this is surely sufficient tragedy for one day if it pleases the court i would like to suggest we may adjourn until tomorrow when sir oliver may put forward any other evidence he feels may salvage his case personally i have little more to add the judge looked at rathbone enquiringly but his gavel was already in his hand rathbone had no weapons and no will to fight any further certainly my lord he said quietly by all means rathbone had barely left the courtroom when he was approached by the usher he did not wish to speak to anyone he was tasting the full bitterness of a defeat he knew he had brought upon himself he dreaded facing hester and seeing her disillusion she would not blame him he was certain she would not be angry her kindness would be even harder to bear what is it he said brusquely sorry sir oliver the usher apologized mrs anderson asked if you would speak with her sir she said it was most important the only thing worse than facing hester was going to be telling cleo anderson that there was nothing more he could attempt on her behalf he drew in his breath it could not be evaded if victory could be accepted and celebrated then defeat must be dealt with with equal composure and at the very least without cowardice or excuses of course he replied thank you morris he turned and was a dozen yards along the corridor when hester caught up with him he had no idea what to say to her there was no comfort to offer no next line of attack to suggest she fell into step with him and said nothing he glanced at her then away again grateful for her silence he had not seen monk and assumed he was on some other business cleo was waiting in the small room with the jailer outside she was standing facing them and she stepped forward as soon as rathbone closed the door hes lying she said looking from one to the other of them he was embarrassed it was futile to protest now and he had not the emotional strength to struggle with her it was over he shook his head im sure you want to believe it has nothing to do with belief i saw her then she wasnt aborted shed gone full term she was angry now with his lack of understanding im a nurse i know the difference between a woman whos given birth and one whos lost her child or done away with it in the first few months that child was borndead or alive the size of herand she had milk poor little thing she swallowed how she wept for it so campbell is lying hester said moving forward to cleo but why to hide what he did to her cleo said furiously he must have raped her and when she was with child he threw her out she looked from hester to rathbone though he didnt even notice her condition who looks at housemaids especially ones who are barely more than children themselves perhaps hed already got tired of hermoved on to someone else or if he thought shed had it aborted and only then realized she hadnt to avoid the scandal it wouldnt be much of a scandal hester said sadly if she was foolish enough to say it was his he would simply deny it no one would be likely to believe her or frankly care that much even if they did it isnt worth murdering anyone over cleos face crumpled but she refused to give in what about the body which body rathbone was confused the baby nono the woman what woman the woman miriam saw murdered the night her baby was born the woman on the heath rathbone was still further confused who was she cleo shook her head i dont know miriam said she had been murdered she saw itthat was what she was running away from but who was the woman i dont know was there ever a body found what happened didnt the police ask cleo waved her hands in denial her eyes desperate no no body was ever found he must have hidden it it was all pointless completely futile rathbone felt a sense of despair drowning him as if he could hardly struggle for breath almost a physical suffocation you said yourself that she was hysterical he tried to sound reasonable not patronizing or offensive to a woman who must be facing the most bitter disillusion imaginable and for which she would face disgrace she had not deserved and a death he could not save her from dont you think the loss of her baby was what she was actually thinking of was it a girl i dont know she didnt say cleo looked as if she had caught his despair she seemed soso sure it was a woman someone she cared for who had helped her even loved her i she stopped too weary too hurt to go on im sorry rathbone said gently you were right to tell me about the baby if campbell was lying at least we may be able to make something of that even if we do no more than save miriams reputation i am sure that will matter to her he was making wild promises and talking nonsense would miriam care about such a thing when she faced death he banged on the door to be released again and as soon as they were outside he turned to hester but before he could begin to say how sorry he was she spoke if this woman really was killed then her body must still be there hestershe was delirious probably weak from loss of blood and in a state of acute distress from delivering a dead child maybe but perhaps she really did see a woman murdered hester insisted if the body was never found then it is out there on the heath for twentytwo years on hampstead heath for heavens sake not in the open buriedhidden somewhere well if its buried no one would find it now perhaps its not buried she refused to give up perhaps its hidden somehow concealed hester im going to find sergeant robb and see if he will help me look you cant after all this time therell be nothing ive got to try what if there really was a woman murdered what if miriam was telling the truth all the time she isnt but what if she was shes your client oliver youve got to give her the benefit of every doubt you must assume that what she says is true until it is completely proved it cant be she was thirteen shed just given birth to a dead child she was alone and hysterical im going to find sergeant robb hell help me look whatever he believes for cleos sake he owes her a debt he can never repay and he knows that and doubtless if he should forget you will remind him certainly she agreed but he wont forget what about monk he challenged her as she turned to leave hes still busy trying to find out more about treadwell and the corpses she said over her shoulder hester wait but she had walked off increasing her pace to a run and short of chasing after her there was nothing he could do except try to imagine how he was going to face the court the next morning michael robb was sitting alone in the room where until recently his grandfather had spent his days the big chair was still there as if the old man might come back to it one day and there was a startling emptiness without him mrs monk robb said with surprise what is it is something wrong everything is wrong she answered remaining standing in spite of his invitation to sit cleo is going to be convicted unless we can find some sort of evidence that miriam also is innocent and our only chance of that is to find the body of the woman what woman just a minute he held up his hand what has happened in court i wasnt there with words falling over each other she told him about rathbones calling cleo to the stand and her story of how she had first met miriam and then aiden campbells denial and explanation weve got to find the woman that miriam said was murdered she finished desperately that would prove what she said was true at least they would have to investigate shes been out there for twentytwo years he protested if she exists at all can you think of anything better she demanded nobut then help me weve got to go and look he hesitated only a moment she could see in his face that he considered it hopeless but he was feeling lonely and guilty because cleo had helped him in the way he valued the most and he could do nothing for her silently he picked up his bullseye lantern and followed her out into the gathering dusk side by side they walked towards green man hill and the row of cottages where cleo anderson had lived until her arrest they stopped outside facing the heath it was now almost dark only the heavy outlines of the trees showed black against the sky where do you think we should start robb asked she was grateful he had spoken of them as together not relegating the search to her idea in which he was merely obliging her she had been thinking about it as they had traveled in silence it cannot have been very far she said staring across the grass she was not in a state to run a distance if the poor woman really was murderedbeaten to death as miriam apparently saidthen whoever did so would not have committed such an act close to the road she pushed away the thought refusing to allow the pictures into her mind even if it was a single blowand please god it wasit cannot have been silent there must have been a quarrel an accusation or something miriam was there she saw it she at least must have cried outand then fled he was staring at her and in the light of the lantern she saw him nodding slowly his face showing his revulsion at what she described whoever it was could not follow her she went on relentlessly because he was afraid of being caught first he had to get rid of the body of the woman mrs monk are you sure you believe this is possible he interrupted she was beginning to doubt it herself but she refused to give up of course she said sharply we are going to prove it if you had just killed someone and you knew a girl had seen you and she had run away perhaps screaming how would you hide a body so quickly that if anyone heard and came to see they would not find anything at all his eyes widened he opened his lips to argue then began to think he walked across the grass towards the first trees and stared around him well i wouldnt have time to dig a grave he said slowly the ground is hard and full of roots and anyway someone would very quickly notice disturbed earth he walked a little farther and she followed after him quickly above them something swooped in the darkness on broad wings involuntarily she gave a little shriek its only an owl he said reassuringly she swung around where did it go one of the trees he replied he lifted the lantern and began shining it around lighting the trunks one after another they looked pale gray against the darkness and the shadows seemed to move beyond them as the lantern waved she was acutely glad she was not alone she imagined what miriam must have felt like her child lost a woman she loved killed in front of her and herself pursued and hunted bleeding terrified no wonder she was all but out of her mind when cleo found her weve got to keep on looking she said fiercely we must exhaust every possibility if the body is here we are going to find it she strode forward hitching up her skirts so as not to fall over them you said he wouldnt have buried it he couldnt leave it in plain sight or it would have been found and it wasnt so he hid it so successfully it never was found where in a tree he replied it has to be theres nowhere else up a tree but someone would find it in time she protested it would rot it i know he said hastily shaking his head as if to rid himself of the idea he moved the lantern ahead of them picking out undergrowth and more trees a weasel ran across the path its lean body bright in the beam for a moment then it disappeared animals would get rid of it in time wouldnt they in time yes well its been over twenty years what would be left now bones teeth hair he said perhaps clothes jewelry buttons boots maybe she shuddered he looked at her shining the light a little below her face not to dazzle her are you all right mrs monk he said gently i can go on my own if you like ill take you back and then come back here again i promise i will she smiled at his earnestness i know you would but i am quite all right thank you lets go forward he hesitated for a moment still uncertain then as she did not waver he shone the lantern ahead of them and started they walked together for forty or fifty yards searching to left and right for any place that could be used for concealment she found herself feeling more and more as if she was wasting her timeand more important robbs time as well she had believed miriams story because she wanted to for cleos sake not because it was really credible sergeant robb she began he turned around the beam of light swinging across the two trees to their right it caught for a moment on a tangle in the lower branches whats that he said quickly an old birds nest she replied last years by the look of it he played the light on it then moved forward to look more closely what she asked with curiosity more than hope clever how they weave them isnt it especially since they havent got any hands he passed her the lantern hold this onto it please i want to take a closer look at a birds nest but she did as he requested and kept the light steady with hands free it was easy enough for him to climb up until he was level with the nest and peer inside where it was caught in a fork in the branches close to the trunk what is it she called up he turned around his face a shadowed mask in the upturned beam hair he answered her long hair lots of it the whole nest is lined with hair his voice was shaking im going to look for a hollow tree you just hold the light and keep your eyes away she felt a lurch inside she had no longer believed it and now here it was they were almost therein the next half hourmore or less yes she said unsteadily yes of course actually it took him only fifteen minutes to find the tree with the hollow core blasted by some ancient lightning and now rotted it was closer to the road than the nest but the spread of branches hid the hole until it was deliberately sought perhaps twentytwo years ago it had been more obvious the entire tree was hollow down the heart its in there robb said huskily climbing down again the lantern tied to his belt his legs were shaking when he reached the ground its only a skeleton but theres still cloth left he blinked and his face looked yellowgray in the beam from the head she was killed by one terrible blow like treadwell and mrs stourbridge rathbone had slept little a messenger had arrived at his rooms after midnight with a note from hester dear oliver we found the body seems to be a woman with gray hair she was killed by a terrible blow to the headjust like the others am in the police station with sergeant robb they do not know who she is will tell william of course i shall be in court in the morning to testify you must call me yours hester he had found it impossible to rest an hour later he had made himself a hot drink and was pacing the study floor trying to formulate a strategy for the next day eventually he went back to bed and sank into a deep sleep when it seemed immediately time to get up his head ached and his mouth was dry his manservant brought him breakfast but he ate only toast and drank a cup of tea then left straightaway for the courtroom he was far too early and the time he had expected to use in preparing himself he wasted in pointless moving from one place to another and conversation from which he learned nothing tobias was in excellent spirits he passed rathbone in the corridor and wished him well with a wry smile he would have preferred a little fight of it such an easy victory was of little savor the gallery was half empty again the public had already made up their minds and the few spectators present were there only to see justice done and taste a certain vengeance the startling exceptions to this were lucius and harry stourbridge who sat towards the front side by side and even at a distance very obviously supporting each other in silent companionship of anguish the judge called the court to order have you any further witnesses sir oliver he asked yes my lord i would like to call hester monk tobias looked across curiously the judge raised his eyebrows but with no objection rathbone smiled very slightly the usher called for hester she took the stand looking tired and palefaced but absolutely confident and she very deliberately turned and looked up towards the dock and nodded to both cleo and miriam then she waited for rathbone to begin rathbone cleared his throat mrs monk were you in court yesterday when mrs anderson testified to the extraordinary story miriam gardiner told when she was first found bleeding and hysterical on hampstead heath twentytwo years ago yes i was did you follow any course of action because of that yes i went to look for the body of the woman miriam said she saw murdered tobias made a sound of derision halfway between a cough and a snort the judge leaned forward enquiringly sir oliver is this really relevant at this stage yes my lord most relevant rathbone answered with satisfaction at last there was a warmth inside him a sense that he could offer a battle assuredly he could startle the equanimity from tobiass face then please make that apparent the judge directed yes my lord mrs monk did you find a body the court was silent but not in anticipation he barely had the jurors attention yes sir oliver i did tobias started forward jerking upright from the seat where he had been all but sprawled there was a wave of sound and movement from the gallery a hiss of indrawn breath the judge leaned across to hester do i hear you correctly madam you say you found a body yes my lord of course i was not alone i took sergeant michael robb with me from the beginning it was actually he who found it this is very serious indeed he frowned at her his face pinched and earnest where is the body now and what can you tell me of it it is in the police morgue in hampstead my lord and my knowledge of it is closely observed but only as a nurse not a doctor you are a nurse he was astounded yes my lord i served in the crimea good gracious he sat back sir oliver you had better proceed but before you do so i will have order in this court the next man or woman to make an unwarranted noise will be removed continue thank you my lord rathbone turned to hester where did you find the body mrs monk precisely in a hollow tree on hampstead heath she replied we started walking from mrs andersons house on green man hill looking for the sort of place where a body might be concealed assuming that mrs gardiners story was true what led you to look in a hollow tree there was total silence in the court not a soul moved a birds nest with a lot of human hair woven into it caught in one of the lower branches of a tree near it hester answered we searched all around until we found the hollow one sergeant robb climbed up and found the hole of course the area will have grown over a great deal in twentytwo years it could have been easier to see to get to then and the body rathbone pursued what can you tell us of it she looked distressed the memory was obviously painful her hands tightened on the railing and she took a deep breath before she began there was only skeleton her clothes had largely rotted away only buttons were left of her dress and the bones of her undergarments her boots were badly damaged but there was still more than enough to be recognizable all the buttons to them were whole and attached to what was left of the leather they were unusual and rather good she stood motionless steadying herself before she continued to judge by what hair we found she would have been a woman in her forties or fifties she had a terrible hole in her skull as if she had been beaten with some heavy object so hard it killed her thank you rathbone said quietly you must be tired and extremely harrowed by the experience she nodded rathbone turned to tobias tobias strode forward shaking his head a little when he spoke his voice was soft he was far too wily to be less than courteous to her she had the courts sympathy and he knew it mrs monk may i commend your courage and your singleminded dedication to seeking the truth it is a very noble cause and you appear to be tireless in it there was not a shred of sarcasm in him thank you she said guardedly tell me mrs monk was there anything on the body of this unfortunate woman to indicate who she was not so far as i know sergeant robb is trying to learn that now using what the remnants of cloth and leather that were still upon the bone you will have to ask him she replied if he feels that this tragedy has any relevance to this present case and therefore gives us that opportunity then i shall tobias agreed but you seem to feel it has or you would not now be telling me of it why is that mrs monk other than that you desire to protect one of your colleagues spots of color warmed hesters cheeks if she had ever imagined he would be gentle with her she now knew better because we found her where miriam gardiner said she was murdered she replied a trifle tartly indeed tobias raised his eyebrows i gathered from mrs anderson that mrs gardinermiss speake as she was thenwas completely hysterical and incoherent indeed mrs anderson herself ceased to believe there was any woman any murder or any body to find is that a question hester asked him nono it is an observation he said sharply you found this gruesome relic somewhere on hampstead heath in an unspecified tree all we know is that it is within walking distance of green man hill is there anything to indicate how long it had been thereexcept that it is obviously more than ten or eleven years could it have been twentyfive or say thirty or even fifty years mrs monk she stared back at him without flinching i am not qualified to say mr tobias you will have to ask sergeant robb or even the police surgeon however my husband is examining the boots and has an idea that they may be able to prove something buttons have a design you know your husband is an expert in buttons for ladies boots he asked he is an expert in detection of facts from the evidence she answered coolly he will know whom to ask no doubt and he may be willing to pursue ladies boot buttons with tireless endeavor tobias said sarcastically but we have to deal with the evidence we have and deduce from it reasonable conclusions is there anything in your knowledge mrs monk to prove that this unfortunate woman whose body you found has anything to do with the murders of james treadwell and of mrs verona stourbridge yes you said miriam gardiner was talking nonsense because no body of a woman was ever found on hampstead heath such as she described well now it has she was not lying nor was she out of her wits there was a murder since she described it it is the most reasonable thing to suppose that she witnessed it exactly as she said there is the body of a woman tobias corrected her we do not know if it was murder although i accept that it may very well have been but we do not know who she was what happened to her and still less do we know when it happened much as you would like to believe it is some support to the past virtue of miriam gardiner mrs monkand your charity does you credit and indeed your loyaltyit does not clear her of this charge he spread his hands in a gesture of finality smiled at the jury and returned to his seat rathbone stood up and looked at hester mrs monk you were at this tree on the heath and made this gruesome discovery therefore you know the place whereas we can only imagine tell us is there any way whatever that this unfortunate woman could have sustained this appalling blow to her head and then placed herself inside the tree no of course not her voice derided the idea she was murdered and her body was afterwards hidden and it happened long enough ago that the flesh has decomposed and most of the fabric of her clothes has rotted rathbone made absolutely certain yes and she was killed by a violent blow to the head in apparently exactly the same manner as james treadwell and poor mrs stourbridge yes thank you mrs monk he turned to the judge i believe my lord that this evidence lends a great deal more credibility to mrs gardiners original account and that in the interest of justice we need to know who that woman was and if her death is connected with those murders of which mrs gardiner and mrs anderson presently stand charged the judge looked across at tobias tobias was already on his feet yes my lord of course mr campbell has informed me that he is willing to testify again and explain all that he can if it will assist the court indeed since what has been said may leave in certain peoples minds suspicion as to his own role he wishes to have the opportunity to speak that would be most desirable the judge agreed please have mr campbell return to the stand aiden campbell looked tired and strained as he climbed the steps again but rathbone watching could see no fear in him he faced the court with sadness but confidence and his voice was quite steady when he answered tobiass questions no i have no idea who the woman is poor creature nor how long she has been there it would seem from the state of the body and the clothes that it was at least ten years have you any idea how she came by her death mr campbell tobias pressed none at all except that from mrs monks description of the wound it sounds distressingly like those inflicted on treadwell andhe hesitated and this time his composure nearly crackedupon my sister please tobias said gently allow yourself a few moments mr campbell would you like a glass of water nono thank you campbell straightened up i beg your pardon i was going to say that this womans death may be connected possibly she also was a nurse and may have become aware of the thefts of medicine from the hospital perhaps she either threatened to tell the authorities or maybe she tried her hand at blackmail he did not need to finish the sentence his meaning was only too apparent just so tobias inclined his head in thanks turned to the jury with a little smile then went back to his table there was silence in the gallery everyone was looking towards rathbone waiting to see what he would do he glanced around playing for time hoping some shred of an idea would come to him and not look too transparently desperate he saw harry stourbridges face colorless and earnest watching him with hope in his eyes beside him lucius looked like a ghost there was a stir as the outside doors opened and everyone craned to see who it was monk came in he nodded very slightly rathbone turned to the front again if there is time before the luncheon adjournment my lord i would like to call mr william monk i believe he may have evidence as to the identity of the woman whose body was found last night then indeed call him the judge said keenly we should all like very much to hear what he has to say you may step down mr campbell amid a buzz of excitement monk climbed the steps to the stand and was sworn in every eye in the room was on him even tobias sat forward in his seat his face puckered with concern his hands spread out on the table in front of him broad and strong fingers drumming silently rathbone found his voice shaking a little he was obliged to clear his throat before he began mr monk have you been engaged in trying to discover whatever information it is possible to find regarding the body of the woman found on hampstead heath last night since i was informed of it at about one oclock this morning monk replied and in fact he looked as if he had been up all night his clothes were immaculate as always but there was a dark shadow of beard on his cheeks and he was unquestionably tired have you learned anything rathbone asked hearing his own heart beating so violently he feared he must be shaking visibly yes i took the buttons from the boots she was wearing and a little of the leather of the soles which were scarcely worn those particular buttons were individual manufactured for only a short space of time it is not absolute proof but it seems extremely likely she was killed twentytwo years ago certainly it was not longer and since the boots were almost new it is unlikely to be less than that if you call the police surgeon he will tell you she was a woman of middle age fortyfive or fifty of medium height and build with long gray hair she had at some time in the past had a broken bone in one foot which had healed completely she was killed by a single very powerful blow to her head by someone facing her at the time and righthanded oh and she had perfect teethwhich is unusual in one of her age there was tension in the court so palpable that when a man in the gallery sneezed the woman behind him let out a scream then stifled it immediately every juror in both rows stared at monk as if unaware of anyone else in the room was that the same police surgeon who examined the bodies of tread well and mrs stourbridge rathbone asked yes monk answered and was he of the opinion that the blows were inflicted by the same person tobias rose to his feet my lord mr monk has no medical expertise indeed the judge agreed we will not indulge in hearsay sir oliver if you wish to call this evidence no doubt the police surgeon will make himself available nevertheless i should very much like to know the answer to that myself i shall most certainly do so rathbone agreed then as the usher stood at his elbow he said excuse me my lord he took the note handed to him and read it to himself it could not have been a blackmailer of cleoshe was not stealing medicines then the apothecary can prove that call me to testify hester the court was waiting my lord may i recall mrs monk to the stand in the question as to whether mrs anderson could have been blackmailed over the theft of medicines twentytwo years ago can she give evidence on the subject the judge asked with surprise surely she was a child at the time she has access to the records of the hospital my lord then call her but i may require to have the records themselves brought and put into evidence with respect my lord the court has accepted that medicines were stolen within the last few months without mr tobias having brought the records for the jury to read testimony has been sufficient for him in that tobias rose to his feet my lord mrs monk has shown herself an interested party her evidence is hardly unbiased i am sure the records can be obtained rathbone said reluctantly he would far rather cleos present thefts were left to testimony only but there was little point in saving her from charges of stealing if she was convicted of murder thank you my lord tobias said with a smile nevertheless the judge added we shall see what mrs monk has to say sir oliver please call her hester took the stand and was reminded of her earlier oath to tell the truth and only the truth she had examined the apothecarys records as far back as thirty years since before cleo andersons time and there was no discrepancy in medicines purchased and those accounted for as given to patients so at the time of this unfortunate womans death there were no grounds for blackmailing mrs anderson or anyone else with regard to medicines at the hospital rathbone confirmed that is so she agreed tobias stood up and walked towards her mrs monk you seem to be disposed to go to extraordinary lengths to prove mrs anderson not guilty lengths quite above and beyond the call of any duty you are either invested with or have taken upon yourself i cannot but suspect you of embarking upon a crusade either because you have a zeal to reform nursing and the view in which nurses are regarded and i will call mr fermin thorpe of the hospital in question to testify to your dedication to thisor less flatteringly a certain desire to draw attention to yourself and fulfill your emotions and perhaps occupy your time and your life in the absence of children to care for it was a tactical error as soon as he said it he was aware of his mistake but he did not know immediately how to retract it on the contrary mr tobias hester said with a cold smile i have merely testified as to facts it is you who are searching to invest them with some emotional value because it appears you do not like to be proved mistaken which i cannot understand since we are all aware you prosecute or defend as you are engaged to not as a personal vendetta against anyone at least i believe that to be the case she allowed it to be a question there was a rustle of movement around the room a ripple of nervous laughter tobias blushed of course that is the case but i am vigorous in it so am i she said tartly and my emotions are no less honorable than your own except that law is not my profession she allowed the sentence to remain unfinished they could draw their own conclusion as to whether she considered her amateur status to mark her inferiority in the matter or the fact that she did not take money for it and thus had a moral advantage if you have no further questions mr tobias the judge said resuming command i shall adjourn the court until such time as this unfortunate woman is identified then perhaps we shall also examine the hospital apothecarys records and be certain in the matter of what was stolen and when he banged his gavel sharply and with finality monk left the court without having heard hesters second testimony he went straight back to the hampstead police station to find sergeant robb it was imperative now that they learn who the dead woman had been the only place to begin was with the assumption that miriam had told the truth and therefore she must have had some connection with aiden campbell but why is he lying robb said doubtfully as they set out along the street in the hazy sunlight why let us even suppose that he seduced miriam when she was his maid or even raped her it would hardly be the first time that had happened let us even say the woman on the heath was a cook or housekeeper who knew about it thatd be no reason to kill her well somebody killed her monk said flatly setting out across the busy street disregarding the traffic and obliging a dray to pull up sharply he was unaware of it and did not even signal his thanks to the driver who shouted at him his opinion of drunkards and lunatics in general and monk in particular robb ran to catch up with him raising a hand to the driver in acknowledgment weve nowhere else to start monk went on where did you say campbell livedexactly robb repeated the address but he moved to wiltshire less than a year after that there wont necessarily be anyone there now who knows him or anything that happened there might be monk argued some servants will have left others prefer to stay in the area and find new positions even stay in the house with whoever buys it people belong to their neighborhoods its the far side of the heath robb was having to hurry to keep up do you want to take a hansom if one passes us monk conceded not slackening his pace if she wasnt part of the household who could she be how was she involved was she a servant or a social acquaintance well there was nobody reported missing around that time robb replied she wasnt local or somebodyd have said so nobody missed her monk swung around to face robb and all but bumped into a gentleman coming briskly the other way then she wasnt a neighbor or a local servant this becomes very curious they said no more until they reached the house where aiden campbell had lived twentyone years before it had changed hands twice since then but the girl who had been the scullery maid was now the housekeeper and the mistress had no objection to allowing monk and robb to speak with her in fact she seemed quite eager to be of assistance yes i was scullery maid then the housekeeper agreed miriam was the tweeny only a bit of a girl she was poor little thing you liked her monk said quickly yesyes i did we laughed together a lot shared stories and dreams got with child poor little soul an i never knew what happened to her then think it may ave been born dead for all that good care was took of er not surprising i suppose only twelve or so when she got like that good care was taken of her robb said with surprise oh yes had the midwife in she replied how do you know she was a midwife monk interrupted she said so she lived ere for a while right before the birth i do know that because i elped prepare er meals an took em up on a tray like you saw her monk said eagerly yes why i never saw er afterwards monk felt a stab of victory and one of horror what was she like think hard miss parkinson and please be as exact as you can height hair age her eyes widened why she done something as she shouldnt no pleasedescribe her very ordinary she was but very pleasantlooking an all grayish sort of hair although i dont reckon now as she was over about fortyfive or so seemed old to me then but i was only fifteen an anything over thirty was old how tall she thought for a moment about same as me ordinary bit less thank you miss parkinsonthank you very much she all right then no i fear very much that she may be the woman whose body was found on the heath cor well im real sorry she said it with feeling and there was sadness in her face as well as her voice poor creature monk turned as they were about to leave you didnt by chance ever happen to notice her boots did you miss parkinson she was startled her boots yes the buttons memory sparked in her eyes yes she had real smart buttons on them never seen no others like em i saw when she was sitting down her skirts was pulled sideways a bit well i never im real sorry to hear mebbe mrs dewarll let me go to the funeral since there wont be many others asll be there now do you remember her name monk said almost holding his breath for her answer she screwed up her face in the effort to take her mind back to the past she did not need his urging to understand the importance of it it began with a d she said after a moment or two ill think of it they waited in silence bailey she said triumphantly mrs bailey sorryi thought it were a d but bailey it was they thanked her again and left with a new energy of hope ill tell rathbone monk said as soon as they were out in the street you see if you can find her family there cant have been so many midwives called bailey twentytwo years ago someonell know her start with the doctors and the hospital send messages to all the neighboring areas he may have brought her in from somewhere else probably did since no one in hampstead reported her missing robb opened his mouth to protest then changed his mind it was not too much to do if it ended in proving cleo anderson innocent it was early afternoon of the following day when the court reconvened rathbone called the police surgeon who gave expert confirmation of the testimony hester had given regarding the death of the woman on the heath a cobbler swore to recognizing the boot buttons and said that they had been purchased by one flora bailey some twentythree years ago miss parkinson came and described the woman she had seen including the buttons the court accepted that the body was indeed that of flora bailey and that she had met her death by a violent blow in a manner which could only have been murder rathbone called aiden campbell once again he was pale his face set in lines of grief and anger he met rathbones eyes defiantly i was hoping profoundly not to have to say this his voice was hard i did know mrs bailey i had no idea that she was dead i never required her services again she was not as my innocent scullery maid supposed a midwife but an abortionist there was a gasp of horror and outrage around the court people turned to one another with a hissing of breath rathbone looked up at miriam in the dock and saw the amazement in her face and then the anger he turned to harry stourbridge sitting stiff and silent and lucius beside him stunned almost beyond reaction an abortionist rathbone said slowly very clearly yes campbell agreed i regret to say so rathbone raised his eyebrows very slightly you find abortion repugnant of course i do doesnt every civilized person of a healthy child from a healthy mother i imagine so rathbone agreed then tell us mr campbell why you had the woman staying in your houseso that your scullery maid carried up her meals to her on a tray campbell hesitated lifting his hands ifif that was done it was without my knowledge the servants perhaps they felt i dont know a pity he stopped if that ever happened he added tobias took his turn briefly was that with your knowledge or approval mr campbell of course not the court adjourned for luncheon the family of flora bailey arrived rathbone called her brother a respected physician as his first witness of the afternoon the gallery was packed word had spread like fire that something new was afoot the tide had turned dr forbes rathbone began your sister spent time in the home of mr aiden campbell immediately before her disappearance were you aware of that no sir i was not i knew she had a case she considered very important but also highly confidential the mothertobe was very young no more than a child herself and whoever engaged her was most anxious that both she and the child should receive the very best attention the child was much wanted in spite of the circumstances that is all she told me rathbone was startled the child was wanted so my sister told me and was it born healthy i have no idea i never heard from my sister again thank you dr forbes may i say how sorry i am for the reason which brings you here thank you forbes said soberly dr forbes one last question did your sister have any feelings regarding the subject of abortion very deep feelings forbes answered she was passionately opposed to it regardless of the pity she felt for women who already had as many children as they could feed or care for or for those who were unmarried or even who had been assaulted or otherwise abused she could never bring herself to feel it acceptable it was a matter of religious principle to her so she would not have performed an abortion herself never forbess face was flushed his emotion naked if you doubt me sir i can name a dozen professional men who will say the same of her i do not doubt you dr forbes i simply wanted you to say it for the court to hear thank you for your patience i have nothing further to ask tobias half rose to his feet then sat down again he glanced across at rathbone and for the first time there was misgiving in his face even anxiety again there was silence in the room no one even noticed harry stourbridge stand up it was not until he spoke that suddenly every eye turned to him my lord he cleared his throat i have listened to the evidence presented here from the beginning i believe i now understand the truth it is very terrible but it must be told or an unbearable injustice will be done two women will be hanged who are innocent of any wrong the silence prickled like the coming of a storm if you have information pertinent to this trial then you should most certainly take the stand again major stourbridge the judge agreed be advised that you are still under oath i am aware of it my lord stourbridge answered and walked slowly from his seat across the open space and up the steps of the witness box he waited until the judge told him to proceed then in a hoarse broken voice with desperate reluctance he began i come from a family of very considerable wealth almost all of it in lands and property with sufficient income to maintain them and some extra to provide a more than comfortable living however it is all entailed and has been so for generations i inherited it from my father and it will pass to my son he stopped for a few seconds as if regathering his strength there was not a sound in the room everyone understood that here was a man laboring under terrible emotions as he realized a truth that shattered his life if i had not had a son he continued with difficulty his voice trembling the property would have passed to my younger brother again he paused before gathering the strength to proceed my wife found it extremely difficult to carry a child time and again she conceived and then miscarried within the first few months we had almost given up hope when she came to visit me in egypt while i was serving in the army there it was a dangerous posting both because of the fighting and because of the natural hazards of disease i was anxious for her but she was determined to come at all costs now he was speaking the words poured out every man and woman in the room was listening intently no one moved even a hand she stayed with me for over a month his voice cracked she seemed to enjoy it then she returned by boat down the nile to alexandria i have had much time to think over and over on what has happened to try to understand why my wife was killed she was a generous woman who never harmed anyone he looked confused beaten and why miriam whom we all cared for so much should have wished her ill i tried to recall what had been said at the dinner table verona had spoken of egypt and her journey back down the nile lucius asked her about a particular excursion and she said she had wished to go but had been unable because she had not been very well she dismissed it as of no importance only a quite usual complaint for her which had passed his face was very white he looked across at lucius im so sorry he said hoarsely then he faced forward again yesterday evening i went and read her diary of the time and found her reference to that day when she had written of the pain and her distress and then she had remembered aidens words of reassurance that it would all be well if she kept her courage and told no one and she had done exactly as he had said his voice dropped then at last i understood rathbone found himself hardly breathing he was so intent upon harry stourbridges white face and tight aching voice when she reached england again stourbridge continued she wrote and told me that during her stay with me she had become with child and felt very well and hoped that this time she would carry it until birth i was overjoyed for her even more than for myself in the gallery a woman sobbed her heart touched with pity maybe with an empathy rathbone glanced up at miriam she looked as if she had seen death facetoface harry stourbridge did not look at her or at lucius or at aiden campbell but straight ahead of him into a vision of the past only he could see in due time i heard that the child was delivered a healthy boy my son lucius i was the happiest man alive some short time after that i returned to duties in england and saw him he was beautiful and so like my wife he could not continue it took him several moments to regain even the barest mastery of his voice when he spoke it was hoarse and little above a whisper i loved him so muchi still do the truth has nohas nothing to do with that that will never change he took a deep breath and let it out in a choking sigh but i now know that he is not my son nor is he my wifes son there was a shock wave around the room as if an earthquake had struck jurors sat paralyzed even the judge seemed to grasp for his bench as if to hold himself steady rathbone found his lips dry his heart pounding harry stourbridge looked across at lucius forgive me he whispered i have always loved you and i always will he faced forward again at attention he is the baby my wifes brother aiden campbell begot by rape upon his twelveyearold maid miriam speake so that i should have an heir and his sister should not lose access to my fortune should i die in action or from disease while abroad she was always generous to him there was a low rumble of fury around the room aiden campbell shot to his feet but he found no words to deny what was written on every face two ushers moved forward simultaneously to restrain him should it become necessary harry stourbridge went on as if oblivious to them all he could not leave his story unfinished he murdered the midwife so she would never tell and he attempted to murder the mother also but distraught hysterical she escaped perhaps she never knew if her baby lived or dieduntil at her own engagement party she saw aiden wield a croquet mallet swinging it high in jest and memory returned to her and with understanding so fearful she could only run from us all and keep silence even at the price of her life rather than have anyone know but above all lucius himself that he had fallen in love with his own mother he could no longer speak in spite of all he could do the tears spilled down his cheeks the noise in the court increased like the roar of a rising tide a wave of pity and anger engulfed the room the ushers closed in on aiden campbell perhaps to restrain him perhaps even to protect him rathbone felt dizzy dimly he saw hester and just beyond her shoulder monk his face as shocked as hers he looked up at miriam not for an instant now did he need to wonder if this was the truth it was written in her eyes her mouth every angle of her body he turned back to harry stourbridge thank you he said quietly no one here can presume to know what it must have cost you to say this i dont know if mr tobias has any questions to ask you but i have none tobias stood up began to speak and then stopped he glanced at the jury then back to the judge i think my lord that in the interests of truth some further detail is required terrible as this story is there are he made a gesture of helplessness and left the rest unsaid rathbone was still on his feet i think now my lord that mrs gardiner has nothing left to protect if i call her to the stand she may be prepared to tell us the little we do not know by all means the judge agreed if she is willingand if she is able he turned to stourbridge thank you sir for your honesty we need ask nothing further of you like a man walking through water harry stourbridge went down the steps and stood for a moment in the middle of the floor he looked up at the dock where miriam had risen to her feet there was a gentleness in his face which held the room in silence a compassion and a gratitude that even in her anguish she could not have failed to recognize he waited while she came down the jailer standing aside as if he understood his duty was over miriam stopped in front of harry stourbridge haltingly he reached out and touched her arm so lightly she could barely have felt it he smiled at her she put her hand over his for an instant then continued on her way to the steps of the witness stand climbed up and turned to face rathbone and the court mrs gardiner rathbone said quietly i understand now why you preferred to face the rope for a crime you did not commit rather than have lucius stourbridge learn the truth of his birth but that is not now possible nor can aiden campbell any longer hide from his actsor blame you for any part of them i do not require you to relive a past which must be painful beyond our imagining but justice necessitates that you tell the jury what you know of the deaths of james treadwell and verona stourbridge miriam nodded very slightly with just the barest acknowledgment then in a quiet drained voice she began i ran from the croquet lawn at first i did not care where i went anywhere to be away from the house aloneto try to realize what had happened what it was i had remembered if it could really be true more than anything on earth i did not want it to be she stopped for a moment of courseit was but i did not fully accept it then i ran to the stables and begged treadwell to take me anywhere i gave him my locket as payment he was greedy but not entirely a bad man i asked him to drive me to hampstead heath i didnt tell him why i wanted to go back to where poor mrs bailey was killed to remember what really happenedif the flash of recollection i had on the croquet lawn was even some kind of madness someone coughed and the noise made people start in the tingling silence aiden campbell must have seen my recognition she went on he also remembered and perhaps knew where i would go he followed us and found us near the tree where mrs baileys body was hidden he had to kill treadwell if he was going to kill me or hed have been blackmailed for the rest of his life he struck treadwell first he caught him completely by surprise i ran i know the area better than he because i lived near the heath for years perhaps desperation lent me speed it was getting dark i escaped him after that i had no idea where to go or what to do at last in the morning i went to cleo anderson again but this time i could not bear to tell even her what i knew and the death of verona stourbridge after you were released back into the stourbridges custody rathbone prompted her she looked at him i couldnt tell anyone we understand what do you know about verona stourbridges death i believe she always thought lucius was an abandoned baby she hid the truth from major stourbridge but she had no knowledge of any crime only her own deception made from her despair that she would never bear a child for her husband i know now that she knew it was aidens child but not about me or how he was concerned she must have asked aiden about itand although he loved her he could not afford to let her know the truth her voice dropped no matter how close they were and they truly were she might one day have told someoneshe would have had toto explain in spite of herself her eyes went to lucius sitting on the front bench the tears running down his cheeks im so sorry miriam whispered im so so sorry rathbone turned to the judge my lord is it necessary to protract this any longer may we adjourn for an hour or so before we conclude i have nothing further to ask and i cannot believe mr tobias will pursue this anymore tobias rose to his feet i am quite willing my lord what little remains can be dealt with after an adjournment major stourbridge and his family have my deepest sympathy very good the judge banged his gavel and after a moments heavy stillness people began to move rathbone felt bruised exhausted as if he had made some great physical journey he turned to hester and monk who were coming towards him from the body of the court just behind them was a man with scruffy black hair and a beard that went in every direction he was beaming with satisfaction his eyes shining hester smiled you have achieved the impossible monk said holding out his hand to rathbone rathbone took it and held it hard for a few moments we still have the matter of the medicines he warned no we dont hester assured him mr phillips here is the apothecary at the hospital he has persuaded fermin thorpe that nothing is missing it was all a matter of natural wastage and a few rather careless entries in the books no actual thefts at all it was a mistake to have mentioned it rathbone was incredulous how in heavens name did you do that he regarded phillips with interest and a growing respect never enjoyed anything more phillips said grinning broadly a little issue of one favor for anotherresurrection you might say monk looked at hester narrowly she beamed back at him with complete innocence well done mr phillips rathbone said gratefully i am much obliged
