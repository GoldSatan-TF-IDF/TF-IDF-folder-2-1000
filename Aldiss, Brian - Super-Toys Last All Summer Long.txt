supertoys last all summer long by brian aldiss aldiss in a january interview with wired magazine says that in the early s he stanley kubrick made two collaborative attempts to turn his story supertoys into a script i cant tell you how many directions we went my favorite was when david and teddy got exiled to tin city a place where the old model robots like old cars were living out their days stanley definitely had the ambition to make another big science fiction movie but in the end we didnt get anywhere stanley called in arthur clarke and asked him to provide a scenario but he didnt like that either i have a feeling having worked with him that he hasnt got the dashing confidence of youth says aldiss but of course with age you acquire a different sort of confidence the directors creative vision meanwhile is clearer than ever stanley embraces android technology aldiss notes and thinks it might eventually take over and be an improvement over the human race the original drafts made by aldiss and kubrick became the starting point for his asyet unfinished project ai following the departure of aldiss kubrick subsequently worked with authors ian watson and bob shaw the film is currently under preproduction in london few further details are currently known supertoys appeared first in harpers bazaar and is brian aldiss all rights reserved in mrs swintons garden it was always summer the lovely almond trees stood about it in perpetual leaf monica swinton plucked a saffroncolored rose and showed it to david isnt it lovely she said david looked up at her and grinned without replying seizing the flower he ran with it across the lawn and disappeared behind the kennel where the mowervator crouched ready to cut or sweep or roll when the moment dictated she stood alone on her impeccable plastic gravel path she had tried to love him when she made up her mind to follow the boy she found him in the courtyard floating the rose in his paddling pool he stood in the pool engrossed still wearing his sandals david darling do you have to be so awful come in at once and change your shoes and socks he went with her without protest into the house his dark head bobbing at the level of her waist at the age of three he showed no fear of the ultrasonic dryer in the kitchen but before his mother could reach for a pair of slippers he wriggled away and was gone into the silence of the house he would probably be looking for teddy monica swinton twentynine of graceful shape and lambent eye went and sat in her living room arranging her limbs with taste she began by sitting and thinking soon she was just sitting time waited on her shoulder with the maniac slowth it reserves for children the insane and wives whose husbands are away improving the world almost by reflex she reached out and changed the wavelength of her windows the garden faded in its place the city center rose by her left hand full of crowding people blowboats and buildings she remained alone an overcrowded world is the ideal place in which to be lonely the directors of synthank were eating an enormous luncheon to celebrate the launching of their new product some of them wore the plastic facemasks popular at the time all were elegantly slender despite the rich food and drink they were putting away their wives were elegantly slender despite the food and drink they too were putting away an earlier and less sophisticated generation would have regarded them as beautiful people apart from their eyes henry swinton managing director of synthank was about to make a speech im sorry your wife couldnt be with us to hear you his neighbor said monica prefers to stay at home thinking beautiful thoughts said swinton maintaining a smile one would expect such a beautiful woman to have beautiful thoughts said the neighbor take your mind off my wife you bastard thought swinton still smiling he rose to make his speech amid applause after a couple of jokes he said today marks a real breakthrough for the company it is now almost ten years since we put our first synthetic lifeforms on the world market you all know what a success they have been particularly the miniature dinosaurs but none of them had intelligence it seems like a paradox that in this day and age we can create life but not intelligence our first selling line the crosswell tape sells best of all and is the most stupid of all everyone laughed though threequarters of the overcrowded world are starving we are lucky here to have more than enough thanks to population control obesitys our problem not malnutrition i guess theres nobody round this table who doesnt have a crosswell working for him in the small intestine a perfectly safe parasite tapeworm that enables its host to eat up to fifty percent more food and still keep his or her figure right general nods of agreement our miniature dinosaurs are almost equally stupid today we launch an intelligent synthetic lifeform a fullsize servingman not only does he have intelligence he has a controlled amount of intelligence we believe people would be afraid of a being with a human brain our servingman has a small computer in his cranium there have been mechanicals on the market with minicomputers for brains plastic things without life supertoys but we have at last found a way to link computer circuitry with synthetic flesh david sat by the long window of his nursery wrestling with paper and pencil finally he stopped writing and began to roll the pencil up and down the slope of the desklid teddy he said teddy lay on the bed against the wall under a book with moving pictures and a giant plastic soldier the speechpattern of his masters voice activated him and he sat up teddy i cant think what to say climbing off the bed the bear walked stiffly over to cling to the boys leg david lifted him and set him on the desk what have you said so far ive said he picked up his letter and stared hard at it ive said dear mummy i hope youre well just now i love you there was a long silence until the bear said that sounds fine go downstairs and give it to her another long silence it isnt quite right she wont understand inside the bear a small computer worked through its program of possibilities why not do it again in crayon when david did not answer the bear repeated his suggestion why not do it again in crayon david was staring out of the window teddy you know what i was thinking how do you tell what are real things from what arent real things the bear shuffled its alternatives real things are good i wonder if time is good i dont think mummy likes time very much the other day lots of days ago she said that time went by her is time real teddy clocks tell the time clocks are real mummy has clocks so she must like them she has a clock on her wrist next to her dial david started to draw a jumbo jet on the back of his letter you and i are real teddy arent we the bears eyes regarded the boy unflinchingly you and i are real david it specialized in comfort monica walked slowly about the house it was almost time for the afternoon post to come over the wire she punched the post office number on the dial on her wrist but nothing came through a few minutes more she could take up her painting or she could dial her friends or she could wait till henry came home or she could go up and play with david she walked out into the hall and to the bottom of the stairs david no answer she called again and a third time teddy she called in sharper tones yes mummy after a moments pause teddys head of golden fur appeared at the top of the stairs is david in his roomteddy david went into the garden mummy come down here teddy she stood impassively watching the little furry figure as it climbed down from step to step on its stubby limbs when it reached the bottom she picked it up and carried it into the living room it lay unmoving in her arms staring up at her she could feel just the slightest vibration from its motor stand there teddy i want to talk to you she set him down on a tabletop and he stood as she requested arms set forward and open in the eternal gesture of embrace teddy did david tell you to tell me he had gone into the garden the circuits of the bears brain were too simple for artifice yes mummy so you lied to me yes mummy stop calling me mummy why is david avoiding me hes not afraid of me is he no he loves you why cant we communicate davids upstairs the answer stopped her dead why waste time talking to this machine why not simply go upstairs and scoop david into her arms and talk to him as a loving mother should to a loving son she heard the sheer weight of silence in the house with a different quality of silence pouring out of every room on the upper landing something was moving very silently david trying to hide away from her he was nearing the end of his speech now the guests were attentive so was the press lining two walls of the banqueting chamber recording henrys words and occasionally photographing him our servingman will be in many senses a product of the computer without computers we could never have worked through the sophisticated biochemics that go into synthetic flesh the servingman will also be an extension of the computerfor he will contain a computer in his own head a microminiaturized computer capable of dealing with almost any situation he may encounter in the home with reservations of course laughter at this many of those present knew the heated debate that had engulfed the synthank boardroom before the decision had finally been taken to leave the servingman neuter under his flawless uniform amid all the triumphs of our civilization yes and amid the crushing problems of overpopulation too it is sad to reflect how many millions of people suffer from increasing loneliness and isolation our servingman will be a boon to them he will always answer and the most vapid conversation cannot bore him for the future we plan more models male and femalesome of them without the limitations of this first one i promise you of more advanced design true bioelectronic beings not only will they possess their own computer capable of individual programming they will be linked to the world data network thus everyone will be able to enjoy the equivalent of an einstein in their own homes personal isolation will then be banished forever he sat down to enthusiastic applause even the synthetic servingman sitting at the table dressed in an unostentatious suit applauded with gusto dragging his satchel david crept round the side of the house he climbed on to the ornamental seat under the livingroom window and peeped cautiously in his mother stood in the middle of the room her face was blank its lack of expression scared him he watched fascinated he did not move she did not move time might have stopped as it had stopped in the garden at last she turned and left the room after waiting a moment david tapped on the window teddy looked round saw him tumbled off the table and came over to the window fumbling with his paws he eventually got it open they looked at each other im no good teddy lets run away youre a very good boy your mummy loves you slowly he shook his head if she loved me then why cant i talk to her youre being silly david mummys lonely thats why she had you shes got daddy ive got nobody cept you and im lonely teddy gave him a friendly cuff over the head if you feel so bad youd better go to the psychiatrist again i hate that old psychiatrist he makes me feel im not real he started to run across the lawn the bear toppled out of the window and followed as fast as its stubby legs would allow monica swinton was up in the nursery she called to her son once and then stood there undecided all was silent crayons lay on his desk obeying a sudden impulse she went over to the desk and opened it dozens of pieces of paper lay inside many of them were written in crayon in davids clumsy writing with each letter picked out in a color different from the letter preceding it none of the messages was finished my dear mummy how are you really do you love me as much dear mummy i love you and daddy and the sun is shining dear dear mummy teddys helping me write to you i love you and teddy darling mummy im your one and only son and i love you so much that some times dear mummy youre really my mummy and i hate teddy darling mummy guess how much i love dear mummy im your little boy not teddy and i love you but teddy dear mummy this is a letter to you just to say how much how ever so much monica dropped the pieces of paper and burst out crying in their gay inaccurate colors the letters fanned out and settled on the floor henry swinton caught the express home in high spirits and occasionally said a word to the synthetic servingman he was taking home with him the servingman answered politely and punctually although his answers were not always entirely relevant by human standards the swintons lived in one of the ritziest cityblocks half a kilometer above the ground embedded in other apartments their apartment had no windows to the outside nobody wanted to see the overcrowded external world henry unlocked the door with his retina patternscanner and walked in followed by the servingman at once henry was surrounded by the friendly illusion of gardens set in eternal summer it was amazing what whologram could do to create huge mirages in small spaces behind its roses and wisteria stood their house the deception was complete a georgian mansion appeared to welcome him how do you like it he asked the servingman roses occasionally suffer from black spot these roses are guaranteed free from any imperfections it is always advisable to purchase goods with guarantees even if they cost slightly more thanks for the information henry said dryly synthetic lifeforms were less than ten years old the old android mechanicals less than sixteen the faults of their systems were still being ironed out year by year he opened the door and called to monica she came out of the sittingroom immediately and flung her arms round him kissing him ardently on cheek and lips henry was amazed pulling back to look at her face he saw how she seemed to generate light and beauty it was months since he had seen her so excited instinctively he clasped her tighter darling whats happened henry henry oh my darling i was in despair but ive just dialed the afternoon post and youll never believe it oh its wonderful for heavens sake woman whats wonderful he caught a glimpse of the heading on the photostat in her hand still moist from the wallreceiver ministry of population he felt the color drain from his face in sudden shock and hope monica oh dont tell me our numbers come up yes my darling yes weve won this weeks parenthood lottery we can go ahead and conceive a child at once he let out a yell of joy they danced round the room pressure of population was such that reproduction had to be strict controlled childbirth required government permission for this moment they had waited four years incoherently they cried their delight they paused at last gasping and stood in the middle of the room to laugh at each others happiness when she had come down from the nursery monica had deopaqued the windows so that they now revealed the vista of garden beyond artificial sunlight was growing long and golden across the lawn and david and teddy were staring through the window at them seeing their faces henry and his wife grew serious what do we do about them henry asked teddys no trouble he works well is david malfunctioning his verbal communication center is still giving trouble i think hell have to go back to the factory again okay well see how he does before the babys born which reminds mei have a surprise for you help just when help is needed come into the hall and see what ive got as the two adults disappeared from the room boy and bear sat down beneath the standard roses teddy i suppose mummy and daddy are real arent they teddy said you ask such silly questions david nobody knows what real really means lets go indoors first im going to have another rose plucking a bright pink flower he carried it with him into the house it could lie on the pillow as he went to sleep its beauty and softness reminded him of mummy
