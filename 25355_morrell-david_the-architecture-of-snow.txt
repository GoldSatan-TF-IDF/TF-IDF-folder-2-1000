david morrell the architecture of snow introduction few authors had the mystique of jd salinger in the mids having written four muchdiscussed books one of which was already being treated as a classic the revered author of the catcher in the rye stopped publishing and withdrew from public life he never explained why but a few possibilities come to mind his final book a pairing of novellas raise high the roof beam carpenters and seymour an introduction received mixed critical reactions perhaps salingers personality was as fragile as the name of his fictional glass family implied perhaps he decided to stop exposing his work to reviewers and preferred to retreat to a simple life where he listened to the sound of one hand clapping a zen buddhist phrase that he favored for whatever reason his walled compound in the remote town of cornish new hampshire acquired the reputation of a hermits lair fans who made pilgrimages to the area reported occasional sightings of the lean aestheticlooking author based on a solitary longago book photograph that they had studied but over the years these sightings became more rare while the citizens of cornish closed ranks refusing to reveal the little information they had about him the few reports that surfaced indicate that during the next four decades salinger wrote obsessively every day and that he had stacks of completed novels in a large safe in his home in january of he died at the age of it remains to be seen if those novels will be published perhaps they never existed perhaps he destroyed them before his death perhaps theyre unreadable or perhaps they are masterpieces the publication of which will come as unexpectedly as his withdrawal from public life these thoughts intrigued me long before salinger died in as i considered the way publishing had changed since my debut novel first blood appeared in i wondered what salinger would make of the international conglomerates that now control the book world publicity has become as important as editing marketing is often more important than content how would a modern publisher react i wondered ifout of nowhere and after so many yearsa new salinger manuscript arrived on an editors desk i called the author by another name and the circumstances of his withdrawal are different but anyone familiar with salinger will recognize the inspiration for the architecture of snow david morrell the architecture of snow on the first monday in october samuel carver who was and suddenly unemployed stepped in front of a fastmoving bus carver was an editor for edwin march amp sons until recently one of the last privately owned publishing houses in new york to describe carver as an editor is an understatement i said in his eulogy having indirectly caused his death march amp sons now a division of gladstone international sent me to represent the company at his funeral he was a legend to find someone with his reputation you need to go back to the s to maxwell perkins and his relationships with ernest hemingway f scott fitzgerald and thomas wolfe it was perkins who massaged hemingways ego helped fitzgerald recover from hangovers and realized that the two feet of manuscript wolfe lugged into his office could be divided into several novels standing next to carvers coffin at the front of a presbyterian church in lower manhattan i counted ten mourners carver followed perkinss example i went on for much of the past five decades he discovered an amazing number of major authors he nurtured them through writers block and discouraging reviews he lent them money he promoted them tirelessly he made them realize the scope of their creative powers r j wentworths classic about childhood and stolen innocence the sand castle carol fabins verse novel wagon mound roger kilpatricks vietnam war novel the disinherited eventual recipients of pulitzer prizes these were buried in piles of unsolicited manuscripts that carver loved to search through ten mourners many of the authors carver had championed were dead others had progressed to huge advances at bigger publishers and seemed to have forgotten their debt to him a few retired editors paid their respects publishers weekly sent someone who took a few notes carvers wife had died seven years earlier the couple hadnt been able to have children the church echoed coldly so much for being a legend the official explanation was that carver stumbled in front of the bus but i had no doubt that he committed suicide despite my praise about the past five decades he hadnt been a creative presence since his wifes death age ill health and grief wore him down at the same time the book business changed so drastically that his instincts didnt fit he was a lover of long shots with the patience to give talent a chance to develop but in the profitobsessed climate of modern publishing manuscripts needed to survive the focus groups of the marketing department if the books werent easily promotable they didnt get accepted for the past seven years george march the grandson of the companys founder loyally postponed forcing carver into retirement paying him a token amount to come to the office two days a week the elderly gentleman had a desk in a corner where he studied unsolicited manuscripts he also functioned as a corporate memory although it was hard to imagine how stories about the goodold days could help an editor survive in contemporary publishing not that it matteredi was one of the few who asked him anything eventually march amp sons succumbed to a conglomerate gladstone international hoped to strengthen its filmandbroadcast division by acquiring a publisher and ordering it to focus on novels suited for movies and television series the trade buzzword for this is synergy as usual when a conglomerate takes over a business the first thing the new owner did was downsize the staff and carver was an obvious target for elimination maybe hed felt that his former contributions made him immune that would account for his stunned reaction when he came to work that monday morning and received the bad news what am i going to do the old man murmured his liverspotted hands shook as he packed framed photographs of his wife and of authors hed discovered into a flimsy box how will i manage how will i fill the time evidently hed decided that he wouldnt the box in one hand his umbrella in the other he went outside and let the bus solve his problems because carver and i seemed to be friends the new ceo put me in charge of whatever projects carver was trying to develop mostly that meant sending a few polite rejection letters also i removed some items carver forgot in his desk drawer cough drops chewing gum and a packet of kleenex mr neal mmmm i glanced up from one of the hundreds of emails i received each day my assistant stood in my office doorway his black turtleneck black pants and black sports coat gave him the appearance of authority young tall thin and ambitious he held a book mailer this arrived for mr carver no return address should i handle it for you in theory it was an innocent suggestion but in the new corporate climate i doubted there was any such thing as an innocent suggestion when my assistant offered to take one of my duties i wondered if it was the first step in assuming all of my duties after carver was fired three other editors each over received termination notices im my assistant keeps calling me mr neal even though ive asked him to call me tom mister isnt only a term of respectits also a way of depersonalizing the competition thanks but ill take care of it determined to stake out my territory i carried the package home but i forgot about it until sunday afternoon after id worked through several gutbusting boxes of submissions that included two serialkiller novels and a romantic saga about californias wine country the timedemanding tyranny of those manuscripts is one reason my wife moved out years earlier she said she lived as if she were single so she might as well be single most days i dont blame her a yankees game was on television i opened a beer noticed the package on a side table and decided to flip though its contents during commercials when i tore it open i found a typed manuscript doublespaced in professional format with unsolicited manuscripts you cant count on any of that it didnt reek of cigarette smoke or food odors and that too was encouraging still i was troubled not to find an introductory letter and return postage the manuscript didnt have the uniform typeface that word processors and printers create some letters were faint others dark some were slightly above or below others the author had actually put this through a typewriter it was a novel called the architecture of snow an evocative title i decided although the marketing department would claim that bookstore clerks would mistakenly put it in the artsandarchitecture section the writers name was peter thomas bland the marketing department preferred last names that had easily remembered concrete nouns like kingor steele with zero expectation i started to read hardly any time seemed to pass before the baseball game ended my beer glass was empty but i didnt remember drinking its contents surprised i noticed the darkness outside my apartments windows i glanced at my watch ten oclock another fifty pages to go eager to proceed i made a sandwich opened another beer shut off the tv and finished one of the best novels id read in years you dream about something like that an absolutely perfect manuscript nothing to correct just a wonderful combination of hypnotic tone powerful emotion palpable vividness beautiful sentences and characters you never want to leave the story was about a tenyearold boy living alone with his divorced father on a farm in vermont in the middle of january a blizzard hits the area it knocks down electricity and telephone lines it disables cellphone relays it blocks roads and imprisons the boy and his father the father starts throwing up i told the marketingeditorial committee he gets a high fever his lower right abdomens in terrific pain theres a medical book in the house and it doesnt take them long to realize the father has appendicitis but they cant telephone for help and the fathers too sick to drive even if he could his truck would never get through the massive drifts meanwhile with the power off their furnace doesnt work the temperature in the house drops to zero when the boy isnt trying to do something for his father he works to keep a fire going in the living room where they retreat plus the animals in the barn need food the cows need milking the boy struggles through the storm to reach the barn and keep them alive with the pipes frozen he cant get water from the well he melts snow in pots near the fire he heats canned soup for his dad but the mans too sick to keep it down finally the boy hears a snowplow on a nearby road in desperation he dresses as warmly as he can he fights through drifts to try to reach the road so basically its a young adult book the head of marketing interrupted without enthusiasm young adult is trade jargon for juvenile a teenager might read it as an adventure but an adult will see far more than that i explained the emotions carry a world of meaning does the boy save the father the new ceo asked he came from gladstones broadcast division yes although the boy nearly dies in the process well at least it isnt a downer the head of marketing shook his head skeptically a couple of days on a farm in a blizzard feels small bestselling novels need global threats and international conspiracies i promiseon the page those few days feel huge the tenyearold becomes the father the sick father becomes the son at first the boys overwhelmed then he manages almost superhuman efforts child in jeopardy the book wont appeal to women whats the title mean the epigraph indicates that the architecture of snow is a quote from an emerson poem about how everything in life is connected as if covered by snow the ceo looked bored has anybody heard of the author no a first novel a small subject itll be hard to persuade the talk shows to promote the book i dont see movie potential send the usual rejection letter cant i felt on the verge of risking my job the author didnt give a return address a typical amateur i dont think so i paused about to take the biggest gamble of my career but if my suspicion was correct i no longer needed to worry about my job the books beautifully powerfully written it has a distinctive hypnotic rhythm the punctuations distinctive also an unusual use of dashes and italics a father and a son lost innocence the books style and theme are synonymous with i took the chance they remind me of r j wentworth the ceo thought a moment the sand castle we sold eight million copies so far a hundred thousand paperbacks to colleges this year alone youre suggesting someone imitated his style not at all then i dont believe its an imitation i think peter thomas is r j wentworth the room became so quiet i heard traffic outside twenty stories below us but isnt wentworth dead a marketer asked wasnt he killed in a car accident in the sixties not exactly october three disasters happened simultaneously a movie based on one of wentworths short stories premiered that month the story was called the fortune teller but the studio changed the title to a valentine for two it also added a couple of songs those changes confirmed wentworths suspicions about hollywood the only reason he sold the rights to the short story was that every producer was begging for the sand castle and he decided to use the fortune teller as a test case he lived with his wife and two sons in connecticut the family begged him to drive them into manhattan for the premier to see how truly bad the film was and laugh it off en route rain turned to sleet the car flipped off the road wentworths wife and two sons were killed the film turned out to be dreadful the storys new england setting became a cruise ship a teenage idol played the main characteroriginally a college professor but now a dance instructor every review was scathing nearly all of them blamed wentworth for giving hollywood the chance to pervert a beloved story most critics wrote their attacks in mock wentworth prose with his distinctive rhythms and his odd use of dashes and italics meanwhile his new book a collection of two novellas opposites attract was published the same day march amp sons wanted to take advantage of the movie publicity of course when the date was originally chosen no one could have known how rotten the movie would be by the time rumors spread it was too late to change the schedule reviewers already had the book in their hands it was charming it was entertaining in many places it was even meaningful but it wasnt as magnificent as the sand castle anticipation led to disappointment which turned to nastiness many reviewers crowed that wentworth wasnt the genius some had reputed him to be they took another look at the sand castle and now faulted passages in it all on the same day i told the marketingeditorial committee october wentworth blamed everything on himself his fiction is influenced by transcendental writers like emerson and thoreau so it isnt surprising that he followed thoreaus example and retreated to the new england countryside where he bought a house on two acres outside a small town called tipton in vermont he enclosed the property with a high fence and that was the end of his public life college students began romanticizing his retreat to the countrysidethe grieving guiltridden author father and husband living in isolation when the paperback of opposites attract was published it became a twoyear bestseller more than that it was suddenly perceived as a minor masterpiece not the sand castle of course but far superior to what critics had first maintained with each year of his seclusion his reputation increased how do you know so much about him the head of marketing asked i wrote several essays about him when i was an undergrad at penn state and youre convinced this is a genuine wentworth manuscript one of the tantalizing rumors about him is that although he never published anything after he kept writing every day he implied as much to a highschool student who knocked on his gate and actually got an interview with him those essays you wrote made you an expert youre confident you can tell the real thing from an imitation the books set in vermont where wentworth retreated the boy limps from frostbite on his right foot the same foot wentworth injured in the accident but i have another reason to believe its genuine wentworths editor the man who discovered him was samuel carver carver the ceo leaned forward in surprise after more than forty years wentworth finally sent his editor a manuscript why the pseudonym that doesnt make sense i dont have an answer but the absence of a letter and a return address tells me that the author expected carver to know how to get in touch with him i can think of only one author who could take that for granted jesus the ceo said if we can prove this was written by wentworth every talk show would want him the head of marketing enthused a legendary hermit coming out of seclusion a solitary genius ready to tell his story cnn would jump at the chance the today show sixty minutes hed easily make the cover of the major magazines wed have a guaranteed numberone bestseller wait a second a marketer asked how old is he in his early eighties i answered maybe he can barely talk maybe hed be useless on the today show thats one of a lot of things you need to find out the ceo told me track him down find out if he wrote this manuscript our parent company wants a twentypercent increase in profits we wont do that by promoting authors who sell only fifty thousand hardbacks we need a million seller im meeting the gladstone executives on monday they want to know what progress were making it would be fabulous if i could tell them we have wentworth i tried to telephone wentworths agent to see if she had contact information but it turned out that his agent had died twelve years earlier and that no arrangements were made for anyone else to represent wentworth who wasnt expected to publish again i called vermonts telephone directory assistance and learned that wentworth didnt have a listed phone number the authors guild couldnt help either my ceo walked in what did he tell you does he admit hes the author i havent been able to ask him i cant find a way to contact him this is too important go up to vermont knock on his door keep knocking until he answers i checked google maps and located tipton in the southern part of vermont a google search revealed that few people lived there it was hard to reach by plane or train so the next morning i rented a car and drove six hours north through connecticut and massachusetts in midoctober vermonts mapletreecovered hills had glorious colors although i was too preoccupied to give them full attention with difficultybecause a crossroads wasnt clearly markedi reached tipton population only after dark and checked into one of its few motels without getting a look at the town at eight the next morning i stepped from my room and breathed cool clean air rustic buildings lined the main street mostly white clapboards with highpitched roofs a church steeple towered above a square calm clean quiet ordered the contrast with manhattan was dramatic down the street a sign read megs pantry as i passed an antique store i had the palpable sense of former years i imagined that except for satellite dishes and suvs tipton looked the same now as it had a hundred years earlier perhaps even two hundred years earlier a plaque confirmed my suspicion jeremiah tipton constructed this building in when i opened the door the smell of coffee pancakes eggs bacon and hash browns overwhelmed me a dozen ruddyfaced patrons looked up from their breakfasts my pale cheeks made me selfconscious as did my slacks and sports coat amid jeans and checkered wool shirts i obviously wasnt a local not that i sensed hostility a town that earned its income from tourists tolerated strangers as they resumed their murmured conversations i sat at the counter a grayhaired woman with spectacles came over gave me a menu and pulled a notepad from an apron whats the special i asked corned beef and eggs i didnt have an appetite but i knew i couldnt establish rapport if my bill wasnt high enough for the waitress to expect a good tip ill take it coffee you bet regular and orange juice when she brought the food i said towns kind of quiet gets busy on the weekends especially now that the leaves are in color when she brought the check i said im told theres a writer who lives in the neighborhood r j wentworth everyone looked at me wentworth i dont think i ever heard of him the waitress said mind you im not a reader youd love his books the obvious response to a statement like that is really what are they about but all i received was a guarded look keep the change i said subtlety not having worked i went outside and noticed a little more activity on the street some of it wasnt reassuring a rumpled guy in ragged clothes came out of an alley he had the vacant look of a druggy other movement caught my attention a slender man wearing a cap and a windbreaker reached a bookstore across the street unlocked its door and went in when i crossed to it i saw that most of the volumes in the window had lush covers depicting covered bridges autumn foliage or snowcovered slopes with titles related to vermonts history and beauty but one volume small and plain was a history of tipton i tried the door and found it was locked through the window i saw the slender man take off his windbreaker his cap was already off revealing thin hair he turned toward the rattling doorknob and shook his head motioning courteously for me to leave when i pretended to be confused he walked over and unlocked the door im not open yet can you come back in an hour sure i want to buy that book in the windowthe history of tipton that caught his attention youve got excellent taste come in an overhead bell rang when he opened the door wider the store was filled with pleasant mustiness he tugged a pen from his shirt pocket ill autograph the book for you youre the author guilty i looked at the cover tales of historic tipton by jonathan wade im from new york an editor for march amp sons its always a pleasure to meet an author youre here to see the colors a little pleasure with business i paid for the book business an author lives around here oh r j wentworth oh i need to speak to him couldnt you just write him a letter i dont have his address i see wade pointed at the book in my hands and you thought perhaps the address is in there the thought crossed my mind you wont find it still want to buy the book absolutely i love history and when i meet an author im always curious to see how he writes not with the brilliance of r j wentworth i regret to say we used to get people asking about him all the time thirty years ago my father had a thriving business selling wentworths books to people who asked about him in fact without wentworth my father wouldnt have made a living nor would anybody else in town for that matter tipton would have dried up if not for the tourists wentworth attracted but not anymore his fans got old i guess and people dont read much these days so a waitress across the street told me this town owes him a lot even if he didnt mean to do us a favor in these parts if youre not born here youre always an outsider but after more than forty years of living here hes definitely one of us you wont find anybody wholl tell you where he is i wouldnt be able to look him in the eyes if i violated his privacy in the eyes i asked feeling a chill you mean youve spoken with him despite bobs reputation for being a hermit he isnt antisocial bob i asked in greater amazement the familiarity sounded almost profane his first name is robert after all he insists on being called bob he comes into town on occasion buys books eats at the pantry gets a haircut watches a baseball game at the tavern down the street i continued to be astounded not often and certainly never on a weekend during peak tourist season wade continued he picks times when he knows he can move around without being bothered even at his age youd be surprised but whats he like polite considerate he doesnt make assumptions about himself what i mostly notice is how clear his eyes are youve read his work many times then you know how much hes influenced by transcendental writers like emerson and thoreau calm still reflective its soothing to be around him but you wont help me meet him definitely not could you at least phone him and try to arrange a meeting cant okay i understand im not sure you do i literally cant bob doesnt have a telephone and im not about to knock on his door why do you need to talk to him i told wade about the manuscript i think its his work but it doesnt have his name on it i added the detail that i hoped would made wade cooperate it was addressed to his editor but unfortunately his editor died recently they were friends i wonder if hes been told i only have your word that youre an editor heres my business card twenty years ago a man showed me a business card claiming he worked in the white house he said the president wanted to give bob an award but he turned out to be an assistant to a hollywood producer who wanted the movie rights for the sand castle what harm would it do to put a note in his mailbox ive never intruded on him im not about to start now outside a pickup truck rattled past a few more locals appeared on the sidewalk another rumpled guy came out of an alley a halfblock to my right a jeep was parked outside an office marked tipton realty i walked over and pretended to admire a display of properties for sale farms cabins and historiclooking homes when i stepped inside the hardwood floor creaked the smell of furniture polish reminded me of my grandmothers house at an antique desk an attractive redhaired woman looked up from a computer screen may i help you her voice was pleasant i was wondering if you had a map of the roads around here my vermont map doesnt provide much detail looking for property dont know yet as you can probably tell im not from around here but the scenerys so magnificent i thought i might drive around and see if anything appeals to me a weekend place to live something like that youre from new york right its that obvious i meet a lot of people passing through im a good judge of accents new yorks a little far to have a weekend place here im not sure it would be just for weekends im a book editor but ive given some thought to writing a novel this attracted her interest i hear the location has inspired other writers i said doesnt john irving live in vermont and david mamet and grace paley and r j wentworth i said doesnt he live around here her expression became guarded great writer i said her tone was now curt youll find maps on that table as i walked to my car i thought that the cia or the mafia ought to send their recruits for training in tipton the townspeople knew how to keep secrets i chose north driving along brilliantly wooded back roads the fragrance of the falling leaves was powerful reminding me of my boyhood on long island of helping my father rake the yard he burned the leaves in a pit behind our house he always let me strike the match he died from a heart attack when i was twelve i turned up a dirt road passed a cabin reached a wall of trees and went back to the main road farther along i turned up another dirt road passed two cabins reached a stream that blocked the road and again went back my search wasnt as aimless as it seemed after all i knew what i was looking for a high fence that enclosed a couple of acres the female student whod been fortunate enough to get an interview with wentworth years earlier described the property the high gate was almost indistinguishable from the fence she wrote the mailbox was embedded in the fence and had a hatch on the opposite side so that wentworth didnt need to leave the compound to get his mail a sign warned no solicitors no trespassing but nothing in the north sector matched that description of course the students interview was two decades old wentworth might have changed things since then in which case i was wasting my time how far away from town would he have wanted to live i arbitrarily decided that fifteen miles was too far and switched my search to the side roads in the west more farms and cabins more falling leaves and wood smoke by the time i finished the western sector and headed south the afternoon light was fading my cell phone rang have you found him yet my boss demanded the reception was so poor i could barely hear him when i explained the problems i was having he interrupted just get it done if wentworth wrote this book remind him his last contract with march amp sons gives us the option on it theres no way im going to let anybody else publish it do you have the agreement with you in my jacket make sure you get him to sign it hell want to talk to an agent you told me his agents dead anyway why does he need an agent within reason well give him whatever he wants the transmission crackled thisll go a long way toward proving youre a necessary part of the team the crackle worsened dont disappoint call soon find with renewed motivation i searched the southern sector not giving up until dark in town i refilled the gas tank ready for an early start the next morning then i walked along the shadowy main street noticing for sale signs on a lot of doors the financial troubles gave me an idea tipton realty had its lights on i knocked come in a womans voice said as i entered i couldnt help noticing my haggard reflection on the doors window again the hardwood floor creaked busy day the same woman sat at the desk she was about her lush red hair hung past her shoulders her bright green eyes were hard to look away from i saw a lot of beautiful country did you find him find bob wentworth everybody in town knows youre looking for him i glanced down i guess id make a poor spy no i didnt find him i held out my hand tom neal she shook it becky shafer i cant get used to people calling him bob i gather youve met him not as much as other people in tipton im new oh yeah i came here only twelve years ago i chuckled i drove into town with my artist boyfriend she explained we loved the quiet and the scenery we decided to stay the boyfriends long gone but im still a newcomer sorry about the boyfriend i noticed she didnt wear a wedding ring no need to be sorry he turned out to be a creep a lot of that going around i thought of my ceo she gave me a look that made me think she applied the word to me i do have an important reason to see him i said after i told her about the manuscript she thought a moment but why would he use a pseudonym thats one of many things id like to ask him thinking of the for sale signs i took my chance to propose my idea to hear the old timers tell it things got crazy here with so many fans wanting to talk to him you can imagine the effect a new book would create the publicity the pentup demand this town would attract a lot of fans again it would be like the excitement of thirty years ago i let the temptation sink in becky didnt respond for several moments her gaze hardened so all i need to do is show you where bob lives and in exchange next year ill have more business than i can handle when you put it that way i guess thats right gosh i didnt realize it was so late she pulled her car keys from her purse youll have to excuse me i need to go home the weathered old tipton tavern was presumably the place wade told me about where wentworth sometimes watched a baseball game there was indeed a baseball game on the televison but i was the main interest patrons setting down their drinks and looking at me as much as i could tell from recalling the photograph on wentworths books a leanfaced darkhaired man with soulful eyes he wasnt in the room heading back to the motel i didnt go far before i heard wary footsteps behind me a cold breeze made me shiver as i glanced back toward the shadowy street the footsteps ended i resumed walking and again heard the footsteps my manhattan instincts took charge not quite running i passed my car and reached the motel my cold hands fumbled with the room key in the night glass broke outside my room i phoned the front desk but no one answered in the morning not having slept well i went out to my car and found the drivers window shattered a rock lay on the seat the radio was gone the surprised desk clerk told me the town constable runs the barbershop yes weve been having incidents lately the heavyset barberconstable trimmed an elderly mans spindly hair a bicycle was stolen a cabin was broken into i took a close look at the man in the chair and decided he wasnt wentworth towns changing outsiders are hanging around the barber continued i recalled the two druggies id seen emerge from an alley the previous day what are you going to do about it contact the state police i hoped the problem would go away as the weather got colder please remember i reported the stolen radio the rental car agency will contact you trying to catch him off guard i added where does bob wentworth live the barber almost responded then caught himself cant say but like a bad poker player he hadnt been able to repress a glance past me toward the right side of the street i went to the left to avoid suspicion then i walked around the block and returned to the main street out of sight of the barbershop as i stepped from an alley i again had the sense that someone followed but when i looked behind me i seemed alone more people were on the sidewalk many dressed like outsiders the town finally attracting business as the weekend approached but the locals paid attention only to me trying to look casual i went into a quilt shop then continued down the street wentworth didnt live on a country road i now realized with growing excitement he lived in town but id checked all the side streets in fact id used some of those streets to drive north west south and east where was he hiding i walked to the end of the street in a park of brilliant maples dead leaves crunched under my shoes as i followed a stream along the edge of town i soon reached a tall fence my cell phone rang i hope youve found him a stern voice warned im making progress i want more than progress the gladstone executives phoned to remind me they expect a better profit picture when i report on monday i hinted id have major news get wentworth a locked gate sealed off a lane i managed to climb over tearing a button off my sports jacket sunlight cast the shadows of branches to my left were the backyards of houses but on my right the fence stretched on a crow cawed leaves rattled as i came to a door that blended with the fence signs warned no solicitors and no trespassing a mailbox was recessed into the fence when i knocked on the door the crow stopped cawing the door shook i waited then knocked again this time harder the noise echoed i knocked a third time mr wentworth leaves fell mr wentworth my names tom neal i work for march amp sons i need to talk to you about a manuscript we think you sent a breeze chilled my face i knocked a fourth time mr wentworth finally i took out a pen and a notepad i thought about writing that carver was dead but that seemed a harsh way for wentworth to get the news so i gave him the name of the motel where i was staying and left my cellphone number then i remembered that wentworth didnt have a phone but if he sometimes left his compound he could use a phone in town i concluded or he could walk to the motel im shoving a note under the gate back in the park i sat on a bench and tried to enjoy the view but the breeze got cooler after an hour i returned to wentworths gate a corner of my note remained visible under it mr wentworth please i need to talk to you its important maybe hes gone for a walk in the woods i thought or maybe he isnt even in town hell he might be in a hospital somewhere did you find him in the tavern i looked up from a glass of beer no strictly speaking it wasnt a lie becky shafer stood next to me at the bar her green eyes were as hypnotic as on the previous evening i thought about our conversation last night i came to apologize for being abrupt hey im from new york remember its impossible to be abrupt to me anyway i cant blame you for trying to protect someone who lives here may i sit down i welcome the company can i buy you a beer rye and diet coke rye i admire an honest drinker she laughed as the bartender took my order maybe it would be good for the town if bob published another book who knows its just that i dont like to feel manipulated im so used to being manipulated it feels normal she gave me a questioning look when i first became an editor all i needed to worry about was helping an author write a good book but now conglomerates own just about every publisher they think of books as commodities if authors dont sell a hundred thousand copies the head office doesnt care about them and editors who dont find the next blockbuster are taking up space every morning i go to march amp sons wondering if i still work there i know what you mean becky sipped her drink im also an attorney my surprised look made her nod yep harvard law school im impressed so was the boston law firm that hired me but i couldnt bear how the senior partners pitted us against each other to see who generated the most fees thats why i ended here i dont earn much money but i sure enjoy waking up each morning i dont hear many people say that stay here longer maybe youll be able to say it walking back to the motel i again heard footsteps as on the previous night they stopped when i turned toward the shadows their echo resumed when i moved on thinking of my broken car window i increased speed my cell phone rang but i didnt have time to answer it only after i hurried into my room and locked the door did i listen to the message hoping it was from wentworth but the voice belonged to my ceo youre taking too long he told me mr wentworth at nine the next morning amid a strong breeze i pounded on his gate its really important that i talk to you about your manuscript and sam carver i need to talk to you about him i stared at the bottom of the gate part of my note still remained visible a thought from yesterday struck me maybe he isnt home maybe hes in a hospital somewhere or maybea new thought struck hardermaybe he is home maybe hes sick too sick to come to the gate mr wentworth i hammered the gate are you all right i tried the knob but it didnt turn mr wentworth can you hear me is anything wrong do you need help perhaps there was another way in chilled by the strengthening breeze i returned the way i had come and climbed back into the park i followed the fence to a corner then continued along the back struggling through dense trees and undergrowth indeed there was another way in hidden among bushes a gate shuddered as i pounded mr wentworth i shoved a branch away and tried the knob but it too wouldnt turn i rammed my shoulder against the gate but it held firm a tree grew next to the fence i grabbed a branch and pulled myself up higher branches acted as steps buffeted by the wind i straddled the fence squirmed over dangled and dropped to a pile of soft leaves immediately i felt a difference the wind stopped sounds were muted the air became cushioned as if a bubble enclosed the property a buffer of some kind no doubt the tall fence caused the muffling effect or maybe it was because id entered sacred territory as far as i knew i was one of the few ever to set foot there although i breathed quickly i felt a hush apples hung on trees or lay on the ground amid leaves a few raspberries remained on bushes a vegetable garden contained the frostbrowned remnants of tomato plants pumpkins and acorn squash bulged from vines continuing to be enveloped in a hush i walked along a stone path ahead were a gazebo a cottage and a smaller building mr wentworth when i rounded the gazebo and headed toward the cottage i heard a door creak open a man stepped out he wore sneakers jeans and a sweater he was slender with slightly graying hair he had dark intense eyes he had a pistol in his hand wait i jerked up my hands thinking my god hes been living alone for so long he lost his mind hes going to shoot me walk to the front gate this isnt what it looks like my chest cramped i thought you were ill i came to see if i can help stay ahead of me my names tom neal i knocked on the gate move i left a note im an editor for march amp sons please i need to talk to you about a manuscript i think you sent us it was addressed to sam carver hes dead i took over his duties thats why stop the man said his command made the air feel stiller crows cawing squirrels scampering along branches leaves fallingeverything seemed to halt sams dead the man frowned as if the notion was unthinkable a week ago monday slowly he lowered the gun he had wentworths sensitive features and soulful eyes but wentworth would be in his early eighties and this man looked twenty years younger his cheeks aglow who are you i asked the man rubbed his forehead in shock what who nobody bobs son hes out of town im watching the house for him bobs son but that didnt make sense the child would have been born when wentworth was around before he got married before the sand castle was published later the furor of interest in wentworth was so great that it would have been impossible to keep an illegitimate child a secret the man continued to look shocked what happened to sam i explained about the firms new owner and how carver was fired the way you talk about the bus are you suggesting i dont think sam had much to live for the look on his face when he carried his belongings from the office the man seemed to peer at something far away too late what despondent he shook his head from side to side the gate selflocks let yourself out as he turned toward the cottage he limped youre not wentworths son he paused the limps from your accident youre r j wentworth you look twenty years younger i dont know how thats possible but thats who you are ive never been looked at so deeply sam was your friend i admired him his dark eyes assessed me wait here when he limped from the house he held a teapot and two cups he looked so awkward that i reached to help we sat in the gazebo the air felt more cushioned and soothing my sense of reality was tested r j wentworth could i actually be talking to him how can you look twenty years younger than you are wentworth ignored the question and poured the tea he stared at the steaming fluid his voice was tight i met sam carver in after he found the sand castle in a stack of unsolicited manuscripts at the time i was a teacher in a grade school in connecticut my wife taught there also i didnt know about agents and how publishing worked all i knew about was children and the sadness of watching them grow up the sand castle was rejected by twenty publishers if sam hadnt found it id probably have remained a teacher which in the long run would have been better for me and certainly for my family sam understood that after the accident he was as regretful as i that the sand castle gained the attention it did he raised his cup to sam to sam i sipped tasting a hint of cinnamon and cloves he and his wife visited me each summer he was a true friend perhaps my only one after his wife died he didnt come here again however you sent him the architecture of snow wentworth nodded sam wrote me a letter that explained what was happening at march amp sons you described his stunned look when he was fired well he may have been stunned but he wasnt surprised he saw it coming i sent the manuscript so he could pretend to make one last discovery and buy himself more time at the company but why didnt you use your real name because i wanted the manuscript to stand on its own i didnt want the novel to be published because of the mystique that developed after i disappeared the deaths of my wife and two sons caused that mystique i couldnt bear using their deaths to get the book published the manuscripts brilliant he hesitated thank you ive never heard anyone speak more humbly youve been writing all these years all these years he sipped his tea after a thoughtful silence he stood and motioned for me to follow we left the gazebo limping he took me to the small building next to the cottage he unlocked its door and led me inside his writing studio for a moment my heart beat faster then the hush of the room spread through me the place had the calm of a sanctuary i noticed a fireplace a desk a chair and a manual typewriter i have five more machines just like itin case i need parts wentworth said i imagined the typewriters bell sounding when wentworth reached the end of each line a ream of paper lay next to the typewriter along with a package of carbon paper a window directed light from behind the desk and in front of the desk i approached shelves upon which were arranged twentyone manuscripts i counted them twenty one they sent a shiver through me all these years i repeated writing can be a form of meditation and you never felt the urge to have them published to satisfy an ego i worked hard to eliminate no but isnt an unread book the equivalent of one hand clapping he shrugged it would mean returning to the world but you did send a manuscript to sam as peter thomas as a favor to my friend but i had doubts that the ploy would work in his final letter sam said the changes in publishing were too grim to be described true in the old days an editor read a manuscript liked it and bought it but now the manuscript goes to the marketing department first if the sales numbers the marketers estimate arent high enough the book wont be accepted wentworth was appalled how can a book with an original vision get published after a while everything will be the same the strain on your face now i understand you hate the business the way its become then why do you stay because god help me i remember how excited i felt when i discovered a wonderful new book and found readers for it i keep hoping corporations will realize books arent potato chips wentworths searching eyes were amazingly clear i felt selfconscious as if he saw directly into me sensing my frustration its a pleasant day why dont we go back to the gazebo he suggested i have some things i need to do but perhaps you could pass the time by reading one of these manuscripts id like your opinion for a moment i was too surprised to respond youre serious an editors perspective would be helpful the last thing you need is my help i couldnt believe my good fortune but id love to read something else youve written wentworths chores turned out to be raking leaves putting them in a compost bin and cleaning his gardens for winter surrounded by the calming air i sat in the gazebo and watched him reminded of my father amid the muted sounds of crows squirrels and leaves i finished my cup of tea poured another and started the manuscript a cloud of witnesses i read about a slum in boston where a fiveyearold boy named eddie lived with his mother who was seldom at home the implication was that she haunted bars prostituting herself in exchange for alcohol because eddie was forbidden to leave the crummy apartment the even worse hallways were filled with drug dealers and perverts he didnt have any friends the television was broken he resorted to the radio and by trial and error found a station with an afternoon callin program you get it straight from jake hosted by a comedian named jake barton jake had an irreverent way of relating to the days events and even though eddie didnt understand most of the events referred to he loved the way jake talked in fact jake accomplished a rare thinghe made eddie laugh as i turned the pages the sound of crows squirrels and leaves became muffled i heard wentworth raking but as if from a great distance farther and fainter my vision narrowed until i was conscious only of the page in front of me eddie looking forward to each days broadcast of you get it straight from jake eddie laughing at jakes tone eddie wishing he had a father like jake eddie a hand nudged my shoulder the touch so gentle i barely felt it tom a voice whispered uh tom wake up my eyelids flickered wentworth stood before me it was difficult to see him everything was so shadowy i was flat on my back on the bench i jerked upright my god i fell asleep i said you certainly did wentworth looked amused i glanced around it was dusk all day i slept all day im so sorry why well i barge in on you but youre generous enough to let me read a manuscript and then i fall asleep reading it and you needed the rest otherwise you wouldnt have dozed dozed i havent slept that soundly in years it had nothing to do with your books wonderful its moving and painful and yet funny and i just got to the part where jake announces hes been fired from the radio station and eddie cant bear losing the only thing in his life he enjoys theres plenty of time read more after we eat eat i made soup and a salad but i cant impose i insist except for a stove and refrigerator the kitchen might have looked the same two hundred years earlier the floor the cabinets and the walls were aged wood with a golden hue that made me think they were maple the table and chairs were dark perhaps oak with dents here and there from a lifetime of use flaming logs crackled in a fireplace i smelled freshly baked bread and for the first time in a long while felt hungry the soup was vegetable i ate three servings and two helpings of salad not to mention a half loaf of bread the potatoes tomatoes onions and carrots everything in the soup comes from my garden wentworth explained the growing season is brief here i need to be resourceful for example the lettuce comes from a late summer planting that i keep in a glass frame so i can harvest it in the winter the fresh taste was powerful warming my stomach somehow i had room for two slices of apple pie which was also homemade the fruit from wentworths trees and tea two cups of tea helping to clean the dishes i yawned embarrassed i covered my mouth sorry dont be its natural to feel sleepy after we eat thats what mammals do after they eat they sleep but i slept all day a sign of how much rest you need lie down on the sofa in the living room read more of my book but i ought to go back to my motel room nonsense limping wentworth guided me into the living room the furnishings reminded me of those i saw long ago in my grandmothers house the sofa was covered with a blanket i wont be an imposition i welcome your reaction to my manuscript i wont let you take it with you to the motel so if you want to read it you need to do it here i suppressed another yawn so tired that i knew i wouldnt be alert enough to deal with anyone following me to the motel thank you youre more than welcome wentworth brought me the rest of the manuscript and again i felt amazed that i was in his company the fireplace warmed me on the sofa i sat against a cushion and turned the pages once more absorbed in the story jake announced that his sense of humor had gotten him fired from the radio station he told his listeners that he had only two more broadcasts and then would leave boston for a talk show in cincinnati eddie was devastated he hadnt seen his mother in two days all he had to eat was peanut butter and crackers he put them in a pillowcase he added his only change of clothes then went to the door and listened he heard footsteps somebody cursed when the sounds became distant eddie did the forbiddenhe unlocked and opened the door the lights were broken in most of the hallway garbage was stacked in corners the smell of urine and cabbage made eddie sick shadows threatened but the curses and footsteps were more distant and eddie stepped through the doorway the crackling in wentworths fireplace seemed to come from far away like the faint tap of a typewriter the hand on my shoulder was again so gentle i barely felt it when i opened my eyes wentworth stood over me but this time he was silhouetted by light good morning he smiled morning its eleven oclock i slept thirteen hours i asked in shock youre more tired than i imagined would you like some breakfast my stomach rumbled i couldnt recall waking up with so strong an appetite starved just give me a moment to theres an extra toothbrush and razor in the bathroom as i washed my face i was puzzled by my reflection in the mirror my cheeks were no longer drawn wrinkles on my brow and around my eyes were less distinct my eyes looked bright my skin healthy at the kitchen table i ate a fruit salad wentworth preparedoranges bananas pears and apples the latter two from his trees he reminded me i refilled my bowl three times as always there was tea is it drugged is that why im sleeping so much wentworth almost smiled we both drank from the same pot wouldnt i have been sleepy also i studied him as hard as he had studied me despite his age his cheeks glowed his eyes were clear his hair was gray instead of white youre in your early eighties correct correct but you look at least twenty years younger i dont understand perhaps you do i glanced around the old kitchen i peered toward the trees and bushes outside the sun cast a glow on falling leaves this place a similar compound in another area would have produced the same effect but yes this place over the years i acquired a natural rhythm i lived with the land i blended with the passage of the sun and moon and seasons after a while i noticed a change in my appearance or rather the lack of change in my appearance i wasnt aging at the rate that i should have i came to savor the delight of waking each day and enjoying what my small version of the universe had in store for me that doesnt seem compatible with your gun i brought that with me when i first retreated here the loss of my family each morning was a struggle not to shoot myself i looked away selfconscious but one day crept into another somehow i persisted i read emerson and thoreau again and again trying to empty myself of my notsoquiet desperation along with these infinite two acres emerson and thoreau saved my life i came to feel my family through the flowers and trees and nothing dies its only transformed i know what youre thinkingthat i found a sentimental way to compensate perhaps i did but compare your life to mine when you came here when you snuck onto my property you looked so desperate that for the first time in many years i was frightened i knew that homes had been broken into i got the gun from a drawer i hoped i wouldnt need to defend myself shame burned my cheeks perhaps id better go then i realized you were truly desperate not because of drugs or greed but because of a profound unhappiness i invited you to stay because i hoped this place would save you as so often with wentworth i couldnt speak finally i managed to say thank you and was reminded of how humbly he used those words when i told him how brilliant the architecture of snow was i have some coveralls that might fit you he said would you like to help me clean my gardens it was one of the finest afternoons of my life raking leaves trimming frostkilled flowers putting them in the compost bin we harvested squash and apples the only day i can compare it to was my final afternoon with my father so long ago a comparably lovely autumn day when we raked leaves before my father bent over and died a sound jolted me my cell phone i looked at the caller id display finally the ringing stopped wentworth gave me a questioning look my boss i explained you dont want to talk to him hes meeting the companys directors on monday hes under orders to squeeze out more profits he wants to announce that the architecture of snow is on our list wentworth glanced at the falling leaves would the announcement help you my instructions are not to come back if i dont return with a signed contract wentworth looked as if id told a slight joke that explains what drove you to climb over my fence i really did worry that you were ill of course wentworth studied more falling leaves monday yes if you go back youll lose sleep again somebodys got to fight them maybe we need to save ourselves before we save anything else how would you like to help me split firewood for supper we ate the rest of the soup the bread and the apple pie they tasted as fresh as on the previous night again i felt sleepy but this time from unaccustomed physical exertion my skin glowed from the sun and the breeze i finished my tea and yawned id better get back to the motel no lie on the sofa finish my manuscript the logs crackled i might have heard the distant clatter of a typewriter as i turned the pages in the story eddie braved the dangers of the ratinfested apartment building needing all his cleverness to escape perverts and drug dealers outside on a dark rainy street he faced greater dangers every shadow was a threat meanwhile a chapter about jake revealed that he was a nasty drunk when he wasnt on the air the stations owner was glad for the chance to fire him when jake insulted one of the sponsors during the program but eddie idealized him and was ready to brave anything to find him as the rain fell harder he wondered how to find the radio station he couldnt just ask a stranger on the street he saw a store that sold newspapers and magazines and hurried from awning to awning toward it this time wentworth didnt need to touch me i sensed his presence and opened my eyes to the glorious morning did you sleep well very but im afraid i didnt finish it im where eddie found the radio stations address in next time wentworth said next time when you come back you can finish it youd like me to come back instead of answering wentworth said ive given your problem a great deal of thought before i tell you my decision i want you to tell me what you think of my manuscript so far i love it and if i were your author is that all youd say to me as an editor is there nothing you want changed the sentences are wonderful your styles so consistent it would be difficult to change anything without causing problems in other places does that imply a few sections would benefit from changes just a few cuts a few why so hesitant are you overwhelmed by the great mans talent do you know how sam and i worked as editor and author we fought over every page he wasnt satisfied until he made me justify every word in every sentence some authors wouldnt have put up with it but i loved the experience he challenged me he made me try harder and reach deeper if you were my editor what would you say to challenge me you really want an answer i took a breath i meant what i said this is a terrific book its moving and dramatic and funny when it needs to be and i love it but the boy in the architecture of snow struggles through a blizzard to save his father eddie in this novel struggles to get out of a slum and find a father youre running variations on a theme an important theme granted but the same one as in the sand castle continue that may be why the critics turned against your last book because it was a variation on the sand castle also maybe some writers only have one theme perhaps thats true but if i were your editor id push you to learn if that were the case wentworth considered me with those clear probing eyes my father molested me when i was eight i felt as if id been hit my mother found out and divorced him we moved to another city i never saw my father again she never remarried fathers and sons a powerful need when a boys growing up thats why i became a gradeschool teacher to be a surrogate father for the children who needed one its the reason i became a writer to understand the hollowness in me i lied to you i told you that when i heard you coming across the yard when i saw your desperate features i pulled my gun from a drawer to protect myself in fact the gun was already in my hand friday the day you crawled over the fence do you know what date it was no october october the date sounded vaguely familiar then it hit me oh the day your family died in the accident for the first time wentworth started to look his true age his cheeks shrinking his eyes clouding i deceive myself by blaming my work i trick myself into thinking that if i hadnt sold the fortune teller to hollywood we wouldnt have driven to new york to see the damned movie but the movie didnt kill my family the movie wasnt driving the car when it flipped the weather turned bad it was an accident so i tell myself but every time i write another novel about a father and a son i think about my two boys crushed in a heap of steel each year it seems easier to handle but some anniversaries even after all these years the gun was in your hand in my mouth i want to save you because you saved me ill sign a contract for the architecture of snow throughout the long drive back to manhattan i felt a familiar heaviness creep over me i reached my apartment around midnight but as wentworth predicted i slept poorly terrific my boss slapped my back when i gave him the news monday morning outstanding i wont forget this after the magic of the compound the office was depressing but wentworth has three conditions i said fine fine just give me the contract you took up there to get signed he didnt sign it what but you said that contracts made out to r j wentworth he wants another contract one made out to peter thomas the pseudonym on the manuscript thats the first condition the second is that the book needs to be published with the name peter thomas on the cover the head of marketing gasped the third condition is that wentworth wont do interviews now the head of marketing turned red as if choking on something well lose cnn and the today show and the magazine covers and no interviews that makes it worthless my ceo complained who the hells going to buy a book about a kid in a snowstorm when its authors a nobody those are his conditions couldnt you talk him out of that he wants the book to speak for itself he says part of the reason hes famous is that his family died he wont capitalize on that and he wont allow himself to be asked about it worthless my boss moaned how can i tell the gladstone executives we wont have a million seller ill lose my job youve already lost yours theres a way to get around wentworths conditions a voice said everyone looked in that direction toward the person next to me my assistant who wore his usual black turtleneck and black sports jacket make out the contract to peter thomas my assistant continued put in clauses guaranteeing that the book will be published under that name and that there wont be any interviews werent you listening an unknown author no interviews no serial killer or global conspiracy in the plot well be lucky to sell ten copies a million youll get the million my assistant promised will you please start making sense the internet will take care of everything a month from pub date ill leak rumors to hundreds of chat groups ill put up a fan website on the social networks ill spread the word that wentworths the actual author ill point out parallels between his early work and this one ill talk about the mysterious arrival of the manuscript just as his editor died ill mention that a march and sons editor robert neal had a weekend conference at wentworths home in october something that can be verified by checking with the motel where mr neal stayed ill juice it up until everyone buys the rumor believe me the internet thrives on gossip itll get out of control fast since what passes for news these days is half speculation reporters and tv commentators will do pieces about the rumors after a week itll be taken for granted that peter thomas is r j wentworth people will want to be the first to buy the book to see what all the fuss is about believe me youll sell a million copies i was too stunned to say anything so were the others finally my boss opened his mouth i love the way this guy thinks he gave me a dismissive glance take the new contract back to wentworth tell him hell get everything he wants so on tuesday i drove back to tipton because i was now familiar with the route i made excellent time and arrived at four in the afternoon indeed i often broke the speed limit eager to see wentworth again and warn him how march amp sons intended to betray him i saw the smoke before i got to town as i approached the main street i found it deserted with a terrible premonition i stopped at the park the smoke shrouded wentworths compound his fence was down a fire engine rumbled next to it running through the leaves i saw townspeople gathered in shock i saw the waitress from megs pantry the waiter from the tipton tavern jonathan wade from the book store the barber who was the town constable and becky i raced toward her what happened the constable turned from speaking to three state policemen the two outsiders whove been hanging around town broke into bobs place the state police found fresh cigarette butts at the back fence next to a locked gate theres a tree so close to the fence its almost a ladder my knees weakened when i realized he was talking about the tree id climbed to get over the fence i showed them the way i thought i taught them how to get into the compound some of the neighbors thought they heard a shot the constable said but since this is hunting season the shot didnt seem unusual except that it was close to town then the neighbors noticed smoke rising from the compound seems that after the outsiders stole what they could they set fire to the placeto make bobs death look like an accident death i could barely say the word the county fire department found his body in the embers my legs were so unsteady that i feared id collapse i reached for something to support me beckys shoulder she held me up the police caught the two guys who did it the constable said i wanted to get my hands on them and bob came to see me after you drove back to new york becky said as you know he needed an attorney what are you talking about becky looked puzzled you arent aware he changed his will his will he said you were the kind of man he hoped that his sons would have grown up to be he made you his heir his literary executor everything this place is yours now tears rolled down my cheeks they rolled even harder an hour later when the firemen let becky and me onto the property and showed us where theyd found wentworths body in the charred kitchen the corpse was gone now but the outline in the ashes was vivid i stared at the blackened timbers of the gazebo i walked toward wentworths gutted writing studio a fireman stopped me from getting too close but even from twenty feet away i saw the clump of twisted metal that was once a typewriter and the piles of ashes that had once been twentyone manuscripts now you know the background i spend a lot of time trying to rebuild the compound although i doubt ill ever regain its magic becky often comes to help me i couldnt do it without her but the architecture of snow is what i mostly think about i told march and sons to go to hell with a special invitation to my assistant my boss and the head of marketing i arranged for the novel to be privately printed under the name peter thomas a tipton artist designed a cover that shows the hint of a farmhouse within gusting snow almost as if the snow is constructing the house theres no authors biography exactly as wentworth intended i keep boxes of the novel in my car i drive from book store to book store throughout new england but only a few will take the chance on an unknown author i tell them its an absolutely wonderful book and they look blank as if wonderful isnt what customers want these days is there a serial killer or a global conspiracy wade has dozens of copies in his store his front windows filled with it he tries to convince visitors to buy it but his tourist customers want books that have photographs of ski slopes and covered bridges he hasnt sold even one the townspeople the waitress at megs pantry spoke the truth she isnt much of a reader nor is anybody else ive tried until i dont know what else to do im so desperate i finally betrayed wentworths trust and told you who wrote it take my wordits wonderful buy it will you please buy this book
