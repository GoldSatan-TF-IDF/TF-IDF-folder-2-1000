one of the editors of this volume does not know that this story is going into it there has been collusion in high places the president of sfwa damon knight and the other editor have overruled in advance any complaints that brian w aldiss might make this story was one of three that tied for the best short story award and is in its own right a fine piece of fiction here is art in the interweaving of idea and dialog and here is something vital being said about the human condition it has earned its place in this book hh man in his time brian w aldiss his absence janet westermark sat watching the three men in the office the administrator who was about to go out of her life the behaviourist who was about to come into it and the husband whose life ran parallel to but insulated from her own she was not the only one playing a watching game the behaviourist whose name was clement stackpole sat hunched in his chair with his ugly strong hands clasped round his knee thrusting his intelligent and simian face forward the better to regard his new subject jack westermark the administrator of the mental research hospital spoke in a lively and engaged way typically it was only jack westermark who seemed absent from the scene your particular problem restless his hands upon his lap lay still but he himself was restless though the restlessness seemed directed it was as if he were in another room with other people janet thought she saw that he caught her eye when in fact she was not entirely looking at him and by the time she returned the glance he was gone withdrawn although mr stackpole has not dealt before with your particular problem the administrator was saying he has had plenty of field experience i know im sure we wont westermark said folding his hands and nodding his head slightly smoothly the administrator made a pencilled note of the remark scribbled the precise time beside it and continued i know mr stackpole is too modest to say this but he is a great man for working in with people if you feel its necessary westermark said though ive seen enough of your equipment for a while the pencil moved the smooth voice proceeded good a great man for working in with people and im sure you and mr westermark will soon find you are glad to have him around remember hes there to help both of you janet smiled and said from the island of her chair trying to smile at him and stackpole im sure that everything will work she was interrupted by her husband who rose to his feet letting his hands drop to his sides and saying turning slightly to address thin air do you mind if i say goodbye to nurse simmons her voice no longer wavered everything will be all right im sure she said hastily and stackpole nodded at her conspiratorially agreeing to see her point of view well all get on fine janet he said she was in the swift process of digesting that unexpected use of her christian name and the administrator was also giving her the sort of encouraging smile so many people had fed her since wester mark was pulled out of the ocean off casablanca when her husband still having his lonely conversation with the air said of course i should have remembered his right hand went half way to his foreheador his heart janet wonderedand then dropped as he added perhap shell come round and see us some time now he turned an was smiling faintly at another vacant space with just th faintest nod of his head as if slightly cajoling youd lik that wouldnt you janet she moved her head instinctively trying to bring her eye into his gaze as she replied vaguely of course darling he voice no longer wavered when she addressed his absen attention there was sunlight through which they could see each other there was sunlight in one corner of the room coming through the windows of a bay angled towards the sun for a moment she caught as she rose to her feet her husbands profile with the sunlight behind it it was thin and withdrawn intelligent she had always thought him overburdened with his intelligence but now there was a lost look there and she thought of the words of a psychiatrist who had been called in on the case earlier you must understand that the waking brain is perpetually lapped by the unconscious lapped by the unconscious fighting the words away she said addressing the smile of the administratorthat smile must have advanced his career so muchyouve helped me a lot i couldnt have got through these months without you now wed better go she heard herself chopping her words fearing westermark would talk across them as he did thank you for your help if you find anything stackpole walked modestly over to janet as the administra tor rose and said well dont either of you forget us if youre in any kind of trouble im sure we wont and jack wed like you to come back here to visit us once a month for a personal checkup dont want to waste all our expensive equipment you know and you are our star er patient he smiled rather tightly as he said it glancing at the paper on his desk to check westermarks answer westermarks back was already turned on him westermark was already walking slowly to the door westermark had said his goodbyes perched out on the lonely eminence of his existence janet looked helplessly before she could guard against it at the administrator and stackpole she hated it that they were too professional to take note of what seemed her husbands breach of conduct stackpole looked kindly in a monkey way and took her arm with one of his thick hands shall we be off then my cars waiting outside not saying anything nodding thinking and consulting watches she nodded not saying anything thinking only without the need of the administrators notes to think it oh yes this was when he said do you mind if i say goodbye to nurse whositsimpson she was learning to follow her hus bands footprints across the broken path of conversation he was now out in the corridor the door swinging to behind him and to empty air the administrator was saying its her day off today youre good on your cues she said feeling the hand tighten on her arm she politely brushed his fingers away horrid stackpole trying to recall what had gone only four minutes before jack had said something to her she couldnt remember didnt speak avoided eyes put out her hand and shook the administrators firmly thanks she said au revoir to both of you he replied firmly glancing swiftly watch notes her the door of course he said if we find anything at all we are very hopeful he adjusted his tie looking at the watch again your husband has gone now mrs westermark he said his manner softening he walked towards the door with her and added you have been wonderfully brave and i do realisewe all realisethat you will have to go on being wonderful with time it should be easier for you doesnt shakespeare say in hamlet that use almost can change the stamp of nature may i suggest that you follow stackpoles and my example and keep a little notebook and a strict check on the time they saw her tiny hesitation stood about her two men round a personable woman not entirely innocent of relish stackpole cleared his throat smiled said he can so easily feel cut off you know its essential that you of all people answer his questions or he will feel cut off always a pace ahead the children she asked lets see you and jack well settled in at home again say for a fortnight or so the administrator said before we think about having the children back to see him that ways better for them and jack and you janet stackpole said dont be glib she thought consolation i need god knows but thats too facile she turned her face away fearing it looked too vulnerable these days in the corridor the administrator said as valediction im sure grandmas spoiling them terribly mrs westermark but worrying wont mend it as the old saw says she smiled at him and walked quickly away a pace ahead of stackpole westermark sat in the back of the car outside the adminis trative block she climbed in beside him as she did so he jerked violently back in his seat darling what is it she asked he said nothing stackpole had not emerged from the building evidently having a last word with the administrator janet took the moment to lean over and kiss her husbands cheek aware as she did so that a phantom wife had already from his viewpoint done so his response was a phantom to her the countryside looks green he said his eyes were flickering over the grey concrete block opposite yes she said stackpole came bustling down the steps apologising as he opened the car door settled in he let the clutch back too fast and they shot forward janet saw then the reason for wester marks jerking backwards a short while before now the acceleration caught him again his body was rolled helplessly back as they drove along he set one hand fiercely on the side grip for his sway was not properly counterbalancing the movement of the car once outside the grounds of the institute they were in the country still under a midaugust day his theories westermark by concentrating could bring himself to con form to some of the laws of the time continuum he had left when the car he was in climbed up his drive familiar yet strange with the rhododendrons unclipped and no signs of children and stopped by the front door he sat in his seat for three and a half minutes before venturing to open his door then he climbed out and stood on the gravel frowning down at it was it as real as ever as material was there a slight glaze on itas if something shone through from the interior of the earth shone through all things or was it that there was a screen between him and everything else it was impor tant to decide between the two theories for he had to live under the discipline of one what he hoped to prove was that the permeation theory was correct that way he was merely one of the factors comprising the functioning universe to gether with the rest of humanity by the glaze theory he was isolated not only from the rest of humanity but from the entire cosmos it was early days yet he had a deal of thinking to do and new ideas would undoubtedly emerge after observation and cogitation emotion must not decide the issue he must be detached revolutionary theories could well emerge from thissuffering he could see his wife by him standing off in case they happened embarrassingly or painfully to collide he smiled thinly at her through her glaze he said i am but id prefer not to talk he stepped towards the house noting the slippery feel of gravel that would not move under his tread until the world caught up he said ive every respect for the guardian but id prefer not to talk at present famous astronaut returns home as the party arrived a man waited in the porch for them ambushing westermarks return home with a deprecatory smile hesitant but businesslike he came forward and looked interrogatively at the three people who had emerged from the car excuse me you are captain jack westermark arent you he stood aside as westermark seemed to make straight for him im the psychology correspondent for the guardian if i might intrude for a moment westermarks mother had opened the front door and stood there smiling welcome at him one hand nervously up to her grey hair her son walked past her the newspaper man stared after him janet told him apologetically youll have to excuse us my husband did reply to you but hes really not prepared to meet people yet when did he reply mrs westermark before he heard what i had to say well naturally notbut his life stream im sorry i cant explain he really is living ahead of time isnt he will you spare me a minute to tell me how you feel now the first shock is over you really must excuse me janet said brushing past him as she followed her husband into the house she heard stackpole say actually i read the guardian and perhaps i could help you the institute has given me the job of remaining with captain westermark my names clement stackpoleyou may know my book persistent human rela tions methuen but you must not say that westermark is living ahead of time thats quite incorrect what you can say is that some of his psychological and physiological processes have somehow been transposed forward ass she exclaimed to herself she had paused by the threshold to catch some of his words now she whisked in talk hanging in the air among the long watches of supper supper that evening had its discomforts although janet westermark and her motherinlaw achieved an air of melan choly gaiety by bringing two scandinavian candelabra relics of a copenhagen holiday onto the table and surprising the two men with a gaylooking hors doeuvre but the conversa tion was mainly like the hors doeuvre janet thought little tempting isolated bits of talk not nourishing mrs westermark senior had not yet got the hang of talking to her son and confined her remarks to janet though she looked towards jack often enough how are the children he asked her flustered by the knowledge that he was waiting a long while for her answer she replied rather incoherently and dropped her knife to relieve the tension janet was cooking up a remark on the character of the administrator at the mental research hospital when westermark said then he is at once thought ful and literate commendable and rare in men of his type i got the impression as you evidently did that he was as interested in his job as in advancement j suppose one might say one even liked him but you know him better stackpole what do you think of him crumbling bread to cover his ignorance of whom they were supposed to be conversing stackpole said oh i dont know its hard to say really spinning out time pretending not to squint at his watch the administrator was quite a charmer didnt you think jack janet remarkedperhaps helping stackpole as much as jack he looks as if he might make a slow bowler westermark said with an intonation that suggested he was agreeing with something as yet unsaid oh him stackpole said yes he seems a satisfactory sort of chap on the whole he quoted shakespeare to me and thoughtfully told me where the quotation came from janet said no thank you mother westermark said i dont have much to do with him stackpole continued though i have played cricket with him a time or two he makes quite a good slow bowler are you really westermark exclaimed that stopped them jacks mother looked helplessly about caught her sons glazed eye said covering up do have some more sauce jack dear recalled she had already had her answer almost let her knife slide again gave up trying to eat im a batsman myself stackpole said as if bringing an old pneumatic drill to the new silence when no answer came he doggedly went on expounding on the game the pleasure of it janet sat and watched a shade perplexed that she was admiring stackpoles performance and wondering at her slight perplexity then she decided that she had made up her mind to dislike stackpole and immediately dissolved the resolution was he not on their side and even the strong hairy hands became a little more acceptable when you thought of them gripping the rubber of a bat handle and the broad shoulders swinging she closed her eyes momentarily and tried to concentrate on what he was saying a batsman himself later she met stackpole on the upper landing he had a small cigar in his mouth she had two pillows in her arms he stood in her way can i help at all janet im only making up a bed mr stackpole are you not sleeping in with your husband he would like to be on his own for a night or two mr stackpole i shall sleep in the childrens room for the time being then please permit me to carry the pillows for you and do please call me clem all my friends do trying to be pleasanter to unfreeze to recall that jack was not moving her out of the bedroom permanently she said im sorry its just that we once had a terrier called clem but it did not sound as she had wished it to do he put the pillows on peters blue bed switched on the bedside lamp and sat on the edge of the bed clutching his cigar and puffing at it this may be a bit embarrassing but theres something i feel i should say to you janet he did not look at her she brought him an ashtray and stood by him we feel your husbands mental health may be endangered although i hasten to assure you that he shows no signs of losing his mental equilibrium beyond what we may call an inordinate absorption in phemomenaand even there we cannot say of course we cant that his absorption is any greater than one might expect except in the totally unprece dented circumstances i mean we must talk about this in the next few days she waited for him to go on not unamused by the play with the cigar then he looked straight up at her and said frankly mrs westermark we think it would help your husband if you could have sexual relations with him a little taken aback she said can you imagine cor recting herself she said that is for my husband to say i am not unapproachable she saw he had caught her slip playing a very straight bat he said lm sure youre not mrs westermark with the light out living she lay in peters bed she lay in peters bed with the light out certainly she wanted him pretty badly now she allowed herself to dwell on it during the long months of the mars expedition while she had stayed at home and he had got farther from home while he actually had existence on that other planet she had been chaste she had looked after the children and driven round the countryside and enjoyed writing those articles for wom ens magazines and being interviewed on tv when the ship was reported to have left mars on its homeward journey she had been in part dormant then came the news kept from her at first that there was confusion in communicating with the returning ship a sensa tional tabloid broke the secrecy by declaring that the nine man crew had all gone mad and the ship had overshot its landing area crashing into the atlantic her first reaction had been a purely selfish oneno not selfish but from the self hell never lie with me again and infinite love and sorrow at his rescue the only survivor miraculously unmaimed her hope had revived since then it had remained embalmed as he was embalmed in time she tried to visualise love as it would be now with everything happening first to him before she had begun towith his movement of pleasure even before sheno it wasnt possible but of course it was if they worked it out first intellectually then if she just lay flat but what she was trying to visualise all she could visualise was not lovemaking merely a formal prostration to the exigencies of glands and time flow she sat up in bed longing for movement freedom she jumped out and opened the lower window there was still a tang of cigar smoke in the dark room they worked it out intellectually within a couple of days they had fallen into routine it was as if the calm weather perpetuating mildness aided them they had to be careful to move slowly through doors keeping to the left so as not to bump into each othera tray of drinks was dropped before they agreed on that they devised simple knocking systems before using the bathroom they conversed in bulletins that did not ask questions unless questions were necessary they walked slightly apart in short they made detours round each others lives its really quite easy as long as one is careful mrs westermark senior said to janet and dear jack is so patient i even get the feeling he likes the situation oh my dear how could he like such an unfortunate predicament mother you realise how we all exist together dont you no it sounds too terrible darent say it now dont you start getting silly ideas youve been very brave and this is not the time for us to be getting upset just as things are going well if you have any worries you must tell clem thats what hes here for i know well then she saw jack walk in the garden as she looked he glanced up smiled said something to himself stretched out a hand withdrew it and went still smiling to sit on one end of the seat on the lawn touched janet hurried over to the french windows to go and join him she paused already she saw ahead saw her sequence of actions for jack had already sketched them into the future she would go onto the lawn call his name smile and walk over to him when he smiled back then they would stroll together to the seat and sit down one at each end the knowledge drained all spontaneity from her she might have been working a treadmill for what she was about to do had already been done as far as jack was concerned yddi his head start in time then if she did not go if she mutinied turned back to the discussion of the days chores with her motherinlaw that left jack mouthing like a fool on the lawn indulging in a fantasy there was no penetrating let him do that let stackpole see then they could drop this theory about jacks being ahead of time and would have to treat him for a more normal sort of hallucinatory insanity he would be safe in clems hands but jacks actions proved that she would go out there it was insane for her not to go out there insane to disobey a law of the universe was impossible not insane jack was not disobeyinghe had simply tumbled over a law that nobody knew was there before the first expedition to mars certainly they had discovered something more momentous than anyone had expected and more unforeseen and she had lostno she hadnt lost yet she ran out onto the lawn calling to him letting the action quell the confusion in her mind and in the repeated event there was concealed a little freshness for she remembered how his smile glimpsed through the window had held a special warmth as if he sought to reassure her what had he said that was lost she walked over to the seat and sat beside him he had been saving a remark for the statutory and unvary ing time lapse dont worry janet he said it could be worse how she asked but he was already answering we could be a day apart minutes at least allows us a measure of communication its wonderful how philosophical you are about it she said she was alarmed at the sarcasm in her tone shall we have a talk together now jack ive been wanting to have a private talk with you for some time i the tall beeches that sheltered the garden on the north side were so still that she thought they will look exactly the same for him as for me he delivered a bulletin looking at his watch his wrists were thin he appeared frailer than he had done when they left hospital i am aware my darling how painful this mus be for you we are both isolated from the other by this amazing shift of temporal function but at least i have the consolation of experiencing the new phenomenon whereas you i talking of interstellar distances i was going to say that you are stuck with the same old world all of mankind has always known but i suppose you dont see it that way evidently a remark of hers had caught up with him for he added inconsequentially ive wanted a private talk with you janet bit off something she was going to say for he raised a finger irritably and said please time your statements so that we do not talk at cross purposes confine what you have to say to essentials really darling im surprised you dont do as clem suggests and make notes of what is said at what time that just wantedwe cant act as if we were a board meeting i want to know your feelings how you are thinking so that i can help you so that eventually you will be able to live a normal life again he was timing it so that he answered almost at once i am not suffering from any mental illness and i have completely recovered my physical health after the crash there is no reason to foresee that my perceptions will ever lapse back into phase with yours they have remained an unfluctuating minutes ahead of terrestrial time ever since our ship left the surface of mars he paused she thought it is now about by my watch and there is so much i long to say but its and a bit by his time and he already knows i cant say anything its such an effort of endurance talking across this three and a bit minutes we might just as well be talking across an interstellar distance evidently he too had lost the thread of the exercise for he smiled and stretched out a hand holding it in the air janet looked round clem stackpole was coming out towards them with a tray full of drinks he set it carefully down on the lawn and picked up a martini the stem of which he slipped between jacks fingers cheers he said smiling and heres your tipple giving janet her gin and tonic he had brought himself a bottle of pale ale can you make my position clearer to janet clem she does not seem to understand it yet angrily she turned to the behaviourist this was meant to be a private talk mr stackpole between my husband and myself sorry youre not getting on too well then perhaps i can help sort you out a bit it is difficult i know powerfully he wrenched the top off the beer bottle and poured the liquid into the glass sipping he said we have always been used to the idea that everything moves forward in time at the same rate we speak of the course of time presuming it only has one rate of flow weve assumed too that anything living on another planet in any other part of our universe might have the same rate of flow in other words although weve long been accustomed to some oddities of time thanks to relativity theories we have accustomed our selves perhaps to certain errors of thinking now were going to have to think differently you follow me perfectly the universe is by no means the simple box our predeces sors imagined it may be that each planet is encased in its own time field just as it is in its own gravitational field from the evidence it seems that marss time field is minutes ahead of ours on earth we deduce this from the fact that your husband and the eight other men with him on mars experienced no sensation of temporal difference among them selves and were unaware that anything was untoward until they were away from mars and attempted to get into com munication again with earth when the temporal discrepancy at once showed up your husband is still living in mars time unfortunately the other members of the crew did not survive the crash but we can be sure that if they did they too would suffer from the same effect thats clear isnt it entirely but i still cannot see why this effect if it is as you say its not what say janet but the conclusion arrived at by much cleverer men than he smiled as hesaid that adding parenthetically not that we dont develop and even alter our conclusions every day then why was a similar effect not noticed when the russians and americans returned from the moon we dont know theres so much we dont know we surmise that because the moon is a satellite of earths and thus within its gravitational field there is no temporal discrep ancy but until we have more data until we can explore further we know so little and can only speculate so much its like trying to estimate the runs of an entire innings when only one over has been bowled after the expedition gets back from venus we shall be in a much better position to start theorising what expedition to venus she asked shocked it may not leave for a year yet but theyre speeding up the programme that will bring us really invaluable data future time with its uses and abuses she started to say but after this surely they wont be fool enough then she stopped she knew they would be fool enough she thought of peter saying im going to be a spaceman too i want to be the first man on saturn the men were looking at their watches westermark trans ferred his gaze to the gravel to say this figure of is surely not a universal constant it may vary think it will varyfrom planetary body to planetary body my private opinion is that it is bound to be connected with solar activity in some way if that is so then we may find that the men returning from venus will be perceiving on a continuum slightly in arrears of earth time he stood up suddenly looking dismayed the absorption gone from his face thats a point that hadnt occurred to me stackpole said making a note if the expedition to venus is primed with these points beforehand we should have no trouble about organising their return ultimately this confusion will be sorted out and ive no doubt that it will eventually vastly enrich the culture of mankind the possibilities are of such enormity that its awful youre all crazy janet exclaimed she jumped up and hurried off towards the house or then again jack began to move after her towards the house by his watch which showed earth time it was and twelve seconds he thought not the first time that he would invest in another watch which would be strapped to his right wrist and show martian time no the one on his left wrist should show martian time for that was the wrist he principally consulted and the time by which he lived even when going through the business of communicating with the earthbound human race he realised he was now moving ahead of janet by her reckoning it would be interesting to have someone ahead of him in perception then he would wish to converse would want to go to the labour of it although it would rob him of the sensation that he was perpetually first in the universe first everywhere with everything dewy in that strange light marslight hed call it that till he had it classified the romantic vision preceding the scientific with a touch of the grand permissible before the steadying discipline closed in or then again suppose they were wrong in their theories and the perceptual effect was some freak of the long space journey itself supposing time were quantal supposing all time were quantal after all ageing was a matter of steps not a smooth progress for much of the inorganic world as for the organic now he was standing quite still on the lawn the glaze was coming through the grass making it look brittle almost tingeing each blade with a tiny spectrum of light if his perceptual time were further ahead than it was now would the marslight be stronger the earth more translucent how beautiful it would look after a longer star journey one would return to a cobweb of a world centuries behind one in perceptual time a mere embodiment of light a prism hun grily he visualised it but they needed more knowledge suddenly he thought if i could get on the venus expedi tioni if the institutes right id be perhaps six say five and a halfno one cant saybut id be ahead of venerean time i must go id be valuable to them i only have to volunteer surely he did not notice stackpole touch his arm in cordial fashion and go past him into the house he stood looking at the ground and through it to the stoney vales of mars and the unguessable landscapes of venus the figures move janet had consented to ride into town with stackpole he was collecting his cricket shoes which had been restudded she thought she might buy a roll of film for her camera the children would like photos of her and daddy together stand ing together as the car ran beside trees their shadows flickered red and green before her vision stackpole held the wheel very capa bly whistling under his breath strangely she did not resent a habit she would normally have found irksome taking it as a sign that he was not entirely at his ease i have an awful feeling you now understand my husband better than i do she said he did not deny it why do you feel that i believe he does not mind the terrible isolation he must be experiencing hes a brave man westermark had been home a week now janet saw that each day they were more removed from each other as he spoke less and stood frequently as still as a statue gazing at the ground raptly she thought of something she had once been afraid to utter aloud to her motherinlaw but with clem stackpole she was safer you know why we manage to exist in comparative har mony she said he was slowing the car halflooking at her we only manage to exist by banishing all events from our lives all children all seasons otherwise wed be faced at every moment with the knowledge of how much at odds we really are catching the note in her voice stackpole said soothingly you are every bit as brave as he is janet damn being brave what i cant bear isnothing seeing the sign by the side of the road stackpole glanced into his driving mirror and changed gear the road was deserted in front as well as behind he whistled through his teeth again and janet felt compelled to go on talking weve already interfered with time too muchall of us i mean time is a european invention goodness knows how mixed up in it we are going to get ifwell if this goes on she was irritated by the lack of her usual coherence as stackpole spoke next he was pulling the car into a layby stopping it by overhanging bushes he turned to her smiling tolerantly time was gods invention if you believe in god as i prefer to do we observe it tame it exploit it where possible exploit it you mustnt think of the future as if we were all wading knee deep in treacle or something he laughed briefly resting his hands on the steering wheel what lovely weather it is i was wonderingon sunday im playing cricket over in the village would you like to come and watch the match and perhaps we could have tea somewhere afterwards all events all children all seasons she had a letter next morning from jane her fiveyearold daughter and it made her think all the letter said was dear mummy thank you for the dollies with love from jane but janet knew the labour that had gone into the inchhigh letters how long could she bear to leave the children away from their home and her care as soon as the thought emerged she recalled that during the previous evening she had told herself nebulously that if there was going to be anything with stackpole it was as well the children would be out of the waypurely she now realised for her convenience and for stackpoles she had not thought then about the children she had thought about stackpole who despite the unexpected delicacy he had shown was not a man she cared for and another intolerably immoral thought she muttered unhappily to the empty room what alternative have i to stackpole she knew westermark was in his study it was a cold day too cold and damp for him to make his daily parade round the garden she knew he was sinking deeper into isolation she longed to help she feared to sacrifice herself to that isolation longed to stay outside it in life dropping the letter she held her head in her hands closing her eyes as in the curved bone of her skull she heard all her possible courses of action jar together future lifelines that annihilated each other as janet stood transfixed westermarks mother came into the room i was looking for you she said youre so unhappy my dear arent you mother people always try and hide from others how they suffer does everyone do it you dont have to hide it from mechiefly i suppose because you cant but i dont know how much you suffer and it ought to work both ways why do we do this awful covering up what are we afraid ofpity or derision help perhaps help perhaps youre right thats a disconcerting thought they stood there staring at each other until the older woman said awkwardly we dont often talk like this janet no she wanted to say more to a stranger in a train perhaps she would have done here she could not deliver seeing nothing more was to be said on that subject mrs westermark said i was going to tell you janet that i thought perhaps it would be better if the children didnt come back here while things are as they are if you want to go and see them and stay with them at your parents house i can look after jack and mr stackpole for a week i dont think jack wants to see them thats very kind mother ill see i promised clemwell i told mr stackpole that perhaps id go and watch him play cricket tomorrow afternoon its not important of course but i did sayanyhow i might drive over and see the children on monday if you could hold the fort youve still plenty of time if you feel like going today im sure mr stackpole will understand your maternal feelings id prefer to leave it till monday janet saida little distantly for she suspected now the motive behind her motherinlaws suggestion where the scientific american did not reach jack westermark put down the scientific american and stared at the table top with his right hand he felt the beat of his heart in the magazine was an article about him illus trated with photographs of him taken at the research hospi tal this thoughtful article was far removed from the sensa tional pieces that had appeared elsewhere the shallow things that referred to him as the man that has done more than einstein to wreck our cosmic picture and for that very reason it was the more startling and presented some aspects of the matter that westermark himself had not considered as he thought over its conclusions he rested from the effort of reading terrestrial books and stackpole sat by the fire smoking a cigar and waiting to take westermarks dicta tion even reading a magazine represented a feat in space time a collaboration a conspiracy stackpole turned the pages at timed intervals westermark read when they lay flat he was unable to turn them when in their own narrow continuum they were not being turned to his fingers they lay under the jellylike glaze that visual hallucination that repre sented an unconquerable cosmic inertia the inertia gave a special shine to the surface of the table as he stared into it and probed into his own mind to determine the truths of the scientific american article the writer of the article began by considering the facts and observing that they tended to point towards the existence of local times throughout the universe and that if this were so a new explanation might be forthcoming for the recession of the galaxies and different estimates arrived at for the age of the universe he then proceeded to deal with the problem that vexed other writers on the subject namely why if westermark lost earth time on mars he had not reciprocally lost mars time back on earth this more than anything pointed to the fact that local times were not purely mechanistic but to some extent at least a psychobiological function in the table top westermark saw himself being asked to travel again to mars to take part in a second expedition to those continents of russet sand where the fabric of spacetime was in some mysterious and insuperable fashion min utes ahead of earth norm would his interior clock leap forward again what then of the sheen on things earthly and what would be the effect of gradually drawing away from the iron laws under which since its scampering pleisto cene infancy humankind had lived impatiently he thrust his mind forward to imagine the day when earth harboured many local times gleaned from voyages across the vacancies of space those vacancies lay across time too and that littleunderstood concept mctag gart had denied its external reality hadnt he would come to lie within the grasp of mans understanding wasnt that the ultimate secret to be able to understand the flux in which existence is staged as a dream is staged in the primitive reaches of the mind and but would not that day bring the annihilation of earths local time that was what he had started it could only mean that local time was not a product of planetary elements there the writer of the scientific american article had not dared to go far enough local time was entirely a product of the psyche that dark innermost thing that could keep accurate time even while a man lay unconscious was a mere provincial but it could be educated to be a citizen of the universe he saw that he was the first of a new race unimaginable in the wildest mind a few months previously he was independent of the enemy that more than death menaced contemporary man time locked within him was an entirety new potential superman had arrived painfully superman stirred in his seat he sat so wrapt for so long that his limbs grew stiff and dead without his noticing it universal thoughts may occur if one times carefully enough ones circumbendibus about a given table dictation he said and waited impatiently until the com mand had penetrated backwards to the limbo by the fire where stackpole sat what he had to say was so terribly importantyet it had to wait on these people as was his custom he rose and began to walk round the table speaking in phrases quickly delivered this was to be the testament to the new way of life consciousness is not expendable but concurrent there may have been many time nodes at the beginning of the human race the mentally deranged often revert to different time rates for some a day seems to stretch on for ever we know by experience that for children time is seen in the convex mirror of consciousness enlarged and distorted beyond its focal point he was momentarily irritated by the scared face of his wife appearing outside the study window but he brushed it away and continued its focal point yet man in his ignorance has persisted in pretending time was some sort of unidirectional flow and homogenous at that despite the evidence to the contrary our conception of ourselvesno this erroneous conception has become a basic life assumption daughters of daughters westermarks mother was not given to metaphysical specu lation but as she was leaving the room she turned and said to her daughterinlaw you know what i sometimes think jack is so strange i wonder at nights if men and women arent getting more and more apart in thought and in their ways with every generationyou know almost like separate species my generation made a great attempt to bring the two sexes together in equality and all the rest but it seems to have come to nothing jack will get better janet could hear the lack of confidence in her own voice i thought the same thingabout men and women getting wider apart i meanwhen my husband was killed suddenly ail janets sympathy was gone she had recog nised a familiar topic drifting onto the scene knew well the careful tone that ironed away all selfpity as her motherin law said bob was dedicated to speed you know that was what killed him really not the fool backing into the road in front of him no blame was attached to your husband janet said you should try not to let it worry you still you see the connection though this progress thing bob so crazy to get round the next bend first and now jack oh well theres nothing a woman can do she closed the door behind her absently janet picked up the message from the next generation of women thank you for the dollies the resolves and the sudden risks involved he was their father perhaps jane and peter should come back despite the risks involved anxiously janet stood there moving herself with a sudden resolve to tackle jack straight away he was so irritable so unapproachable but at least she could observe how busy he was before interrupting him as she slipped into the side hall and made for the back door she heard her motherinlaw call her just a minute she answered the sun had broken through sucking moisture from the damp garden it was now unmistakably autumn she rounded the corner of the house stepped round the rose bed and looked into her husbands study shaken she saw he leaned half over the table his hands were over his face blood ran between his fingers and dripped onto an open magazine on the table top she was aware of stackpole sitting indifferently beside the electric fire she gave a small cry and ran round the house again to be met at the back door by mrs westermark oh i was justjanet what is it jack mother hes had a stroke or something terrible but how do you know quick we must phone the hospital must go to him mrs westermark took janets arm perhaps wed better leave it to mr stackpole hadnt we im afraid mother we must do what we can i know were amateurs please let me go no janet wereits their world im frightened theyll come if they want us she was gripping janet in her fright their wild eyes stared momentarily at each other as if seeing something else and then janet snatched herself away i must go to him she said she hurried down the hall and pushed open the study door her husband stood now at the far end of the room by the window while blood streamed from his nose jack she exclaimed as she ran towards hima blow from the empty air struck her on the forehead so that she staggered aside falling against a bookcase a shower of smaller volumes from the upper shelf fell on her and round her exclaiming stackpole dropped his notebook and ran round the table to her even as he went to her aid he noted the time from his watch aid after and the tidiness of bed westermarks mother appeared in the doorway stay where you are stackpole shouted or there will be more trouble janet you see what youve done get out of here will you jack im right with yougod knows what youve felt isolated without aid for three and a third min utes angrily he went across and stood within arms length of his patient he threw his handkerchief down onto the table mr stackpole westermarks mother said tentatively from the door an arm round janets waist he looked back over his shoulder only long enough to say get towels phone the research hospital for an ambulance and tell them to be here right away by midday westermark was tidily in bed upstairs and the ambulance staff who had treated him for what after all was only nosebleed had left stackpole as he turned from closing the front door eyed the two women i feel it is my duty to warn you he said heavily that another incident such as this might well prove fatal this time we escaped very lightly if anything else of this sort happens i shall feel obliged to recommend to the board that mr westermark is moved back to the hospital current way to define accidents he wouldnt want to go janet said besides you are being absurd it was entirely an accident now i wish to go upstairs and see how he is just before you go may i point out that what happened was not an accidentor not as we generally define accidents since you saw the results of your interference through the study window before you entered where you were to blame but thats absurd both women began at once janet went on to say i never would have rushed into the room as i did had i not seen through the window that he was in trouble what you saw was the result on your husband of your later interference in something like a wail westermarks mother said i dont understand any of this what did janet bump into when she ran in she ran mrs westermark into the spot where her hus band had been standing minutes earlier surely by now you have grasped this elementary business of time inertia when they both started speaking at once he stared at them until they stopped and looked at him then he said we had better go into the living room speaking for myself i would like a drink he helped himself and not until his hand was round a glass of whisky did he say now without wishing to lecture to you ladies j think it is high time you both realised that you are not living in the old safe world of classical mechanics ruled over by a god invented by eighteenthcentury enlightenment all that has happened here is perfectly rational but if you are going to pretend it is beyond your female under standings mr stackpole janet said sharply can you please keep to the point without being insulting will you tell me why what happened was not an accident i understand now that when i looked through the study window i saw my husband suffering from a collision that to him had happened three and something minutes before and to me would not happen for another three and something minutes but at that moment i was so startled that i forgot no no your figures are wrong the total time lapse is only minutes when you saw your husband he had been hit half that time minutesago and there was another minutes to go before you completed the action by bursting into the room and striking him but she didnt strike him the older woman cried firmly stackpole diverted his attention long enough to reply she struck him at earthtime which equals plus about seconds mars or his time which equals or whatever neptune time which equals and a half sinus time its a big universe mrs westermark you will remain confused as long as you continue to confuse event with time may i suggest you sit down and have a drink leaving aside the figures janet said returning to the attackloathsome opportunist the man washow can you say that what happened was no accident you are not claiming i injured my husband deliberately i hope what you say suggests that i was powerless from the moment i saw him through the window leaving aside the figures he quoted thats where your responsibility lies what you saw through the window was the result of your act it was by then inevitable that you should complete it for it had already been completed through the window draughts of time blow i cant understand she clutched her forehead gratefully accepting a cigarette from her motherinlaw while shrugging off her consolatory dont try to understand dear suppos ing when i had seen jacks nose bleeding i had looked at my watch and thought its or whenever it was and he may be suffering from my interference so id better not go in and i hadnt gone in would his nose then miraculously have healed of course not you take such a mechanistic view of the universe cultivate a mental approach try and live in your own century you could not think what you suggest because that is not in your nature just as it is not in your nature to consult your watch intelligently just as you always leave aside the figures as you say no im not being personal its all very feminine and appealing in a way what im saying is that if before you looked into the window you had been a person to think however i see my husband now i must recall he has the additional experience of the next minutes then you could have looked in and seen him unharmed and you would not have come bursting in as you did she drew on her cigarette baffled and hurt youre saying im a danger to my own husband youre saying that god howl hate men she exclaimed youre so bloody logical so bloody smug he finished his whisky and set the glass down on a table beside her so that he leant close youre upset just now he said of course im upset what do you think she fought a desire to cry or slap his face she turned to jacks mother who gently took her wrist why dont you go off straight away and stay with the children for the weekend darling come back when you feel like it jack will be all right and i can look after himas much as he wants looking after she glanced about the room i will ill pack right away theyll be glad to see me as she passed stackpole on the way out she said bitterly at least they wont be worrying about the local time on sirius they may said stackpole imperturbably from the mid dle of the room have to one day all events all children all seasons
