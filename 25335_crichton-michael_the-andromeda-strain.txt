michael crichton the andromeda strain foreword this book recounts the fiveday history of a major american scientific crisis as in most crises the events surrounding the andromeda strain were a compound of foresight and foolishness innocence and ignorance nearly everyone involved had moments of great brilliance and moments of unaccountable stupidity it is therefore impossible to write about the events without offending some of the participants however i think it is important that the story be told this country supports the largest scientific establishment in the history of mankind new discoveries are constantly being made and many of these discoveries have important political or social overtones in the near future we can expect more crises on the pattern of andromeda thus i believe it is useful for the public to be made aware of the way in which scientific crises arise and are dealt with in researching and recounting the history of the andromeda strain i received the generous help of many people who felt as i did and who encouraged me to tell the story accurately and in detail my particular thanks must go to major general willis a haverford united states army lieutenant everett j sloane united states navy ret captain l s waterhouse united states air force vandenberg special projects division colonel henley jackson and colonel stanley friedrich both of wright patterson and murray charles of the pentagon press division for their help in elucidating the background of the wildfire project i must thank roger white national aeronautics and space administration houston msq john roble nasa kennedy complex peter j mason nasa intelligence arlington hall dr francis martin university of california berkeley and the presidents science advisory council dr max byrd usia kenneth vorhees white house press corps and professor jonathan percy of the university of chicago genetics department for their review of relevant chapters of the manuscript and for their technical corrections and suggestions i wish to thank christian p lewis goddard space flight center herbert stanch avco inc james p baker jet propulsion laboratory carlos n sandos california institute of technology dr brian stack university of michigan edgar blalock hudson institute professor linus kjelling the rand corporation dr eldredge benson national institutes of health lastly i wish to thank the participants in the wildfire project and the investigation of the socalled andromeda strain all agreed to see me and with many my interviews lasted over a period of days furthermore i was able to draw upon the transcripts of their debriefing which are stored in arlington hall substation seven and which amounted to more than fifteen thousand pages of typewritten manuscript this material stored in twenty volumes represents the full story of the events at flatrock nevada as told by each of the participants and i was thus able to utilize their separate viewpoints in preparing a composite account this is a rather technical narrative centering on complex issues of science wherever possible i have explained the scientific questions problems and techniques i have avoided the temptation to simplify both the issues and the answers and if the reader must occasionally struggle through an and passage of technical detail i apologize i have also tried to retain the tension and excitement o events in these five days for there is an inherent drama in the story of andromeda and if it is a chronicle of stupid deadly blunders it is also a chronicle of heroism and intelligence mc cambridge massachusetts january day contact the country of lost borders a man with binoculars that is how it began with a man standing by the side of the road on a crest overlooking a small arizona town on a winter night lieutenant roger shawn must have found the binoculars difficult the metal would be cold and he would be clumsy in his fir parka and heavy gloves his breath hissing out into the moonlit air would have fogged the lenses he would be forced to pause to wipe them frequently using a stubby gloved finger he could not have known the futility of this action binoculars were worthless to see into that town and uncover its secrets he would have been astonished to learn that the men who finally succeeded used instruments a million times more powerful than binoculars there is something sad foolish and human in the image of shawn leading against a boulder propping his arms on it and holding the binoculars to his eyes though cumbersome the binoculars would at least feel comfortable and familiar in his hands it would be one of the last familiar sensations before his death we can imagine and try to reconstruct what happened from that point on lieutenant shawn swept over the town slowly and methodically he could see it was not large just a halfdozen wooden buildings set out along a single main street it was very quiet no lights no activity no sound carried by the gentle wind he shifted his attention from the town to the surrounding hills they were low dusty and blunted with scrubby vegetation and an occasional withered yucca tree crusted in snow beyond the hills were more hills and then the flat expanse of the mojave desert trackless and vast the indians called it the country of lost borders lieutenant shawn found himself shivering in the wind it was february the coldest month and it was after ten he walked back up the road toward the ford econovan with the large rotating antenna on top the motor was idling softly it was the only sound he could hear he opened the rear doors and climbed into the back shutting the doors behind him he was enveloped in deepred light a night light so that he would not be blinded when he stepped outside in the red light the banks of instruments and electronic equipment glowed greenly private lewis crane the electronics technician was there also wearing a parka he was hunched over a map making calculations with occasional reference to the instruments before him shawn asked crane if he were certain they had arrived at the place and crane confirmed that they had both men were tired they had driven all day from vandenberg in search of the latest scoop satellite neither knew much about the scoops except that they were a series of secret capsules intended to analyze the upper atmosphere and then return shawn and crane had the job of finding the capsules once they had landed in order to facilitate recovery the satellites were fitted with electronic beepers that began to transmit signals when they came down to an altitude of five miles that was why the van had so much radiodirectional equipment in essence it was performing its own triangulation in any parlance it was known as singleunit triangulation and it was highly effective though slow the procedure was simple enough the van stopped and fixed its position recording the strength and direction of the radio beam from the satellite once this was done it would be driven in the most likely direction of the satellite for a distance of twenty miles then it would stop and take new coordinates in this way a series of triangulation points could be mapped and the van could proceed to the satellite by a zigzag path stopping every twenty miles to correct any error the method was slower than using two vans but it was safer the army felt that two vans in an area might arouse suspicion for six hours the van had been closing on the scoop satellite now they were almost there crane tapped the map with a pencil in a nervous way and announced the name of the town at the foot of the hill piedmont arizona population fortyeight both men laughed over that though they were both inwardly concerned the vandenberg esa or estimated site of arrival had been twelve miles north of piedmont vandenberg computed this site on the basis of radar observations and computer trajectory projections the estimates were not usually wrong by more than a few hundred yards yet there was no denying the radiodirectional equipment which located the satellite beeper directly in the center of town shawn suggested that someone from the town might have seen it coming down it would be glowing with the heat and might have retrieved it bringing it into piedmont this was reasonable except that a native of piedmont who happened upon an american satellite fresh from space would have told someone reporters police nasa the army someone but they had heard nothing shawn climbed back down from the van with crane scrambling after him shivering as the cold air struck him together the two men looked out over the town it was peaceful but completely dark shawn noticed that the gas station and the motel both had their lights doused yet they represented the only gas station and motel for miles and then shawn noticed the birds in the light of the full moon he could see them big birds gliding in slow circles over the buildings passing like black shadows across the face of the moon he wondered why he hadnt noticed them before and asked crane what he made of them crane said he didnt make anything of them as a joke he added maybe theyre buzzards thats what they look like all right shawn said crane laughed nervously his breath hissing out into the night but why should there be buzzards here they only come when something is dead shawn lit a cigarette cupping his hands around the lighter protecting the flame from the wind he said nothing but looked down at the buildings the outline of the little town then he scanned the town once more with binoculars but saw no signs of life or movement at length he lowered the binoculars and dropped his cigarette onto the crisp snow where it sputtered and died he turned to crane and said wed better go down and have a look vandenberg three hundred miles away in the large square windowless room that served as mission control for project scoop lieutenant edgar comroe sat with his feet on his desk and a stack of scientificjournal articles before him comroe was serving as control officer for the night it was a duty he filled once a month directing the evening operations of the skeleton crew of twelve tonight the crew was monitoring the progress and reports of the van coded caper one now making its way across the arizona desert comroe disliked this job the room was gray and lighted with fluorescent lights the tone was sparsely utilitarian and comroe found it unpleasant he never came to mission control except during a launch when the atmosphere was different then the room was filled with busy technicians each at work on a single complex task each tense with the peculiar cold anticipation that precedes any spacecraft launch but nights were dull nothing ever happened at night comroe took advantage of the time and used it to catch up on reading by profession he was a cardiovascular physiologist with special interest in stresses induced at highg accelerations tonight comroe was reviewing a journal article titled stoichiometrics of oxygencarrying capacity and diffusion gradients with increased arterial gas tensions he found it slow reading and only moderately interesting thus he was willing to be interrupted when the overhead loudspeaker which carried the voice transmission from the van of shawn and crane clicked on shawn said this is caper one to vandal deca caper one to vandal deca are you reading over comroe feeling amused replied that he was indeed reading we are about to enter the town of piedmont and recover the satellite very good caper one leave your radio open roger this was a regulation of the recovery technique as outlined in the systems rules manual of project scoop the srm was a thick gray paperback that sat at one corner of comroes desk where he could refer to it easily comroe knew that conversation between van and base was taped and later became part of the permanent project file but he had never understood any good reason for this in fact it had always seemed to him a straightforward proposition the van went out got the capsule and came back he shrugged and returned to his paper on gas tensions only half listening to shawns voice as it said we are now inside the town we have just passed a gas station and a motel all quiet here there is no sign of life the signals from the satellite are stronger there is a church half a block ahead there are no lights or activity of any kind comroe put his journal down the strained quality of shawns voice was unmistakable normally comroe would have been amused at the thought of two grown men made jittery by entering a small sleepy desert town but he knew shawn personally and he knew that shawn whatever other virtues he might have utterly lacked an imagination shawn could fall asleep in a horror movie he was that kind of man comroe began to listen over the crackling static he heard the rumbling of the van engine and he heard the two men in the van talking quietly shawn pretty quiet around here crane yes sir there was a pause crane sir shawn yes crane did you see that shawn see what crane back there on the sidewalk it looked like a body shawn youre imagining things another pause and then comroe heard the van come to a halt brakes squealing shawn judas crane its another one sir shawn looks dead crane shall i shawn no stay in the van his voice became louder more formal as he ran through the call this is caper one to vandal deca over comroe picked up the microphone reading you whats happened shawn his voice tight said sir we see bodies lots of them they appear to be dead are you certain caper one for petes sake shawn said of course were certain comroe said mildly proceed to the capsule caper one as he did so he looked around the room the twelve other men in the skeleton crew were staring at him their eyes blank unseeing they were listening to the transmission the van rumbled to life again comroe swung his feet off the desk and punched the red security button on his console that button automatically isolated the mission control room no one would be allowed in or out without comroes permission then he picked up the telephone and said get me major manchek manchek this is a stat call ill hold manchek was the chief duty officer for the month the man directly responsible for all scoop activities during february while he waited he cradled the phone in his shoulder and lit a cigarette over the loudspeaker shawn could be heard to say do they look dead to you crane crane yes sir kind of peaceful but dead shawn somehow they dont really look dead theres something missing something funny but theyre all over must be dozens of them crane like they dropped in their trucks stumbled and fallen down dead shawn all over the streets on the sidewalks another silence then crane sir shawn judas crane you see him the man in the white robe walking across the street shawn i see him crane hes just stepping over them like shawn hes coming toward us crane sir look i think we should get out of here if you dont mind my the next sound was a highpitched scream and a crunching noise transmission ended at this point and vandenberg scoop mission control was not able to raise the two men again crisis gladstone upon heaiung of the death of chinese gordon in egypt was reported to have muttered irritably that his general might have chosen a more propitious time to die gordons death threw the gladstone government into turmoil and crisis an aide suggested that the circumstances were unique and unpredictable to which gladstone crossly answered all crises are the same he meant political crises of course there were no scientific crises in and indeed none for nearly forty years afterward since then there have been eight of major importance two have received wide publicity it is interesting that both the publicized crises atomic energy and space capability have concerned chemistry and physics not biology this is to be expected physics was the first of the natural sciences to become fully modern and highly mathematical chemistry followed in the wake of physics but biology the retarded child lagged far behind even in the time of newton and galileo men knew more about the moon and other heavenly bodies than they did about their own it was not until the late s that this situation changed the postwar period ushered in a new era of biologic research spurred by the discovery of antibiotics suddenly there was both enthusiasm and money for biology and a torrent of discoveries poured forth tranquilizers steroid hormones immunochemistry the genetic code by the first kidney was transplanted and by the first birthcontrol pills were tested it was not long before biology was the fastestgrowing field in all science it was doubling its knowledge every ten years farsighted researchers talked seriously of changing genes controlling evolution regulating the mind ideas that had been wild speculation ten years before and yet there had never been a biologic crisis the andromeda strain provided the first according to lewis bornheim a crisis is a situation in which a previously tolerable set of circumstances is suddenly by the addition of another factor rendered wholly intolerable whether the additional factor is political economic or scientific hardly matters the death of a national hero the instability of prices or a technological discovery can all set events in motion in this sense gladstone was right all crises are the same the noted scholar alfred pockrun in his study of crises culture crisis and change has made several interesting points first he observes that every crisis has its beginnings long before the actual onset thus einstein published his theories of relativity in forty years before his work culminated in the end of a war the start of an age and the beginnings of a crisis similarly in the early twentieth century american german and russian scientists were all interested in space travel but only the germans recognized the military potential of rockets and after the war when the german rocket installation at peenernfinde was cannibalized by the soviets and americans it was only the russians who made immediate vigorous moves toward developing space capabilities the americans were content to tinker playfully with rockets and ten years later this resulted in an american scientific crisis involving sputnik american education the icbm and the missile gap pockran also observes that a crisis is compounded of individuals and personalities which are unique it is as difficult to imagine alexander at the rubicon and eisenhower at waterloo as it is difficult to imagine darwin writing to roosevelt about the potential for an atomic bomb a crisis is made by men who enter into the crisis with their own prejudices propensities and predispositions a crisis is the sum of intuition and blind spots a blend of facts noted and facts ignored yet underlying the uniqueness of each crisis is a disturbing sameness a characteristic of all crises is their predictability in retrospect they seem to have a certain inevitability they seem predestined this is not true of all crises but it is true of sufficiently many to make the most hardened historian cynical and misanthropic in the light of pockrans arguments it is interesting to consider the background and personalities involved in the andromeda strain at the time of andromeda there had never been a crisis of biological science and the first americans faced with the facts were not disposed to think in terms of one shawn and crane were capable but not thoughtful men and edgar comroe the night officer at vandenberg though a scientist was not prepared to consider anything beyond the immediate irritation of a quiet evening ruined by an inexplicable problem according to protocol comroe called his superior officer major arthur manchek and here the story takes a different turn for manchek was both prepared and disposed to consider a crisis of the most major proportions but he was not prepared to acknowledge it major manchek his face still creased with sleep sat on the edge of comroes desk and listened to the replay of the tape from the van when it was finished he said strangest damned thing i ever heard and played it over again while he did so he carefully filled his pipe with tobacco lit it and tamped it down arthur manchek was an engineer a quiet heavyset man plagued by labile hypertension which threatened to end further promotions as an army officer he had been advised on many occasions to lose weight but had been unable to do so he was therefore considering abandoning the army for a career as a scientist in private industry where people did not care what your weight or blood pressure was manchek had come to vandenberg from wright patterson in ohio where he had been in charge of experiments in spacecraft landing methods his job had been to develop a capsule shape that could touch down with equal safety on either land or sea manchek had succeeded in developing three new shapes that were promising his success led to a promotion and transfer to vandenberg here he did administrative work and hated it people bored manchek the mechanics of manipulation and the vagaries of subordinate personality held no fascination for him he often wished he were back at the wind tunnels of wright patterson particularly on nights when he was called out of bed by some damn fool problem tonight he felt irritable and under stress his reaction to this was characteristic he became slow he moved slowly he thought slowly he proceeded with a dull and plodding deliberation it was the secret of his success whenever people around him became excited manchek seemed to grow more disinterested until he appeared about to fall asleep it was a trick he had for remaining totally objective and clearheaded now he sighed and puffed on his pipe as the tape spun out for the second time no communications breakdown i take it comroe shook his head we checked all systems at this end we are still monitoring the frequency he turned on the radio and hissing static filled the room you know about the audio screen vaguely manchek said suppressing a yawn in fact the audio screen was a system he had developed three years before in simplest terms it was a computerized way to find a needle in a haystack a machine program that listened to apparently garbled random sound and picked out certain irregularities for example the hubbub of conversation at an embassy cocktail party could be recorded and fed through the computer which would pick out a single voice and separate it from the rest it had several intelligence applications well comroe said after the transmission ended we got nothing but the static you hear now we put it through the audio screen to see if the computer could pick up a pattern and we ran it through the oscilloscope in the corner across the room the green face of the scope displayed a jagged dancing white line the summated sound of static then comroe said we cut in the computer like so he punched a button on his desk console the oscilloscope line changed character abruptly it suddenly became quieter more regular with a pattern of beating thumping impulses i see manchek said he had in fact already identified the pattern and assessed its meaning his mind was drifting elsewhere considering other possibilities wider ramifications heres the audio comroe said he pressed another button and the audio version of the signal filled the room it was a steady mechanical grinding with a repetitive metallic click manchek nodded an engine with a knock yes sir we believe the van radio is still broadcasting and that the engine is still running thats what were hearing now with the static screened away all right manchek said his pipe went out he sucked on it for a moment then lit it again removed it from his mouth and plucked a bit of tobacco from his tongue we need evidence he said almost to himself he was considering categories of evidence and possible findings contingencies evidence of what comroe said manchek ignored the question have we got a scavenger on the base im not sure sir if we dont we can get one from edwards then do it manchek stood up he had made his decision and now he felt tired again an evening of telephone calls faced him an evening of irritable operators and bad connections and puzzled voices at the other end well want a flyby over that town he said a complete scan all canisters to come directly alert the labs he also ordered comroe to bring in the technicians especially jaggers manchek disliked jaggers who was effete and precious but manchek also knew that jaggers was good and tonight he needed a good man at pm samuel gunner wilson was moving at miles per hour over the mojave desert up ahead in the moonlight he saw the twin lead jets their afterburners glowing angrily in the night sky the planes had a heavy pregnant look phosphorus bombs were slung beneath the wings and belly wilsons plane was different sleek and long and black it was a scavenger one of seven in the world the scavenger was the operational version of the x it was an intermediaterange reconnaissance jet aircraft fully equipped for day or night intelligence flights it was fitted with two sideslung mm cameras one for the visible spectrum and one for lowfrequency radiation in addition it had a centermount homans infrared multispex camera as well as the usual electronic and radiodetection gear all films and plates were of course processed automatically in the air and were ready for viewing as soon as the aircraft returned to base all this technology made the scavenger almost impossibly sensitive it could map the outlines of a city in blackout and could follow the movements of individual trucks and cars at eight thousand feet it could detect a submarine to a depth of two hundred feet it could locate harbor mines by wavemotion deformities and it could obtain a precise photograph of a factory from the residual heat of the building four hours after it had shut down so the scavenger was the ideal instrument to fly over piedmont arizona in the dead of night wilson carefully checked his equipment his hands fluttering over the controls touching each button and lever watching the blinking green lights that indicated that all systems were in order his earphones crackled the lead plane said lazily coming up on the town gunner you see it he leaned forward in the cramped cockpit he was low only five hundred feet above the ground and for a moment he could see nothing but a blur of sand snow and yucca trees then up ahead buildings in the moonlight roger i see it okay gunner give us room he dropped back putting half a mile between himself and the other two planes they were going into the psquare formation for direct visualization of target by phosphorus flare direct visualization was not really necessary scavenger could function without it but vandenberg seemed insistent that they gather all possible information about the town the lead planes spread moving wide until they were parallel to the main street of the town gunner ready to roll wilson placed his fingers delicately over the camera buttons four fingers as if playing the piano ready were going in now the two planes swooped low dipping gracefully toward the town they were now very wide and seemingly inches above the ground as they began to release the bombs as each struck the ground a blazing whitehot sphere went up bathing the town in an unearthly glaring light and reflecting off the metal underbellies of the planes the jets climbed their run finished but gunner did not see them his entire attention his mind and his body was focused on the town all yours gunner wilson did not answer he dropped his nose cracked down his flaps and felt a shudder as the plane sank sickeningly like a stone toward the ground below him the area around the town was lighted for hundreds of yards in every direction he pressed the camera buttons and felt rather than heard the vibrating whir of the cameras for a long moment he continued to fall and then he shoved the stick forward and the plane seemed to catch in the air to grab and lift and climb he had a fleeting glimpse of the main street he saw bodies bodies everywhere spreadeagled lying in the streets across cars judas he said and then he was up still climbing bringing the plane around in a slow arc preparing for the descent into his second run and trying not to think of what he had seen one of the first rules of air reconnaissance was ignore the scenery analysis and evaluation were not the job of the pilot that was left to the experts and pilots who forgot this who became too interested in what they were photographing got into trouble usually they crashed as the plane came down into a flat second run he tried not to look at the ground but he did and again saw the bodies the phosphorus flares were burning low the lighting was darker more sinister and subdued but the bodies were still there he had not been imagining it judas priest he said again sweet judas the sign on the door said data prossex epsilon and underneath in red lettering admission by clearance card only inside was a comfortable sort of briefing room screen on one wall a dozen steeltubing and leather chairs facing it and a projector in the back when manchek and comroe entered the room jaggers was already waiting for them standing at the front of the room by the screen jaggers was a short man with a springy step and an eager rather hopeful face though not well liked on the base he was nonetheless the acknowledged master of reconnaissance interpretation he had the sort of mind that delighted in small and puzzling details and was well suited to his job jaggers rubbed his hands as manchek and comroe sat down well then he said might as well get right to it i think we have something to interest you tonight he nodded to the projectionist in the back first picture the room lights darkened there was a mechanical click and the screen lighted to show an aerial view of a small desert town this is an unusual shot jaggers said from our files taken two months ago from janos our recon satellite orbiting at an altitude of one hundred and eightyseven miles as you know the technical quality here is quite good cant read the license plates on the cars yet but were working on it perhaps by next year manchek shifted in his chair but said nothing you can see the town here jaggers said piedmont arizona population fortyeight and not much to look at even from one hundred and eightyseven miles heres the general store the gas station notice how clearly you can read gulf and the post office the motel everything else you see is private residences church over here well next picture another click this was dark with a reddish tint and was clearly an overview of the town in white and dark red the outlines of the buildings were very dark we begin here with the scavenger ir plates these are infrared films as you know which produce a picture on the basis of heat instead of light anything warm appears white on the picture anything cold is black now then you can see here that the buildings are dark they are colder than the ground as night comes on the buildings give up their heat more rapidly what are those white spots comroe said there were forty or fifty white areas on the film those jaggers said are bodies some inside houses some in the street by count they number fifty in the case of some of them such as this one here you can make out the four limbs and head clearly this body is lying flat in the street he lit a cigarette and pointed to a white rectangle as nearly as we can tell this is an automobile notice its got a bright white spot at one end this means the motor is still running still generating heat the van comroe said manchek nodded the question now arises jaggers said are all these people dead we cannot be certain about that the bodies appear to be of different temperatures fortyseven are rather cold indicating death some time ago three are warmer two of those are in this car here our men comroe said and the third the third is rather puzzling you see him here apparently standing or lying curled in the street observe that he is quite white and therefore quite warm our temperature scans indicate that he is about ninetyfive degrees which is a little on the cool side but probably attributable to peripheral vasoconstriction in the night desert air drops his skin temperature next slide the third film flicked onto the screen manchek frowned at the spot its moved exactly this film was made on the second passage the spot has moved approximately twenty yards next picture a third film moved again yes an additional five or ten yards so one person down there is alive that jaggers said is the presumptive conclusion manchek cleared his throat does that mean its what you think yes sir it is what we think theres a man down there walking among the corpses jaggers shrugged and tapped the screen it is difficult to account for the data in any other manner and at that moment a private entered the room with three circular metal canisters under his arm sir we have films of the direct visualization by psquare run them manchek said the film was threaded into a projector a moment later lieutenant wilson was ushered into the room jaggers said i havent reviewed these films yet perhaps the pilot should narrate manchek nodded and looked at wilson who got up and walked to the front of the room wiping his hands nervously on his pants he stood alongside the screen and faced his audience beginning in a flat monotone sir my flybys were made between and pm this evening there were two a start from the east and a return from the west done at an average speed of two hundred and fourteen miles per hour at a median altitude by corrected altimeter of eight hundred feet and an just a minute son manchek said raising his hand this isnt a grilling just tell it naturally wilson nodded and swallowed the room lights went down and the projector whirred to life the screen showed the town bathed in glaring white light as the plane came down over it this is my first pass wilson said east to west at were looking from the leftwing camera which is running at ninetysix frames per second as you can see my altitude is falling rapidly straight ahead is the main street of the target he stopped the bodies were clearly visible and the van stopped in the street its rooftop antenna still turning slow revolutions as the plane continued its run approaching the van they could see the driver collapsed over the steering wheel excellent definition jaggers said that finegrain film really gives resolution when you need wilson manchek said was telling us about his run yes sir wilson said clearing his throat he stared at the screen at this time i am right over target where i observed the casualties you see here my estimate at that time was seventyfive sir his voice was quiet and tense there was a break in the film some numbers and the image came on again now i am coming back for my second run wilson said the flares are already burning low but you can see stop the film manchek said the projectionist froze the film at a single frame it showed the long straight main street of the town and the bodies go back the film was run backward the jet seeming to pull away from the street there stop it now the frame was frozen manchek got up and walked close to the screen peering off to one side look at this he said pointing to a figure it was a man in kneelength white robes standing and looking up at the plane he was an old man with a withered face his eyes were wide what do you make of this manchek said to jaggers jaggers moved close he frowned run it forward a bit the film advanced they could clearly see the man turn his head roll his eyes following the plane as it passed over him now backward jaggers said the film was run back jaggers smiled bleakly the man looks alive to me sir yes manchek said crisply he certainly does and with that he walked out of the room as he left he paused and announced that he was declaring a state of emergency that everyone on the base was confined to quarters until further notice that there would be no outside calls or communication and that what they had seen in this room was confidential outside in the hallway he headed for mission control comroe followed him i want you to call general wheeler manchek said tell him i have declared an soe without proper authorization and ask him to come down immediately technically no one but the commander had the right to declare a state of emergency comroe said wouldnt you rather tell him yourself ive got other things to do manchek said alert when arthur manchek stepped into the small soundproofed booth and sat down before the telephone he knew exactly what he was going to do but he was not very sure why he was doing it as one of the senior scoop officers he had received a briefing nearly a year before on project wildfire it had been given manchek remembered by a short little man with a dry precise way of speaking he was a university professor and he had outlined the project manchek had forgotten the details except that there was a laboratory somewhere and a team of five scientists who could be alerted to man the laboratory the function of the team was investigation of possible extraterrestrial life forms introduced on american spacecraft returning to earth manchek had not been told who the five men were he knew only that a special defense department trunk line existed for calling them out in order to hook into the line one had only to dial the binary of some number he reached into his pocket and withdrew his wallet then fumbled for a moment until he found the card he had been given by the professor in case of fire notify division emergencies only he stared at the card and wondered what exactly would happen if he dialed the binary of he tried to imagine the sequence of events who would he talk to would someone call him back would there be an inquiry a referral to higher authority he rubbed his eyes and stared at the card and finally he shrugged one way or the other he would find out he tore a sheet of paper from the pad in front of him next to the telephone and wrote this was the basis of the binary system base two raised to some power two to the zero power was one two to the first was two two squared was four and so on manchek quickly wrote another line beneath then he began to add up the numbers to get a total of he circled these numbers and then he drew in the binary code binary numbers were designed for computers which utilize an onoff yesno kind of language a mathematician once joked that binary numbers were the way people who have only two fingers count in essence binary numbers translated normal numbers which require ten digits and decimal places to a system that depended on only two digits one and zero manchek looked at the number he had just written and inserted the dashes a perfectly reasonable telephone number manchek picked up the telephone and dialed the time was exactly twelve midnight day piedmont the early hours the machinery was there the cables the codes the teleprinters had all been waiting dormant for two years it only required mancheks call to set the machinery in motion when he finished dialing he heard a series of mechanical clicks and then a low hum which meant he knew that the call was being fed into one of the scrambled trunk lines after a moment the humming stopped and a voice said this is a recording state your name and your message and hang up major arthur manchek vandenberg air force base scoop mission control i believe it is necessary to call up a wildfire alert i have confirmatory visual data at this post which has just been closed for security reasons as he spoke it occurred to him that it was all rather improbable even the tape recorder would disbelieve him he continued to hold the telephone in his hand somehow expecting an answer but there was none only a click as the connection was automatically broken the line was dead he hung up and sighed it was all very unsatisfying manchek expected to be called back within a few minutes by washington he expected to receive many calls in the next few hours and so remained at the phone yet he received no calls for he did not know that the process he had initiated was automatic once mobilized the wildfire alert would proceed ahead and not be recalled for at least twelve hours within ten minutes of mancheks call the following message clattered across the scrambled maximumsecurity cable five minutes later there was a second cable which named units of the nation the men on the wildfire team unit top secret code follows as cbw pulg coordinates delta message follows as wildfire alert has been called repeat wildfire alert has been called coordinates to read nasaamcnsc comb dec time of command to read ll on date further notations as press blackface

however the machine misprinted one of the names and failed to reread the entire message normally when one of the printout units of a secret trunk line miswrote part of a message the entire message was rewritten or else it was reread by the computer to certify its corrected form the message was thus open to doubt in washington and elsewhere a computer expert was called in to confirm the accuracy of

meant the upshot of all this was that the first two names on the list were accorded status while the rest were not pending confirmation allison stone was tired at her home in the hills overlooking the stanford campus she and her husband the chairman of the stanford bacteriology department had held a party for fifteen couples and everyone had stayed late mrs stone was annoyed she had been raised in official washington where ones second cup of coffee offered pointedly without cognac was accepted as a signal to go home unfortunately she thought academics did not follow the rules she had served the second cup of coffee hours ago and everybody was still there shortly before one am the doorbell rang answering it she was surprised to see two military men standing side by side in the night they seemed awkward and nervous to her and she assumed they were lost people often got lost driving through these residential areas at night may i help you im sorry to disturb you maam one said politely but is this the residence of dr jeremy stone yes she said frowning slightly it is she looked beyond the two men to the driveway a blue military sedan was parked there another man was standing by the car he seemed to be holding something in his hand does that man have a gun she said maam the man said we must see dr stone at once it all seemed strange to her and she found herself frightened she looked across the lawn and saw a fourth man moving up to the house and looking into the window in the pale light streaming out onto the lawn she could distinctly see the rifle in his hands whats going on maam we dont want to disturb your party please call dr stone to the door i dont know if otherwise we will have to go get him the man said she hesitated a moment then said wait here she stepped back and started to close the door but one man had already slipped into the hall he stood near the door erect and very polite with his hat in his hand ill just wait here maam he said and smiled at her she walked back to the party trying to show nothing to the guests everyone was still talking and laughing the room was noisy and dense with smoke she found jeremy in a corner in the midst of some argument about riots she touched his shoulder and he disengaged himself from the group i know this sounds funny she said but there is some kind of army man in the hall and another outside and two others with guns out on the lawn they say they want to see you for a moment stone looked surprised and then he nodded ill take care of it he said his attitude annoyed her he seemed almost to be expecting it well if you knew about this you might have told i didnt he said ill explain later he walked out to the hallway where the officer was still waiting she followed her husband stone said i am dr stone captain morton the man said he did not offer to shake hands theres a fire sir all right stone said he looked down at his dinner jacket do i have time to change im afraid not sir to her astonishment allison saw her husband nod quietly all right he turned to her and said ive got to leave his face was blank and expressionless and it seemed to her like a nightmare his face like that while he spoke she was confused and afraid when will you be back im not sure a week or two maybe longer she tried to keep her voice low but she couldnt help it she was upset what is it she said are you under arrest no he said with a slight smile its nothing like that make my apologies to everyone will you but the guns mrs stone the military man said its our job to protect your husband from now on nothing must be allowed to happen to him thats right stone said you see im suddenly an important person he smiled again an odd crooked smile and gave her a kiss and then almost before she knew what was happening he was walking out the door with captain morton on one side of him and the other man on the other the man with the rifle wordlessly fell into place behind them the man by the car saluted and opened the door then the car lights came on and the doors slammed shut and the car backed down the drive and drove off into the night she was still standing by the door when one of her guests came up behind her and said allison are you all right and she turned and found she was able to smile and say yes its nothing jeremy had to leave the lab called him another one of his latenight experiments going wrong the guest nodded and said shame its a delightful party in the car stone sat back and stared at the men he recalled that their faces were blank and expressionless he said what have you got for me got sir yes dammit what did they give you for me they must have given you something oh yes sir he was handed a slim file stenciled on the brown cardboard cover was project summary scoop nothing else stone said no sir stone sighed he had never heard of project scoop before the file would have to be read carefully but it was too dark in the car to read there would be time for that later on the airplane he found himself thinking back over the last five years back to the rather odd symposium on long island and the rather odd little speaker from england who had in his own way begun it all in the summer of j j merrick the english biophysicist presented a paper to the tenth biological symposium at cold spring harbor long island the paper was entitled frequencies of biologic contact according to speciation probabilities merrick was a rebellious unorthodox scientist whose reputation for clear thinking was not enhanced by his recent divorce or the presence of the handsome blond secretary he had brought with him to the symposium following the presentation of his paper there was little serious discussion of merricks ideas which were summarized at the end of the paper i must conclude that the first contact with extraterrestrial life will be determined by the known probabilities of speciation it is an undeniable fact that complex organisms are rare on earth while simple organisms flourish in abundance there are millions of species of bacteria and thousands of species of insects there are only a few species of primates and only four of great apes there is but one species of man with this frequency of speciation goes a corresponding frequency in numbers simple creatures are much more common than complex organisms there are three billion men on the earth and that seems a great many until we consider that ten or even one hundred times that number of first contact would consist of a plague brought back from the bacteria can be contained within a large flask all available evidence on the origin of life points to an evolutionary progression from simple to complex life forms this is true on earth it is probably true throughout the universe shapley merrow and others have calculated the number of viable planetary systems in the near universe my own calculations indicated earlier in the paper consider the relative abundance of different organisms throughout the universe my aim has been to determine the probability of contact between man and another life form that probability is as follows form probability unicellular organisms or less naked genetic in formation multicellular organisms simple multicellular organisms complex but lacking coordinated central nervous system multicellular organisms with integrated organ systems including nervous system multicellular organisms with complex nervous system capable of handling data human capability total these considerations lead me to believe that the first human interaction with extraterrestrial life will consist of contact with organisms similar to if not identical to earth bacteria or viruses the consequences of such contact are disturbing when one recalls that per cent of all earth bacteria are capable of exerting some deleterious effect upon man later merrick himself considered the possibility that the first contact would consist of a plague brought back from the moon by the first men to go there this idea was received with amusement by the assembled scientists one of the few who took it seriously was jeremy stone at the age of thirtysix stone was perhaps the most famous person attending the symposium that year he was professor of bacteriology at berkeley a post he had held since he was thirty and he had just won the nobel prize the list of stones achievements disregarding the particular series of experiments that led to the nobel prize is astonishing in he was the first to use the technique of multiplicative counts for bacterial colonies in he developed a method for liquidpure suspension in stone presented a radical new theory of operon activity in e coli and s tabuh and developed evidence for the physical nature of the inducer and repressor substances his paper on linear viral transformations opened broad new lines of scientific inquiry particularly among the pasteur institute group in paris which subsequently won the nobel prize in in stone himself won the nobel prize the award was given for work on bacterial mutant reversion that he had done in his spare time as a law student at michigan when he was twentysix perhaps the most significant thing about stone was that he had done nobelcaliber work as a law student for it demonstrated the depth and range of his interests a friend once said of him jeremy knows everything and is fascinated by i the rest already he was being compared to einstein and to bohr as a scientist with a conscience an overview an appreciation of the significance of events physically stone was a thin balding man with a prodigious memory that catalogued scientific facts and blue jokes with equal facility but his most outstanding characteristic was a sense of impatience the feeling he conveyed to every one around him that they were wasting his time he had a bad habit of interrupting speakers and finishing conversations a habit he tried to control with only limited success his imperious manner when added to the fact that he had won the nobel prize at an early age as well as the scandals of his private life he was four times married twice to the wives of colleagues did nothing to increase his popularity yet it was stone who in the early s moved forward in government circles as one of the spokesmen for the new scientific establishment he himself regarded this role with tolerant amusement a vacuum eager to be filled with hot gas he once said but in fact his influence was considerable by the early s america had reluctantly come to realize that it possessed as a nation the most potent scientific complex in the history of the world eighty per cent of all scientific discoveries in the preceding three decades had been made by americans the united states had per cent of the worlds computers and per cent of the worlds lasers the united states had three and a half times as many scientists as the soviet union and spent three and a half times as much money on research the u s had four times as many scientists as the european economic community and spent seven times as much on research most of this money came directly or indirectly from congress and congress felt a great need for men to advise them on how to spend it during the s all the great advisers had been physicists teller and oppenheimer and bruckman and weidner but ten years later with more money for biology and more concern for it a new group emerged led by debakey in houston farmer in boston heggerman in new york and stone in california stones prominence was attributable to many factors the prestige of the nobel prize his political contacts his most recent wife the daughter of senator thomas wayne of indiana his legal training all this combined to assure stones repeated appearance before confused senate subcommittees and gave him the power of any trusted adviser it was this same power that he used so successfully to implement the research and construction leading to wildfire stone was intrigued by merricks ideas which paralleled certain concepts of his own he explained these in a short paper entitled sterilization of spacecraft printed in science and later reprinted in the british journal nature the argument stated that bacterial contamination was a twoedged sword and that man must protect against both edges previous to stones paper most discussion of contamination dealt with the hazards to other planets of satellites and probes inadvertently carrying earth organisms this problem was considered early in the american space effort by nasa had set strict regulations for sterilization of earth origin probes the object of these regulations was to prevent contamination of other worlds clearly if a probe were being sent to mars or venus to search for new life forms it would defeat the purpose of the experiment for the probe to carry earth bacteria with it stone considered the reverse situation he stated that it was equally possible for extraterrestrial organisms to contaminate the earth via space probes he noted that spacecraft that burned up in reentry presented no problem but live returns manned flights and probes such as the scoop satellites were another matter entirely here he said the question of contamination was very great his paper created a brief flurry of interest but as he later said nothing very spectacular therefore in he began an informal seminar group that met twice monthly in room on the top floor of the university of california medical school biochemistry wing for lunch and discussion of the contamination problem it was this group of five men stone and john black of berkeley samuel holden and terence lisset of stanford med and andrew weiss of stanford biophysics that eventually formed the early nucleus of the wildfire project they presented a petition to the president in in a letter consciously patterned after the einstein letter to roosevelt in concerning the atomic bomb university of california berkeley calif june the president of the united states the white house pennsylvania avenue washington dc dear mr president recent theoretical considerations suggest that sterilization procedures of returning space probes may be inadequate to guarantee sterile reentry to this planets atmosphere the consequence of this is the potential introduction of virulent organisms into the present terrestrial ecologic framework it is our belief that sterilization for reentry probes and manned capsules can never be wholly satisfactory our calculations suggest that even if capsules received sterilizing procedures in space the probability of contamination would still remain one in ten thousand and perhaps much more these estimates are based upon organized life as we know it other forms of life may be entirely resistant to our sterilizing methods we therefore urge the establishment of a facility designed to deal with an extraterrestrial life form should one inadvertently be introduced to the earth the purpose of this facility would be twofold to limit dissemination of the life form and to provide laboratories for its investigation and analysis with a view to protecting earth life forms from its influence we recommend that such a facility be located in an uninhabited region of the united states that it be constructed underground that it incorporate all known isolation techniques and that it be equipped with a nuclear device for selfdestruction in the eventuality of an emergency so far as we know no form of life can survive the two million degrees of heat which accompany an atomic nuclear detonation yours very truly jeremy stone john black samuel holden terence lisset andrew weiss response to the letter was gratifyingly prompt twentyfour hours later stone received a call from one of the presidents advisers and the following day he flew to washington to confer with the president and members of the national security council two weeks after that he flew to houston to discuss further plans with nasa officials although stone recalls one or two cracks about the goddam penitentiary for bugs most scientists he talked with regarded the project favorably within a month stones informal team was hardened into an official committee to study problems of contamination and draw up recommendations this committee was put on the defense departments advance research projects list and funded through the defense department at that time the arpl was heavily invested in chemistry and physics ion sprays reversal duplication pimeson substrates but there was growing interest in biologic problems thus one arpl group was concerned with electronic pacing of brain function a euphemism for mind control a second had prepared a study of biosynergics the future possible combinations of man and machines implanted inside the body still another was evaluating project ozma the search for extraterrestrial life conducted in a fourth group was engaged in preliminary design of a machine that would carry out all human functions and would be selfduplicating all these projects were highly theoretical and all were staffed by prestigious scientists admission to the arpl was a mark of considerable status and it ensured future funds for implementation and development therefore when stones committee submitted an early draft of the life analysis protocol which detailed the way any living thing could be studied the defense department responded with an outright appropriation of for the construction of a special isolated laboratory this rather large sum was felt to be justified since the project had application to other studies already under way in the whole field of sterility and contamination was one of major importance for example nasa was building a lunar receiving laboratory a highsecurity facility for apollo astronauts returning from the moon and possibly carrying bacteria or viruses harmful to man every astronaut returning from the moon would be quarantined in the lrl for three weeks until decontamination was complete further the problems of clean rooms of industry where dust and bacteria were kept at a minimum and the sterile chambers under study at bethesda were also major aseptic environments life islands and sterile support systems seemed to have great future significance and stones appropriation was considered a good investment in all these fields once money was funded construction proceeded rapidly the eventual result the wildfire laboratory was built in in flatrock nevada design was awarded to the naval architects of the electric boat division of general dynamics since gd had considerable experience designing living quarters on atomic submarines where men had to live and work for prolonged periods the plan consisted of a conical underground structure with five floors each floor was circular with a central service core of wiring plumbing and elevators each floor was more sterile than the one above the first floor was nonsterile the second moderately sterile the third stringently sterile and so on passage from one floor to another was not free personnel had to undergo decontamination and quarantine procedures in passing either up or down once the laboratory was finished it only remained to select the wildfire alert team the group of scientists who would study any new organism after a number of studies of team composition five men were selected including jeremy stone himself these five were prepared to mobilize immediately in the event of a biologic emergency barely two years after his letter to the president stone was satisfied that this country has the capability to deal with an unknown biologic agent he professed himself pleased with the response of washington and the speed with which his ideas had been implemented but privately he admitted to friends that it had been almost too easy that washington had agreed to his plans almost too readily stone could not have known the reasons behind washingtons eagerness or the very real concern many government officials had for the problem for stone knew nothing until the night he left the party and drove off in the blue military sedan of project scoop it was the fastest thing we could arrange sir the army man said stone stepped onto the airplane with a sense of absurdity it was a boeing completely empty the seats stretching back in long unbroken rows sit first class if you like the army man said with a slight smile it doesnt matter a moment later he was gone he was not replaced by a stewardess but by a stern mp with a pistol on his hip who stood by the door as the engines started whining softly in the night stone sat back with the scoop file in front of him and began to read it made fascinating reading he went through it quickly so quickly that the mp thought his passenger must be merely glancing at the file but stone was reading every word scoop was the brainchild of major general thomas sparks head of the army medical corps chemical and biological warfare division sparks was responsible for the research of the cbw installations at fort detrick maryland harley indiana and dugway utah stone had met him once or twice and remembered him as being mildmannered and bespectacled not the sort of man to be expected in the job he held reading on stone learned that project scoop was contracted to the jet propulsion laboratory of the california institute of technology in pasadena in its avowed aim was the collection of any organisms that might exist in near space the upper atmosphere of the earth technically speaking it was an army project but it was funded through the national aeronautics and space administration a supposedly civilian organization in fact nasa was a government agency with a heavy military commitment per cent of its contractual work was classified in in theory jpl was designing a satellite to enter the fringes of space and collect organisms and dust for study this was considered a project of pure science almost curiosity and was thus accepted by all the scientists working on the study in fact the true aims were quite different the true aims of scoop were to find new life forms that might benefit the fort detrick program in essence it was a study to discover new biological weapons of war detrick was a rambling structure in maryland dedicated to the discovery of chemicalandbiologicalwarfare weapons covering acres with a physical plant valued at it ranked as one of the largest research facilities of any kind in the united states only per cent of its findings were published in open scientific journals the rest were classified as were the reports from harley and dugway harley was a maximumsecurity installation that dealt largely with viruses in the previous ten years a number of new viruses had been developed there ranging from the variety coded carrie nation which produces diarrhea to the variety coded arnold which causes clonic seizures and death the dugway proving ground in utah was larger than the state of rhode island and was used principally to test poison gases such as tabun sklar and kuff few americans stone knew were aware of the magnitude of us research into chemical and biological warfare the total government expenditure in cbw exceeded half a billion dollars a year much of this was distributed to academic centers such as johns hopkins pennsylvania and the university of chicago where studies of weapons systems were contracted under vague terms sometimes of course the terms were not so vague the johns hopkins program was devised to evaluate studies of actual or potential injuries and illnesses studies on diseases of potential biologicalwarfare significance and evaluation of certain chemical and immunological responses to certain toxoids and vaccines in the past eight years none of the results from johns hopkins had been published openly those from other universities such as chicago and ucla had occasionally been published but these were considered within the military establishment to be trial balloons examples of ongoing research intended to intimidate foreign observers a classic was the paper by tendron and five others entitled researches into a toxin which rapidly uncouples oxidative phosphorylation through cutaneous absorption the paper described but did not identify a poison that would kill a person in less than a minute and was absorbed through the skin it was recognized that this was a relatively minor achievement compared to other toxins that had been devised in recent years with so much money and effort going into cbw one might think that new and more virulent weapons would be continuously perfected however this was not the case from to the conclusion of the senate preparedness subcommittee in was that conventional research has been less than satisfactory and that new avenues and approaches of inquiry should be opened within the field that was precisely what major general thomas sparks intended to do with project scoop in final form scoop was a program to orbit seventeen satellites around the earth collecting organisms and bringing them back to the surface stone read the summaries of each previous flight scoop i was a goldplated satellite coneshaped weighing thirtyseven pounds fully equipped it was launched from vandenberg air force base in purisima california on march vandenberg is used for polar north to south orbits as opposed to cape kennedy which launches west to east vandenberg had the additional advantage of maintaining better secrecy than kennedy scoop i orbited for six days before being brought down it landed successfully in a swamp near athens georgia unfortunately it was found to contain only standard earth organisms scoop ii burned up in reentry as a result of instrumentation failure scoop iii also burned up though it had a new type of plasticandtungstenlaminate heat shield scoops iv and v were recovered intact from the indian ocean and the appalachian foothills but neither contained radically new organisms those collected were harmless variants of s albus a common contaminant of normal human skin these failures led to a further increase in sterilization procedures prior to launch scoop vi was launched on new years day it incorporated all the latest refinements from earlier attempts high hopes rode with the revised satellite which returned eleven days later landing near bombay india unknown to anyone the th airborne then stationed in evreux france just outside paris was dispatched to recover the capsule the th was on alert whenever a spaceflight went up according to the procedures of operation scrub a plan first devised to protect mercury and gemini capsules should one be forced to land in soviet russia or eastern bloc countries scrub was the primary reason for keeping a single paratroop division in western europe in the first half of the s scoop vi was recovered uneventfully it was found to contain a previously unknown form of unicellular organism coccobacillary in shape gramnegative coagulase and triokinasepositive however it proved generally benevolent to all living things with the exception of domestic female chickens which it made moderately ill for a fourday period among the detrick staff hope dimmed for the successful recovery of a pathogen from the scoop program nonetheless scoop vii was launched soon after scoop vi the exact date is classified but it is believed to be february scoop vii immediately went into stable orbit with an apogee of miles and a perigee of miles it remained in orbit for two and a half days at that time the satellite abruptly left stable orbit for unknown reasons and it was decided to bring it down by radio command the anticipated landing site was a desolate area in northeastern arizona midway through the flight his reading was interrupted by an officer who brought him a telephone and then stepped a respectful distance away while stone talked yes stone said feeling odd he was not accustomed to talking on the telephone in the middle of an airplane trip general marcus here a tired voice said stone did not know general marcus i just wanted to inform you that all members of the team have been called in with the exception of professor kirke what happened professor kirke is in the hospital general marcus said youll get further details when you touch down the conversation ended stone gave the telephone back to the officer he thought for a minute about the other men on the team and wondered at their reactions as they were called out of bed there was leavitt of course he would respond quickly leavitt was a clinical microbiologist a man experienced in the treatment of infectious disease leavitt had seen enough plagues and epidemics in his day to know the importance of quick action besides there was his ingrained pessimism which never deserted him leavitt had once said at my wedding all i could think of was how much alimony shed cost me he was an irritable grumbling heavyset man with a morose face and sad eyes which seemed to peer ahead into a bleak and miserable future but he was also thoughtful imaginative and not afraid to think daringly then there was the pathologist burton in houston stone had never liked burton very well though he acknowledged his scientific talent burton and stone were different where stone was organized burton was sloppy where stone was controlled burton was impulsive where stone was confident burton was nervous jumpy petulant colleagues referred to burton as the stumbler partly because of his tendency to trip over his untied shoelaces and baggy trouser cuffs and partly because of his talent for tumbling by error into one important discovery after another and then kirke the anthropologist from yale who apparently was not going to be able to come if the report was true stone knew he was going to miss him kirke was an illinformed and rather foppish man who possessed as if by accident a superbly logical brain he was capable of grasping the essentials of a problem and manipulating them to get the necessary result though he could not balance his own checkbook mathematicians often came to him for help in resolving highly abstract problems stone was going to miss that kind of brain certainly the fifth man would be no help stone frowned as he thought about mark hall hall had been a compromise candidate for the team stone would have preferred a physician with experience in metabolic disease and the choice of a surgeon instead had been made with the greatest reluctance there had been great pressure from defense and the aec to accept hall since those groups believed in the odd man hypothesis in the end stone and the others had given in stone did not know hall well he wondered what he would say when he was informed of the alert stone could not have known of the great delay in notifying members of the team he did not know for instance that burton the pathologist was not called until five am or that peter leavitt the microbiologist was not called until six thirty the time he arrived at the hospital and hall was not called until five minutes past seven it was mark hall said later a horrifying experience in an instant i was taken from the most familiar of worlds and plunged into the most unfamiliar at six fortyfive hall was in the washroom adjacent to or scrubbing for his first case of the day he was in the midst of a routine he had carried out daily for several years he was relaxed and joking with the resident scrubbing with him when he finished he went into the operating room holding his arms before him and the instrument nurse handed him a towel to wipe his hands dry also in the room was another resident who was prepping the body for surgery applying iodine and alcohol solutions and a circulating nurse they all exchanged greetings at the hospital hall was known as a swift quicktempered and unpredictable surgeon he operated with speed working nearly twice as fast as other surgeons when things went smoothly he laughed and joked as he worked kidding his assistants the nurses the anesthetist but if things did not go well if they became slow and difficult hall could turn blackly irritable like most surgeons he was insistent upon routine everything had to be done in a certain order in a certain way if not he became upset because the others in the operating room knew this they looked up toward the overhead viewing gallery with apprehension when leavitt appeared leavitt clicked on the intercom that connected the upstairs room to the operating room below and said hello mark hall had been draping the patient placing green sterile cloths over every part of the body except for the abdomen he looked up with surprise hello peter he said sorry to disturb you leavitt said but this is an emergency have to wait hall said im starting a procedure he finished draping and called for the skin knife he palpated the abdomen feeling for the landmarks to begin his incision it cant wait leavitt said hall paused he set down the scalpel and looked up there was a long silence what the hell do you mean it cant wait leavitt remained calm youll have to break scrub this is an emergency look peter ive got a patient here anesthetized ready to go i cant just walk kelly will take over for you kelly was one of the staff surgeons kelly hes scrubbing now leavitt said its all arranged ill expect to meet you in the surgeons change room in about thirty seconds and then he was gone hall glared at everyone in the room no one moved or spoke after a moment he stripped off his gloves and stomped out of the room swearing once very loudly hall viewed his own association with wildfire as tenuous at best in he had been approached by leavitt the chief of bacteriology of the hospital who had explained in a sketchy way the purpose of the project hall found it all rather amusing and had agreed to join the team if his services ever became necessary privately he was confident that nothing would ever come of wildfire leavitt had offered to give hall the files on wildfire and to keep him up to date on the project at first hall politely took the files but it soon became clear that he was not bothering to read them and so leavitt stopped giving them to him if anything this pleased hall who preferred not to have his desk cluttered a year before leavitt had asked him whether he wasnt curious about something that he had agreed to join and that might at some future time prove dangerous hall had said no now in the doctors room hall regretted those words the doctors room was a small place lined on all four walls with lockers there were no windows a large coffeemaker sat in the center of the room with a stack of paper cups alongside leavitt was pouring himself a cup his solemn bassethound face looking mournful this is going to be awful coffee he said you cant get a decent cup anywhere in a hospital hurry and change hall said do you mind telling me first why i mind i mind leavitt said change theres a car waiting outside and were already late perhaps too late he had a gruffly melodramatic way of speaking that had always annoyed hall there was a loud slurp as leavitt sipped the coffee just as i suspected he said how can you tolerate it hurry please hall unlocked his locker and kicked it open he leaned against the door and stripped away the black plastic shoe covers that were worn in the operating room to prevent buildup of static charges next i suppose youre going to tell me this has to do with that damned project exactly leavitt said now try to hurry the car is waiting to take us to the airport and the morning traffic is bad hall changed quickly not thinking his mind momentarily stunned somehow he had never thought it possible he dressed and walked out with leavitt toward the hospital entrance outside in the sunshine he could see the olive us army sedan pulled up to the curb its light flashing and he had a sudden horrible realization that leavitt was not kidding that nobody was kidding and that some kind of awful nightmare was coming true for his own part peter leavitt was irritated with hall in general leavitt had little patience with practicing physicians though he had an md degree leavitt had never practiced preferring to devote his time research his field was clinical microbiology and epidemiology and his specialty was parasitology he had done parasitic research all over the world his work had led to the discovery of the brazilian tapeworm taenia renzi which he had characterized in a paper in as he grew older however leavitt had stopped traveling public health he was fond of saying was a young mans game when you got your fifth case of intestinal amebiasis it was time to quit leavitt got his fifth case in rhodesia in he was dreadfully sick for three months and lost forty pounds afterward he resigned his job in the public health service he was offered the post of chief of microbiology at the hospital and he had taken it with the understanding that he would be able to devote a good portion of his time to research within the hospital he was known as a superb clinical bacteriologist but his real interest remained parasites in the period from to he published a series of elegant metabolic studies on ascaris and necator that were highly regarded by other workers in the field leavitts reputation had made him a natural choice for wildfire and it was through leavitt that hall had been asked to join leavitt knew the reasons behind halls selection though hall did not when leavitt had asked him to join hall had demanded to know why im just a surgeon he had said yes leavitt said but you know electrolytes so that may be important blood chemistries ph acidity and alkalinity the whole thing that may be vital when the time comes but there are a lot of electrolyte people hall had pointed out many of them better than me yes leavitt had said but theyre all married so what we need a single man why its necessary that one member of the team be unmarried thats crazy hall had said maybe leavitt had said maybe not they left the hospital and walked up to the army sedan a young officer was waiting stiffly and saluted as they came up dr hall yes may i see your card please hall gave him the little plastic card with his picture on it he had been carrying the card in his wallet for more than a year it was a rather strange card with just a name a picture and a thumbprint nothing more nothing to indicate that it was an official card the officer glanced at it then at hall and back to the card he handed it back very good sir he opened the rear door of the sedan hall got in and leavitt followed shielding his eyes from the flashing red light on the car top hall noticed it something wrong no just never liked flashing lights reminds me of my days as an ambulance driver during the war leavitt settled back and the car started off now then he said when we reach the airfield you will be given a file to read during the trip what trip youll be taking an f leavitt said where nevada try to read the file on the way once we arrive things will be very busy and the others in the team leavitt glanced at his watch kirke has appendicitis and is in the hospital the others have already begun work right now they are in a helicopter over piedmont arizona never heard of it hall said nobody has leavitt said until now piedmont at am on the same morning a k jet helicopter lifted off the concrete of vandenbergs maximumsecurity hangar msh and headed east toward arizona the decision to lift off from an msh was made by major manchek who was concerned about the attention the suits might draw because inside the helicopter were three men a pilot and two scientists and all three wore clear plastic inflatable suits making them look like obese men from mars or as one of the hangar maintenance men put it like balloons from the macys parade as the helicopter climbed into the clear morning sky the two passengers in the belly looked at each other one was jeremy stone the other charles burton both men had arrived at vandenberg just a few hours before stone from stanford and burton from baylor university in houston burton was fiftyfour a pathologist he held a professorship at baylor medical school and served as a consultant to the nasa manned spaceflight center in houston earlier he had done research at the national institutes in bethesda his field had been the effects of bacteria on human tissues it is one of the peculiarities of scientific development that such a vital field was virtually untouched when burton came to it though men had known germs caused disease since henles hypothesis of by the middle of the twentieth century there was still nothing known about why or how bacteria did their damage the specific mechanisms were unknown burton began like so many others in his day with diplococcus pneumoniae the agent causing pneumonia there was great interest in pneumococcus before the advent of penicillin in the forties after that both interest and research money evaporated burton shifted to staphylococcus aureus a common skin pathogen responsible for pimples and boils at the time he began his work his fellow researchers laughed at him staphylococcus like pneumococcus was highly sensitive to penicillin they doubted burton would ever get enough money to carry on his work for five years they were right the money was scarce and burton often had to go begging to foundations and philanthropists yet he persisted patiently elucidating the coats of the cell wall that caused a reaction in host tissue and helping to discover the halfdozen toxins secreted by the bacteria to break down tissue spread infection and destroy red cells suddenly in the s the first penicillinresistant strains of staph appeared the new strains were virulent and produced bizarre deaths often by brain abscess almost overnight burton found his work had assumed major importance dozens of labs around the country were changing over to study staph it was a hot field in a single year burton watched his grant appropriations jump from a year to soon afterward he was made a professor of pathology looking back burton felt no great pride in his accomplishment it was he knew a matter of luck of being in the right place and doing the right work when the time came he wondered what would come of being here in this helicopter now sitting across from him jeremy stone tried to conceal his distaste for burtons appearance beneath the plastic suit burton wore a dirty plaid sport shirt with a stain on the left breast pocket his trousers were creased and frayed and even his hair stone felt was unruly and untidy he stared out the window forcing himself to think of other matters fifty people he said shaking his head dead within eight hours of the landing of scoop vii the question is one of spread presumably airborne burton said yes presumably everyone seems to have died in the immediate vicinity of the town burton said are there reports of deaths farther out stone shook his head im having the army people look into it theyre working with the highway patrol so far no deaths have turned up outside wind a stroke of luck stone said last night the wind was fairly brisk nine miles an hour to the south and steady but around midnight it died pretty unusual for this time of year they tell me but fortunate for us yes stone nodded were fortunate in another way as well there is no important area of habitation for a radius a of nearly one hundred and twelve miles outside that of course there is las vegas to the north san bernardino to the west and phoenix to the east not nice if the bug gets to any of them but as long as the wind stays down we have time presumably stone said for the next half hour the two men discussed the vector problem with frequent reference to a sheaf of output maps drawn up during the night by vandenbergs computer division the output maps were highly complex analyses of geographic problems in this case the maps were visualizations of the southwestern united states weighted for wind direction and population graphic about page first map of mountain west of usa showing examples of the staging of computerbase output mapping each shows coordinates around population centers and other important areas a second map shows the weighting that accounts for wind and population factors and is consequently distorted in southern ca and southern nv a third map shows the computer projection of the effects of wind and population in a specific scenario none of the maps is from the wildfire project they are similar but they represent output from a cbw scenario not the actual wildfire work courtesy general autonomics corporation discussion then turned to the time course of death both men had heard the tape from the van they agreed that everyone at piedmont seemed to have died quite suddenly even if you slit a mans throat with a razor burton said you wont get death that rapidly cutting both carotids and jugulars still allows ten to forty seconds before unconsciousness and nearly a minute before death at piedmont it seems to have occurred in a second or two burton shrugged trauma he suggested a blow to the head yes or a nerve gas certainly possible its that or something very much like it stone said if it was an enzymatic block of some kind like arsenic or strychnine wed expect fifteen or thirty seconds perhaps longer but a block of nervous transmission or a block of the neuromuscular junction or cortical poisoning that could be very swift it could be instantaneous if it is a fastacting gas burton said it must have high diffusibility across the lungs or the skin stone said mucous membranes anything any porous surface burton touched the plastic of his suit if this gas is so highly diffusible stone gave a slight smile well find out soon enough over the intercom the helicopter pilot said piedmont approaching gentlemen please advise stone said circle once and give us a look at it the helicopter banked steeply the two men looked out and saw the town below them the buzzards had landed during the night and were thickly clustered around the bodies i was afraid of that stone said they may represent a vector for infectious spread burton said eat the meat of infected people and carry the organisms away with them stone nodded staring out the window what do we do gas them stone said he flicked on the intercom to the pilot have you got the canisters yes sir circle again and blanket the town yes sir the helicopter tilted and swung back soon the two men could not see the ground for the clouds of paleblue gas what is it chlorazine stone said highly effective in low concentrations on aviary metabolism birds have a high metabolic rate they are creatures that consist of little more than feathers and muscle their heartbeats are usually about onetwenty and many species eat more than their own weight every day the gas is an uncoupler yes itll hit them hard the helicopter banked away then hovered the gas slowly cleared in the gentle wind moving off to the south soon they could see the ground again hundreds of birds lay there a few flapped their wings spastically but most were already dead stone frowned as he watched somewhere in the back of his mind he knew he had forgotten something or ignored something some fact some vital clue that the birds provided and he must not overlook over the intercom the pilot said your orders sir go to the center of the main street stone said and drop the rope ladder you are to remain twenty feet above ground do not put down is that clear yes sir when we have climbed down you are to lift off to an altitude of five hundred feet yes sir return when we signal you yes sir and should anything happen to us i proceed directly to wildfire the pilot said his voice dry correct the pilot knew what that meant he was being paid according to the highest air force pay scales he was drawing regular pay plus hazardousduty pay plus nonwartime specialservices pay plus missionoverhostileterritory pay plus bonus airtime pay he would receive more than a thousand dollars for this days work and his family would receive an additional ten thousand dollars from the shortterm life insurance should he not return there was a reason for the money if anything happened to burton and stone on the ground the pilot was ordered to fly directly to the wildfire installation and hover thirty feet above ground until such time as the wildfire group had determined the correct way to incinerate him and his airplane in midair he was being paid to take a risk he had volunteered for the job and he knew that high above circling at twenty thousand feet was an air force jet with airtoair missiles it was the job of the jet to shoot down the helicopter should the pilot suffer a lastminute loss of nerve and fail to go directly to wildfire dont slip up the pilot said sir the helicopter maneuvered over the main street of the town and hung in midair there was a rattling sound the rope ladder being released stone stood and pulled on his helmet he snapped shut the sealer and inflated his clear suit puffing it up around him a small bottle of oxygen on his back would provide enough air for two hours of exploration he waited until burton had sealed his suit and then stone opened the hatch and stared down at the ground the helicopter was raising a heavy cloud of dust stone clicked on his radio all set all set stone began to climb down the ladder burton waited a moment then followed he could see nothing in the swirling dust but finally felt his shoes touch the ground he released the ladder and looked over he could barely make out stones suit a dim outline in a gloomy dusky world the ladder pulled away as the helicopter lifted into the sky the dust cleared they could see lets go stone said moving clumsily in their suits they walked down the main street of piedmont an unusual process scarcely twelve hours after the first known human contact with the andromeda strain was made at piedmont burton and stone arrived in the town weeks later in their debriefing sessions both men recalled the scene vividly and described it in detail the morning sun was still low in the sky it was cold and cheerless casting long shadows over the thinly snowcrusted ground from where they stood they could look up and down the street at the gray weathered wooden buildings but what they noticed first was the silence except for a gentle wind that whined softly through the empty houses it was deathly silent bodies lay everywhere heaped and flung across the ground in attitudes of frozen surprise but there was no sound no reassuring rumble of an automobile engine no barking dog no shouting children silence the two men looked at each other they were painfully aware of how much there was to learn to do some catastrophe had struck this town and they must discover all they could about it but they had practically no clues no points of departure they knew in fact only two things first that the trouble apparently began with the landing of scoop vii and second that death had overtaken the people of the town with astonishing rapidity if it was a disease from the satellite then it was like no other in the history of medicine for a long time the men said nothing but stood in the street looking about them feeling the wind tug at their over sized suits finally stone said why are they all outside in the street if this was a disease that arrived at night most of the people would be indoors not only that burton said theyre mostly wearing pajamas it was a cold night last night youd think they would have stopped to put on a jacket or a raincoat something to keep warm maybe they were in a hurry to do what burton said to see something stone said with a helpless shrug burton bent over the first body they came to odd he said look at the way this fellow is clutching his chest quite a few of them are doing that looking at the bodies stone saw that the hands of many were pressed to their chests some flat some clawing they didnt seem to be in pain stone said their faces are quite peaceful almost astonished in fact burton nodded these people look cut down caught in midstride but clutching their chests coronary stone said doubt it they should grimace its painful the same with a pulmonary embolus if it was fast enough they wouldnt have time perhaps but somehow i think these people died a painless death which means they are clutching their chests because they couldnt breathe stone said burton nodded its possible were seeing asphyxiation rapid painless almost instantaneous asphyxiation but i doubt it if a person cant breathe the first thing he does is loosen his clothing particularly around the neck and chest look at that man there hes wearing a tie and he hasnt touched it and that woman with the tightly buttoned collar burton was beginning to regain his composure now after the initial shock of the town he was beginning to think clearly they walked up to the van standing in the middle of the street its lights still shining weakly stone reached in to turn off the lights he pushed the stiff body of the driver back from the wheel and read the name on the breast pocket of the parka shawn the man sitting rigidly in the back of the van was a private named crane both men were locked in rigor mortis stone nodded to the equipment in the back will that still work i think so burton said then lets find the satellite thats our first job we can worry later about he stopped he was looking at the face of shawn who had obviously pitched forward hard onto the steering wheel at the moment of death there was a large arcshaped cut across his face shattering the bridge of his nose and tearing the skin i dont get it stone said get what burton said this injury look at it very clean burton said remarkably clean in fact practically no bleeding then burton realized he started to scratch his head in astonishment but his hand was stopped by the plastic helmet a cut like that he said on the face broken capillaries shattered bone torn scalp veins it should bleed like hell yes stone said it should and look at the other bodies even where the vultures have chewed at the flesh no bleeding burton stared with increasing astonishment none of the bodies had lost even a drop of blood he wondered why they had not noticed it before maybe the mechanism of action of this disease yes stone said i think you may be right he grunted and dragged shawn out of the van working to pull the stiff body from behind the wheel lets get that damned satellite he said this is really beginning to worry me burton went to the back and pulled crane out through the rear doors then climbed in as stone turned the ignition the starter turned over sluggishly and the engine did not catch stone tried to start the van for several seconds then said i dont understand the battery is low but it should still be enough hows your gas burton said there was a pause and stone swore loudly burton smiled and crawled out of the back together they walked up the street to the gas station found a bucket and filled it with gas from the pump after spending several moments trying to decide how it worked when they had the gas they returned to the van filled the tank and stone tried again the engine caught and held stone grinned lets go burton scrambled into the back turned on the electronic equipment and started the antenna rotating he heard the faint beeping of the satellite the signals weak but still there sounds over to the left somewhere stone put the van in gear they rumbled off swerving around the bodies in the street the beeping grew louder they continued down the main street past the gas station and the general store the beeping suddenly grew faint weve gone too far turn around it took a while for stone to find reverse on the gearshift and then they doubled back tracing the intensity of the sound it was another fifteen minutes before they were able to locate the origin of the beeps to the north on the outskirts of the town finally they pulled up before a plain singlestory woodframe house a sign creaked in the wind dr alan benedict might have known stone said theyd take it to the doctor the two men climbed out of the van and went up to the house the front door was open banging in the breeze they entered the living room and found it empty riming right they came to the doctors office benedict was there a pudgy whitehaired man he was seated before his desk with several textbooks laid open along one wall were bottles syringes pictures of his family and several others showing men in combat uniforms one showed a group of grinning soldiers the scrawled words for benny from the boys of anzio benedict himself was staring blankly toward a corner of the room his eyes wide his face peaceful well burton said benedict certainly didnt make it outside and then they saw the satellite it was upright a sleek polished cone three feet high and its edges had been cracked and seared from the heat of reentry it had been opened crudely apparently with the help of a pair of pliers and chisel that lay on the floor next to the capsule the bastard opened it stone said stupid son of a bitch how was he to know he might have asked somebody stone said he sighed anyway he knows now and so do fortynine other people he bent over the satellite and closed the gaping triangular hatch you have the container burton produced the folded plastic bag and opened it out together they slipped it over the satellite then sealed it shut i hope to hell theres something left burton said in a way stone said softly i hope there isnt they turned their attention to benedict stone went over to him and shook him the man fell rigidly from his chair onto the floor burton noticed the elbows and suddenly became excited he leaned over the body come on he said to stone help me do what strip him down why i want to check the lividity but why just wait burton said he began unbuttoning benedicts shirt and loosening his trousers the two men worked silently for some moments until the doctors body was naked on the floor there burton said standing back ill be damned stone said there was no dependent lividity normally after a person died blood seeped to the lowest points drawn down by gravity a person who died in bed had a purple back from accumulated blood but benedict who had died sitting up had no blood in the tissue of his buttocks or thighs or in his elbows which had rested on the arms of the chair quite a peculiar finding burton said he glanced around the room and found a small autoclave for sterilizing instruments opening it he removed a scalpel he fitted it with a blade carefully so as not to puncture his airtight suit and then turned back to the body well take the most superficial major artery and vein he said which is the radial at the wrist holding the scalpel carefully burton drew the blade along the skin of the inner wrist just behind the thumb the skin pulled back from the wound which was completely bloodless he exposed fat and subcutaneous tissue there was no bleeding amazing he cut deeper there was still no bleeding from the incision suddenly abruptly he struck a vessel crumbling redblack material fell out onto the floor ill be damned stone said again clotted solid burton said no wonder the people didnt bleed burton said help me turn him over together they got the corpse onto its back and burton made a deep incision into the medial thigh cutting down to the femoral artery and vein again there was no bleeding and when they reached the artery as thick as a mans finger it was clotted into a firm reddish mass incredible he began another incision this time into the chest he exposed the ribs then searched dr benedicts office for a very sharp knife he wanted an osteotome but could find none he settled for the chisel that had been used to open the capsule using this he broke away several ribs to expose the lungs and the heart again there was no bleeding burton took a deep breath then cut open the heart slicing into the left ventricle the interior was filled with red spongy material there was no liquid blood at all clotted solid he said no question any idea what can clot people this way the whole vascular system five quarts of blood no burton sat heavily in the doctors chair and stared at the body he had just cut open ive never heard of anything like it theres a thing called disseminated intravascular coagulation but its rare and requires all sorts of special circumstances to initiate it could a single toxin initiate it in theory i suppose but in fact there isnt a toxin in the world he stopped yes stone said i suppose thats right he picked up the satellite designated scoop vii and carried it outside to the van when he came back he said wed better search the houses beginning here might as well stone said it was burton who found mrs benedict she was a pleasantlooking middleaged lady sitting in a chair with a book on her lap she seemed about to turn the page burton examined her briefly then heard stone call to him he walked to the other end of the house stone was in a small bedroom bent over the body of a young teenage boy on the bed it was obviously his room psychedelic posters on the walls model airplanes on a shelf to one side the boy lay on his back in bed eyes open staring at the ceiling his mouth was open in one hand an empty tube of modelairplane cement was tightly clenched all over the bed were empty bottles of airplane dope paint thinner turps stone stepped back have a look burton looked in the mouth reached a finger in touched the nowhardened mass good god he said stone was frowning this took time he said regardless of what made him do it it took time weve obviously been oversimplifying events here everyone did not die instantaneously some people died in their homes some got out into the street and this kid here he shook his head lets check the other houses on the way out burton returned to the doctors office stepping around the body of the physician it gave him a strange feeling to see the wrist and leg sliced open the chest exposed but no bleeding there was something wild and inhuman about that as if bleeding were a sign of humanity well he thought perhaps it is perhaps the fact that we bleed to death makes us human for stone piedmont was a puzzle challenging him to crack its secret he was convinced that the town could tell him everything about the nature of the disease its course and effects it was only a matter of putting together the data in the proper way but he had to admit as they continued their search that the data were confusing a house that contained a man his wife and their young daughter all sitting around the dinner table they had apparently been relaxed and happy and none of them had had time to push back their chairs from the table they remained frozen in attitudes of congeniality smiling at each other across the plates of nowrotting food and flies stone noticed the flies which buzzed softly in the room he would he thought have to remember the flies an old woman her hair white her face creased she was smiling gently as she swung from a noose tied to a ceiling rafter the rope creaked as it rubbed against the wood of the rafter at her feet was an envelope in a careful neat unhurried hand to whom it may concern stone opened the letter and read it the day of judgment is at hand the earth and the waters shall open up and mankind shall be consumed may god have mercy on my soul and upon those who have shown mercy to me to hell with the others amen burton listened as the letter was read crazy old lady he said senile dementia she saw everyone around her dying and she went nuts and killed herself yes i think so pretty bizarre way to kill herself dont you think that kid also chose a bizarre way burton said stone nodded roy o thompson who lived alone from his greasy coveralls they assumed he ran the town gas station roy had apparently filled his bathtub with water then knelt down stuck his head in and held it there until he died when they found him his body was rigid holding himself under the surface of the water there was no one else around and no sign of struggle impossible stone said no one can commit suicide that way lydia everett a seamstress in the town who had quietly gone out to the back yard sat in a chair poured gasoline over herself and struck a match next to the remains of her body they found the scorched gasoline can william arnold a man of sixty sitting stiffly in a chair in the living room wearing his world war i uniform he had been a captain in that war and he had become a captain again briefly before he shot himself through the right temple with a colt there was no blood in the room when they found him he appeared almost ludicrous sitting there with a clean dry hole in his head a tape recorder stood alongside him his left hand resting on the case burton looked at stone questioningly then turned it on a quavering irritable voice spoke to them you took your sweet time coming didnt you still i am glad you have arrived at last we are in need of reinforcements i tell you its been one hell of a battle against the hun lost per cent last night going over the top and two of our officers are out with the rot not going well not at all if only gary cooper was here we need men like that the men who made america strong i cant tell you how much it means to me with those giants out there in the flying saucers now theyre burning us down and the gas is coming you can see them die and we dont have gas masks none at all but i wont wait for it i am going to do the proper thing now i regret that i have but one life to kill for my country the tape ran on but it was silent burton turned if off crazy he said stark raving mad stone nodded some of them died instantly and the otherswent quietly nuts but we seem to come back to the same basic question why what was the difference perhaps theres a graded immunity to this bug burton said some people are more susceptible than others some people are protected at least for a time you know stone said there was that report from the flybys and those films of a man alive down here one man in white robes you think hes still alive well i wonder stone said because if some people survived longer than others long enough to dictate a taped speech or to arrange a hanging then you have to ask yourself if someone maybe didnt survive for a very long time you have to ask yourself if there isnt someone in this town who is still alive it was then that they heard the sound of crying at first it seemed like the sound of the wind it was so high and thin and reedy but they listened feeling puzzled at first and then astonished the crying persisted interrupted by little hacking coughs they ran outside it was faint and difficult to localize they ran up the street and it seemed to grow louder this spurred them on and then abruptly the sound stopped the two men came to a halt gasping for breath chests heaving they stood in the middle of the hot deserted street and looked at each other have we lost our minds burton said no stone said we heard it all right they waited it was absolutely quiet for several minutes burton looked down the street at the houses and the jeep van parked at the other end in front of dr benedicts house the crying began again very loud now a frustrated howl the two men ran it was not far two houses up on the right side a man and a woman lay outside on the sidewalk fallen and clutching their chests they ran past them and into the house the crying was still louder it filled the empty rooms they hurried upstairs clambering up and came to the bedroom a large double bed unmade a dresser a mirror a closet and a small crib they leaned over pulling back the blankets from a small very redfaced very unhappy infant the baby immediately stopped crying long enough to survey their faces enclosed in the plastic suits then it began to howl again scared hell out of it burton said poor thing he picked it up gingerly and rocked it the baby continued to scream its toothless mouth was wide open its cheeks purple and the veins stood out on its forehead probably hungry burton said stone was frowning its not very old cant be more than a couple of months is it a he or a she burton unwrapped the blankets and checked the diapers he and he needs to be changed and fed he looked around the room theres probably a formula in the kitchen no stone said we dont feed it why not we dont do anything to that child until we get it out of this town maybe feeding is part of the disease process maybe the people who werent hit so hard or so fast were the ones who hadnt eaten recently maybe theres something protective about this babys diet maybe he stopped but whatever it is we cant take a chance weve got to wait and get him into a controlled situation burton sighed he knew that stone was right but he also knew that the baby hadnt been fed for at least twelve hours no wonder the kid was crying stone said this is a very important development its a major break for us and weve got to protect it i think we should go back immediately we havent finished our head count stone shook his head doesnt matter we have something much more valuable than anything we could hope to find we have a survivor the baby stopped crying for a moment stuck its finger in its mouth and looked questioningly up at burton then when he was certain no food was forthcoming he began to howl again too bad burton said he cant tell us what happened im hoping he can stone said they parked the van in the center of the main street beneath the hovering helicopter and signaled for it to descend with the ladder burton held the infant and stone held the scoop satellite strange trophies stone thought from a very strange town the baby was quiet now he had finally tired of crying and was sleeping fitfully awakening at intervals to whimper then sleep again the helicopter descended spinning up swirls of dust burton wrapped the blankets about the babys face to protect him the ladder came down and he climbed up with difficulty stone waited on the ground standing with the capsule in the wind and dust and thumpy noise from the helicopter and suddenly he realized that he was not alone on the street he turned and saw a man behind him he was an old man with thin gray hair and a wrinkled worn face he wore a long nightgown that was smudged with dirt and yellowed with dust and his feet were bare he stumbled and tottered toward stone his chest was heaving with exertion beneath the nightgown who are you stone said but he knew the man in the pictures the one who had been photographed by the airplane you the man said who are you you did it what is your name dont hurt me im not like the others he was shaking with fear as he stared at stone in his plastic suit stone thought we must look strange to him like men from mars men from another world dont hurt me we wont hurt you stone said what is your name jackson peter jackson sir please dont hurt me he waved to the bodies in the street im not like the others we wont hurt you stone said again you hurt the others no we didnt theyre dead we had nothing youre lying he shouted his eyes wide youre lying to me youre not human youre only pretending you know im a sick man you know you can pretend with me im a sick man im bleeding i know ive had this this this he faltered and then doubled over clutching his stomach and wincing in pain are you all right the man fell to the ground he was breathing heavily his skin pale there was sweat on his face my stomach he gasped its my stomach and then he vomited it came up heavy deepred rich with blood mr jackson but the man was not awake his eyes were closed and he was lying on his back for a moment stone thought he was dead but then he saw the chest moving slowly very slowly but moving burton came back down who is he our wandering man help me get him up is he alive so far ill be damned burton said they used the power winch to hoist up the unconscious body of peter jackson and then lowered it again to raise the capsule then slowly burton and stone climbed the r into the belly of the helicopter they did not remove their suits but instead clipped on a second bottle of oxygen to give them another two hours of breathing time that would be sufficient to carry them to the wildfire installation the pilot established a radio connection to vandenberg so that stone could talk with major manchek what have you found manchek said the town is dead we have good evidence for an unusual process at work be careful manchek said this is an open circuit i am aware of that will you order up a ill try you want it now yes now piedmont yes you have the satellite yes we have it all right manchek said ill put through the order directive directive was a part of the final wildfire protocol for action in the event of a biologic emergency it called for the placement of a limited thermonuclear weapon at the site of exposure of terrestrial life to exogenous organisms the code for the directive was cautery since the function of the bomb was to cauterize the infection to burn it out and thus prevent its spread as a single step in the wildfire protocol cautery had been agreed upon by the authorities involved executive state defense and aec after much debate the aec already unhappy about the assignment of a nuclear device to the wildfire laboratory did not wish cautery to be accepted as a program state and defense argued that any aboveground thermonuclear detonation for whatever purpose would have serious repercussions internationally the president finally agreed to directive but insisted that he retain control over the decision to use a bomb for cautery stone was displeased with this arrangement but he was forced to accept it the president had been under considerable pressure to reject the whole idea and had compromised only after much argument then too there was the hudson institute study the hudson institute had been contracted to study possible consequences of cautery their report indicated that the president would face four circumstances scenarios in which he might have to issue the cautery order according to degree of seriousness the scenarios were a satellite or manned capsule lands in an unpopulated area of the united states the president may cauterize the area with little domestic uproar and small loss of life the russians may be privately informed of the reasons for breaking the moscow treaty of forbidding aboveground nuclear testing a satellite or manned capsule lands in a major american city the example was chicago the cautery will require destruction of a large land area and a large population with great domestic consequences and secondary international consequences a satellite or manned capsule lands in a major neutralist urban center new delhi was the example the cautery will entail american intervention with nuclear weapons to prevent further spread of disease according to the scenarios there were seventeen possible consequences of americansoviet interaction following the destruction of new delhi twelve led directly to thermonuclear war a satellite or manned capsule lands in a major soviet urban center the example was stalingrad cautery will require the united states to inform the soviet union of what has happened and to advise that the russians themselves destroy the city according to the hudson institute scenario there were six possible consequences of americanrussian interaction following this event and all six led directly to war it was therefore advised that if a satellite fell within soviet or eastern bloc territory the united states not inform the russians of what had happened the basis of this decision was the prediction that a russian plague would kill between two and five million people while combined sovietamerican losses from a thermonuclear exchange involving both first and secondstrike capabilities would come to more than two hundred and fifty million persons as a result of the hudson institute report the president and his advisers felt that control of cautery and responsibility for it should remain within political not scientific hands the ultimate consequences of the presidents decision could not of course have been predicted at the time it was made washington came to a decision within an hour of mancheks report the reasoning behind the presidents decision has never been clear but the final result was plain enough the president elected to postpone calling directive for twentyfour to fortyeight hours instead he called out the national guard and cordoned off the area around piedmont for a radius of one hundred miles and he waited flatrock mark william hall md sat in the tight rear seat of the f fighter and stared over the top of the rubber oxygen mask at the file on his knees leavitt had given it to him just before takeoff a heavy thick wad of paper bound in gray cardboard hall was supposed to read it during the flight but the f was not made for reading there was barely enough room in front of him to hold his i hands clenched together let alone open a file and read yet hall was reading it on the cover of the file was stenciled wildfire and underneath an ominous note this file is classified top secret examination by unauthorized persons is a criminal offense punishable by fines and imprisonment up to years and when leavitt gave him the file hall had read the note and whistled dont you believe it leavitt said just a scare scare hell leavitt said if the wrong man reads this file he just disappears nice read it leavitt said and youll see why the plane flight had taken an hour and forty minutes cruising in eerie perfect silence at times the speed of sound hall had skimmed through most of the file reading it he had found was impossible much of its bulk of pages

department of defense this page from a highsecurity file has been deleted the page is number two hundred fiftyfive the file is coded wildfire the subject matter deleted is odd man hypothesis please note that this constitutes a legal deletion from the file which need not be reported by the reader machine score review below hall was frowning at the page wondering what it meant when the pilot said dr hall yes we have just passed the last checkpoint sir we will touch down in four minutes all right hall paused do you know where exactly we are landing i believe said the pilot that it is flatrock nevada i see hall said a few minutes later the flaps went down and he heard a whine as the airplane slowed nevada was the ideal site for wildfire the silver state ranks seventh in size but fortyninth in population it is the leastdense state in the union after alaska particularly when one considers that per cent of the states people live in las vegas reno or carson city the population density of persons per square mile seems well suited for projects such as wildfire and indeed many have been located there along with the famous atomic site at vinton flats there is the ultraenergy test station at martindale and the air force medivator unit near los gados most of these facilities are in the southern triangle of the state having been located there in the days before las vegas swelled to receive twenty million visitors a year more recently government test stations have been located in the northwest corner of nevada which is still relatively isolated pentagon classified lists include five new installations in that area the nature of each is unknown stage i hall landed shortly after noon the hottest part of the day the sun beat down from a pale cloudless sky and the airfield asphalt was soft under his feet as he walked from the airplane to the small quonset hut at the edge of the runway feeling his feet sink into the surface hall thought that the airfield must have been designed primarily for night use at night it would be cold the asphalt solid the quonset hut was cooled by two massive grumbling air conditioners it was furnished sparsely a card table in one corner at which two pilots sat playing poker and drinking coffee a guard in the corner was making a telephone call he had a machine gun slung over his shoulder he did not look up as hall entered there was a coffee machine near the telephone hall went over with his pilot and they each poured a cup hall took a sip and said wheres the town anyway i didnt see it as we were coming in dont know sir have you been here before no sir its not on the standard runs well what exactly does this airfield serve at that moment leavitt strode in and beckoned to hall the bacteriologist led him through the back of the quonset and then out into the heat again to a lightblue falcon sedan parked in the rear there were no identifying marks of any kind on the car there was no driver leavitt slipped behind the wheel and motioned for hall to get in as leavitt put the car in gear hall said i guess we dont rate any more oh yes we rate but drivers arent used out here in fact we dont use any more personnel than we have to the number of wagging tongues is kept to a minimum they set off across desolate hilly countryside in the distance were blue mountains shimmering in the liquid heat of the desert the road was pockmarked and dusty it looked as if it hadnt been used for years hall mentioned this deceptive leavitt said we took great pains about it we spent nearly five thousand dollars on this road why leavitt shrugged had to get rid of the tractor treadmarks a hell of a lot of heavy equipment has moved over these roads at one time or another wouldnt want anyone to wonder why speaking of caution hall said after a pause i was reading in the file something about an atomic selfdestruct device what about it it exists it exists installation of the device had been a major stumbling block in the early plans for wildfire stone and the others had insisted that they retain control over the detonateno detonate decision the aec and the executive branch had been reluctant no atomic device had been put in private hands before stone argued that in the event of a leak in the wildfire lab there might not be time to consult with washington and get a presidential detonate order it was a long time before the president agreed that this might be true i was reading hall said that this device is somehow connected with the odd man hypothesis it is how the page on odd man was taken from my file i know leavitt said well talk about it later the falcon turned off the potted road onto a dirt track the sedan raised a heavy cloud of dust and despite the heat they were forced to roll up the windows hall lit a cigarette thatll be your last leavitt said i know let me enjoy it on their fight they passed a sign that said government property keep off but there was no fence no guard no dogs just a battered weatherbeaten sign great security measures hall said we try not to arouse suspicion the security is better than it looks they proceeded another mile bouncing along the dirt rut and then came over a hill suddenly hall saw a large fenced circle perhaps a hundred yards in diameter the fence he noticed was ten feet high and sturdy at intervals it was laced with barbed wire inside was a utilitarian wooden building and a field of corn com hall said rather clever i think they came to the entrance gate a man in dungarees and a tshirt came out and opened it for them he held a sandwich in one hand and was chewing vigorously as he unlocked the gate he winked and smiled and waved them through still chewing the sign by the gate said government property us department of agriculture desert reclamation test station leavitt drove through the gates and parked by the wooden building he left the keys on the dashboard and got out hall followed him now what inside leavitt said they entered the building coming directly into a small room a man in a stetson hat checked sport shirt and string tie sat at a rickety desk he was reading a newspaper and like the man at the gate eating his lunch he looked up and smiled pleasantly howdy he said hello leavitt said help you folks just passing through leavitt said on the way to rome the man nodded have you got the time my watch stopped yesterday leavitt said durn shame the man said its because of the heat the ritual completed the man nodded again and they walked past him out of the anteroom and down a corridor the doors had handprinted labels seedling incubation moisture control soil analysis a halfdozen people were at work in the building all of them dressed casually but all of them apparently busy this is a real agricultural station leavitt said if necessary that man at the desk could give you a guided tour explaining the purpose of the station and the experiments that are going on mostly they are attempting to develop a strain of corn that can grow in lowmoisture highalkalinity soil and the wildfire installation here leavitt said he opened a door marked storage and they found themselves staring at a narrow cubicle lined with rakes and hoes and watering hoses step in leavitt said hall did leavitt followed and closed the door behind him hall felt the floor sink and they began to descend rakes and hoses and all in a moment he found himself in a modern bare room lighted by banks of cold overhead fluorescent lights the walls were painted red the only object in the room was a rectangular waisthigh box that reminded hall of a podium it had a glowing green glass top step up to the analyzer leavitt said place your hands flat on the glass palms down hall did he felt a faint tingling in his fingers and then the machine gave a buzz all right step back leavitt placed his hands on the box waited for the buzz and then said now we go over here you mentioned the security arrangements ill show them to you before we enter wildfire he nodded to a door across the room what was that thing finger and palmprint analyzer leavitt said it is fully automatic reads a composite of ten thousand dermatographic lines so it cant make a mistake in its storage banks it has a record of the prints of everyone cleared to enter wildfire leavitt pushed through the door they were faced with another door marked security which slid back noiselessly they entered a darkened room in which a single man sat before banks of green dials hello john leavitt said to the man how are you good dr leavitt saw you come in leavitt introduced hall to the security man who then demonstrated the equipment to hall there were the man explained two radar scanners located in the hills overlooking the installation they were well concealed but quite effective then closer in impedance sensors were buried in the ground they signaled the approach of any animal life weighing more than one hundred pounds the sensors ringed the base weve never missed anything yet the man said and if we do he shrugged to leavitt going to show him the dogs yes leavitt said they walked through into an adjoining room there were nine large cages there and the room smelled strongly of animals hall found himself looking at nine of the largest german shepherds he had ever seen they barked at him as he entered but there was no sound in the room he watched in astonishment as they opened their mouths and threw their heads forward in a barking motion no sound these are armytrained sentry dogs the security man said bred for viciousness you wear leather clothes and heavy gloves when you walk them theyve undergone laryngectomies which is why you cant hear them silent and vicious hall said have you ever uh used them no the security man said fortunately not they were in a small room with lockers hall found one with his name on it we change in here leavitt said he nodded to a stack of pink uniforms in one corner put those on after you have removed everything you are wearing hall changed quickly the uniforms were loosefitting onepiece suits that zipped up the side when they had changed they proceeded down a passageway suddenly an alarm sounded and a gate in front of them slid closed abruptly overhead a white light began to flash hall was confused and it was only much later that he remembered leavitt looked away from the flashing light somethings wrong leavitt said did you remove everything yes hall said rings watch everything hall looked at his hands he still had his watch on go back leavitt said put it in your locker hall did when he came back they started down the corridor a second time the gate remained open and there was no alarm automatic as well hall said yes leavitt said it picks up any foreign object when we installed it we were worried because we knew it would pick up glass eyes cardiac pacemakers false teeth anything at all but fortunately nobody on the project has these things fillings it is programmed to ignore fillings how does it work some kind of capacitance phenomenon i dont really understand it leavitt said they passed a sign that said you are now entering level i proceed directly to immunization control hall noticed that all the walls were red he mentioned this to leavitt yes leavitt said all levels are painted a different color level i is red ii yellow iii white iv green and v blue any particular reason for the choice it seems leavitt said that the navy sponsored some studies a few years back on the psychological effects of colored environments those studies have been applied here they came to immunization a door slid back revealing three glass booths leavitt said just sit down in one of them i suppose this is automatic too of course hall entered a booth and closed the door behind him there was a couch and a mass of complex equipment in front of the couch was a television screen which showed several lighted points sit down said a flat mechanical voice sit down sit down he sat on the couch observe the screen before you place your body on the couch so that all points are obliterated he looked at the screen he now saw that the points were arranged in the shape of a man he shifted his body and one by one the spots disappeared very good said the voice we may now proceed state your name for the record last name first first name last mark hall he said state your name for the record last name first first name last simultaneously on the screen appeared the words subject has given uncodable response hall mark thank you for your cooperation said the voice please recite mary had a little lamb youre kidding hall said there was a pause and the faint sound of relays and circuits clicking the screen again showed subject has given uncodable response please recite feeling rather foolish hall said mary had a little lamb her fleece was white as snow and everywhere that mary went the lamb was sure to go another pause then the voice thank you for your cooperation and the screen said analyzer confirms identity hall mark please listen closely said the mechanical voice you will answer the following questions with a yes or no reply make no other response have you received a smallpox vaccination within the last twelve months yes diphtheria yes typhoid and paratyphoid a and b yes tetanus toxoid yes yellow fever yes yes yes i had them all just answer the question please uncooperative subjects waste valuable computer time yes hall said subdued when he had joined the wildfire team he had undergone immunizations for everything imaginable even plague and cholera which had to be renewed every six months and gammaglobulin shots for viral infection have you ever contracted tuberculosis or other mycobacterial disease or had a positive skin test for tuberculosis no have you ever contracted syphilis or other spirochetal disease or had a positive serological test for syphilis no have you contracted within the past year any grampositive bacterial infection such as streptococcus staphylococcus or pneumococcus no any gramnegative infection such as gonococcus meningeococcus proteus pseudomonas salmonella or shigella no have you contracted any recent or past fungal infection including blastomycosis histoplasmosis or coccidiomycosis or had a positive skin test for any fungal disease no have you had any recent viral infection including poliomyelitis hepatitis mononucleosis mumps measles varicella or herpes no any warts no have you any known allergies yes to ragweed pollen on the screen appeared the words rogeen palen and then after a moment uncodable response please repeat your response slowly for our memory cells very distinctly he said ragweed pollen on the screen ragweed pollen coded are you allergic to albumen continued the voice no this ends the formal questions please undress and return to the couch obliterating the points as before he did so a moment later an ultraviolet lamp swung out on a long arm and moved close to his body next to the lamp was some kind of scanning eye watching the screen he could see the computer print of the scan beginning with his feet graphic of a foot this is a scan for fungus the voice announced after several minutes hall was ordered to lie on his stomach and the process was repeated he was then told to lie on his back once more and align himself with the dots physical parameters will now be measured the voice said you are requested to lie quietly while the examination is conducted a variety of leads snaked out at him and were attached by mechanical hands to his body some he could understand the halfdozen leads over his chest for an electrocardiogram and twentyone on his head for an electroencephalogram but others were fixed on his stomach his arms and his legs please raise your left hand said the voice hall did from above a mechanical hand came down with an electric eye fixed on either side of it the mechanical hand examined halls place your hand on the board to the left do not move you will feel a slight prick as the intravenous needle is inserted hall looked over at the screen it flashed a color image of his hand with the veins showing in a pattern of green against a blue background obviously the machine worked by sensing heat he was about to protest when he felt a brief sting he looked back the needle was in now then just lie quietly relax for fifteen seconds the machinery whirred and clattered then the leads were withdrawn the mechanical hands placed a neat bandaid over the intravenous puncture this completes your physical parameters the voice said can i get dressed now please sit up with your right shoulder facing the television screen you will receive pneumatic injections a gun with a thick cable came out of one wall pressed up against the skin of his shoulder and fired there was a hissing sound and a brief pain now you may dress said the voice be advised that you may feel dizzy for a few hours you have received booster immunizations and gamma g if you feel dizzy sit down if you suffer systemic effects such as nausea vomiting or fever report at once to level control is that clear yes the exit is to your right thank you for your cooperation this recording is now ended hall walked with leavitt down a long red corridor his arm ached from the injection that machine hall said youd better not let the ama find out about it we havent leavitt said in fact the electronic body analyzer had been developed by sandeman industries in under a general government contract to produce body monitors for astronauts in space it was understood by the government at that time that such a device though expensive at a cost of each would eventually replace the human physician as a diagnostic instrument the difficulties for both doctor and patient of adjusting to this new machine were recognized by everyone the government did not plan to release the eba until and then only to certain large hospital facilities walking along the corridor hall noticed that the walls were slightly curved where exactly are we on the perimeter of level to our left are all the laboratories to the right is nothing but solid rock several people were walking in the corridor everyone wore pink jumpsuits they all seemed serious and busy where are the others on the team hall said right here leavitt said he opened a door marked conference and they entered a room with a large hardwood table stone was there standing stiffly erect and alert as if he had just taken a cold shower alongside him burton the pathologist somehow appeared sloppy and confused and there was a kind of tired fright in his eyes they all exchanged greetings and sat down stone reached into his pocket and removed two keys one was silver the other red the red one had a chain attached to it he gave it to hall put it around your neck he said hall looked at it whats this leavitt said im afraid mark is still unclear about the odd man i thought that he would read it on the plane his file was edited i see stone turned to hall you know nothing about the odd man nothing hall said frowning at the key nobody told you that a major factor in your selection to the team was your single status what does that have to do the fact of the matter is stone said that you are the odd man you are the key to all this quite literally he took his own key and walked to a corner of the room he pushed a hidden button and the wood paneling slid away to reveal a burnished metal console he inserted his key into a lock and twisted it a green light on the console flashed on he stepped back the paneling slid into place at the lowest level of this laboratory is an automatic atomic selfdestruct device stone said it is controlled from within the laboratory i have just inserted my key and armed the mechanism the device is ready for detonation the key on this level cannot be removed it is now locked in place your key on the other hand can be inserted and removed again there is a threeminute delay between the time detonation locks in and the time the bomb goes off that period is to provide you time to think and perhaps call it all off hall was still frowning but why me because you are single we have to have one unmarried man stone opened a briefcase and withdrew a file he gave it to hall read that it was a wildfire file page stone said hall turned to it project wildfire

trapping organisms of size up to one micron trapping at efficiency per leaf causing triplelayered membrance to give results of infective ratio of remainder too low to be harmful cost factor of four or

summary appended summary of odd man hypothesis first tested as null hypothesis by wildfire advisory committee grew out of tests conducted by usaf norad to determine reliability of commanders in making lifedeath decisions tests involved decisions in ten scenario contexts with prestructured alternatives drawn up by walter reed psychiatric division after norder test analysis by biostatistics unit nih bethesda test given to sac pilots and groundcrews norad workers and others involved in decisionmaking or positiveaction capacity ten scenarios drawn up by hudson institute subjects required to make yesno decision in each case decisions always involved thermonuclear or chembiol destruction of enemy targets data on subjects tested by hh program for multifactorial analysis of variance later test by anovar program final discrimination by classif program nih biostat summarizes this program as follows it is the object of this program to determine the effectiveness of assigning individuals to distinct groups on the basis of scores which can be quantified the program produces group contours and probability of classification for individuals as a control of data program prints mean scores for groups contour confidence limits and scores of individual test subjects kg borgrand phd nih results of odd man study the study concluded that married individuals performed differently from single individuals on several parameters of the test hudson institute provided mean answers ie theoretical right decisions made by computer on basis of data given in scenario conformance of study groups to these right answers produced an index of effectiveness a measure of the extent to which correct decisions were made group index of effectiveness married males married females single females single males the data indicate that married men choose the correct decision only once in three times while single men choose correctly four out of five times the group of single males was then broken down further in search of highly accurate subgroups within that classification results of special testing confirm the odd man hypothesis that an unmarried male should carry out command decisions involving thermonuclear or chembiol destruct contexts single males total military commissioned officer noncommissioned officer technical engineers ground crews service maintenance and utility professional scientists these results concerning the relative skill of decisionmaking individuals should not be interpreted hastily although it would appear that janitors are better decision makers than generals the situation is in reality more complex printed scores are summations of test and individual variations data must be interpreted with this in mind failure to do so may lead to totally erroneous and dangerous assumptions application of study to wildfire command personnel conducted at request of aec at time of implantation of selfdestruct nuclear capacity test given to all wildfire personnel results filed under classif wildfire general personnel see ref special testing for command group name index of effectiveness burton leavitt kirke stone hall results of special testing confirm the odd man hypothesis that an unmarried male should carry out command decisions involving thermonuclear or chembiol destruct contexts when hall had finished reading he said its crazy nonetheless stone said it was the only way we could get the government to put control of the weapon in our hands you really expect me to put in my key and fire that thing im afraid you dont understand stone said the detonation mechanism is automatic should breakthrough of the organism occur with contamination of all level v detonation will take place within three minutes unless you lock in your key and call it off oh hall said in a quiet voice decontamination a bell rang somewhere on the level stone glanced up at the wall clock it was late he began the formal briefing talking rapidly pacing up and down the room hands moving constantly as you know he said we are on the top level of a fivestory underground structure according to protocol it will take us nearly twentyfour hours to descend through the sterilization and decontamination procedures to the lowest level therefore we must begin immediately the capsule is already on its way he pressed a button on a console at the head of the table and a television screen glowed to life showing the coneshaped satellite in a plastic bag making its descent it was being cradled by mechanical hands the central core of this circular building stone said contains elevators and service units plumbing wiring that sort of thing that is where you see the capsule now it will be deposited shortly in a maximumsterilization assembly on the lowest level he went on to explain that he had brought back two other surprises from piedmont the screen shifted to show peter jackson lying on a litter with intravenous lines running into both arms this man apparently survived the night he was the one walking around when the planes flew over and he was still alive this morning whats his status now uncertain stone said he is unconscious and he was vomiting blood earlier today weve started intravenous dextrose to keep him fed and hydrated until we can get down to the bottom stone flicked a button and the screen showed the baby it was howling strapped down to a tiny bed an intravenous bottle was running into a vein in the scalp this little fellow also survived last night stone said so we brought him along we couldnt really leave him since a directive was being called the town is now destroyed by a nuclear blast besides he and jackson are living clues which may help us unravel this mess then for the benefit of hall and leavitt the two men disclosed what they had seen and learned at piedmont they reviewed the findings of rapid death the bizarre suicides the clotted arteries and the lack of bleeding hall listened in astonishment leavitt sat shaking his head when they were through stone said questions none that wont keep leavitt said then lets get started stone said they began at a door which said in plain white letters to level ii it was an innocuous straightforward almost mundane sign hall had expected something more perhaps a stern guard with a machine gun or a sentry to check passes but there was nothing and he noticed that no one had badges or clearance cards of any kind he mentioned this to stone yes stone said we decided against badges early on they are easily contaminated and difficult to sterilize usually they are plastic and highheat sterilization melts them the four men passed through the door which clanged shut heavily and sealed with a hissing sound it was airtight hall faced a tiled room empty except for a hamper marked i clothing he unzipped his jumpsuit and dropped it into the hamper there was a brief flash of light as it was incinerated then looking back he saw that on the door through which he had come was a sign return to level i is not possible through this access he shrugged the other men were already moving through the second door marked simply exit he followed them and stepped into clouds of steam the odor was peculiar a faint woodsy smell that he guessed was scented disinfectant he sat down on a bench and relaxed allowing the steam to envelop him it was easy enough to understand the purpose of the steam room the heat opened the pores and the steam would be inhaled into the lungs the four men waited saying little until their bodies were coated with a sheen of moisture and then walked into the next room leavitt said to hall what do you think of this its like a goddam roman bath hall said the next room contained a shallow tub immerse feet only and a shower do not swallow shower solution avoid undue exposure to eyes and mucous membranes it was all very intimidating he tried to guess what the solutions were by smell but failed the shower was slippery though which meant it was alkaline he asked leavitt about this and leavitt said the solution was alpha chlorophin at ph leavitt said that whenever possible acidic and alkaline solutions were alternated when you think about it leavitt said weve faced up to quite a planning problem here how to disinfect the human body one of the dirtiest things in the known universe without killing the person at the same time interesting he wandered off dripping wet from the shower hall looked around for a towel but found none he entered the next room and blowers turned on from the ceiling in a rush of hot air from the sides of the room uv lights clicked on bathing the room in an intense purple light he stood there until a buzzer sounded and the dryers turned off his skin tingled slightly as he entered the last room which contained clothing they were not jumpsuits but rather like surgical uniforms lightyellow a loosefitting top with a vneck and short sleeves elastic banded pants low rubbersoled shoes quite comfortable like ballet slippers the cloth was soft some kind of synthetic he dressed and stepped with the others through a door marked exit to level ii he entered the elevator and waited as it descended hall emerged to find himself in a corridor the was here were painted yellow not red as they had been on level i the people wore yellow uniforms a nurse by the elevator said the time is pm gentlemen you may continue your descent in one hour they went to a small room marked interim confinement it contained a halfdozen couches with plastic disposable covers over them stone said better relax sleep if you can well need all the rest we can get before level v he walked over to hall how did you find the decontamination procedure interesting hall said you could sell it to the swedes and make a fortune but somehow i expected something more rigorous just wait stone said it gets tougher as you go physicals on levels iii and iv afterward there will be a brief conference then stone lay down on one of the couches and fell instantly asleep it was a trick he had learned years before when he had been conducting experiments around the clock he learned to squeeze in an hour here two hours there he found it useful the second decontamination procedure was similar to the first halls yellow clothing though he had worn it just an hour was incinerated isnt that rather wasteful he asked burton burton shrugged its paper paper that cloth burton shook his head not cloth paper new process they stepped into the first totalimmersion pool instructions on the wall told hall to keep his eyes open under water total immersion he soon discovered was guaranteed by the simple device of making the connection between the first room and the second an underwater passage swimming through he felt a slight burning of his eyes but nothing bad the second room contained a row of six boxes glasswalled looking rather like telephone booths hall approached one and saw a sign that said enter and close both eyes hold arms slightly away from body and stand with feet one foot apart do not open eyes until buzzer sounds blindness may result from exposure to longwave radiation he followed the directions and felt a kind of cold heat on his body it lasted perhaps five minutes and then he heard the buzzer and opened his eyes his body was dry he followed the others to a corridor consisting of four showers walking down the corridor he passed beneath each shower in turn at the end he found blowers which dried him and then clothing this time the clothing was white they dressed and took the elevator down to level iii there were four nurses waiting for them one took hall to an examining room it turned out to be a twohour physical examination given not by a machine but by a blankfaced thorough young man hall was annoyed and thought to himself that he preferred the machine the doctor did everything including a complete history birth education travel family history past hospitalizations and illnesses and an equally complete physical hall became angry it was all so damned unnecessary but the doctor shrugged and kept saying its routine after two hours he rejoined the others and proceeded to level iv four totalimmersion baths three sequences of ultraviolet and infrared light two of ultrasonic vibrations and then something quite astonishing at the end a steelwalled cubicle with a helmet on a peg the sign said this is an ultraflash apparatus to protect head and facial hair place metal helmet securely on head then press button below hall had never heard of ultraflash and he followed directions not knowing what to expect he placed the helmet over his head then pressed the button there was a single brief dazzling burst of white light followed by a wave of heat that filled the cubicle he felt a moment of pain so swift he hardly recognized it until it was over cautiously he removed the helmet and looked at his body his skin was covered with a fine white ash and then he realized that the ash was his skin or had been the machine had burned away the outer epithelial layers he proceeded to a shower and washed the ash off when he finally reached the dressing room he found green uniforms another physical this time they wanted samples of everything sputum oral epithelium blood urine stool he submitted passively to the tests examinations questions he was tired and was beginning to feel disoriented the repetitions the new experiences the colors on the walls the same bland artificial light finally he was brought back to stone and the others stone said we have six hours on this level thats protocol waiting while they do the lab tests on us so we might as well sleep down the corridor are rooms marked with your names further down is the cafeteria well meet there in five hours for a conference right hall found his room marked with a plastic door tag he entered surprised to find it quite large he had been expecting something the size of a pullman cubicle but this was bigger and betterfurnished there was a bed a chair a small desk and a computer console with builtin tv set he was curious about the computer but also very tired he lay down on the bed and fell asleep quickly burton could not sleep he lay in his bed on level iv and stared at the ceiling thinking he could not get the image of that town out of his mind or those bodies lying in the street without bleeding burton was not a hematologist but his work had involved some blood studies he knew that a variety of bacteria had effects on blood his own research with staphylococcus for example had shown that this organism produced two enzymes that altered blood one was the socalled exotoxin which destroyed skin and dissolved red cells another was a coagulase which coated the bacteria with protein to inhibit destruction by white cells so it was possible that bacteria could alter blood and it could do it many different ways strep produced an enzyme streptokinase that dissolved coagulated plasma clostridia and pneumococci produced a variety of hemolysins that destroyed red cells malaria and amebae also destroyed red cells by digesting them as food other parasites did the same thing so it was possible but it didnt help them in finding out how the scoop organism worked burton tried to recall the sequence for blood clotting he remembered that it operated like a kind of waterfall one enzyme was set off and activated which acted on a second enzyme which acted on a third the third on a fourth and so on down through twelve or thirteen steps until finally blood clotted and vaguely he remembered the rest the details all the intermediate steps the necessary enzymes the metals ions local factors it was horribly complex he shook his head and tried to sleep leavitt the clinical microbiologist was thinking through the steps in isolation and identification of the causative organism he had been over it before he was one of die original founders of the group one of the men who developed the life analysis protocol but now on the verge of putting that plan into effect he had doubts two years before sitting around after lunch talking speculatively it had all seemed wonderful it had been an amusing intellectual game then a kind of abstract test of wits but now faced with a real agent that caused real and bizarre death he wondered whether all their plans would prove to be so effective and so complete as they once thought the first steps were simple enough they would examine the capsule minutely and culture everything onto growth media they would be hoping like hell to come up with an organism that they could work with experiment on and identify and after that attempt to find out how it attacked there was already the suggestion that it killed by clotting the blood if that turned out to be the case they had a good start but if not they might waste valuable time following it up the example of cholera came to mind for centuries men had known that cholera was a fatal disease and that it caused severe diarrhea sometimes producing as much as thirty quarts of fluid a day men knew this but they somehow assumed that the lethal effects of the disease were unrelated to the diarrhea they searched for something else an antidote a drug a way to kill the organism it was not until modern times that cholera was recognized as a disease that killed through dehydration primarily if you could replace a victims water losses rapidly he would survive the infection without other drugs or treatment cure the symptoms cure the disease but leavitt wondered about the scoop organism could they cure the disease by treating the blood clotting or was the clotting secondary to some more serious disorder there was also another concern a nagging fear that had bothered him since the earliest planning stages of wildfire in those early meetings leavitt had argued that the wildfire team might be committing extraterrestrial murder leavitt had pointed out that all men no matter how scientifically objective had several builtin biases when discussing life one was the assumption that complex life was larger than simple life it was certainly true on the earth as organisms became more intelligent they grew larger passing from the singlecelled stage to multicellular creatures and then to larger animals with differentiated cells working in groups called organs on earth the trend had been toward larger and more complex animals but this might not be true elsewhere in the universe in other places life might progress in the opposite direction toward smaller and smaller forms just as modern human technology had learned to make things smaller perhaps highly advanced evolutionary pressures led to smaller life forms there were distinct advantages to smaller forms less consumption of raw materials cheaper spaceflight fewer feeding problems perhaps the most intelligent life form on a distant planet was no larger than a flea perhaps no larger than a bacterium in that case the wildfire project might be committed to destroying a highly developed life form without ever realizing what it was doing this concept was not unique to leavitt it had been proposed by merton at harvard and by chalmers at oxford chalmers a man with a keen sense of humor had used the example of a man looking down on a microscope slide and see in the bacteria formed into the words take us to your leader everyone thought chalmerss idea highly amusing yet leavitt could not get it out of his mind because it just might turn out to be true before he fell asleep stone thought about the conference coming up and the business of the meteorite he wondered what nagy would say or karp if they knew about the meteorite probably he thought it would drive them insane probably it will drive us all insane and then he slept delta sector was the designation of three rooms on level i that contained all communications facilities for the wildfire installation all intercom and visual circuits between levels were routed through there as were cables for telephone and teletype from the outside the trunk lines to the library and the central storage unit were also regulated by delta sector in essence it functioned as a giant switchboard fully computerized the three rooms of delta sector were quiet all that could be heard was the soft hum of spinning tape drums and the muted clicking of relays only one person worked here a single man sitting at a console surrounded by the blinking lights of the computer there was no real reason for the man to be there he performed no necessary function the computers were selfregulating constructed to run check patterns through their circuits every twelve minutes the computers shut down automatically if there was an abnormal reading according to protocol the man was required to monitor mcn communications which were signaled by the ringing of a bell on the teleprinter when the bell rang he notified the five level command centers that the transmission was received he was also required to report any computer dysfunction to level i command should that unlikely event occur day wildfire the conference time to wake up sir mark hall opened his eyes the room was lit with a steady pale fluorescent light he blinked and rolled over on his stomach time to wake up sir it was a beautiful female voice soft and seductive he sat up in bed and looked around the room he was alone hello time to wake up sir who are you time to wake up sir he reached over and pushed a button on the nightstand by his bed a light went off he waited for the voice again but it did not speak it was he thought a hell of an effective way to wake a man up as he slipped into his clothes he wondered how it worked it was not a simple tape because it worked as a response of some sort the message was repeated only when hall spoke to test his theory he pushed the nightstand button again the voice said softly do you wish something sir id like to know your name please will that be all sir yes i believe so will that be all sir he waited the light clicked off he slipped into his shoes and was about to leave when a male voice said this is the answeringservice supervisor dr hall i wish you would treat the project more seriously hall laughed so the voice responded to comments and taped his replies it was a clever system sorry he said i wasnt sure how the thing worked the voice is quite luscious the voice said the supervisor heavily belongs to miss gladys stevens who is sixtythree years old she lives in omaha and makes her living taping messages for sac crews and other voicereminder systems oh hall said he left the room and walked down the corridor to the cafeteria as he walked he began to understand why submarine designers had been called in to plan wildfire without his wristwatch he had no idea of the time or even whether it was night or day he found himself wondering whether the cafeteria would be crowded wondering whether it was dinner time or breakfast time as it turned out the cafeteria was almost deserted leavitt was there he said the others were in the conference room he pushed a glass of darkbrown liquid over to hall and suggested he have breakfast whats this hall said fortytwofive nutrient it has everything needed to sustain the average seventykilogram man for eighteen hours hall drank the liquid which was syrupy and artificially flavored to taste like orange juice it was a strange sensation drinking brown orange juice but not bad after the initial shock leavitt explained that it had been developed for the astronauts and that it contained everything except airsoluble vitamins for that you need this pill he said hall swallowed the pill then got himself a cup of coffee from a dispenser in the corner any sugar leavitt shook his head no sugar anywhere here nothing that might provide a bacterial growth medium from now on were all on highprotein diets well make all the sugar we need from the protein breakdown but we wont be getting any sugar into the gut quite the opposite he reached into his pocket oh no yes leavitt said he gave him a small capsule sealed in aluminum foil no hall said everyone else has them broadspectrum stop by your room and insert it before you go into the final decontamination procedures i dont mind dunking myself in all those foul baths hall said i dont mind being irradiated but ill be goddammed the idea leavitt said is that you be as nearly sterile as possible on level v we have sterilized your skin and mucous membranes of the respiratory tract as best we can but we havent done a thing about the gi tract yet yes hall said but suppositories youll get used to it were all taking them for the first four days not of course that theyll do any good he said with the familiar wry pessimistic look on his face he stood lets go to the conference room stone wants to talk about karp who rudolph karp rudolph karp was a hungarianborn biochemist who came to the united states from england in he obtained a position at the university of michigan and worked steadily and quietly for five years then at the suggestion of colleagues at the ann arbor observatory karp began to investigate meteorites with the intent of determining whether they harbored life or showed evidence of having done so in the past he took the proposal quite seriously and worked with diligence writing no papers on the subject until the early s when calvin and vaughn and nagy and others were writing explosive papers on similar subjects the arguments and counterarguments were complex but boiled down to a simple substrate whenever a worker would announce that he had found a fossil or a proteinaceous hydrocarbon or other indication of life within a meteorite the critics would claim sloppy lab technique and contamination with earthorigin matter and organisms karp with his careful slow techniques was determined to end the arguments once and for all he announced that he had taken great pains to avoid contamination each meteorite he examined had been washed in twelve solutions including peroxide iodine hypertonic saline and dilute acids it was then exposed to intense ultraviolet light for a period of two days finally it was submerged in a germicidal solution and placed in a germfree sterile isolation chamber further work was done within the chamber karp upon breaking open his meteorites was able to isolate bacteria he found that they were ringshaped organisms rather like a tiny undulating inner tube and he found they could grow and multiply he claimed that while they were essentially similar to earthly bacteria in structure being based upon proteins carbohydrates and lipids they had no cell nucleus and therefore their manner of propagation was a mystery karp presented his information in his usual quiet unsensational manner and hoped for a good reception he did not receive one instead he was laughed down by the seventh conference of astrophysics and geophysics meeting in london in he became discouraged and set his work with meteorites aside the organisms were later destroyed in an accidental laboratory explosion on the night of june karps experience was almost identical to that of nagy and the others scientists in the s were not willing to entertain notions of life existing in meteorites all evidence presented was discounted dismissed and ignored a handful of people in a dozen countries remained intrigued however one of them was jeremy stone another was peter leavitt it was leavitt who some years before had formulated the rule of the rule of was intended as a humorous reminder to scientists and referred to the massive literature collected in the late s and the s concerning the human chromosome number for years it was stated that men had fortyeight chromosomes in their cells there were pictures to prove it and any number of careful studies in a group of american researchers announced to the world that the human chromosome number was fortysix once more there were pictures to prove it and studies to confirm it but these researchers also went back to reexamine the old pictures and the old studies and found only fortysix chromosomes not fortyeight leavitts rule of said simply all scientists are blind and leavitt had invoked his rule when he saw the reception karp and others received leavitt went over the reports and the papers and found no reason to reject the meteorite studies out of hand many of the experiments were careful wellreasoned and compelling he remembered this when he and the other wildfire planners drew up the study known as the vector three along with the toxic five it formed one of the firm theoretical bases for wildfire the vector three was a report that considered a crucial question if a bacterium invaded the earth causing a new disease where would that bacterium come from after consultation with astronomers and evolutionary theories the wildfire group concluded that bacteria could come from three sources the first was the most obvious an organism from another planet or galaxy which had the protection to survive the extremes of temperature and vacuum that existed in space there was no doubt that organisms could survive there was for instance a class of bacteria known as thermophilic that thrived on extreme heat multiplying enthusiastically in temperatures as high as deg c further it was known that bacteria had been recovered from egyptian tombs where they had been sealed for thousands of years these bacteria were still viable the secret lay in the bacterias ability to form spores molding a hard calcific shell around themselves this shell enabled the organism to survive freezing or boiling and if necessary thousands of years without food it combined all the advantages of a space suit with those of suspended animation there was no doubt that a spore could travel through space but was another planet or galaxy the most likely source of contamination for the earth here the answer was no the most likely source was the closest source the earth itself the report suggested that bacteria could have left the surface of the earth eons ago when life was just beginning to emerge from the oceans and the hot baked continents such bacteria would depart before the fishes before the primitive mammals long before the first apeman the bacteria would head up into the air and slowly ascend until they were literally in space once there they might evolve into unusual forms perhaps even learning to derive energy for life directly from the sun instead of requiring food as an energy source these organisms might also be capable of direct conversion of energy to matter leavitt himself suggested the analogy of the upper atmosphere and the depths of the sea as equally inhospitable environments but equally viable in the deepest blackest regions of the oceans where oxygenation was poor and where light never reached life forms were known to exist in abundance why not also in the far reaches of the atmosphere true oxygen was scarce true food hardly existed but if creatures could live miles beneath the surface why could they not also live five miles above it and if there were organisms out there and if they had departed from the baking crust of the earth long before the first men appeared then they would be foreign to man no immunity no adaptation no antibodies would have been developed they would be primitive aliens to modern man in the same way that the shark a primitive fish unchanged for a hundred million years was alien and dangerous to modern man invading the oceans for the first time the third source of contamination the third of the vectors was at the same time the most likely and the most troublesome this was contemporary earth organisms taken into space by inadequately sterilized spacecraft once in space the organisms would be exposed to harsh radiation weightlessness and other environmental forces that might exert a mutagenic effect altering the organisms so that when they came down they would be different take up a harmless bacteria such as the organism that causes pimples or sore throats and bring it back in a new form virulent and unexpected it might do anything it might show a preference for the aqueous humor of the inner eye and invade the eyeball it might thrive on the acid secretions of the stomach it might multiply on the small currents of electricity afforded by the human brain itself drive men mad this whole idea of mutated bacteria seemed farfetched and unlikely to the wildfire people it is ironic that this should be the case particularly in view of what happened to the andromeda strain but the wildfire team staunchly ignored both the evidence of their own experience that bacteria mutate rapidly and radically and the evidence of the biosatellite tests in which a series of earth forms were sent into space and later recovered biosatellite ii contained among other things several species of bacteria it was later reported that the bacteria had reproduced at a rate twenty to thirty times normal the reasons were still unclear but the results unequivocal space could affect reproduction and growth and yet no one in wildfire paid attention to this fact until it was too late stone reviewed the information quickly then handed each of them a cardboard file these files he said contain a transcript of autoclock records of the entire flight of scoop vii our purpose in reviewing the transcript is to determine if possible what happened to the satellite while it was in orbit hall said something happened to it leavitt explained the satellite was scheduled for a sixday orbit since the probability of collecting organisms is proportional to time in orbit after launch it was in stable orbit then on the second day it went out of orbit hall nodded start stone said with the first page hall opened his file autoclock transcript project scoop vii launchdate

radio reentry reentry code transmitted houston reports initiation of reentry stabilized flight path what about voice communication during the critical period there were linkups between sydney kennedy and grand bahama all routed through houston houston had the big computer as well but in this instance houston was just helping out all decisions came from scoop mission control in vandenberg we have the voice communication at the back of the file its quite revealing transcript of voice communications scoop mission control vandenberg afb hours to this is a classified transcript it has not been abridged or edited hours min sec communication hello kennedy this is scoop mission control at the end of hours of flight time we have stable orbits from all stations do you confirm think we do scoop our check is going through now hold this line open for a few minutes fellows hello scoop mc this is kennedy we have a stable orbit confirmation for you on the last passby sorry about the delay but there is an instrument snag somewhere here kennedy please clarify is your snag on the ground or aloft i am sorry we have no tracer yet we think it is on the ground hello scoop mc this is kennedy we have a preliminary report of system malfunction aboard your spacecraft repeat we have a preliminary report of malfunction in the air awaiting confirmation kennedy please clarify system involved im sorry they havent given me that i assume they are waiting for final confirmation of the malfunction does your orbital check as stable stillhold vandenberg we have confirmed your orbital check as stable repeat the orbit is stable ah vandenberg i am afraid we also confirm readings consistent with system malfunction on board your spacecraft these include the stationary rotor elements and spanner units going to mark twelve i repeat mark twelve have you run consistency check on your computers sorry fellows but our computers check out we read it as a real malfunction hello houston open the line to sydney will you we want confirmation of data scoop mission control this is sydney station we confirm our last reading there was nothing wrong with the spacecraft on its last passby here our computer check indicates no systems malfunction and good orbital stability on summated data we question kennedy ground instrument failure this is kennedy scoop mc we have run repeat checkouts at this end our reading of system malfunction remains have you got something from bahama negative kennedy standing by houston this is scoop mc can your projection group give us anything scoop at this time we cannot our computers have insufficient data they still read stable orbit with all systems going scoop mc this is grand bahama station we report passby of your craft scoop seven according to schedule preliminary radar fixes were normal with question of increased transit times please hold for systems telemetry holding grand bahama scoop mc we are sorry to say we confirm kennedy observations repeat we confirm kennedy observations of systems malfunction our data are on the trunk to houston can they be routed to you as well station no we will wait for houstons printout they have larger predictive banking units scoop mc houston has the bahama data it is going through the dispar program give us ten seconds scoop mc this is houston the dispar program confirms systems malfunction your vehicle is now in unstable orbit with increased transit time of zero point three seconds per unit of arc we are analyzing orbital parameters at this time is there anything further you wish as interpreted data no houston sounds like youre doing beautifully sorry scoop bad break get us the decay ratios as soon as possible command wishes to make a decision on instrumentation takedown within the next two orbits understand scoop our condolences here scoop houston projection group has confirmed orbital instability and decay ratios are now being passed by the data trunk to your station how do they look houston bad not understood please repeat bad b as in broken a as in awful d as in dropping houston do you have a causation that satellite has been in excellent orbit for nearly one hundred hours what happened to it beats us we wonder about collision there is a good wobble component to the new orbit houston our computers are working through the transmitted data we agree a collision have you guys got something in the neighborhood air force skywatch confirms our report that we have nothing around your baby scoop houston our computers are reading this as a random event probabilities greater than zero point seven nine we can add nothing looks reasonable are you going to bring it down we are holding on that decision houston we will notify as soon as it is made houston our command group has raised the question of whether reply from houston deleted scoop query to houston deleted reply from houston deleted agree houston we will make our decision as soon as we have final confirmation of orbital shutdown from sydney is this acceptable perfectly scoop we are standing by houston we are reworking our data and no longer consider thatis likely roger scoop houston we are standing by for sydney scoop mission control this is sydney station we have just followed the passby of your vehicle our initial readings confirm a prolonged transit time it is quite striking at this time thank you sydney bit of nasty luck scoop sorry this is scoop mission control to all stations our computers have just calculated the orbital decay for the vehicle and we find it to be coming down as a plus four standby for the final decision as to when we will bring it down hall said what about the deleted passages major manchek at vandenberg told me stone said that they had to do with the russian craft in the area the two stations eventually concluded that the russians had not either accidentally or purposely brought down the scoop satellite no one has since suggested differently they nodded its tempting stone said the air force maintains a watchdog facility in kentucky that tracks all satellites in earth orbit it has a dual function both to follow old satellites known to be in orbit and to track new ones there are twelve satellites in orbit at this time that cannot be accounted for in other words they are not ours and are not the result of announced soviet launches it is thought that some of these represent navigation satellites for soviet submarines others are presumed to be spy satellites but the important thing is that russian or not there are a hell of a lot of satellites up there as of last friday the air force reported five hundred and eightyseven orbiting bodies around the earth this includes some old nonfunctioning satellites from the american explorer series and the russian sputnik series it also includes boosters and final stages anything in stable orbit large enough to reflect back a radar beam thats a lot of satellites yes and there are probably many more the air force thinks there is a lot of junk out there nuts bolts scraps of metal all in more or less stable orbit no orbit as you know is completely stable without frequent corrections any satellite will eventually decay out and spiral down to earth burning up in the atmosphere but that may be years even decades after the launch in any event the air force estimates that the total number of individual orbiting objects could be anything up to seventyfive thousand so a collision with a piece of junk is possible yes possible how about a meteor that is the other possibility and the one vandenberg favors a random event most likely a meteor any showers these days none apparently but that does not rule out a meteor collision leavitt cleared his throat there is still another possibility stone frowned he knew that leavitt was imaginative and that this trait was both a strength and a defect at times leavitt could be startling and exciting at others merely irritating its rather farfetched stone said to postulate debris from some extragalactic source other than i agree leavitt said hopelessly farfetched no evidence for it whatever but i dont think we can afford to ignore the possibility a gong sounded softly a lush female voice which hall now recognized as that of gladys stevens of omaha said softly you may proceed to the next level gentlemen level v level v was painted a quiet shade of blue and they all wore blue uniforms burton showed hall around this floor he said is like all the others its circular arranged in a series of concentric circles actually were on the outer perimeter now this is where we live and work cafeteria sleeping rooms everything is out here just inside is a ring of laboratories and inside that sealed off from us is the central core thats where the satellite and the two people are now but theyre sealed off from us yes then how do we get to them have you ever used a glove box burton asked hall shook his head burton explained that glove boxes were large clear plastic boxes used to handle sterile materials the boxes had holes cut in the sides and gloves attached with an airtight seal to handle the contents you slipped your hands into the gloves and reached into the box but your fingers never touched the material only the gloves weve gone one step further burton said we have whole rooms that are nothing more than glorified glove boxes instead of a glove for your hand theres a whole plastic suit for your entire body youll see what i mean they walked down the curved corridor to a room marked central control leavitt and stone were there working quietly central control was a cramped room stuffed with electronic equipment one wall was glass allowing the tails were considered particularly trying many a scientist workers to look into the adjacent room through the glass hall saw mechanical hands moving the capsule to a table and setting it down hall who had never seen a capsule before watched with interest it was smaller than he had imagined no more than a yard long one end was seared and blackened from the heat of reentry the mechanical hands under stones direction opened the little scoopshaped trough in the side of the capsule to expose the interior there stone said taking his hands from the controls the controls looked like a pair of brass knuckles the operator slipped his own hands into them and moved his hands as he wanted the mechanical hands to move our next step he said is to determine whether there is still anything in the capsule which is biologically active suggestions a rat leavitt said use a black norway the black norway rat was not black at all the name simply designated a strain of laboratory animal perhaps the most famous strain in all science once of course it had been both black and norwegian but years of breeding and countless generations had made it white small and docile the biological explosion had created a demand for genetically uniform animals in the last thirty years more than a thousand strains of pure animals had been evolved artificially in the case of the black norwegian it was now possible for a scientist anywhere in the world to conduct experiments using this animal and be assured that other scientists elsewhere could repeat or enlarge upon his work using virtually identical organisms follow with a rhesus burton said we will want to get onto primates sooner or later the others nodded wildfire was prepared to conduct experiments with monkeys and apes as well as smaller cheaper animals a monkey was exceedingly difficult to work with the little primates were hostile quick intelligent among scientists the new world monkeys with their prehensile tails were considered particularly trying many scientists had engaged three or four lab assistants to hold down a monkey while he administered an injection only to have the prehensile tail whip up grasp the syringe and fling it across the room the theory behind primate experimentation was that these animals were closer biologically to man in the s several laboratories even attempted experiments on gorillas going to great trouble and expense to work with these seemingly most human of animals however by it had been demonstrated that of the apes the chimpanzee was biochemically more like man than the gorilla on the basis of similarity to man the choice of laboratory animals is often surprising for example the hamster is preferred for immunological and cancer studies since his responses are so similar to mans while for studies of the heart and circulation the pig is considered most like man stone put his hands back on the controls moving them gently through the glass they saw the black metal fingers move to the far wall of the adjoining room where several caged lab animals were kept separated from the room by hinged airtight doors the wall reminded hall oddly of an automat the mechanical hands opened one door and removed a rat in its cage brought it into the room and set it down next to the capsule the rat looked around the room sniffed the air and made some stretching movements with its neck a moment later it flopped over onto its side kicked once and was still it had happened with astonishing speed hall could hardly believe it had happened at all my god stone said what a time course that will make it difficult leavitt said burton said we can try tracers yes well have to use tracers on it stone said how fast are our scans milliseconds if necessary it will be necessary try the rhesus burton said youll want a post on it anyway stone directed the mechanical hands back to the wall opening another door and withdrawing a cage containing a large brown adult rhesus monkey the monkey screeched as it was lifted and banged against the bars of its cage then it died after flinging one hand to its chest with a look of startled surprise stone shook his head well at least we know its still biologically active whatever killed everyone in piedmont is still there and still as potent as ever he sighed if potent is the word leavitt said wed better start a scan of the capsule ill take these dead animals burton said and run the initial vector studies then ill autopsy them stone worked the mechanical hands once more he picked up the cages that held the rat and monkey and set them on a rubber conveyor belt at the rear of the room then he pressed a button on a control console marked autopsy the conveyor belt began to move burton left the room walking down the corridor to the autopsy room knowing that the conveyor belt made to carry materials from one lab to another would have automatically delivered the cages stone said to hall youre the practicing physician among us im afraid youve got a rather tough job right now pediatrician and geriatrist exactly see what you can do about them theyre both in our miscellaneous room the room we built precisely for unusual circumstances like this theres a computer linkup there that should help you the technician will show you how it works miscellaneous hall opened the door marked miscellaneous thinking to himself that his job was indeed miscellaneous keeping alive an old man and a tiny infant both of them vital to the project and both of them no doubt difficult to manage he found himself in another small room similar to the control room he had just left this one also had a glass window looking inward to a central room in the room were two beds and on the beds peter jackson and the infant but the incredible thing was the suits standing upright in the room were four clear plastic inflated suits in the shape of men from each suit a tunnel ran back to the wall obviously one would have to crawl down the tunnel and then stand up inside the suit then one could work with the patients inside the room the girl who was to be his assistant was working in the room bent over the computer console she introduced herself as karen anson and explained the working of the computer this is just one substation of the wildfire computer on the first level she said there are thirty substations throughout the laboratory all plugging into the computer thirty different people can work at once hall nodded timesharing was a concept he understood he knew that as many as two hundred people had been able to use the same computer at once the principle was that computers operated very swiftly in fractions of a second while people operated slowly in seconds or minutes one person using a computer was inefficient because it took several minutes to punch in instructions while the computer sat around idle waiting once instructions were fed in the computer answered almost instantaneously this meant that a computer was rarely working and by permitting a number of people to ask questions of the computer simultaneously you could keep the machine more continuously in operation if the computer is really backed up the technician said there may be a delay of one or two seconds before you get your answer but usually its immediate what we are using here is the medcom program do you know it hall shook his head its a medicaldata analyzer she said you feed in information and it will diagnose the patient and tell you what to do next for therapy or to confirm the diagnosis sounds very convenient its fast she said all our lab studies are done by automated machines so we can have complex diagnoses in a matter of minutes hall looked through the glass at the two patients whats been done on them so far nothing at level i they were started on intravenous infusions plasma for peter jackson dextrose and water for the baby they both seem well hydrated now and in no distress jackson is still unconscious he has no pupillary signs but is unresponsive and looks anemic hall nodded the labs here can do everything everything even assays for adrenal hormones and things like partial thromboplastin times every known medical test is possible all right wed better get started she turned on the computer this is how you order laboratory tests she said use this light pen here and check off the tests you want just touch the pen to the screen she handed him a small penlight and pushed the start button the screen glowed medcom

mbc steriod aldo loh ks acth vits a all b c e k urine sp gr ph prot gluc ketone all electrolytes all steriods all inorganics catechols porphyrins urobil hiaa hall stared at the list he touched the tests he wanted with the penlight they disappeared from the screen he ordered fifteen or twenty then stepped back the screen went blank for a moment and then the following appeared tests ordered will require for each subject cc whole blood lo cc oxalated blood l cc citrated blood cc urine the technician said ill draw the bloods if you want to do physicals have you been in one of these rooms before hall shook his head its quite simple really we crawl through the tunnels into the suits the tunnel is then sealed off behind us oh why in case something happens to one of us in case the covering of the suit is broken the integrity of the surface is ruptured as the protocol says in that case bacteria could spread back through the tunnel to the outside so were sealed off yes we get air from a separate system you can see the thin lines coming in over there but essentially youre isolated from everything when youre in that suit i dont think you need worry though the only way you might possibly break your suit is to cut it with a scalpel and the gloves are triplethickness to prevent just such an occurrence she showed him how to crawl through and then imitating her he stood up inside the plastic suit he felt like some kind of giant reptile moving cumbersomely about dragging his tunnel like a thick tail behind him after a moment there was a hiss his suit was being sealed off then another hiss and the air turned cold as the special line began to feed air in to him the technician gave him his examining instruments while she drew blood from the child taking it from a scalp vein hall turned his attention to peter jackson an old man and pale anemia also thin first thought cancer second thought tuberculosis alcoholism some other chronic process and unconscious he ran through the differential in his mind from epilepsy to hypoglycernic shock to stroke hall later stated that he felt foolish when the computer provided him with a differential complete with probabilities of diagnosis he was not at that time aware of the skill of the computer the quality of its program he checked jacksons blood pressure it was low pulse fast at temperature respirations and deep he went over the body systematically beginning with the head and working down when he produced pain by pressing on the nerve through the supraorbital notch just below the eyebrow the man grimaced and moved his arms to push hall away perhaps he was not unconscious after all perhaps just stuporous hall shook him mr jackson mr jackson the man made no response and then slowly he seemed to revive hall shouted his name in his ear and shook him hard peter jackson opened his eyes just for a moment and said goaway hall continued to shake him but jackson relaxed going limp his body slipping back to its unresponsive state hall gave up returning to his physical examination the lungs were clear and the heart seemed normal there was sm tenseness of the abdomen and jackson retched once bringing up some bloody drooling material quickly hall did a basolyte test for blood it was positive he did a rectal exam and tested the stool it was also positive for blood he turned to the technician who had drawn all the bloods and was feeding the tubes into the computer analysis apparatus in one corner weve got a gi bleeder here he said how soon will the results be back she pointed to a tv screen mounted near the ceiling the lab reports are flashed back as soon as they come in they are displayed there and on the console in the other room the easy ones come back first we should have hematocrit in two minutes hall waited the screen glowed the letters printing out jackson peter laboratory analyses test normal value hematocrit half normal hall said he slapped an oxygen mask on jacksons face fixed the straps and said well need at least four units plus two of plasma ill order them to start as soon as possible she went to phone the blood bank on level ii and asked them to hurry on the requisition meantime hall turned his attention to the child it had been a long time since he had examined an infant and he had forgotten how difficult it could be every time he tried to look at the eyes the child shut them tightly every time he looked down the throat the child closed his mouth every time he tried to listen to the heart the child shrieked obscuring all heart sounds yet he persisted remembering what stone had said these two people dissimilar though they were nonetheless represented the only survivors of piedmont somehow they had managed to beat the disease that was a link between the two between the shriveled old man vomiting blood and the pink young child howling and screaming at first glance they were as different as possible they were at opposite ends of the spectrum sharing nothing in common and yet there must be something in common it took hall half an hour to finish his examination of the child at the end of that time he was forced to conclude that the infant was to his exam perfectly normal totally normal nothing the least bit unusual about him except that somehow he had survived main control stone sat with leavitt in the main control room looking into the inner room with the capsule though cramped main control was complex and expensive it had cost the most costly single room in the wildfire installation but it was vital to the functioning of the entire laboratory main control served as the first step in scientific examination of the capsule its chief function was detectionthe room was geared to detect and isolate microorganisms according to the life analysis protocol there were three main steps in the wildfire program detection characterization and control first the organism had to be found then it had to be studied and understood only then could ways be sought to control it main control was set up to find the organism leavitt and stone sat side by side in front of the banks of controls and dials stone operated the mechanical hands while leavitt manipulated the microscopic apparatus naturally it was impossible to enter the room with the capsule and examine it directly robotcontrolled microscopes with viewing screens in the control room would accomplish this for them an early question had been whether to utilize television or some kind of direct visual linkup television was cheaper and more easily set up tv imageintensifiers were already in use for electron microscopes xray machines and other devices however the wildfire group finally decided that a tv screen was too imprecise for their needs even a doublescan camera which transmitted twice as many lines as the usual tv and gave better image resolution would be insufficient in the end the group chose a fiber optics system in which a light image was transmitted directly through a snakelike bundle of glass fibers and then displayed on the viewers this gave a clear sharp image stone positioned the capsule and pressed the appropriate controls a black box moved down from the ceiling and began to scan the capsule surface the two men watched the viewer screens start with five power stone said leavitt set the controls they watched as the viewer automatically moved around the capsule focusing on the surface of the metal they watched one complete scan then shifted up to twentypower magnification a twentypower scan took much longer since the field of view was smaller they still saw nothing on the surface no punctures no indentations nothing that looked like a small growth of any kind lets go to one hundred stone said leavitt adjusted the controls and sat back they were beginning what they knew would be a long and tedious search probably they would find nothing soon they would examine the interior of the capsule they might find something there or they might not in either case they would take samples for analysis plating out the scrapings and swabs onto growth media leavitt glanced from the viewing screens to look into the room the viewer suspended from the ceiling by a complex arrangement of rods and wires was automatically moving in slow circles around the capsule he looked back to the screens there were three screens in main control and all showed exactly the same field of view in theory they could use three viewers projecting onto three screens and cover the capsule in one third the time but they did not want to do that at least not now both men knew that their interest and attention would fatigue as the day wore on no matter how hard they tried they could not remain alert all the time but if two men watched the same image there was less chance of missing something the surface area of the coneshaped capsule thirtyseven inches long and a foot in diameter at the base was just over square inches three scans at five twenty and one hundred power took them slightly more than two hours at the end of the third scan stone said i suppose we ought to proceed with the scan as well but i am tempted to go directly to a scan of the interior if we find nothing we can come back outside and do a i agree all right stone said start with five on the inside leavitt worked the controls this time it could not be done automatically the viewer was programmed to follow the contours of any regularly shaped object such as a cube a sphere or a cone but it could not probe the interior of the capsule without direction leavitt set the lenses at five diameters and switched the remote viewer to manual control then he directed it down into the scoop opening of the capsule stone watching the screen said more light leavitt made adjustments five additional remote lights came down from the ceiling and clicked on shining into the scoop better fine watching his own screen leavitt began to move the remote viewer it took several minutes before he could do it smoothly it was difficult to coordinate rather like trying to write while you watched in a mirror but soon he was scanning smoothly the fivepower scan took twenty minutes they found nothing except a small indentation the size of a pencil point at stones suggestion when they began the twentypower scan they started with the indentation immediately they saw it a tiny black fleck of jagged material no larger than a grain of sand there seemed to be bits of green mixed in with the black neither man reacted though leavitt later recalled that he was trembling with excitement i kept thinking if this is it if its really something new some brand new form of life however all he said was interesting wed better complete the scan at twenty power stone said he was working to keep his voice calm but it was clear that he was excited too leavitt wanted to examine the fleck at higher power immediately but he understood what stone was saying they could not afford to jump to conclusions any conclusions their only hope was to be grindingly interminably thorough they had to proceed methodically to assure themselves at every point that they had overlooked nothing otherwise they could pursue a course of investigation for hours or days only to find it ended nowhere that they had made a mistake misjudged the evidence and wasted time so leavitt did a complete scan of the interior at twenty power he paused once or twice when they thought they saw other patches of green and marked down the coordinates so they could find the areas later under higher magnification half an hour passed before stone announced he was satisfied with the twentypower scan they took a break for caffeine swallowing two pills with water the team had agreed earlier that amphetamines should not be used except in times of serious emergency they were stocked in the level v pharmacy but for routine purposes caffeine was preferred the aftertaste of the caffeine pill was sour in his mouth as leavitt clicked in the hundredpower lenses and began the third scan as before they started with the indentation and the small black fleck they had noted earlier it was disappointing at higher magnification it appeared no different from their earlier views only larger they could see however that it was an irregular piece of material dull looking like rock and they could see there were definitely flecks of green mined on the jagged surface of the material what do you make of it stone said if thats the object the capsule collided with leavitt said it was either moving with great speed or else it is very heavy because its not big enough to knock the satellite out of orbit otherwise i agree and yet it did not make a very deep indentation suggesting stone shrugged suggesting that it was either not responsible for the orbital change or that it has some elastic properties we dont yet know about what do you think of the green stone grinned you wont trap me yet i am curious nothing more leavitt chuckled and continued the scan both men now felt elated and inwardly certain of their discovery they checked the other areas where they had noted green and confirmed the presence of the patches at higher magnification but the other patches looked different from the green on the rock for one thing they were larger and seemed somehow more luminous for another the borders of the patches seemed quite regular and rounded like small drops of green paint spattered on the inside of the capsule stone said i hope thats not what it is we could probe stone said lets wait for stone agreed by now they had been scanning the capsule for nearly four hours but neither man felt tired they watched closely as the viewing screens blurred for a moment the lenses shifting when the screens came back into focus they were looking at the indentation and the black fleck with the green areas at this magnification the surface irregularities of the rock were striking it was like a miniature planet with jagged peaks and sharp valleys it occurred to leavitt that this was exactly what they were looking at a minute complete planet with its life forms intact but he shook his head dismissing the thought from his mind impossible stone said if thats a meteor its damned funnylooking what bothers you that left border over there stone pointed to the screen the surface of the stone if it is stone is rough everywhere except on that left border where it is smooth and rather straight like an artificial surface stone sighed if i keep looking at it he said i might start to think so lets see those other patches of green leavitt set the coordinates and focused the viewer a new image appeared on the screens this time it was a closeup of one of the green patches under high magnification the borders could be seen clearly they were not smooth but slightly notched they looked almost like a gear from the inside of a watch ill be damned leavitt said its not paint that notching is too regular as they watched it happened the green spot turned purple for a fraction of a second less than the blink of an eye then it turned green once more did you see that i saw it you didnt change the lighting no didnt touch it a moment later it happened again green a flash of purple green again amazing this may be and then as they watched the spot turned purple and remained purple the notches disappeared the spot had enlarged slightly filling in the vshaped gaps it was now a complete circle it became green once more its growing stone said they worked swiftly the movie cameras were brought down recording from five angles at ninetysix frames per second another timelapse camera clicked off frames at halfsecond intervals leavitt also brought down two more remote cameras and set them at different angles from the original camera in main control all three screens displayed different views of the green spot can we get more power more magnification stone said no you remember we decided was the top stone swore to obtain higher magnification they would have to go to a separate room or else use the electron microscopes in either case it would take time leavitt said shall we start culture and isolation yes might as well leavitt turned the viewers back down to twenty power they could now see that there were four areas of interest three isolated green patches and the rock with its indentation on the control console he pressed a button marked culture and a tray t the side of the room slid out revealing stacks of circular plasticcovered petri dishes inside each dish was a thin layer of growth medium the wildfire project employed almost every known growth medium the media were jellied compounds containing various nutrients on which bacteria would feed and multiply along with the usual laboratory standbys horse and sheep blood agar chocolate agar simplex sabourads medium there were thirty diagnostic media containing various sugars and minerals then there were fortythree specialized culture media including those for growth of tubercule bacilli and unusual fungi as well as the highly experimental media designated by numbers me me mea and so on with the tray of media was a batch of sterile swabs using the mechanical hands stone picked up the swabs singly and touched them to the capsule surface then to the media leavitt punched data into the computer so that they would know later where each swab had been taken in this manner they swabbed the outer surface of the entire capsule and went to the interior very carefully using high viewer magnification stone took scrapings from the green spots and transferred them to the different media finally he used fine forceps to pick up the rock and move it intact to a clean glass dish the whole process took better than two hours at the end of that time leavitt punched through the maxcult computer program this program automatically instructed the machine in the handling of the hundreds of petri dishes they had collected some would be stored at room temperature and pressure with normal earth atmosphere others would be subjected to heat and cold high pressure and vacuum low oxygen and high oxygen light and dark assigning the plates to the various culture boxes was a job that would take a man days to work out the computer could do it in seconds when the program was running stone placed the stacks of petri dishes on the conveyor belt they watched as the dishes moved off to the culture boxes there was nothing further they could do except wait twentyfour to fortyeight hours to see what grew out meantime stone said we can begin analysis of this piece of rock if it actually is rock how are you with an em rusty leavitt said he had not used an electron microscope for nearly a year then ill prepare the specimen well also want mass spectrometry done thats all computerized but before we do that we ought to go to higher power whats the highest light magnification we can get in morphology a thousand diameters then lets do that first punch the rock through to morphology leavitt looked down at the console and pressed morphology stones mechanical hands placed the glass dish with the rock onto the conveyor belt they looked at the wall clock behind them it showed hours they had been working for eleven straight hours so far stone said so good leavitt grinned and crossed his fingers autopsy burton was working in the autopsy room he was nervous and tense still bothered by his memories of piedmont weeks later in reviewing his work and his thoughts on level v he regretted his inability to concentrate because in his initial series of experiments burton made several mistakes according to the protocol he was required to carry out autopsies on dead animals but he was also in charge of preliminary vector experiments in all fairness burton was not the man to do this work leavitt would have been better suited to it but it was felt that leavitt was more useful working on preliminary isolation and identification so the vector experiments fell to burton they were reasonably simple and straightforward designed to answer the question of how the disease was transmitted burton began with a series of cages lined up in a row each had a separate air supply the air supplies could be interconnected in a variety of ways burton placed the corpse of the dead norway rat which was contained in an airtight cage alongside another cage containing a living rat he punched buttons air was allowed to pass freely from one cage to the other the living rat flopped over and died interesting he thought airborne transmission he hooked up a second cage with a live rat but inserted a millipore filter between the living and dead rat cages this filter had perforations angstroms in diameter the size of a small virus he opened the passage between the two cages the rat remained alive he watched for several moments until he was satisfied whatever it was that transmitted the disease it was larger than a virus he changed the filter replacing it with a larger one and then another still larger he continued in this way until the rat died the filter had allowed the agent to pass he checked it two microns in diameter roughly the size of a small cell he thought to himself that he had just learned something very valuable indeed the size of the infectious agent this was important for in a single simple experiment he had ruled out the possibility that a protein or a chemical molecule of some kind was doing the damage at piedmont he and stone had been concerned about a gas perhaps a gas released as waste from the living organism yet clearly no gas was responsible the disease was transmitted by something the size of a cell that was very much bigger than a molecule or gas droplet the next step was equally simple to determine whether dead animals were potentially infectious he took one of the dead rats and pumped the air out of its cage he waited until the air was fully evacuated in the pressure fall the rat ruptured bursting open burton ignored this when he was sure all air was removed he replaced the air with fresh clean filtered air then he connected the cage to the cage of a living animal nothing happened interesting he thought using a remotely controlled scalpel he sliced open the dead animal further to make sure any organisms contained inside the carcass would be released into the atmosphere nothing happened the live rat scampered about its cage happily the results were quite clear dead animals were not infectious that was why he thought the buzzards could chew at the piedmont victims and not die corpses could not transmit the disease only the bugs themselves carried in the air could do so bugs in the air were deadly bugs in the corpse were harmless in a sense this was predictable it had to do with theories of accommodation and mutual adaptation between bacteria and man burton had long been interested in this problem and had lectured on it at the baylor medical school most people when they thought of bacteria thought of diseases yet the fact was that only percent of them produced human disease the rest were either harmless or beneficial in the human gut for instance there were a variety of bacteria that were helpful to the digestive process man needed them and relied upon them in fact man lived in a sea of bacteria they were everywhere on his skin in his ears and mouth down his lungs in his stomach everything he owned anything he touched every breath he breathed was drenched in bacteria bacteria were ubiquitous most of the time you werent aware of it and there was a reason both man and bacteria had gotten used to each other had developed a kind of mutual immunity each adapted to the other and this in turn for a very good reason it was a principle of biology that evolution was directed toward increased reproductive potential a man easily killed by bacteria was poorly adapted he didnt live long enough to reproduce a bacteria that killed its host was also poorly adapted because any parasite that kills its host is a failure it must die when the host dies the successful parasites were those that could live off the host without killing him and the most successful hosts were those that could tolerate the parasite or even turn it to advantage to make it work for the host the best adapted bacteria burton used to say are the ones that cause minor diseases or none at all you may carry the same single cell of strep viridians on your body for sixty or seventy years during that time you are growing and reproducing happily so is the strep you can carry staph aureus around and pay only the price of some acne and pimples you can carry tuberculosis for many decades you can carry syphilis for a lifetime these last are not minor diseases but they are much less severe than they once were because both man and organism have adapted it was known for instance that syphilis had been a virulent disease four hundred years before producing huge festering sores all over the body often killing in weeks but over the centuries man and the spirochete had learned to tolerate each other such considerations were not so abstract and academic as they seemed at first in the early planning of wildfire stone had observed that per cent of all human disease was caused by microorganisms burton had countered by noting that only per cent of all microorganisms caused disease obviously while much human misery was attributable to bacteria the chances of any particular bacteria being dangerous to man were very small this was because the process of adaptation of fitting man to bacteria was complex most bacteria burton observed simply cant live within a man long enough to harm him conditions are one way or another unfavorable the body is too hot or too cold too acid or too alkaline there is too much oxygen or not enough mans body is as hostile as antarctica to most bacteria this meant that the chances of an organism from outer space being suited to harm man were very slim everyone recognized this but felt that wildfire had to be constructed in any event burton certainly agreed but felt in an odd way that his prophecy had come true clearly the bug they had found could kill men but it was not really adapted to men because it killed and died within the organism it could not be transmitted from corpse to corpse it existed for a second or two in its host and then died with it satisfying intellectually he thought but practically speaking they still had to isolate it understand it and find a cure burton already knew something about transmission and something about the mechanism of death clotting of the blood the question remained how did the organisms get into the body because transmission appeared to be airborne contact with skin and lungs seemed likely possibly the organisms burrowed right through the skin surface or they might be inhaled or both how to determine it he considered putting protective suitings around an experimental animal to cover all but the mouth that was possible but it would take a long time he sat and worried about the problem for an hour then he hit upon a more likely approach he knew that the organism killed by clotting blood very likely it would initiate clotting at the point of entrance into the body if skin clotting would start near the surface if lungs it would begin in the chest radiating outward this was something he could test by using radioactively tagged blood proteins and then following his animals with scintillometer scans he could determine where in the body the blood first clotted he prepared a suitable animal choosing a rhesus monkey because its anatomy was more human than a rats he infused the radioactive tagging substance a magnesium isotope into the monkey and calibrated the scanner after allowing equilibration he tied the monkey down and positioned the scanner overhead he was now ready to begin the scanner would print out its results on a series of human block outlines he set the computer printing program and then exposed the rhesus to air containing the lethal microorganism immediately the printout began to clatter out from the computer graphic of disease spread in human body it was all over in three seconds the graphic printout told him what he needed to know that clotting began in the lungs and spread outward through the rest of the body but there was an additional piece of information gained burton later said i had been concerned that perhaps death and clotting did not coincide or at least did not coincide exactly it seemed impossible to me that death could occur in three seconds but it seemed even more unlikely that the total blood volume of the bodyfive quartscould solidify in so short a period i was curious to know whether a single crucial clot might form in the brain perhaps and the rest of the body clot at a slower pace burton was thinking of the brain even at this early stage of his investigation in retrospect it is frustrating that he did not follow this line of inquiry to its logical conclusion he was prevented from doing this by the evidence of the scans which told him that clotting began in the lungs and progressed up the carotid arteries to the brain one or two seconds later so burton lost immediate interest in the brain and his mistake was compounded by his next experiment it was a simple test not part of the regular wildfire protocol burton knew that death coincided with blood clotting if clotting could be prevented could death be avoided he took several rats and injected them with heparin an anticoagulating drug preventing bloodclot formation heparin was a rapidacting drug widely used in medicine its actions were thoroughly understood burton injected the drug intravenously in varying amounts ranging from a lownormal dose to a massively excessive dose then he exposed the rats to air containing the lethal organism the first rat with a low dose died in five seconds the others followed within a minute a single rat with a massive dose lived nearly three minutes but he also succumbed in the end burton was depressed by the results although death was delayed it was not prevented the method of symptomatic treatment did not work he put the dead rats to one side and then made his crucial mistake burton did not autopsy the anticoagulated rats instead he turned his attention to the original autopsy specimens the first black norway rat and the first rhesus monkey to be exposed to the capsule he performed a complete autopsy on these animals but discarded the anticoagulated animals it would be fortyeight hours before he realized his error the autopsies he performed were careful and good he did them slowly reminding himself that he must overlook nothing he removed the internal organs from the rat and monkey and examined each removing samples for both the light and electron microscopes to gross inspection the animals had died of total intravascular coagulation the arteries the heart lungs kidneys liver and spleen all the bloodcontaining organs were rockhard solid this was what he had expected he carried his tissue slices across the room to prepare frozen sections for microscopic examination as each section was completed by his technician he slipped it under the microscope examined it and photographed it the tissues were normal except for the clotted blood there was nothing unusual about them at all he knew that these same pieces of tissue would now be sent to the microscopy lab where another technician would prepare stained sections using hematoxylineosin periodic acidschiff and zenkerformalin stains sections of nerve would be stained with nissl and cajal gold preparations this process would take an additional twelve to fifteen hours he could hope of course that the stained sections would reveal something more but he had no reason to believe they would similarly he was unenthusiastic about the prospects for electron microscopy the electron microscope was a valuable tool but occasionally it made things more difficult not easier the electron microscope could provide great magnification and clear detailbut only if you knew where to look it was excellent for examining a single cell or part of a cell but first you had to know which cell to examine and there were billions of cells in a human body at the end of ten hours of work he sat back to consider what he had learned he drew up a short list the lethal agent is approximately micron in size therefore it is not a gas or molecule or even a large protein or virus it is the size of a cell and may actually be a cell of some sort the lethal agent is transmitted by air dead organisms are not infectious the lethal agent is inspired by the victim entering the lungs there it presumably crosses over into the bloodstream and starts coagulation the lethal agent causes death through coagulation this occurs within seconds and coincides with total coagulation of the entire body vascular system anticoagulant drugs do not prevent this process no other pathologic abnormalities are known to occur in the dying animal burton looked at his list and shook his head anticoagulants might not work but the fact was that something s the process there was a way that it could be done he knew that because two people had survived recovery at hours mark hall was bent over the computer staring at the console that showed the laboratory results from peter jackson and the infant the computer was giving results as they were finished by the automated laboratory equipment by now nearly all results were in the infant hall observed was normal the computer did not mince words subject coded infant shows all laboratory values within normal limits however peter jackson was another problem entirely his results were abnormal in several respects subject coded jackson peter laboratory values not within normal limits follow test normal value hematoc initial repeat repeat repeat repeat bun counts retic blood smear shows many immature erythrocyte forms test normal value pro time l blood ph sgot sed rate amylase some of the results were easy to understand others were not the hematocrit for example was rising because jackson was receiving transfusions of whole blood and packed red cells the bun or blood urea nitrogen was a test of kidney function and was mildly elevated probably because of decreased blood flow other analyses were consistent with blood loss the reticulocyte count was up from to per cent jackson had been anemic for some time he showed immature redcell forms which meant that his body was struggling to replace lost blood and so had to put young immature red cells into circulation the prothrombin time indicated that while jackson was bleeding from somewhere in his gastrointestinal tract he had no primary bleeding problem his blood clotted normally the sedimentation rate and sgot were indices of tissue destruction somewhere in jacksons body tissues were dying off but the ph of the blood was a bit of a puzzle at it was too acid though not strikingly so hall was at a loss to explain this so was the computer subject coded jackson peter diagnostic probabilities acute and chronic blood loss etiology gastrointestinal no other statistically significant sources acidosis etiology unexplained further data required suggest history hall read the printout and shrugged the computer might suggest he talk to the patient but that was easier said than done jackson was comatose and if he had ingested anything to make his blood acid they would not find out until he revived on the other hand perhaps he could test blood gases he turned to the computer and punched in a request for blood gases the computer responded stubbornly patient history preferable to laboratory analyses hall typed in patient comatose the computer seemed to consider this and then flashed back patient monitors not compatible with coma eeg shows alpha waves diagnostic of sleep ill be damned hall said he looked through the window and saw that jackson was indeed stirring sleepily he crawled down through the tunnel to his plastic suit and leaned over the patient mr jackson wake up slowly he opened his eyes and stared at hall he blinked not believing dont be frightened hall said quietly youre sick and we have been taking care of you do you feel better jackson swallowed and nodded he seemed afraid to speak but the pallor of his skin was gone his cheeks had a slight pinkish tinge his fingernails were no longer gray how do you feel now okay who are you i am dr hall i have been taking care of you you were bleeding very badly we had to give you a transfusion he nodded accepting this quite calmly somehow his manner rung a bell for hall who said has this happened to you before yes he said twice how did it happen before i dont know where i am he said looking around the room is this a hospital why are you wearing that thing no this isnt a hospital it is a special laboratory in nevada nevada he closed his eyes and shook his head but im in arizona not now we brought you here so we could help you how come that suit we brought you from piedmont there was a disease in piedmont you are now in an isolation chamber you mean im contagious well we dont know for sure but we must listen he said suddenly trying to get up this place gives me the creeps im getting out of here i dont like it here he struggled in the bed trying to move against the straps hall pushed him back gently just relax mr jackson everything will be all right but you must relax youve been a sick man slowly jackson lay back then i want a cigarette im afraid you cant have one what the hell i want one im sorry smoking is not allowed look here young fella when youve lived as long as i have youll know what you can do and what you cant do they told me before none of that mexican food no liquor no butts i tried it for a spell you know how that makes a body feel terrible just terrible who told you the doctors what doctors those doctors in phoenix big fancy hospital all that shiny equipment and all those shiny white uniforms real fancy hospital i wouldnt have gone there except for my sister she insisted she lives in phoenix you know with that husband of hers george stupid ninny i didnt want no fancy hospital i just wanted to rest up is all but she insisted so i went when was this last year june it was or july why did you go to the hospital why does anybody go to the hospital i was sick dammit what was your problem this damn stomach of mine same as always bleeding hell bleeding every time i hiccoughed i came up with blood never knew a body had so much blood in it bleeding in your stomach yeah like i said i had it before all these needles stuck in you he nodded to the intravenous lines and all the blood going into you phoenix last year and then tucson the year before that now tucson was a right nice place right nice had me a pretty little nurse and all abruptly he closed his mouth how old are you son anyhow you dont seem old enough to be a doctor im a surgeon hall said surgeon oh no you dont they kept trying to get me to do it and i kept saying not on your sweet life no indeedy not taking it out of me youve had an ulcer for two years a bit more the pains started out of the clear blue thought i had a touch of indigestion you know until the bleeding started up a twoyear history hall thought definitely ulcer not cancer and you went to the hospital yep fixed me up fine warned me off spicy foods and hard stuff and cigarettes and i tried sonny i sure did but it wasnt no good a man gets used to his pleasures so in a year you were back in the hospital yeah big old place in phoenix with that stupid ninny george and my sister visiting me every day hes a booklearning fool you know lawyer talks real big but he hasnt got the sense god gave a grasshoppers behind and they wanted to operate in phoenix sure they did no offense sonny but any doctorll operate on you give him half a chance its the way they think i just told them id gone this far with my old stomach and i reckoned id finish the stretch with it when did you leave the hospital must have been early august sometime first week or thereabouts and when did you start smoking and drinking and eating the wrong foods now dont lecture me sonny jackson said iv been living for sixtynine years eating all the wrong foods and doing all the wrong things i like it that way and if i cant keep it up well then the hell with it but you must have had pain hall said frowning oh sure it kicked up some specially if i didnt eat but i found a way to fix that yes sure they gave me this milk stuff at the hospital and wanted me to keep on with it hundred times a day in little sips milk stuff tasted like chalk but i found a better thing what was that aspirin jackson said aspirin sure works real nice how much aspirin did you take fair bit toward the end i was doing a bottle a day you know them bottles it comes in hall nodded no wonder the man was acid aspirin was acetylsalicylic acid and if it was taken in sufficient quantities it would acidify you aspirin was a gastric irritant and it could exacerbate bleeding didnt anybody tell you aspirin would make the bleeding worse he asked sure jackson said they told me but i didnt mind none because it stopped the pains see that plus a little squeeze squeeze redeye you know hall shook his head he didnt know sterno pink lady you take it see and put it in cloth and squeeze it out hall sighed you were drinking sterno he said well only when i couldnt get nothing else aspirin and squeeze see really kills that pain sterno isnt only alcohol its methanol too doesnt hurt you does it jackson asked in a voice suddenly concerned as a matter of fact it does it can make you go blind and it can even kill you well hell it made me feel better so i took it jackson said did this aspirin and squeeze have any effect on you on your breathing well now you mention it i was a tad short of breath but what the hell i dont need much breath at my age jackson yawned and closed his eyes youre awful full of questions boy i want to sleep now hall looked at him and decided the man was right it would be best to proceed slowly at least for a time he crawled back down the tunnel and out to the main room he turned to his assistant our friend mr jackson has a twoyear history of ulcer wed better keep the blood going in for another couple of units then we can stop and see whats happening drop an ng tube and start icewater lavage a gong rang echoing softly through the room whats that the twelvehour mark it means we have to change our clothing and it means you have a conference i do where the cr off the dining room hall nodded and left in delta sector the computers hummed and clicked softly as captain arthur morris punched through a new program on the console captain morris was a programmer he had been sent to delta sector by the command on level i because no mcn messages had been received for nine hours it was possible of course that there had been no priority transmissions but it was also unlikely and if there had been unreceived mcn messages then the computers were not functioning properly captain morris watched as the computer ran its usual internal check program which read out as all circuits functioning unsatisfied he punched in the checklim program a more rigorous testing of the circuit banks it required seconds for the machine to come back with its answer a row of five green lights blinked on the console he walked over to the teleprinter and watched as it typed machine function on all circuits within rational indices he looked and nodded satisfied he could not have known as he stood before the teleprinter that there was indeed a fault but that it was purely mechanical not electronic and hence could not be tested on the check programs the fault lay within the teleprinter box itself there a sliver of paper from the edge of the roll had peeled away and curling upward had lodged between the bell and striker preventing the bell from ringing it was for this reason that no mcn transmissions had been recorded neither machine nor man was able to catch the error the noon conference according to protocol the team met every twelve hours for a brief conference at which results were summarized and new directions planned in order to save time the conferences were held in a small room off the cafeteria they could eat and talk at the same time hall was the last to arrive he slipped into a chair behind his lunch two glasses of liquid and three pills of different colors just as stone said well hear from burton first burton shuffled to his feet and in a slow hesitant voice outlined his experiments and his results he noted first that he had determined the size of the lethal agent to be one micron stone and leavitt looked at each other the green flecks they had seen were much larger than that clearly infection could be spread by a mere fraction of the green fleck burton next explained his experiments concerning airborne transmission and coagulation beginning at the lungs he finished with his attempts at anticoagulation therapy what about the autopsies stone said what did they show nothing we dont already know the blood is clotted throughout no other demonstrable abnormalities at the light microscope level and clotting is initiated at the lungs yes presumably the organisms cross over to the bloodstream there or they may release a toxic substance which crosses over we may have an answer when the stained sections are finished in particular we will be looking for damage to blood vessels since this releases tissue thromboplastin and stimulates clotting at the site of the damage stone nodded and turned to hall who told of the tests carried out on his two patients he explained that the infant was normal to all tests and that jackson had a bleeding ulcer for which he was receiving transfusions hes revived hall said i talked with him briefly everyone sat up mr jackson is a cranky old goat of sixtynine who has a twoyear history of ulcer hes bled out twice before two years ago and again last year each time he was warned to change his habits each time he went back to his old ways and began bleeding again at the time of the piedmont contact e was treating his problems with his own regimen a bottle of aspirin a day and some sterno on top of it he says this left him a little short of breath and made him acidotic as hell burton said exactly methanol when broken down by the body was converted to formaldehyde and formic acid in combination with aspirin it meant jackson was consuming great quantities of acid the body had to maintain its acidbase balance within fairly narrow limits or death would occur one way to keep the balance was to breathe rapidly and blow off carbon dioxide decreasing carbonic acid in the body stone said could this acid have protected him from the organism hall shrugged impossible to say leavitt said what about the infant was it anemic no hall said but on the other hand we dont know for sure that it was protected by the same mechanism it might have something entirely different how about the acidbase balance of the child normal hall said perfectly normal at least it is now there was a moment of silence finally stone said well you have some good leads here the problem remains to discover what if anything that child and that old man have in common perhaps as you suggest there is nothing in common but for a start we have to assume that they were protected in the same way by the same mechanism hall nodded burton said to stone and what have you found in the capsule wed better show you stone said show us what something we believe may represent the organism stone said the door said morphology inside the room was partitioned into a place for the experimenters to stand and a glasswalled isolation chamber further in gloves were provided so the men could reach into the chamber and move instruments about stone pointed to the glass dish and the small fleck of black inside it we think this is our meteor he said we have found something apparently alive on its surface there were also other areas within the capsule that may represent life weve brought the meteor in here to have a look at it under the light microscope reaching through with the gloves stone set the glass dish into an opening in a large chrome box then withdrew his hands the box he said is simply a light microscope fitted with the usual image intensifiers and resolution scanners we can go up to a thousand diameters with it projected on the screen here leavitt adjusted dials while hall and the others stared at the viewer screen ten power leavitt said on the screen hall saw that the rock was jagged blackish dull stone pointed out green flecks one hundred power the green flecks were larger now very clear we think thats our organism we have observed it growing it turns purple apparently at the point of mitotic division spectrum shift of some kind one thousand power leavitt said the screen was filled with a single green spot nestled down in the jagged hollows of the rock hall noticed the surface of the green which was smooth and glistening almost oily you think thats a single bacterial colony we cant be sure its a colony in the conventional sense stone said until we heard burtons experiments we didnt think it was a colony at all we thought it might be a single organism but obviously the single units have to be a micron or less in size this is much too big therefore it is probably a larger structure perhaps a colony perhaps something else as they watched the spot turned purple and green again its dividing now stone said excellent leavitt switched on the cameras now watch closely the spot turned purple and held the color it seemed to expand slightly and for a moment the surface broke into fragments hexagonal in shape like a tile floor did you see that it seemed to break up into sixsided figures i wonder stone said whether those figures represent single units or whether they are regular geometric shapes all the time or just during division well know more stone said after the em he turned to burton have you finished your autopsies yes can you work the spectrometer i think so then do that its computerized anyway well want an analysis of samples of both the rock and the green organism youll get me a piece yes stone said to leavitt can you handle the aa analyzer yes same tests on that and a fractionation i think so stone said but youll have to do that by hand leavitt nodded stone turned back to the isolation chamber and removed a glass dish from the light microscope he set it to one side beneath a small device that looked like a miniature scaffolding this was the microsurgical unit microsurgery was a relatively new skill in biology the ability to perform delicate operations on a single cell using microsurgical techniques it was possible to remove the nucleus from a cell or part of the cytoplasm as neatly and cleanly as a surgeon performed an amputation the device was constructed to scale down human hand movements into fine precise miniature motions a series of gears and servomechanisms carried out the reduction the movement of a thumb was translated into a shift of a knife blade millionths of an inch using a high magnification viewer stone began to chip away delicately at the black rock until he had two tiny fragments he set them aside in separate glass dishes and proceeded to scrape away two small fragments from the green area immediately the green turned purple and expanded it doesnt like you leavitt said and laughed stone frowned interesting do you suppose thats a nonspecific growth response or a trophic response to injury and irradiation i think leavitt said that it doesnt like to be poked at we must investigate further stone said crash for arthur manchek there was a certain kind of horror in the telephone conversation he received it at home having just finished dinner and sat down in the living room to read the newspapers he hadnt seen a newspaper in the last two days he had been so busy with the piedmont business when the phone rang he assumed that it must be for his wife but a moment later she came in and said its for you the base he had an uneasy feeling as he picked up the receiver major manchek speaking major this is colonel burns at unit eight unit eight was the processing and clearing unit of the base personnel checked in and out through unit eight and calls were transmitted through it yes colonel sir we have you down for notification of certain contingencies his voice was guarded he was choosing his words carefully on the open line im informing you now of an rtm crash fortytwo minutes ago in big head utah manchek frowned why was he being informed of a routine trainingmission crash it was hardly his province what was it phantom sir en route san francisco to topeka i see manchek said though he did not see at all sir goddard wanted you to be informed in this instance so that you could join the post team goddard why goddard for a moment as he sat there in the living room staring at the newspaper headline absently new berlin crisis ffared he thought that the colonel meant lewis goddard chief of the codes section of vandenberg then he realized he meant goddard spaceflight center outside washington among other things goddard acted as collating center for certain special projects that fell between the province of houston and the governmental agencies in washington sir colonel burns said the phantom drifted off its flight plan forty minutes out of san francisco and passed through area wf manchek felt himself slowing down a kind of sleepiness came over him area wf that is correct sir when twenty minutes before the crash at what altitude twentythree thousand feet sir when does the post team leave half an hour sir from the base all right manchek said ill be there he hung up and stared at the phone lazily he felt tired he wished he could go to bed area wf was the designation for the cordonedoff radius around piedmont arizona they should have dropped the bomb he thought they should have dropped it two days ago at the time of the decision to delay directive manchek had been uneasy but officially he could not express an opinion and he had waited in vain for the wildfire team now located in the underground laboratory to complain to washington he knew wildfire had been notified he had seen the cable that went to all security units it was quite explicit yet for some reason wildfire had not complained indeed they had paid no attention to it whatever very odd and now there was a crash he lit his pipe and sucked on it considering the possibilities overwhelming was the likelihood that some green trainee had daydreamed gone off his flight plan panicked and lost control of the plane it had happened before hundreds of times the post team a group of specialists who went out to the site of the wreckage to investigate all crashes usually returned a verdict of agnogenic systems failure it was military doubletalk for crash of unknown cause it did not distinguish between mechanical failure and pilot failure but it was known that most systems failures were pilot failures a man could not afford to daydream when he was running a complex machine at two thousand miles an hour the proof lay in the statistics though only per cent of flights occurred after the pilot had taken a leave or weekend pass these flights accounted for per cent of casualties mancheks pipe went out he stood dropping the newspaper and went into the kitchen to tell his wife he was leaving this is movie country somebody said looking at the sandstone cliffs the brilliant reddish hues against the deepening blue of the sky and it was true many movies had been filmed in this area of utah but manchek could not think of movies now as he sat in the back of the limousine moving away from the utah airport he considered what he had been told during the flight from vandenberg to southern utah the post team had heard transcripts of the flight transmission between the phantom and topeka central for the most part it was dull except for the final moments before the pilot crashed the pilot had said something is wrong and then a moment later my rubber air hose is dissolving it must be the vibration its just disintegrating to dust perhaps ten seconds after that a weak fading voice said everything made of rubber in the cockpit is dissolving there were no further transmissions manchek kept hearing that brief communication in his mind over and over each time it sounded more bizarre and terrifying he looked out the window at the cliffs the sun was setting now and only the tops of the cliffs were lighted by fading reddish sunlight the valleys lay in darkness he looked ahead at the other limousine raising a small dust cloud as it carried the rest of the team to the crash site i used to love westerns somebody said they were all shot out here beautiful country manchek frowned it was astonishing to him how people could spend so much time on irrelevancies or perhaps it was just denial the unwillingness to face reality the reality was cold enough the phantom had strayed into area wf going quite deep for a matter of six minutes before the pilot realized the error and pulled north again however once in wf the plane had begun to lose stability and it had finally crashed he said has wildfire been informed a member of the group a psychiatrist with a crew cut all post teams had at least one psychiatrist said you mean the germ people yes theyve been told somebody else said it went out on the scrambler an hour ago then thought manchek there would certainly be a reaction from wildfire they could not afford to ignore this unless they werent reading their cables it had never occurred to him before but perhaps it was possible they werent reading the cables they were so absorbed in their work they just werent bothering theres the wreck somebody said up ahead each time manchek saw a wreck he was astonished somehow one never got used to the idea of the sprawl the mess the destructive force of a large metal object striking the earth at thousands of miles an hour he always expected a neat tight little clump of metal but it was never that way the wreckage of the phantom was scattered over two square miles of desert standing next to the charred remnants of the left wing he could barely see the others on the horizon near the right wing everywhere he looked there were bits of twisted metal blackened paint peeling he saw one with a small portion of a sign still intact the stenciled letters clear do not the rest was gone it was impossible to make anything of the remnants the fuselage the cockpit the canopy were all shattered into a million fragments and the fires had disfigured everything as the sun faded he found himself standing near the remains of the tail section where the metal still radiated heat from the smoldering fire halfburied in the sand he saw a bit of bone he picked it up and realized with horror that it was human long and broken and charred at one end it had obviously come from an arm or a leg but it was oddly clean there was no flesh remaining only smooth bone darkness descended and the post team took out their flashlights the halfdozen men moving among smoking metal flashing their yellow beams of light about it was late in the evening when a biochemist whose name he did not know came up to talk with him you know the biochemist said its funny that transcript about the rubber in the cockpit dissolving how do you mean well no rubber was used in this airplane it was all a synthetic plastic compound newly developed by ancro theyre quite proud of it its a polymer that has some of the same characteristics as human tissue very flexible lots of applications manchek said do you think vibrations could have caused the disintegration no the man said there are thousands of phantoms flying around the world they all have this plastic none of them has ever had this trouble meaning meaning that i dont know what the hell is going on the biochemist said routine slowly the wildfire installation settled into a routine a rhythm of work in the underground chambers of a laboratory where there was no night or day morning or afternoon the men slept when they were tired awoke when they were refreshed and carried on their work in a number of different areas most of this work was to lead nowhere they knew that and accepted it in advance as stone was fond of saying scientific research was much like prospecting you went out and you hunted armed with your maps and your instruments but in the end your preparations did not matter or even your intuition you needed your luck and whatever benefits accrued to the diligent through sheer grinding hard work burton stood in the room that housed the spectrometer along with several other pieces of equipment for radioactivity assays ratiodensity photometry thermocoupling analysis and preparation for xray crystallography the spectrometer employed in level v was the standard whittington model k essentially it consisted of a vaporizer a prism and a recording screen the material to be tested was set in the vaporizer and burned the light from its burning then passed through the prism where it was broken down to a spectrum that was projected onto a recording screen since different elements gave off different wavelengths of light as they burned it was possible to analyze the chemical makeup of a substance by analyzing the spectrum of light produced in theory it was simple but in practice the reading of spectrometrograms was complex and difficult no one in this wildfire laboratory was trained to do it well thus results were fed directly into a computer which performed the analysis because of the sensitivity of the computer rough percentage compositions could also be determined burton placed the first chip from the black rock onto the vaporizer and pressed the button there was a single bright burst of intensely hot light he turned away avoiding the brightness and then put the second chip onto the lamp already he knew the computer was analyzing the light from the first chip he repeated the process with the green fleck and then checked the time the computer was now scanning the selfdeveloping photographic plates which were ready for viewing in seconds but the scan itself would take two hours die electric eye was very slow once the scan was completed the computer would analyze results and print the data within five seconds the wall clock told him it was now hours three in the afternoon he suddenly realized he was tired he punched in instructions to the computer to wake him when analysis was finished then he went off to bed in another room leavitt was carefully feeding similar chips into a different machine an aminoacid analyzer as he did so he smiled slightly to himself for he could remember how it had been in the old days before aa analysis was automatic in the early fifties the analysis of amino acids in a protein might take weeks or even months sometimes it took years now it took hours or at the very most a day and it was fully automatic amino acids were the building blocks of proteins there were twentyfour known amino acids each composed of a halfdozen molecules of carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen proteins were made by stringing these amino acids together in a line like a freight train the order of stringing determined the nature of the protein whether it was insulin hemoglobin or growth hormone all proteins were composed of the same freight cars the same units some proteins had more of one kind of car than another or in a different order but that was the only difference the same amino acids the same freight cars existed in human proteins and flea proteins that fact had taken approximately twenty years to discover but what controlled the order of amino acids in the protein the answer turned out to be dna the geneticcoding substance which acted like a switching manager in a freightyard that particular fact had taken another twenty years to discover but then once the amino acids were strung together they began to twist and coil upon themselves the analogy became closer to a snake than a train the manner of coiling was determined by the order of acids and was quite specific a protein had to be coiled in a certain way and no other or it failed to function another ten years rather odd leavitt thought hundreds of laboratories thousands of workers throughout the world all bent on discovering such essentially simple facts it had all taken years and years decades of patient effort and now there was this machine the machine would not of course give the precise order of amino acids but it would give a rough percentage composition so much valine so much arginine so much cystine and proline and leucine and that in turn would give a great deal of information yet it was a shot in the dark this machine because they had no reason to believe that either the rock or the green organism was composed even partially of proteins true every living thing on earth had at least some proteins but that didnt mean life elsewhere had to have it for a moment he tried to imagine life without proteins it was almost impossible on earth proteins were part of the cell wall and comprised all the enzymes known to man and life without enzymes was that possible he recalled the remark of george thompson the british biochemist who had called enzymes the matchmakers of life it was true enzymes acted as catalysts for all chemical reactions by providing a surface for two molecules to come together and react upon there were hundreds of thousands perhaps millions of enzymes each existing solely to aid a single chemical reaction without enzymes there could be no chemical reactions without chemical reactions there could be no life or could there it was a longstanding problem early in planning wildfire the question had been posed how do you study a form of life totally unlike any you know how would you even know it was alive this was not an academic matter biology as george wald had said was a unique science because it could not define its subject matter nobody had a definition for life nobody knew what it was really the old definitions an organism that showed ingestion excretion metabolism reproduction and so on were worthless one could always find exceptions the group had finally concluded that energy conversion was the hallmark of life all living organisms in some way took in energy as food or sunlight and converted it to another form of energy and put it to use viruses were the exception to this rule but the group was prepared to define viruses as nonliving for the next meeting leavitt was asked to prepare a rebuttal to the definition he pondered it for a week and returned with three objects a swatch of black cloth a watch and a piece of granite he set them down before the group and said gentleman i give you three living things he then challenged the team to prove that they were not living he placed the black cloth in the sunlight it became warm this he announced was an example of energy conversionradiant energy to heat it was objected that this was merely passive energy absorption not conversion it was also objected that the conversion if it could be called that was not purposeful it served no function how do you know it is not purposeful leavitt had demanded they then turned to the watch leavitt pointed to the radium dial which glowed in the dark decay was taking place and light was being produced the men argued that this was merely release of potential energy held in unstable electron levels but there was growing confusion leavitt was making his point finally they came to the granite this is alive leavitt said it is living breathing walking and talking only we cannot see it because it is happening too slowly rock has a lifespan of three billion years we have a lifespan of sixty or seventy years we cannot see what is happening to this rock for the same reason that we cannot make out the tune on a record being played at the rate of one revolution every century and the rock for its part is not even aware of our existence because we are alive for only a brief instant of its lifespan to it we are like flashes in the dark he held up his watch his point was clear enough and they revised their thinking in one important respect they conceded that it was possible that they might not be able to analyze certain life forms it was possible that they might not be able to make the slightest headway the least beginning in such an analysis but leavitts concerns extended beyond this to the general problem of action in uncertainty he recalled reading talbert gregsons planning the unplanned with close attention poring over the complex mathematical models the author had devised to analyze the problem it was gregsons conviction that all decisions involving uncertainty fall within two distinct categories those with contingencies and those without the latter are distinctly more difficult to deal with most decisions and nearly all human interaction can be incorporated into a contingencies model for example a president may start a war a man may sell his business or divorce his wife such an action will produce a reaction the number of reactions is infinite but the number of probable reactions is manageably small before making a decision an individual can predict various reactions and he can assess his original or primarymode decision more effectively but there is also a category which cannot be analyzed by contingencies this category involves events and situations which are absolutely unpredictable not merely disasters of all sorts but those also including rare moments of discovery and insight such as those which produced the laser or penicillin because these moments are unpredictable they cannot be planned for in any logical manner the mathematics are wholly unsatisfactory we may only take comfort in the fact that such situations for ill or for good are exceedingly rare jeremy stone working with infinite patience took a flake of the green material and dropped it into molten plastic the plastic was the size and shape of a medicine capsule he waited until the flake was firmly imbedded and poured more plastic over it he then transferred the plastic pill to the curing room stone envied the others their mechanized routines the preparation of samples for electron microscopy was still a delicate task requiring skilled human hands the preparation of a good sample was as demanding a craft as that ever practiced by an artisan and took almost as long to learn stone had worked for five years before he became proficient at it the plastic was cured in a special highspeed processing unit but it would still take five hours to harden to proper consistency the curing room would maintain a constant temperature of deg c with a relative humidity of per cent once the plastic was hardened he would scrape it away and then flake off a small bit of green with a microtome this would go into the electron microscope the flake would have to be of the right thickness and size a small round shaving angstroms in depth no more only then could he look at the green stuff whatever it was at sixty thousand diameters magnification that he thought would be interesting in general stone believed the work was going well they were making fine progress moving forward in several promising lines of inquiry but most important they had time there was no rush no panic no need to fear the bomb had been dropped on piedmont that would destroy airborne organisms and neutralize the source of infection wildfire was the only place that any further infection could spread from and wildfire was specifically designed to prevent that should isolation be broken in the lab the areas that were contaminated would automatically seal off within a halfsecond sliding airtight doors would close producing a new configuration for the lab this was necessary because past experience in other laboratories working in socalled axenic or germfree atmospheres indicated that contamination occurred in per cent of cases the reasons were usually structural a seal burst a glove tore a seam split but the contamination occurred nonetheless at wildfire they were prepared for that eventuality but if it did not happen and the odds were it would not then they could work safely here for an indefinite period they could spend a month even a year working on the organism there was no problem no problem at all hall walked through the corridor looking at the atomicdetonator substations he was trying to memorize their positions there were five on the floor positioned at intervals along the central corridor each was the same small silver boxes no larger than a cigarette packet each had a lock for the key a green light that was burning and a darkred light burton had explained the mechanism earlier there are sensors in all the duct systems and in all the labs they monitor the air in the rooms by a variety of chemical electronic and straight bioassay devices the bioassay is just a mouse whose heartbeat is being monitored if anything goes wrong with the sensors the lab automatically seals off if the whole floor is contaminated it will seal off and the atomic device will cut in when that happens the green light will go out and the red light will begin to blink that signals the start of the threeminute interval unless you lock in your key the bomb will go off at the end of three minutes and i have to do it myself burton nodded the key is steel it is conductive the lock has a system which measures the capacitance of the person holding the key it responds to general body size particularly weight and also the salt content of sweat its quite specific actually for you so im really the only one you really are and you only have one key but theres a complicating problem the blueprints werent followed exactly we only discovered the error after the lab was finished and the device was installed but there is an error we are short three detonator substations there are only five instead of eight meaning meaning that if the floor starts to contaminate you must rush to locate yourself at a substation otherwise there is a chance you could be sealed off in a sector without a substation and then in the event of a malfunction of the bacteriologic sensors a false positive malfunction the laboratory could be destroyed needlessly that seems a rather serious error in planning it turns out burton said that three new substations were going to be added next month but that wont help us now just keep the problem in mind and everythingll be all right leavitt awoke quickly rolling out of bed and starting to dress he was excited he had just had an idea a fascinating thing wild crazy but fascinating as hell it had come from his dream he had been dreaming of a house and then of a city a huge complex interconnecting city around the house a man lived in the house with his family the man lived and worked and commuted within the city moving about acting reacting and then in the dream the city was suddenly eliminated leaving only the house how different things were then a single house standing alone without the things it needed water plumbing electricity streets and a family cut off from the supermarkets schools drugstores and the husband whose work was in the city interrelated to others in the city suddenly stranded the house became a different organism altogether and from that to the wildfire organism was but a single step a single leap of the imagination he would have to discuss it with stone stone would laugh as usual stone always laughed but he would also pay attention leavitt knew that in a sense he operated as the idea man for the team the man who would always provide the most improbable mindstretching theories well stone would at least be interested he glanced at the clock hours getting on toward midnight he hurried to dress he took out a new paper suit and slipped his feet in the paper was cool against his bare flesh and then suddenly it was warm a strange sensation he finished dressing stood and zipped up the onepiece suit as he left he looked once again at the clock oh geez he thought it had happened again and this time for ten minutes what had gone on he couldnt remember but it was ten minutes gone disappeared while he had dressed an action that shouldnt have taken more than thirty seconds he sat down again on the bed trying to remember but he could not ten minutes gone it was terrifying because it was happening again though he had hoped it would not it hadnt happened for months but now with the excitement the odd hours the break in his normal hospital schedule it was starting once more for a moment he considered telling the others then shook his head hed be all right it wouldnt happen again he was going to be just fine he stood he had been on his way to see stone to talk to stone about something something important and exciting he paused he couldnt remember the idea the image the excitement was gone vanished erased from his mind he knew then that he should tell stone admit the whole thing but he knew what stone would say and do if he found out and he knew what it would mean to his future to the rest of his life once the wildfire project was finished everything would change if people knew he couldnt ever be normal again he would have to quit his job do other things make endless adjustments he couldnt even drive a car no he thought he would not say anything and he would be all right as long as he didnt look at blinking lights jeremy stone was tired but knew he was not ready for sleep he paced up and down the corridors of the laboratory thinking about the birds at piedmont he ran over everything they had done how they had seen the birds how they had gassed them with chlorazine and how the birds had died he went over it in his mind again and again because he was missing something and that something was bothering him at the time while he had been inside piedmont itself it had bothered him then he had forgotten but his nagging doubts had been revived at the noon conference while hall was discussing the patients something hall had said some fact he had mentioned was related in some off way to the birds but what was it what was the exact thought the precise words that had triggered the association stone shook his head he simply couldnt dig it out the clues the connection the keys were all there but he couldnt bring them to the surface he pressed his hands to his head squeezing against the bones and he damned his brain for being so stubborn like many intelligent men stone took a rather suspicious attitude toward his own brain which he saw as a precise and skilled but temperamental machine he was never surprised when the machine failed to perform though he feared those moments and hated them in his blackest hours stone doubted the utility of all thought and all intelligence there were times when he envied the laboratory rats he worked with their brains were so simple certainly they did not have the intelligence to destroy themselves that was a peculiar invention of man he often argued that human intelligence was more trouble than it was worth it was more destructive than creative more confusing than revealing more discouraging than satisfying more spiteful than charitable there were times when he saw man with his giant brain as equivalent to the dinosaurs every schoolboy knew that dinosaurs had outgrown themselves had become too large and ponderous to be viable no one ever thought to consider whether the human brain the most complex structure in the known universe making fantastic demands on the human body in terms of nourishment and blood was not analogous perhaps the human brain had become a kind of dinosaur for man and perhaps in the end would prove his downfall already the brain consumed one quarter of the bodys blood supply a fourth of all blood pumped from the heart went to the brain an organ accounting for only a small percentage of body mass if brains grew larger and better then perhaps they would consume more perhaps so much that like an infection they would overrun their hosts and kill the bodies that transported them or perhaps in their infinite cleverness they would find a way to destroy themselves and each other there were times when as he sat at state department or defense department meetings and looked around the table he saw nothing more than a dozen gray convoluted brains sitting on the table no flesh and blood no hands no eyes no fingers no mouths no sex organs all these were superfluous just brains sitting around trying to decide how to outwit other brains at other conference tables idiotic he shook his head thinking that he was becoming like leavitt conjuring up wild and improbable schemes yet there was a sort of logical consequence to stones ideas if you really feared and hated your brain you would attempt to destroy it destroy your own and destroy others im tired he said aloud and looked at the wall clock it was hours almost time for the midnight conference the midnight conference they met again in the same room in the same way stone glanced at the others and saw they were tired no one including himself was getting enough sleep were going at this too hard he said we dont need to work around the clock and we shouldnt do so tired men will make mistakes mistakes in thinking and mistakes in action well start to drop things to screw things up to work sloppily and well make wrong assumptions draw incorrect inferences that mustnt happen the team agreed to get at least six hours sleep in h c twentyfourhour period that seemed reasonable since there was no problem on the surface the infection at piedmont had been halted by the atomic bomb their belief might never have been altered had not leavitt suggested that they file for a code name leavitt stated that they had an organism and that it required a code the others agreed in a corner of the room stood the scrambler typewriter it had been clattering all day long typing out material sent in from the outside it was a twoway machine material transmitted had to be typed in lowercase letters while received material was printed out in capitals no one had really bothered to look at the input since their arrival on level v they were all too busy besides most of the input had been routine military dispatches that were sent to wildfire but did not concern it this was because wildfire was one of the cooler circuit substations known facetiously as the top twenty these substations were linked to the basement of the white house and were the twenty most important strategic locations in the country other substations included vandenberg kennedy norad patterson detrick and virginia key stone went to the typewriter and printed out his message the message was directed by computer to central codes a station that handled the coding of all projects subsumed under the system of cooler the transmission was as follows open line to transmit understand transmit state origin stone project wildfire state destination central codes understand central codes message follows send have isolated extraterrestrial organism secondary to return of scoop seven wish coding for organism end message transmitted there followed a long pause the scrambler teleprinter hummed and clicked but printed nothing then the typewriter began to spit out a message on a long roll of paper message from central codes follows understand isolation of new organism please characterize end message stone frowned but we dont know enough however the teleprinter was impatient transmit reply to central codes after a moment stone typed back message to central codes follows cannot characterize at this time but suggest tentative classification as bacterial strain end message message from central codes follows understand request for bacterial classification opening new category classification according to icda standard reference code for your organism will be andromeda code will read out andromeda filed under icda listings as unspecified organism further filing as e aircraft accident this filing represents closest fit to established categories stone smiled it seems we dont fit the established categories he typed back understand coding as andromeda strain accepted end message transmitted well stone said thats that burton had been looking over the sheaves of paper behind the teleprinter the teleprinterwrote its messages out on a long roll of paper which fell into a box there were dozens of yards of paper that no one had looked at silently he read a single message tore it from the rest of the strip and handed it to stone kkyu information status transmit to all stations classification top secret request for directive received today by exec and nbccobra origin vandenbergwildfire corroboration nasaamc authority primary manchek arthur major usa in closed session this directive has not been acted upon final decision has been postponed twenty four to forty eight hours reconsideration at that time alternative troop deployment according to directive now in effect no notification end message transmit all stations classification top secret end transmission the team stared at the message in disbelief no one said anything for a long time finally stone ran his fingers along the upper corner of the sheet and said in a low voice this was a that makes it an mcn transmission it should have rung the bell down here theres no bell on this teleprinter leavitt said only on level i at sector five but theyre supposed to notify us whenever get sector five on the intercom stone said ten minutes later the horrified captain mortis had connected stone to robertson the head of the presidents science advisory committee who was in houston stone spoke for several minutes with robertson pressed initial surprise that he hadnt heard from earlier there then followed a heated discussion of the presidents decision not to call a directive the president doesnt trust scientists robertshe doesnt feel comfortable with them its your job to make him comfortable stone said and you havent been doing it jeremy there are only two sources of contamination stone said piedmont and this installation were adequately protected here but piedmont jeremy i agree the bomb should have been dropped then work on him stay on his back get him as soon as possible it may already be too late robertson said he would and would call back before he hung up he said by the way any thoughts about the phantom the what the phantom that crashed in utah there was a moment of confusion before the wildfire group understood that they had missed still another important teleprinter message routine training mission the jet strayed over the closed zone though thats the puzzle any other information the pilot said something about his air hose dissolving vibration or something his last communication was bizarre like he was crazy stone asked like that robertson said is there a team at the wreck site now yes were waiting for information from them it could come at any time pass it along stone said and then he stopped if a was ordered instead of a he said then you have troops in the area around piedmont national guard yes thats pretty damned stupid stone said look jeremy i agree when the first one dies stone said i want to know when and how and most especially where the wind there is from the east predominantly if you start losing men west of piedmont ill call jeremy robertson said the conversation ended and the team shuffled out of the conference room hall remained behind a moment going through some of the rolls in the box noting the messages the majority were unintelligible to him a weird set of nonsense messages and codes after a time he gave up he did so before he came upon the reprinted news item concerning the peculiar death of officer martin willis of the arizona highway patrol day spread the analysis with the new pressures of time the results of spectrometry and aminoacid analysis previously of peripheral interest suddenly became matters of major concern it was hoped that these analyses would tell in a rough way how foreign the andromeda organism was to earth life forms it was thus with interest that leavitt and burton looked over the computer printout a column of figures written on green paper mass spectrometry data output print percentage output sample black object unidentified origin diagram of chemistry of the rock from h to br all heavier metals show zero content sample green object unidentified origin diagram of chemistry of green object all heavier metals show zero content end print end program stop what all this meant was simple enough the black rock contained hydrogen carbon and oxygen with significant amounts of sulfur silicon and selenium and with trace quantities of several other elements the green spot on the other hand contained hydrogen carbon nitrogen and oxygen nothing else at all the two men found it peculiar that the rock and the green spot should be so similar in chemical makeup and it was peculiar that the green spot should contain nitrogen while the rock contained none at all the conclusion was obvious the black rock was not rock at all but some kind of material similar to earthly organic life it was something akin to plastic and the green spot presumably alive was composed of elements in roughly the same proportion as earth life on earth these same four elements hydrogen carbon nitrogen and oxygen accounted for per cent of all the elements in life organisms the men were encouraged by these results which suggested similarity between the green spot and life on earth their hopes were however shortlived as they turned to the aminoacid analysis amino acid analysis graphic of amino acid analysis all zeroes total amino acid content end print end program stop damn leavitt said staring at the printed sheet will you look at that no amino acids burton said no proteins life without proteins leavitt said he shook his head it seemed as if his worst fears were realized on earth organisms had evolved by learning to carry out biochemical reactions in a small space with the help of protein enzymes biochemists were now learning to duplicate these reactions but only by isolating a single reaction from all others living cells were different there within a small area reactions were carried out that provided energy growth and movement there was no separation and man could not duplicate this any more than a man could prepare a complete dinner from appetizers to dessert by mixing together the ingredients for everything into a single large dish cooking it and hoping to separate the apple pie from the cheese dip later on cells could keep the hundreds of separate reactions straight using enzymes each enzyme was like a single worker in a kitchen doing just one thing thus a baker could not make a steak any more than a steak griller could use his equipment to prepare appetizers but enzymes had a further use they made possible chemical reactions that otherwise would not occur a biochemist could duplicate the reactions by using great heat or great pressure or strong acids but the human body or the individual cell could not tolerate such extremes of environment enzymes the matchmakers of life helped chemical reactions to go forward at body temperature and atmospheric pressure enzymes were essential to life on earth but if another form of life had learned to do without them it must have evolved in a wholly different way therefore they were dealing with an entirely alien organism and this in turn meant that analysis and neutralization would take much much longer in the room marked morphology jeremy stone removed the small plastic capsule in which the green fleck had been imbedded he set the nowhard capsule into a vise fixing it firmly and then took a dental drill to it shaving away the plastic until he exposed bare green material this was a delicate process requiring many minutes of concentrated work at the end of that time he had shaved the plastic in such a way that he had a pyramid of plastic with the green fleck at the peak of the pyramid he unscrewed the vise and lifted the plastic out he took it to the microtome a knife with a revolving blade that cut very thin slices of plastic and imbedded green tissue these slices were round they fell from the plastic block into a dish of water the thickness of the slice could be measured by looking the light as it reflected off the slices if the light was faint silver the slice was too thick if on the other hand it was a rainbow of colors then it was the right thickness just a few molecules in depth that was how thick they wanted a slice of tissue to be for the electron microscope when stone had a suitable piece of tissue he lifted it carefully with forceps and set it onto a small round copper grid this in turn was inserted into a metal button finally the button was set into the electron microscope and the microscope sealed shut the electron microscope used by wildfire was the bvj model jj it was a highintensity model with an image resolution attachment in principle the electron microscope was simple enough it worked exactly like a light microscope but instead of focusing light rays it focused an electron beam light is focused by lenses of curved glass electrons are focused by magnetic fields in many respects the em was not a great deal different from television and in fact the image was displayed on a television screen a coated surface that glowed when electrons struck it the great advantage of the electron microscope was that it could magnify objects far more than the light microscope the reason for this had to do with quantum mechanics and the waveform theory of radiation the best simple explanation had come from the electron microscopist sidney polton also a racing enthusiast assume polton said that you have a road with a sharp corner now assume that you have two automobiles a sports car and a large truck when the truck tries to go around the corner it slips off the road but the sports car manages it easily why the sports car is lighter and smaller and faster it is better suited to tight sharp curves on large gentle curves the automobiles will perform equally well but on sharp curves the sports car will do better in the same way an electron microscope will hold the road better than a light microscope all objects are made of corners and edges the electron wavelength is smaller than the quantum of light it cuts the corners closer follows the road better and outlines it more precisely with a light microscope like a truck you can follow only a large road in microscopic terms this means only a large object with large edges and gentle curves cells and nuclei but an electron microscope can follow all the minor routes the byroads and can outline very small structures within the cell mitochondria ribosomes membranes reticula in actual practice there were several drawbacks to the electron microscope which counterbalanced its great powers of magnification for one thing because it used electrons instead of light the inside of the microscope had to be a vacuum this meant it was impossible to examine living creatures but the most serious drawback had to do with the sections of specimen these were extremely thin making it difficult to get a good threedimensional concept of the object under study again polton had a simple analogy let us say you cut an automobile in half down the middle in that case you could guess the complete whole structure but if you cut a very thin slice from the automobile and if you cut it on a strange angle it could be more difficult in your slice you might have only a bit of bumper and rubber tire and glass from such a slice it would be hard to guess the shape and function of the full structure stone was aware of all the drawbacks as he fitted the metal button into the em sealed it shut and started the vacuum pump he knew the drawbacks and he ignored them because he had no choice limited as it was the electron microscope was their only available highpower tool he turned down the room lights and clicked on the beam he adjusted several dials to focus the beam in a moment the image came into focus green and black on the screen it was incredible jeremy stone found himself staring at a single unit of the organism it was a perfect sixsided hexagon and it interlocked with other hexagons on each side the interior of the hexagon was divided into wedges each meeting at the precise center of the structure the overall appearance was accurate with a kind of mathematical precision he did not associate with life on earth it looked like a crystal he smiled leavitt would be pleased leavitt liked spectacular mindstretching things leavitt had also frequently considered the possibility that life might be based upon crystals of some kind that it might be ordered in some regular pattern he decided to call leavitt in graphic of em crystal pattern caption early sketch by jeremy stone of hexagonal andromeda configuration photo courtesy project wildfire as soon as he arrived leavitt said well theres our answer answer to what to how this organism functions ive seen the results of spectrometry and aminoacid analysis and the organism is made of hydrogen carbon oxygen and nitrogen but it has no amino acids at all none which means that it has no proteins as we know them and no enzymes i was wondering how it could survive without proteinbased organization now i know the crystalline structure looks like it leavitt said peering at the screen in three dimensions its probably a hexagonal slab like a piece of tile eightsided with each face a hexagon and on the inside those wedgeshaped compartments leading to the center they would serve to separate biochemical functions quite well yes leavitt said he frowned something the matter leavitt was thinking remembering something he had forgotten a dream about a house and a city he thought for a moment and it began to come back to him a house and a city the way the house worked alone and the way it worked in a city it all came back you know he said its interesting the way this one unit interlocks with the others around it youre wondering if were seeing part of a higher organism exactly is this unit selfsufficient like a bacterium or is it just a block from a larger organ or a larger organism after all if you saw a single liver cell could you guess what kind of an organ it came from no and what good would one brain cell be without the rest of the brain stone stared at the screen for a long time a rather unusual pair of analogies because the liver can regenerate can grow back but the brain cannot leavitt smiled the messenger theory one wonders stone said the messenger theory had come from john r samuels a communications engineer speaking before the fifth annual conference on astronautics and communication he had reviewed some theories about the way in which an alien culture might choose to contact other cultures he argued that the most advanced concepts in communications in earth technology were inadequate and that advanced cultures would find better methods let us say a culture wishes to scan the universe he said let us say they wish to have a sort of comingout party on a galactic scale to formally announce their existence they wish to spew out information clues to their existence in every direction what is the best way to do this radio hardly radio is too slow too expensive and it decays too rapidly strong signals weaken within a few billion miles tv is even worse light rays are fantastically expensive to generate even if one learned a way to detonate whole stars to explode a sun as a kind of signal it would be costly besides expense all these methods suffer the traditional drawback to any radiation namely decreasing strength with distance a light bulb may be unbearably bright at ten feet it may be powerful at a thousand feet it may be visible at ten miles but at a million miles it is completely obscure because radiant energy decreases according to the fourth power of the radius a simple unbeatable law of physics so you do not use physics to carry your signal you use biology you create a communications system that does not diminish with distance but rather remains as powerful a million miles away as it was at the source in short you devise an organism to carry your message the organism would be selfreplicating cheap and could be produced in fantastic numbers for a few dollars you could produce trillions of them and send them off in all directions into space they would be tough hardy bugs able to withstand the rigors of space and they would grow and duplicate and divide within a few years there would be countless numbers of these in the galaxy speeding in all directions waiting to contact life and when they did each single organism would carry the potential to develop into a full organ or a full organism they would upon contacting life begin to grow into a complete communicating mechanism it is like spewing out a billion brain cells each capable of regrowing a complete brain under the proper circumstances the newly grown brain would then speak to the new culture informing it of the presence of the other and announcing ways in which contact might be made samuelss theory of the messenger bug was considered amusing by practical scientists but it could not be discounted now do you suppose stone said that it is already developing into some kind of organ of communication perhaps the cultures will tell us more leavitt said or xray crystallography stone said ill order it now level v had facilities for xray crystallography though there had been much heated discussion during wildfire planning as to whether such facilities were necessary xray crystallography represented the most advanced complex and expensive method of structural analysis in modern biology it was a little like electron microscopy but one step further along the line it was more sensitive and could probe deeper but only at great cost in terms of time equipment and personnel the biologist r a janek has said that increasing vision is increasingly expensive he meant by this that any machine to enable men to see finer or fainter details increased in cost faster than it increased in resolving power this hard fact of research was discovered first by the astronomers who learned painfully that construction of a twohundredinch telescope mirror was far more difficult and expensive than construction of a onehundredinch mirror in biology this was equally true a light microscope for example was a small device easily carried by a technician in one hand it could outline a cell and for this ability a scientist paid about an electron microscope could outline small structures within the cell the em was a large console and cost up to in contrast xray crystallography could outline individual molecules it came as close to photographing atoms as science could manage but the device was the size of a large automobile filled an entire room required specially trained operators and demanded a computer for interpretation of results this was because xray crystallography did not produce a direct visual picture of the object being studied it was not in this sense a microscope and it operated differently from either the light or electron microscope it produced a diffraction pattern instead of an image this appeared as a pattern of geometric dots in itself rather mysterious on a photographic plate by using a computer the pattern of dots could be analyzed and the structure deduced it was a relatively new science retaining an oldfashioned name crystals were seldom used any more the term x ray crystallography dated from the days when crystals were chosen as test objects crystals had regular structures and thus the pattern of dots resulting from a beam of x rays shot at a crystal were easier to analyze but in recent years the x rays had been shot at irregular objects of varying sorts the x rays were bounced off at different angles a computer could read the photographic plate and measure the angles and from this work back to the shape of the object that had caused such a reflection the computer at wildfire performed the endless and tedious calculations all this if done by manual human calculation would take years perhaps centuries but the computer could do it in seconds how are you feeling mr jackson hall asked the old man blinked his eyes and looked at hall in his plastic suit all right not the best but all right he gave a wry grin up to talking a little about what piedmont what about it that night hall said the night it all happened well i tell you ive lived in piedmont all my life traveled a bit been to la and even up to frisco went as far east as st louis which was far enough for me but piedmont thats where ive lived and i have to tell you the night it all happened hall repeated he stopped and turned his head away i dont want to think about it he said you have to think about it no he continued to look away for a moment and then turned back to hall they all died did they not all one other survived he nodded to the crib next to jackson jackson peered over at the bundle of blankets whos that a baby baby must be the ritter child jamie ritter real young is it about two months yep thats him a real little heller just like the old man old ritter likes to kick up a storm and his kids the same way squalling morning noon and night family couldnt keep the windas open on account of the squalling is there anything else unusual about jamie nope healthy as a water buffalo except he squalls i remember he was squalling like the dickens that night hall said what night the night charley thomas brought the damned thing in we all seen it of course it came down like one of them shooting stars all glowing and landed just to the north everybody was excited and charley thomas went off to get it came back about twenty minutes later with the thing in the back of his ford station wagon brandnew wagon hes real proud of it then what happened well we all gathered around looking at it reckoned it must be one of those space things annie figured it was from mars but you know how annie is lets her mind carry her off at times the rest of us we didnt feel it was no martian thing we just figured it was something sent up from cape canaveral you know that place in florida where they shoot the rockets yes go on so once we figured that out good and proper we didnt know what to do nothing like that ever happened in piedmont you know i mean once we had that tourist with the gun shot up the comanche chief motel but that was back in and besides he was just a gi had a little too much to drink and there were exterminating circumstances his gal run out on him while he was in germany or some damn place nobody gave him a bad time we understood how it was but nothing happened since really quiet town thats why we like it i reckon what did you do with the capsule well we didnt know what to do with it al he said open er up but we didnt figure that was right especially since it might have some scientific stuff inside so we thought awhile and then charley who got it in the first place charley says lets give it to doc thats doc benedict hes the town doctor actually he takes care of everybody around even the indians but hes a good fella anyhow and hes been to lots of schools got these degrees on the walls well we figured doc benedict would know what to do with the thing so we brought it to him and then old doc benedict hes not so old actually he looks er over real careful like it was his patient and then he allows as how it might be a thing from space and it might be one of ours or it might be one of theirs and he says hell take care of it and maybe make a few phone calls and let everybody know in a few hours see doc always played poker monday nights with charley and al and herb johnstone over at herbs place and we figured that hed spread the word around then besides it was getting on suppertime and most of us were a bit hungry so we all kind of left it with doc when was that bout seventhirty or so what did benedict do with the satellite took it inside his house none of us saw it again it was about eight eightthirty that it all started up you see i was over at the gas station having a chat with al who was working the pump that night chilly night but i wanted a chat to take my mind off the pain and to get some soda from the machine to wash down the aspirin with also i was thirsty squeeze makes you right thirsty you know youd been drinking sterno that day bout six oclock i had some yes how did you feel well when i was with al i felt good little dizzy and my stomach was paining me but i felt good and al and me were sitting inside the office you know talking and suddenly he shouts oh god my head he ups and runs outside and falls down right there in the street not a word from him well i didnt know what to make of it i figured he had a heart attack or a shock but he was pretty young for that so i went after him only he was dead then they all started coming out i believe mrs langdon the widow langdon was next after that i dont recall there was so many of them just pouring outside it seemed like and they just grab their chests and fall like they slipped only they wouldnt get up afterward and never a word from any of them what did you think i didnt know what to think it was so damned peculiar i was scared i dont mind telling you but i tried to stay calm i couldnt naturally my old heart was thumping and i was wheezin and gaspin i was scared i thought everybody was dead then i heard the baby crying so i knew not everybody could be dead and then i saw the general the general oh we just called him that he wasnt no general just been in the war and liked to be remembered oldern me he is nice fella peter arnold steady as a rock all his life and hes standing by the porch all got up in his military clothes its dark but theres a moon and he sees me in the street and he says that you peter we both got the same name see and i says yes it is and he says what the hells happening japs coming in and i think thats a mighty peculiar thing for him to be saying and he says i think it must be the japs come to kill us all and i say peter you gone loco and he says he dont feel too good and he goes inside course he must have gone loco cause he shot himself but others went loco too it was the disease how do you know people dont burn themselves or drown themselves if they got sense do they all them in that town were good normal folks until that night then they just seemed to go crazy what did you do i thought to myself peter youre dreaming you had too much to drink so i went home and got into bed and figured id be better in the morning only about ten oclock i hear a noise and its a car so i go outside to see who it is its some kind of car you know one of those vans two fellers inside i go up to them and damn but they dont fall over dead scariest thing you ever saw but its funny whats funny that was the only other car to come through all night normally theres lots of cars there was another car yep willis the highway patrol he came through about fifteen thirty seconds before it all started didnt stop though sometimes he doesnt depends if hes late on his schedule hes got a regular patrol you know he has to stick to jackson sighed and let his head fall back against the pillow now he said if you dont mind im going to get me some sleep im all talked out he closed his eyes hall crawled back down the tunnel out of the unit and sat in the room looking through the glass at jackson and the baby in the crib alongside he stayed there just looking for a long time topeka the room was huge the size of a football field it was furnished sparsely just a few tables scattered about inside the room voices echoed as the technicians called to each other positioning the pieces of wreckage the post team was reconstructing the wreck in this room placing the clumps of twisted metal from the phantom in the same positions as they had been found on the sand only then would the intensive examination begin major manchek tired blearyeyed clutching his coffee cup stood in a corner and watched to him there was something surrealistic about the scene a dozen men in a long whitewashed room in topeka rebuilding a crash one of the biophysicists came up to him holding a clear plastic bag he waved the contents under mancheks nose just got it back from the lab he said what is it youll never guess the mans eyes gleamed in excitement all right manchek thought irritably ill never guess what is it a depolymerized polymer the biochemist said smacking his lips with satisfaction just back from the lab what kind of polymer a polymer was a repeating molecule built up from thousands of the same units like a stack of dominos most plastics nylon rayon plant cellulose and even glycogen in the human body were polymers a polymer of the plastic used on the air hose of the phantom jet the face mask to the pilot we thought as much manchek frowned he looked slowly at the crumbly black powder in the bag plastic yes a polymer depolymerized it was broken down now thats no vibration effect its a biochemical effect purely organic slowly manchek began to understand you mean something tore the plastic apart yes you could say that the biochemist replied its a simplification of course but what tore it apart the biochemist shrugged chemical reaction of some sort acid could do it or intense heat or or a microorganism i suppose if one existed that could eat plastic if you know what i mean i think manchek said that i know what you mean he left the room and went to the cable transmitter located in another part of the building he wrote out his message to the wildfire group and gave it to the technician to transmit while he waited he said has there been any reply yet reply sir the technician asked from wildfire manchek said it was incredible to him that no one had acted upon the news of the phantom crash it was so obviously linked wildfire sir the technician asked manchek rubbed his eyes he was tired he would have to remember to keep his big mouth shut forget it he said after his conversation with peter jackson hall went to see burton burton was in the autopsy room going over his slides from the day before hall said find anything burton stepped away from the microscope and sighed no nothing i keep wondering hall said about the insanity talking with jackson reminded me of it a large number of people in that town went insane or at least became bizarre and suicidal during the evening many of those people were old burton frowned so old people hall said are like jackson they have lots wrong with them their bodies are breaking down in a variety of ways the lungs are bad the hearts are bad the livers are shot the vessels are sclerotic and this alters the disease process perhaps i keep wondering what makes a person become rapidly insane burton shook his head and theres something else hall said jackson recalls hearing one victim say just before he died oh god my head burton stared away into space just before death just before youre thinking of hemorrhage hall nodded it makes sense he said at least to check if the andromeda strain produced hemorrhage inside the brain for any reason then it might produce rapid unusual mental aberrations but we already know the organism acts by clotting yes hall said in most people not all some survive and some go mad burton nodded he suddenly became excited suppose that the organism acted by causing damage to blood vessels this damage would initiate clotting anytime the wall of a blood vessel was torn or cut or burned then the clotting sequence would begin first platelets would clump around the injury protecting it preventing blood loss then red cells would accumulate then a fibrin mesh would bind all the elements together and finally the clot would become hard and firm that was the normal sequence but if the damage was extensive if it began at the lungs and worked its way im wondering hall said if our organism attacks vessel walls if so it would initiate clotting but if clotting were prevented in certain persons then the organism might eat away and cause hemorrhage in those persons and insanity burton said hunting through his slides he found three of the brain and checked them no question the pathology was striking within the internal layer of cerebral vessels were small deposits of green burton had no doubt that under higher magnification they would turn out to be hexagonal in shape quickly he checked the other slides for vessels in lung liver and spleen in several instances he found green spots in the vessel walls but never in the profusion he found for cerebral vessels obviously the andromeda strain showed a predilection for cerebral vasculature it was impossible to say why but it was known that the cerebral vessels are peculiar in several respects for instance under circumstances in which normal body vessels dilate or contract such as extreme cold or exercise the brain vasculature does not change but maintains a steady constant blood supply to the brain in exercise the blood supply to muscle might increase five to twenty times but the brain always has a steady flow whether its owner is taking an exam or a nap chopping wood or watching tv the brain receives the same amount of blood every minute hour day the scientists did not know why this should be or how precisely the cerebral vessels regulate themselves but the phenomenon is known to exist and cerebral vessels are regarded as a special case among the bodys arteries and veins clearly something is different about them and now there was an example of an organism that destroyed them preferentially but as burton thought about it the action of andromeda did not seem so unusual for example syphilis causes an inflammation of the aorta a very specific peculiar reaction schistosomiasis a parasitic infection shows a preference for bladder intestine or colonic vessels depending on the species so such specificity was not impossible but theres another problem he said in most people the organism begins clotting at the lungs we know that presumably vessel destruction begins there as well what is different about he stopped he remembered the rats he had anticoagulated the ones who had died anyway but had had no autopsies my god he said he drew out one of the rats from cold storage and cut it open it bled quickly he incised the head exposing the brain there he found a large hemorrhage over the gray surface of the brain youve got it hall said if the animal is normal it dies from coagulation beginning at the lungs but if coagulation is prevented then the organism erodes through the vessels of the brain and hemorrhage occurs and insanity yes burton was now very excited and coagulation could be prevented by any blood disorder or too little vitamin k malabsorption syndrome poor liver function impaired protein synthesis any of a dozen things all more likely to be found in an old person hall said did jackson have any of those things hall took a long time to answer then finally said no he has liver disease but not significantly burton sighed then were back where we started not quite because jackson and the baby both survived they didnt hemorrhage as far as we know they survived untouched completely untouched meaning meaning that they somehow prevented the primary process which is invasion of the organism into the vessel walls of the body the andromeda organism didnt get to the lungs or the brain it didnt get anywhere but why we know that hall said when we know why a sixtynineyearold sterno drinker with an ulcer is like a twomonthold baby they seem pretty much opposites burton said they do dont they hall said it would be hours before he realized burton had given him the answer to the puzzle but an answer that was worthless evaluation sir winston churchill once said that true genius resides in the capacity for evaluation of uncertain hazardous and conflicting information yet it is a peculiarity of the wildfire team that despite the individual brilliance of team members the group grossly misjudged their information at several points one is reminded of montaignes acerbic comment men under stress are fools and fool themselves certainly the wildfire team was under severe stress but they were also prepared to make mistakes they had even predicted that this would occur what they did not anticipate was the magnitude the staggering dimensions of their error they did not expect that their ultimate error would be a compound of a dozen small clues that were missed a handful of crucial facts that were dismissed the team had a blind spot which stone later expressed this way we were problemoriented everything we did and thought was directed toward finding a solution a cure to andromeda and of course we were fixed on the events that had occurred at piedmont we felt that if we did not find a solution no solution would be forthcoming and the whole world would ultimately wind up like piedmont we were very slow to think otherwise the error began to take on major proportions with the cultures stone and leavitt had taken thousands of cultures from the original capsule these had been incubated in a wide variety of atmospheric temperature and pressure conditions the results of this could only be analyzed by computer using the growthtransmatrix program the computer did not print out results from all possible growth combinations instead it printed out only significant positive and negative results it did this after first weighing each petri dish and examining any growth with its photoelectric eye when stone and leavitt went to examine the results they found several striking trends their first conclusion was that growth media did not matter at all the organism grew equally well on sugar blood chocolate plain agar or sheer glass however the gases in which the plates were incubated were crucial as was the light ultraviolet light stimulated growth under all circumstances total darkness and to a lesser extent infrared light inhibited growth oxygen inhibited growth in all circumstances but carbon dioxide stimulated growth nitrogen had no effect thus best growth was achieved in per cent carbon dioxide lighted by ultraviolet radiation poorest growth occurred in pure oxygen incubated in total darkness what do you make of it stone said it looks like a pure conversion system leavitt said i wonder stone said he punched through the coordinates of a closedgrowth system closedgrowth systems studied bacterial metabolism by measuring intake of gases and nutrients and output of waste products they were completely sealed and selfcontained a plant in such a system for example would consume carbon dioxide and give off water and oxygen graphic an example of a scanner printout from the photoelectric eye that examined all growth media within the circular petri dish the computer has noted the presence of two separate colonies the colonies are read in twomillimetersquare segments and graded by density on a scale from one to nine but when they looked at the andromeda strain they found something remarkable the organism had no excretions if incubated with carbon dioxide and ultraviolet light it grew steadily until all carbon dioxide had been consumed then growth stopped there was no excretion of any kind of gas or waste product at all no waste clearly efficient stone said youd expect that leavitt said this was an organism highly suited to its environment it consumed everything wasted nothing it was perfect for the barren existence of space he thought about this for a moment and then it hit him it hit leavitt at the same time oh my hell leavitt was already reaching for the phone get robertson he said get him immediately incredible stone said softly no waste it doesnt require growth media it can grow in the presence of carbon oxygen and sunlight period i hope were not too late leavitt said watching the computer console screen impatiently stone nodded if this organism is really converting matter to energy and energy to matter directly then its functioning like a little reactor and an atomic detonation incredible stone said just incredible the screen came to life they saw robertson looking tired smoking a cigarette jeremy youve got to give me time i havent been able to get through to listen stone said i want you to make sure directive is not carried out it is imperative no atomic device must be detonated around the organisms thats the last thing in the world literally that we want to do he explained briefly what he had found robertson whistled wed just provide a fantastically rich growth medium thats right stone said the problem of a rich growth medium was a peculiarly distressing one to the wildfire team it was known for example that checks and balances exist in the normal environment these manage to dampen the exuberant growth of bacteria the mathematics of uncontrolled growth are frightening a single cell of the bacterium e coli would under ideal circumstances divide every twenty minutes that is not particularly disturbing until you think about it but the fact is that bacteria multiply geometrically one becomes two two become four four become eight and so on in this way it can be shown that in a single day one cell of e coli could produce a supercolony equal in size and weight to the entire planet earth this never happens for a perfectly simple reason growth cannot continue indefinitely under ideal circumstances food runs out oxygen runs out local conditions within the colony change and check the growth of organisms on the other hand if you had an organism that was capable of directly converting energy to matter and if you provided it with a huge rich source of energy like an atomic blast ill pass along your recommendation to the president robertson said hell be pleased to know he made the right decision on the you can congratulate him on his scientific insight stone said for me robertson was scratching his head ive got some more data on the phantom crash it was over the area west of piedmont at twentythree thousand feet the post team has found evidence of the disintegration the pilot spoke of but the material that was destroyed was a plastic of some kind it was depolymerized what does the post team make of that they dont know what the hell to make of it robertson admitted and theres something else they found a few pieces of bone that have been identified as human a bit of humerus and tibia notable because they are clean almost polished flesh burned away doesnt look that way robertson said stone frowned at leavitt what does it look like it looks like clean polished bone robertson said they say its weird as hell and theres something else we checked into the national guard around piedmont the th is stationed in a hundredmile radius and it turns out theyve been running patrols into the area for a distance of fifty miles theyve had as many as one hundred men west of piedmont no deaths none youre quite sure absolutely were there men on the ground in the area the phantom flew over yes twelve men they reported the plane to the base in fact leavitt said sounds like the plane crash is a fluke stone nodded to robertson im inclined to agree with peter in the absence of fatalities on the ground maybe its only in the upper air maybe but we know at least this much we know how andromeda kills it does so by coagulation not disintegration or bonecleaning or any other damned thing by coagulation all right robertson said lets forget the plane for the time being it was on that note that the meeting ended stone said i think wed better check our cultured organisms for biologic potency run some of them against a rat stone nodded make sure its still virulent still the same leavitt agreed they had to be careful the organism didnt mutate didnt change to something radically different in its effects as they were about to start the level v monitor clicked on and said dr leavitt dr leavitt leavitt answered on the computer screen was a pleasant young man in a white lab coat yes dr leavitt we have gotten our electroencephalograms back from the computer center im sure its all a mistake but his voice trailed off yes leavitt said is something wrong well sir yours were read as grade four atypical probably benign but we would like to run another set stone said it must be a mistake yes leavitt said it must be undoubtedly sir the man said but we would like another set of waves to be certain im rather busy now leavitt said stone broke in talking directly to the technician dr leavitt will get a repeat eeg when he has the chance very good sir the technician said when the screen was blank stone said there are times when this damned routine gets on anybodys nerves leavitt said yes they were about to begin biologic testing of the various culture media when the computer flashed that preliminary reports from xray crystallography were prepared stone and leavitt left the room to check the results delaying the biologic tests of media this was a most unfortunate decision for had they examined the media they would have seen that their thinking had already gone astray and that they were on the wrong track willis xray crystallography analysis showed that the andromeda organism was not composed of component parts as a normal cell was composed of nucleus mitochondria and ribosomes andromeda had no subunits no smaller particules instead a single substance seemed to form the walls and interior this substance produced a characteristic precession photograph or scatter pattern of x rays looking at the results stone said a series of sixsided rings and nothing else leavitt said how the hell does it operate the two men were at a loss to explain how so simple an organism could utilize energy for growth a rather common ring structure leavitt said a phenolic group nothing more it should be reasonably inert yet it can convert energy to matter leavitt scratched his head he thought back to the city analogy and the braincell analogy the molecule was simple in its building blocks it possessed no remarkable powers taken as single units yet collectively it had great powers perhaps there is a critical level he suggested a structural complexity that makes possible what is not possible in a similar but simple structure the old chimpbrain argument stone said graphic caption electrondensity mapping of andromeda structure as derived from micrographic studies it was this mapping which disclosed activity variations within an otherwise uniform structure photo courtesy project wildfire leavitt nodded as nearly as anyone could determine the chimp brain was as complex as the human brain there were minor differences in structure but the major difference was size the human brain was larger with more cells more interconnections and that in some subtle way made the human brain different thomas waldren the neurophysiologist once jokingly noted that the major difference between the chimp and human brain was that we can use the chimp as an experimental animal and not the reverse stone and leavitt puzzled over the problem for several minutes until they came to the fourier electrondensity scans here the probability of finding electrons was mapped for the structure on a chart that resembled a topological map they noticed something odd the structure was present but the fourier mapping was inconstant it almost looks stone said as if part of the structure is switched off in some way its not uniform after all leavitt said stone sighed looking at the map i wish to hell he said that wed brought a physical chemist along on the team unspoken was the added comment instead of hall tired hall rubbed his eyes and sipped the coffee wishing he could have sugar he was alone in the cafeteria which was silent except for the muted ticking of the teleprinter in the corner after a time he got up and went over to the teleprinter examining the rolls of paper that had come from it most of the information was meaningless to him but then he saw one item which had come from the deathmatch program deathmatch was a newsscanning computer program that recorded all significant deaths according to whatever criterion the computer was fed in this case the computer was alerted to pick up all deaths in the arizonanevadacalifornia area and to print them back the item he read might have gone unnoticed were it not for halls conversation with jackson at the time it had seemed like a pointless conversation to hall productive of little and consuming a great deal of time but now he wondered print program deathwatch deathmatch scale yo x print as item from associated press verbatim brush ridge ariz an arizona highway patrol officer was allegedly involved in the death today of five persons in a highway diner miss sally conover waitress at the dineeze diner on route ten miles south of flagstaff was the sole survivor of the incident miss conover told investigators that at am officer martin willis entered the diner and ordered coffee and donut officer willis had frequently visited the diner in the past after eating he stated that he had a severe headache and that his ulcer was acting up miss conover gave him two aspirin and a tablespoon of bicarbonate of soda according to her statement officer willis then looked suspiciously at the other people in the diner and whispered theyre after me before the waitress could reply willis took out his revolver and shot the other customers in the diner moving methodically from one to the next shooting each in the forehead then he allegedly turned to miss conover and smiling said i love you shirley temple placed the barrel in his mouth and fired the last bullet miss conover was released by police after questioning the names of the deceased customers are not known at this time end item verbatim end print end program terminate hall remembered that officer willis had gone through piedmont earlier in the evening just a few minutes before the disease broke out he had gone through without stopping and had gone mad later on connection he wondered there might be certainly he could see many similarities willis had an ulcer had taken aspirin and had eventually committed suicide that didnt prove anything of course it might be a wholly unrelated series of events but it was certainly worth checking he punched a button on the computer console the tv screen lighted and a girl at a switchboard with a headset pressing down her hair smiled at him i want the chief medical officer for the arizona highway patrol the western sector if there is one yes sir she said briskly a few moments later the screen came back on it was the operator we have a dr smithson who is the medical officer for the arizona highway patrol west of flagstaff he has no television monitor but you can speak to him on audio fine hall said there was a crackling and a mechanical hum hall watched the screen but the girl had shut down her own audio and was busy answering another call from elsewhere in the wildfire station while he watched her he heard a deep drawling voice ask tentatively anyone there hello doctor hall said this is dr mark hall inphoenix im calling for some information about one of your patrolmen officer willis the girl said it was some government thing smithson drawled that right that is correct we require dr hall smithson said still drawling perhaps youd identify yourself and your agency it occurred to hall that there was probably a legal problem involved in officer willis death smithson might be worried about that hall said i am not at liberty to tell you exactly what it is well look here doctor i dont give out information over the phone and especially i dont when the feller at the other end wont tell me what its all about hall took a deep breath dr smithson i must ask you ask all you want im sorry i simply wont at that moment a bell sounded on the line and a flat mechanical voice said attention please this is a recording computer monitors have analyzed cable properties of this communication and have determined that the communication is being recorded by the outside party all parties should be informed that the penalty for outside recording of a classified government communication is a minimum of five years prison sentence if the recording is continued this connection will automatically be broken this is a recording thank you there was a long silence hall could imagine the surprise smithson was feeling he felt it himself what the hell kind of a place are you calling from anyhow smithson said finally turn it off hall said there was a pause a click then all right its off i am calling from a classified government installation hall said well look here mister let me be perfectly plain hall said this is a matter of considerable importance and it concerns officer willis no doubt theres a court inquiry pending on him and no doubt youll be involved we may be able to demonstrate that officer willis was not responsible for his actions that he was suffering from a purely medical problem but we cant do that unless you tell us what you know about his medical status and if you dont tell us dr smithson and tell us damned fast we can have you locked away for twelve years for obstructing an official government inquiry i dont care whether you believe that or not im telling you and youd better believe it there was a very long pause and finally the drawl no need to get excited doctor naturally now that i understand the situation did willis have an ulcer ulcer no that was just what he said or was reported to have said he never had an ulcer that i know of did he have any medical problem diabetes smithson said diabetes yeah and he was pretty casual about it we diagnosed him five six years ago at the age of thirty had a pretty severe case we put him on insulin fifty units a day but he was casual like i said showed up in the hospital once or twice in coma because he wouldnt take his insulin said he hated the needles we almost put him off the force because we were afraid to let him drive a car thought hed go into acidosis at the wheel and conk out we scared him plenty and he promised to go straight that was three years ago and as far as i know he took his insulin regularly from then on youre sure of that well i think so but the waitress at that restaurant sally conover told one of our investigators that she figured willis had been drinking because she could smell liquor on his breath and i know for a fact that willis never touched a drop in his life he was one of these real religious fellows never smoked and never drank always led a clean life that was why his diabetes bothered him so he felt he didnt deserve it hall relaxed in his chair he was getting near now coming closer the answer was within reach the final answer the key to it all one last question hall said did willis go through piedmont on the night of his death yes he radioed in he was a little behind schedule but he passed through why is it something about the government tests being held there no hall said but he was sure smithson didnt believe him well listen were stuck here with a bad case and if you have any information which would we will be in touch hall promised him and clicked off the girl at the switchboard came back on is your call completed dr hall yes but i need information what kind of information i want to know if i have the authority to arrest someone i will check sir what is the charge no charge just to hold someone there was a moment while she looked over at her computer console dr hall you may authorize an official army interview with anyone involved in project business this interview may last up to fortyeight hours all right hall said arrange it yes sir who is the person dr smithson hall said the girl nodded and the screen went blank hall felt sorry for smithson but not very sorry the man would have a few hours of sweating but nothing more serious than that and it was essential to halt rumors about piedmont he sat back in his chair and thought about what he had learned he was excited and felt on the verge of an important discovery three people a diabetic in acidosis from failure to take insulin an old man who drank sterno and took aspirin also in acidosis a young infant one had survived for hours the other two had survived longer apparently permanently one had gone mad the other two had not somehow they were all interrelated in a very simple way acidosis rapid breathing carbondioxide content oxygen saturation dizziness fatigue somehow they were all logically coordinated and they held the key to beating andromeda at that moment the emergency bell sounded ringing in a high pitched urgent way as the brightyellow light began to flash he jumped up and left the room the seal in the corridor he saw the flashing sign that indicated the source of the trouble autopsy hall could guess the problem somehow the seals had been broken and contamination had occurred that would sound the alarm as he ran down the corridor a quiet soothing voice on the loudspeakers said seal has been broken in autopsy seal has been broken in autopsy this is an emergency his lab technician came out of the lab and saw him what is it burton i think infection spread is he all right doubt it hall said running she ran with him leavitt came out of the morphology room and joined them sprinting down the corridor around the gentle curves hall thought to himself that leavitt was moving quite well for an older man when suddenly leavitt stopped he stood riveted to the ground and stared straight forward at the flashing sign and the light above it blinking on and off hall looked back come on he said then the technician dr hall hes in trouble leavitt was not moving he stood eyes open but otherwise he might have been asleep his arms hung loosely at his sides dr hall hall stopped and went back peter boy come on we need your he said nothing more for leavitt was not listening he was staring straight forward at the blinking light when hall passed his hand in front of his face he did not react and then hall remembered the other blinking lights the lights leavitt had turned away from had joked off with stories the son of a bitch hall said now of all times what is it the technician said a small dribble of spittle was coming from the corner of leavitts mouth hall quickly stepped behind him and said to the technician get in front of him and cover his eyes dont let him look at the blinking light why because its blinking three times a second hall said you mean hell go any minute now leavitt went with frightening speed his knees gave way and he collapsed to the floor he lay on his back and his whole body began to vibrate it began with his hands and feet then involved his entire arms and legs and finally his whole body he clenched his teeth and gave a gasping loud cry his head hammered against the floor hall slipped his foot beneath the back of leavitts head and let him bang against his toes it was better than having him hit the hard floor dont try to open his mouth hall said you cant do it hes clenched tight as they watched a yellow stain began to spread at leavitts waist he may go into status hall said go to the pharmacy and get me a hundred milligrams of phenobarb now in a syringe well get him onto dilantin later if we have to leavitt was crying through his clenched teeth like an animal his body tapped like a tense rod against the floor a few moments later the technician came back with the syringe hall waited until leavitt relaxed until his body stopped its seizures and then he injected the barbiturate stay with him he said to the girl if he has another seizure just do what i did put your foot under his head i think hell be all right dont try to move him and hall ran down to the autopsy lab for several seconds he tried to open the door to the lab and then he realized it had been sealed off the lab was contaminated he went on to main control and found stone looking at burton through the closedcircuit tv monitors burton was terrified his face was white and he was breathing in rapid shallow gasps and he could not speak he looked exactly like what he was a man waiting for death to strike him stone was trying to reassure him just take it easy boy take it easy youll be okay just take it easy im scared burton said damn im scared just take it easy stone said in a soft voice we know that andromeda doesnt do well in oxygen were pumping pure oxygen through your lab now for the moment that should hold you stone turned to hall you took your time getting here wheres leavitt he fitted hall said what your lights flash at three per second and he had a seizure what petit mal it went on to a grandmal attack tonic clonic seizure urinary incontinence the whole bit i got him onto phenobarb and came as soon as i could leavitt has epilepsy thats right stone said he must not have known he must not have realized and then stone remembered the request for a repeat electroencephalogram oh hall said he knew all right he was avoiding flashing lights which will bring on an attack im sure he knew im sure he has attacks where he suddenly doesnt know what happened to him where he just loses a few minutes from his life and cant remember what went on is he all right well keep him sedated stone said weve got pure oxygen running into burton that should help him until we know something more stone flicked off the microphone button connecting voice transmission to burton actually it will take several minutes to hook in but ive told him weve already started hes sealed off in there so the infection is stopped at that point the rest of the base is okay at least hall said how did it happen the contamination seal must have broken stone said in a lower voice he added we knew it would sooner or later all isolation units break down after a certain time hall said you think it was just a random event yes stone said just an accident so many seals so much rubber of suchandsuch a thickness theyd all break given time burton happened to be there when one went hall didnt see it so simply he looked in at burton who was breathing rapidly his chest heaving in terror hall said how long has it been stone looked up at the stopclocks the stopclocks were special timing clocks that automatically cut in during emergencies the stopclocks were now timing the period since the seal broke four minutes hall said burtons still alive yes thank god and then stone frowned he realized the point why hall said is he still alive the oxygen you said yourself the oxygen isnt running yet whats protecting burton at that moment burton said over the intercom listen i want you to try something for me stone flicked on the microphone what kalocin burton said no stones reaction was immediate dammit its my life no stone said hall said maybe we should try absolutely not we dont dare not even once kalocin was perhaps the bestkept american secret of the last decade kalocin was a drug developed by jensen pharmaceuticals in the spring of an experimental chemical designated ujw or k in the short abbreviation it had been found as a result of routine screening tests employed by jensen for all new compounds like most pharmaceutical companies jensen tested all new drugs with a scatter approach running the compounds through a standard battery of tests designed to pick up any significant biologic activity these tests were run on laboratory animals rats dogs and monkeys there were twentyfour tests in all jensen found something rather peculiar about k it inhibited growth an infant animal given the drug never attained full adult size this discovery prompted further tests which produced even more intriguing results the drug jensen learned inhibited metaplasia the shift of normal body cells to a new and bizarre form a precursor to cancer jensen became excited and put the drug through intensive programs of study by september there could be no doubt kalocin stopped cancer through an unknown mechanism it inhibited the reproduction of the virus responsible for myelogenous leukemia animals taking the drug did not develop the disease and animals already demonstrating the disease showed a marked regression as a result of the drug the excitement at jensen could not be contained it was soon recognized that the drug was a broadspectrum antiviral agent it killed the virus of polio rabies leukemia and the common wart and oddly enough kalocin also killed bacteria and fungi and parasites somehow the drug acted to destroy all organisms built on a unicellular structure or less it had no effect on organ systems groups of cells organized into larger units the drug was perfectly selective in this respect in fact kalocin was the universal antibiotic it killed everything even the minor germs that caused the common cold naturally there were side effects the normal bacteria in the intestines were destroyed so that all users of the drug experienced massive diarrhea but that seemed a small price to pay for a cancer cure in december knowledge of the drug was privately circulated among government agencies and important health officials and then for the first time opposition to the drug arose many men including jeremy stone argued that the drug should be suppressed but the arguments for suppression seemed theoretical and jensen sensing billions of dollars at hand fought hard for a clinical test eventually the government the hew the fda and others agreed with jensen and sanctioned further clinical testing over the protests of stone and others in february a pilot clinical trial was undertaken it involved twenty patients with incurable cancer and twenty normal volunteers from the alabama state penitentiary all forty subjects took the drug daily for one month results were as expected normal subjects experienced unpleasant side effects but nothing serious cancer patients showed striking remission of symptoms consistent with cure on march the forty men were taken off the drug within six hours they were all dead it was what stone had predicted from the start he had pointed out that mankind had over centuries of exposure developed a carefully regulated immunity to most organisms on his skin in the air in his lungs gut and even bloodstream were hundreds of different viruses and bacteria they were potentially deadly but man had adapted to them over the years and only a few could still cause disease all this represented a carefully balanced state of affairs if you introduced a new drug that killed all bacteria you upset the balance and undid the evolutionary work of centuries and you opened the way to superinfection the problem of new organisms bearing new diseases stone was right the forty volunteers each had died of obscure and horrible diseases no one had ever seen before one man experienced swelling of his body from head to foot a hot bloated swelling until he suffocated from pulmonary edema another man fell prey to an organism that ate away his stomach in a matter of hours a third was hit by a virus that dissolved his brain to a jelly and so it went jensen reluctantly took the drug out of further study the government sensing that stone had somehow understood what was happening agreed to his earlier proposals and viciously suppressed all knowledge and experimentation with the drug kalocin and that was where the matter had rested for two years now burton wanted to be given the drug no stone said not a chance it might cure you for a while but youd never survive later when you were taken off thats easy for you to say from where you are its not easy for me to say believe me its not he put his hand over the microphone again to hall we know that oxygen inhibits growth of the andromeda strain thats what well give burton it will be good for him make him a little giddy a little relaxed and slow his breathing down poor fellow is scared to death hall nodded somehow stones phrase stuck in his mind scared to death he thought about it and then began to see that stone had hit upon something important that phrase was a clue it was the answer he started to walk away where are you going ive got some thinking to do about what about being scared to death scared to death hall walked back to his lab and stared through the glass at the old man and the infant he looked at the two of them and tried to think but his brain was running in frantic circles he found it difficult to think logically and his earlier sensation of being on the verge of a discovery was lost for several minutes he stared at the old man while brief images passed before him burton dying his hand clutched to his chest los angeles in panic bodies everywhere cars going haywire out of control it was then that he realized that he too was scared scared to death the words came back to him scared to death somehow that was the answer slowly forcing his brain to be methodical he went over it again a cop with diabetes a cop who didnt take his insulin and had a habit of going into ketoacidosis an old man who drank sterno which gave him methanolism and acidosis a baby who did what what gave him acidosis hall shook his head always he came back to the baby who was normal not acidotic he sighed take it from the beginning he told himself be logical if a man has metabolic acidosis any kind of acidosis what does he do he has too much acid in his body he can die from too much acid just as if he had injected hydrochloric acid into his veins too much acid meant death but the body could compensate by breathing rapidly because in that manner the lungs blew off carbon dioxide and the bodys supply of carbonic acid which was what carbon dioxide formed in the blood decreased a way to get rid of acid rapid breathing and andromeda what happened to the organism when you were acidotic and breathing fast perhaps fast breathing kept the organism from getting into your lungs long enough to penetrate to blood vessels maybe that was the answer but as soon as he thought of it he shook his head no something else some simple direct fact something they had always known but somehow never recognized the organism attacked through the lungs it entered the bloodstream it localized in the walls of arteries and veins particularly of the brain it produced damage this led to coagulation which was dispersed throughout the body or else led to bleeding insanity and death but in order to produce such rapid severe damage it would take many organisms millions upon millions collecting in the arteries and veins probably you did not breathe in so many so they must multiply in the bloodstream at a great rate a fantastic rate and if you were acidotic did that halt multiplication perhaps again he shook his head because a person with acidosis like willis or jackson was one thing but what about the baby the baby was normal if it breathed rapidly it would become alkaloticbasic too little acid not acidotic the baby would go to the opposite extreme hall looked through the glass and as he did the baby awoke almost immediately it began to scream its face turning purple the little eyes wrinkling the mouth toothless and smoothgummed shrieking scared to death and then the birds with the fast metabolic rate the fast heart rates the fast breathing rates the birds who did everything fast they too survived breathing fast was it as simple as that he shook his head it couldnt be he sat down and rubbed his eyes he had a headache and he felt tired he kept thinking of burton who might die at any minute burton sitting there in the sealed room hall felt the tension was unbearable he suddenly felt an overwhelming urge to escape it to get away from everything the tv screen clicked on his technician appeared and said dr hall we have dr leavitt in the infirmary and hall found himself saying ill be right there he knew he was acting strangely there was no reason to see leavitt leavitt was all right perfectly fine in no danger in going to see him hall knew that he was trying to forget the other more immediate problems as he entered the infirmary he felt guilty his technician said hes sleeping postictal hall said persons after a seizure usually slept shall we start dilantin no wait and see perhaps we can hold him on phenobarb he began a slow and meticulous examination of leavitt his technician watched him and said youre tired yes said hall its past my bedtime on a normal day he would now be driving home on the expressway so would leavitt going home to his family in pacific palisades the santa monica expressway he saw it vividly for a moment the long lines of cars creeping slowly forward and the signs by the side of the road speed limit maximum minimum they always seemed like a cruel joke at rush hour maximum and minimum cars that drove slowly were a menace you had to keep traffic moving at a fairly constant rate little difference between the fastest and the slowest and you had to he stopped ive been an idiot he said and he turned to the computer in later weeks hall referred to it as his highway diagnosis the principle of it was so simple so clear and obvious he was surprised none of them had thought of it before he was excited as he punched in instructions for the growth program into the computer he had to punch in the directions three times his fingers kept making mistakes at last the program was set on the display screen he saw what he wanted growth of andromeda as a function of ph of acidityalkalinity the results were quite clear graphic colony growth versus ph bell shaped curve centered at ph and dying at the andromeda strain grew within a narrow range if the medium for growth was too acid the organism would not multiply if it was too basic it would not multiply only within the range of ph to would it grow well he stared at the graph for a moment then ran for the door on his way out he grinned at his assistant and said its all over our troubles are finished he could not have been more wrong the test in the main control room stone was watching the television screen that showed burton in the sealed lab the oxygens going in stone said stop it hall said what stop it now put him on room air hall was looking at burton on the screen it was clear that the oxygen was beginning to affect him he was no longer breathing so rapidly his chest moved slowly he picked up the microphone burton he said this is hall ive got the answer the andromeda strain grows within a narrow range of ph do you understand a very narrow range if youre either acidotic or alkalotic youll be all right i want you to go into respiratory alkalosis i want you to breathe as fast as you can burton said but this is pure oxygen ill hyperventilate and pass out im a little dizzy now no were switching back to air now start breathing as fast as you can hall turned back to stone give him a higher carbon dioxide atmosphere but the organism flourishes in carbon dioxide i know but not at an unfavorable ph of the blood you see thats the problem air doesnt matter but blood does we have to establish an unfavorable acid balance for burtons blood stone suddenly understood the child he said it screamed yes and the old fellow with the aspirin hyperventilated yes and drank sterno besides and both of them shot their acidbase balance to hell stone said yes hall said my trouble was i was hung up on the acidosis i didnt understand how the baby could become acidotic the answer of course was that it didnt it became basic too little acid but that was all right you could go either way too much acid or too little as long as you got out of the growth range of andromeda he turned back to burton all right now he said keep breathing rapidly dont stop keep your lungs going and blow off your carbon dioxide how do you feel okay burton panted scaredbutokay good listen stone said we cant keep burton that way forever sooner or later yes hall said well alkalinize his blood to burton look around the lab do you see anything we could use to raise your blood ph burton looked no not really bicarbonate of soda ascorbic acid vinegar burton searched frantically among the bottles and reagents on the lab shelf and finally shook his head nothing here that will work hall hardly heard him he had been counting burtons respirations they were up to thirtyfive a minute deep and full that would hold him for a time but sooner or later he would become exhausted breathing was hard work or pass out he looked around the lab from his vantage point and it was while doing this that he noticed the rat a black norway sitting calmly in its cage in a corner of the room watching burton he stopped that rat it was breathing slowly and easily stone saw the rat and said what the hell and then as they watched the lights began to flash again and the computer console blinked on early degenerative change in gasket v damn stone said where does that gasket lead its one of the core gaskets it connects all the labs the main seal is the computer came back on degenerative change in gaskets a v n they looked at the screen in astonishment something is wrong stone said very wrong in rapid succession the computer flashed the number of nine more gaskets that were breaking down i dont understand and then hall said the child of course the child and that damned airplane it all fits what are you talking about stone said the child was normal hall said it could cry and disrupt its acidbase balance well and good that would prevent the andromeda strain from getting into its bloodstream and multiplying and killing it yes yes stone said youve told me all that but what happens when the child stops crying stone stared at him he said nothing i mean hall said that sooner or later that kid had to stop crying it couldnt cry forever sooner or later it would stop and its acidbase balance would return to normal then it would be vulnerable to andromeda true but it didnt die perhaps some rapid form of immunity no impossible there are only two explanations when the child stopped crying either the organism was no longer therehad been blown away cleared from the airor else the organism changed stone said mutated yes mutated to a noninfectious form and perhaps it is still mutating now it is no longer directly harmful to man but it eats rubber gaskets the airplane hall nodded national guardsmen could be on the ground and not be harmed but the pilot had his aircraft destroyed because the plastic was dissolved before his eyes so burton is now exposed to a harmless organism thats why the rat is alive thats why burton is alive hall said the rapid breathing isnt necessary hes only alive because andromeda changed it may change again stone said and if most mutations occur at times of multiplication when the organism is growing most rapidly the sirens went off and the computer flashed a message in red gasket integrity zero level v contaminated and sealed stone turned to hall quick he said get out of here theres no substation in this lab you have to go to the next sector for a moment hall did not understand he continued to sit in his seat and then when the realization hit him he scrambled for the door and hurried outside to the corridor as he did so he heard a hissing sound and a thump as a massive steel plate slid out from a wall and closed off the corridor stone saw it and swore that does it he said were trapped here and if that bomb goes off itll spread the organism all over the surface there will be a thousand mutations each killing in a different way well never be rid of it over the loudspeaker a flat mechanical voice was saying the level is closed the level is closed this is an emergency the level is closed there was a moment of silence and then a scratching sound as a new recording came on and miss gladys stevens of omaha nebraska said quietly there are now three minutes to atomic selfdestruct three minutes a new rising and falling siren came on and all the clocks snapped their hands back to hours and the second hands began to sweep out the time the stopclocks all glowed red with a green line on the dial to indicate when detonation would occur and the mechanical voice repeated calmly there are now three minutes to selfdestruct automatic stone said quietly the system cuts in when the level is contaminated we cant let it happen hall was holding the key in his hand theres no way to get to a substation not on this level each sector is sealed from every other but there are substations on the other levels yes how do i get up you cant all the conventional routes are sealed what about the central core the central core communicated with all levels stone shrugged the safeguards hall remembered talking to burton earlier about the centralcore safeguards in theory once inside the central core you could go straight to the top but in practice them were ligamine sensors located around the core to prevent this originally intended to prevent escape of lab animals that might break free into the core the sensors released ligamine a curare derivative that was watersoluble in the form of a gas there were also automatic guns that fired ligamine darts the mechanical voice said there are now two minutes fortyfive seconds to selfdestruct hall was already moving back into the lab and staring through the glass into the inner work area beyond that was the central core hall said what are my chances they dont exist stone explained hall bent over and crawled through a tunnel into a plastic suit he waited until it had sealed behind him and then he picked up a knife and cut away the tunnel like a tail he breathed in the air of the lab which was cool and fresh and laced with andromeda organisms nothing happened back in the lab stone watched him through the glass hall saw his lips move but heard nothing then a moment later the speakers cut in and he heard stone say best that we could devise what was the defense system thanks very much hall said moving toward the rubber gasket it was circular and rather small leading into the central core theres only one chance stone said the doses are low theyre calculated for a tenkilogram animal like a large monkey and you weigh seventy kilograms or so you can stand a fairly heavy dose before before i stop breathing hall said the victims of curare suffocate to death their chest muscles and diaphragms paralyzed hall was certain it was an unpleasant way to die wish me luck he said there are now two minutes thirty seconds to selfdestruct gladys stevens said hall slammed the gasket with his fist and it crumbled in a dusty cloud he moved out into the central core it was silent he was away from the sirens and flashing lights of the level and into a cold metallic echoing space the central core was perhaps thirty feet wide painted a utilitarian gray the core itself a cylindrical shaft of cables and machinery lay before him on the walls he could see the rungs of a ladder leading upward to level iv i have you on the tv monitor stones voice said start up the ladder the gas will begin any moment a new recorded voice broke in the central core has been contaminated it said authorized maintenance personnel are advised to clear the area immediately go stone said hall climbed as he went up the circular wall he looked back and saw pale clouds of white smoke blanketing the floor thats the gas stone said keep going hall climbed quickly hand over hand moving up the rungs he was breathing hard partly from the exertion partly from emotion the sensors have you stone said his voice was dull stone was sitting in the level v laboratory watching on the consoles as the computer electric eyes picked up hall and outlined his body moving up the wall to stone he seemed painfully vulnerable stone glanced over at a third screen which showed the ligamine ejectors pivoting on their wall brackets the slim barrels coming around to take aim go on the screen halls body was outlined in red on a vivid green background as stone watched a crosshair was superimposed over the body centering on the neck the computer was programmed to choose a region of high blood flow for most animals the neck was better than the back hall climbing up the core wall was aware only of the distance and his fatigue he felt strangely and totally exhausted as if he had been climbing for hours then he realized that the gas was beginning to affect him the sensors have picked you up stone said but you have only ten more yards hall glanced back and saw one of the sensor units it was aimed directly at him as he watched it fired a small puff of bluish smoke spurting from the barrel there was a whistling sound and then something struck the wall next to him and fell to the ground missed that time keep going another dart slammed into the wall near his neck he tried to hurry tried to move faster above he could see the door with the plain white markings level iv stone was right less than ten yards to go a third dart and then a fourth he still was untouched for an ironic moment he felt irritation the damned computers werent worth anything they couldnt even hit a simple target the next dart caught him in the shoulder stinging as it entered his flesh and then there was a second wave of burning pain as the liquid was injected hall swore stone watched it all on the monitor the screen blandly recorded strike and then proceeded to rerun a tape of the sequence showing the dart moving through the air and hitting halls shoulder it showed it three times in succession the voice said there are now two minutes to selfdestruct its a low dose stone said to hall keep going hall continued to climb he felt sluggish like a fourhundred pound man but he continued to climb he reached the next door just as a dart slammed into the wall near his cheekbone nasty go go the door had a seal and handle he tugged at the handle while still another dart struck the wall thats it thats it youre going to make it stone said there are now ninety seconds to selfdestruct the voice said the handle spun with a hiss of air the door came open he moved into an inner chamber just as a dart struck his leg with a brief searing wave of heat and suddenly instantly he was a thousand pounds heavier he moved in slow motion as he reached for the door and pulled it shut behind him youre in an airlock stone said turn the next door handle hall moved toward the inner door it was several miles away an infinite trip a distance beyond hope his feet were encased in lead his legs were granite he felt sleepy and achingly tired as he took one step and then another and another there are now sixty seconds to selfdestruct time was passing swiftly he could not understand it everything was so fast and he was so slow the handle he closed his fingers around it as if in a dream he turned the handle fight the drug you can do it stone said what happened next was difficult to recall he saw the handle turn and the door open he was dimly aware of a girl a technician standing in the hallway as he staggered through she watched him with frightened eyes as he took a single clumsy step forward help me he said she hesitated her eyes got wider and then she ran down the corridor away from him he watched her stupidly and fell to the ground the substation was only a few feet away a glittering polished metal plate on the wall fortyfive seconds to selfdestruct the voice said and then he was angry because the voice was female and seductive and recorded because someone had planned it this way had written out a series of inexorable statements like a script which was now being followed by the computers together with all the polished perfect machinery of the laboratory it was as if this was his fate planned from the beginning and he was angry later hall could not remember how he managed to crawl the final distance nor could he remember how he was able to get to his knees and reach up with the key he did remember twisting it in the lock and watching as the green light came on again selfdestruct has been canceled the voice announced as if it were quite normal hall slid to the floor heavy exhausted and watched as blackness closed in around him day resolution the last day avoice from very far away said hes fighting it is he yes look and then a moment later hall coughed as something was pulled from his throat and he coughed again gasped for air and opened his eyes a concerned female face looked down at him you okay it wears off quickly hall tried to answer her but could not he lay very still on his back and felt himself breathe it was a little stiff at first but soon became much easier his ribs going in and out without effort he turned his head and said how long about forty seconds the girl said as nearly as we can figure forty seconds without breathing you were a little blue when we found you but we got you intubated right away and onto a respirator when was that twelve fifteen minutes ago ligamine is shortacting but even so we were worried about you how are you feeling okay he looked around the room he was in the infirmary on level iv on the far wall was a television monitor which showed stones face hello hall said stone grinned congratulations i take it the bomb didnt the bomb didnt stone said thats good hall said and closed his eyes he slept for more than an hour and when he awoke the television screen was blank a nurse told him that dr stone was talking to vandenburg whats happening according to predictions the organism is over los angeles now and the nurse shrugged nothing it seems to have no effect at all none whatsoever stone said much later it has apparently mutated to a benign form were still waiting for a bizarre report of death or disease but its been six hours now and it gets less likely with every minute we suspect that ultimately it will migrate back out of the atmosphere since theres too much oxygen down here but of course if the bomb had gone off in wildfire hall said how much time was left when you turned the key about thirtyfour seconds hall smiled plenty of time hardly even exciting perhaps from where you were stone said but down on level v it was very exciting indeed i neglected to tell you that in order to improve the subterranean detonation characteristics of the atomic device all air is evacuated from level v beginning thirty seconds before explosion oh hall said but things are now under control stone said we have the organism and can continue to study it weve already begun to characterize a variety of mutant forms its a rather astonishing organism in its versatility he smiled i think we can be fairly confident that the organism will move into the upper atmosphere without causing further difficulty on the surface so theres no problem there and as for us down here we understand whats happening now in terms of the mutations thats the important thing that we understand understand hall repeated yes stone said we have to understand epilogue officially the loss of andros v the manned spacecraft that burned up as it reentered the atmosphere was explained on the basis of mechanical failure the tungstenandplasticlaminate heat shield was said to have eroded away under the thermal stress of returning to the atmosphere and an investigation was ordered by nasa into production methods for the heat shield in congress and in the press there was clamor for safer spacecraft as a result of governmental and public pressure nasa elected to postpone future manned flights for an indefinite period this decision was announced by jack marriott the voice of andros in a press conference at the manned spaceflight center in houston a partial transcript of the conference follows q jack when does this postponement go into effect a immediately right as i talk to you we are shutting down q how long do you anticipate this delay will last a im afraid thats impossible to say q could it be a matter of months a it could q jack could it be as long as a year a its just impossible for me to say we must wait for the findings of the investigative committee q does this postponement have anything to do with the russian decision to curtail their space program after the crash of zond a youd have to ask the russians about that q i see that jeremy stone is on the list of the investigative committee how did you happen to include a bacteriologist a professor stone has served on many scientific advisory councils in the past we value his opinion on a broad range of subjects q what will this delay do to the marslanding target date a it will certainly set the scheduling back q jack how far a ill tell you frankly its something that all of us here would like to know we regard the failure of andros v as a scientific error a breakdown in systems technology and not as a specifically human error the scientists are going over the problem now and well have to wait for their findings the decision is really out of our hands q jack would you repeat that a the decision is out of our hands
