harry turtledove united states of atlantis chapter victor radcliff didnt like to go into hanover or new hastings or any of atlantis other seaboard towns too many people crowded too close together to suit him in places like that he lived on a farm well to the west more than halfway out to the green ridge mountains whenever he foundor madethe chance he ranged farther afield yet but towns were sometimes useful he had a manuscript to deliver to a printer in hanover unless he cared to buy a printing press himself which he didnt or to stop writing which he also didnt he needed to deal with the men who could turn his scribble into words someone besides himself and the compositor could understand his wife kissed him when he left come home as soon as you can margaret said ill miss you what might have been lay not far below the surface of her voice theyd had two boys and a girl none of the children saw its third birthday without victor meg had a lonely time of it adam would have been fourteen now ill miss you too victor meant it which didnt keep him from plunging into the trackless swamps and forests of western atlantis as often as he could a lot of edward radcliffes descendantsthose who still kept the e on the end of their surnames and those who didntstill had the restless spirit that came down from the discoverer no doubt edward had it for without it he never would have started the english settlement in atlantis on sea and land his descendants through his sonsand others through his daughters who didnt wear the family name any morehad kept it through more than three centuries now give my regards to all the cousins you see meg said therell be a swarm of them victor replied radcliffs and radcliffes had thrived here as they never would have in england without a doubt old edward had known what he was doing when he decided this was a better land than the one hed left behind englishmen thought of atlanteans as colonials and looked down their noses at them atlanteans thought of englishmen as straitjacketed on their little island and felt sorry for them someone knocked on the front door that will be blaise margaret said not likely to be anyone else victor agreed he opened the door it was blaise you are ready the negro asked his english flavored both by the french hed learned as a slave farther south and by the tongue hed grown up speaking in africa he and victor and two copperskins from terranova had escaped french atlantis together victor didnt know what had become of the men from the west blaise had stuck with him the black man had been his sergeant during the war against france and spain and his factotum ever since im ready victor said lets go then it will be good to get away blaise had two boys and two girls he and his wife had buried only one baby with the genial chaos in his household he probably meant what he said he made sure this trip wouldnt be for nothing you have the manuscript put it in my saddle bag half an hour ago victor replied i wont be the kind of author they make jokes aboutnot that kind of joke anyhow good blaise lifted his plain tricorn hat from his head for a moment ill bring him back safe mrs radcliff i know you will meg smiled i dont think id let him go if you werent along im not an infant meg i have been known to take care of myself victor said a touch of asperity in his voice i know dear but blaise does it better no one could deflate you the way a wife could victor left with such dignity as he could muster he swung up onto his horse a sturdy chestnut gelding blaise rode a bay mare stallions had more fire they also had more temper victor preferred a steady reliable mount blaise had come to horsemanship late in life he rode to get from here to there not from a love of riding a temperamental horse was the last thing he wanted they rode off victors farm and down a little winding side road toward the highway east it had rained a couple of days beforenot a lot but enough to lay the dust and make the journey more pleasant fields were broader than they would have been in england most of the crops were the same though wheat and barley rye and oats here and there farmers planted a field in terranovan maize but english farmers were doing that these days too horses and cattle and sheep cropped grass in meadows as they might have on the home island chickens and ducks and terranovan turkeys strutted and waddled across farmyards apple orchards and groves of peaches and plums and walnuts grew among the fields and meadows lettuce and cabbage and radishes turnips and parsnips and carrots flourished in garden plots dogs barked and played cats sauntered or snoozed or sat by woodpiles waiting for unwary mice again everything was much the way it would have been in england only in the unsettled stretches did atlantis remind victor of what it must have been like before englishmen and bretons and basques first began settling here pines and even a few redwoods made up the woods in those stretches barreltrees with their strange short trunks and sheaves of palmlike leaves sticking off from the top of them showed themselves here and there all manner of ferns gave the native forest an exuberant bright green understory a bird called from the woods an oil thrush victor said theyre getting scarce in settled country oil thrushes were plainly related to the brickbreasted birds atlanteans called robins that name irked englishmen who applied it to another smaller bird with a red front it seemed natural to victor though hed used it all his life oil thrushes were much larger easily the size of chickens they had wings too small to let them fly and long beaks they thrust into soft ground in search of earthworms their fatty flesh gave them their name settlers rendered them for grease to make soap or candles and good eating blaise said theyre mighty good eating do you want to stop and hunt victor radcliff asked as if to tempt a yes the oil thrush called again like a lot of atlantean creatures the flightless birds didnt know enough to be wary of men but reluctantly blaise shook his head i reckon not he said we know where our next meals coming from i do like that dont need to take the time sensible i was thinking the same thing radcliff laughed at himself funny isnt it how often we think hes a sensible fellow means the same thing as he agrees with me blaise laughed too hadnt looked at it like that but youre right no doubt about it victors good humor faded faster than he wished it would have no wonder englishmen dont find atlanteans sensible these days then and no wonder we dont think they are either what can we do about it can we do anything about it blaise was above all else a practical man victor supposed anyone whod been a slave would have to be i dont know victor answered along with seeing my manuscript off to the printer finding out whether we can do anything makes me put up with going to hanover i wont have to wait for the news to come out to the farm blaise looked at him sidelong thought you liked it there i do victor said god knows i do but edward radcliffe came here three hundred years ago so he wouldnt have lords and kings telling him what to do they seem to have forgotten that in london air hissed out between his lips some people in hanover seem to have forgotten too they came into the little town of hooville as afternoon neared evening only an antiquarianof which there were few in atlantiswould have known it was named for the baron of hastings in the midfifteenth century the sun going down toward the green ridge mountains cast victors long shadow and blaises out ahead of them hooville had three or four shops three or four churches and several streetsor rather rutted lanesworth of houses most of the streets in hanover and new hastings and other prosperous coastal towns were cobbled no one in hooville had seen the need or more likely cared to spend the money a boy took the travelers horses victor tipped him a penny apiece for them the boy grinned knuckled his forelock and made the broad copper coins disappear smoke and noise greeted victor and blaise when they walked into the tavern the taproom was nearly full a pockmarked man raised his tankard in salute heres to the major he called to the major mugs rose men drank a dozen years earlier victor had been the highestranking officer from the english atlantean settlements in the war against france and spain he saw several people here who he knew had fought under him some he knew by name others were just familiar faces and heres to the majors shadow shouted the fellow whod hailed him before amidst laughter the topers drank again blaise smiled his teeth white against his dark skin what he thought was anyones guess but as a practical man he must have known he couldnt keep people from noticing and remarking on his blackness lets get us something to drink he said now youre talking victor replied they made their way over to the tapman and ordered mugs of flip the potent mix of rum and beer sweetened with sugar and mulled with a hot poker went a long way toward letting a man forget hed been in the saddle all dayor if he didnt forget at least he didnt mind so much something for your supper gents by the way the tapman said it he was stretching a point to include blaise in that but stretch the point he did nodding toward the big fireplace he went on my brotherinlaw shot a wild boar this morning so if you hanker for pork bring it on sir bring it on victor said expansively the flip was hitting him hard blaise nodded victor lifted his mug on high and god bless your brotherinlaw for turning an ugly beast into a fine supper good to think god will bless him for something the tapman said but then men who spoke well of their brothersinlaw were few and far between the cheap earthenware plates were locally made so were the pewter forks victor and blaise cut the pork with their belt knives they drank more flip and listened to the hooville gossip part of that was the inevitable local scandal soandso had run off with suchandsuchs daughter while mr somebody was supposed to be paying entirely too much attention to mrs someone else mr somebody had some sympathy among the hoovilleans can you blame him when the body hes stuck with is cold as greenland winter a welllubricated fellow asked how do you know cried another drinker and everybody laughed sooner or later though the talk veered toward politics the way it did in any tavern sooner or later major how come england thinks it can tax us here somebody asked victor doesnt the king recollect our grandsires crossed the ocean to get away from all that nonsense as far as victor knew his manytimesgreatgrandsire came to atlantis because of the cod banks offshore men still fished those banks today even if the mansized monster cod the old chronicles talked about had grown rare but cod werent what this fellow was talking about radcliff had to pick his words with care the king recollects that he spent a pile of money keeping the french from taking these settlements away from us he wants to get some of it back hes got no right to do it the way hes doing it though the man insisted england cant tax us not in law only we can tax ourselves thats how we see it england sees it differently again victor spoke carefully ordinary people could talk as free as they pleased no one cared about them but chances were somebody in this crowded room would report his words to the english authorities and someone else would report them to the local leaders squabbling with those authorities he didnt want either side to conclude he was a traitor he didnt want the two sides banging heads either whether he could do anything to stop them might be a different question another man banged his mug down hard on the tabletop in front of him me im damned if ill buy anything that comes from england as long as shes going to play these dirty games he declared we can make do with what we turn out for ourselves thats right someone else shouted heads bobbed up and down support for the latest boycott ran strong a hundred years earlier the settlers couldnt have done without england the mother country made too many things they couldnt make for themselves no more oh some luxury goods furs and silks and furniture and fripperies still came from across the sea but atlantis could do without those even if certain rich atlanteanssome of them radcliffs and radcliffesstill pined for them dyou buy english major asked the man whod said the king had no right to tax atlanteans a hush fell everyone waited on victors answer he passed it off with a laugh or tried to what this far inland i didnt think they let english goods get past the coast when the laugh rose it was an angry one england might think of the atlantean settlers as bumpkins one and all the rich merchants in the seaside towns resented what the english thought of themand thought the same thing of their inland cousins you cant win no matter who you are you cant win blaise said the color of his skin gave him uncommon authority on such questions someone will have to win i think victor said later that evening hoping the mattress hed lie down on wouldnt be buggy mmmaybe blaise still didnt sound convinced when he winsif he winswill he be happy in the end victor said the only thing he could i dont know he blew out the candle hed carried from the taproom it was guttering towards an end anyhow the landlord wasnt about to waste a quarter of a farthing by giving a customer any more light than he absolutely had to darkness fell on the bedchamber like a cloak victor fell asleep before he found out whether the mattress held bedbugsbut not before blaise whose first snores he heard as darkness came down on them by the time victor and his colored companion got to hanover they were both scratching one inn or anotheror more likely one inn and anotherhad proved buggy victor was more resigned than surprised blaise was more apt to complain about big things than small ones hanover was a big thing at least by atlantean standards with about people it claimed to be the largest city in atlantis of course so did new hastings farther south and so did freetown south of new hastings croydon north of hanover also had its pretensions though only locals took them seriously down in french atlantis cosquer might have been half the size of the leading english settlement towns of course most of the people whod flocked there since the end of the war came from one english settlement or another the same held true for the still smaller st denis south of cosquer and for new marseille smaller yet on the west coast of atlantis as for avalon north of new marseille it wasnt a pirates nest any more but it remained a law or no law unto itself nobody could say how many people lived there which suited those who did just fine none of atlantis leading cities would have been anything more than a provincial town in england or on the continent even terranova to the west settled later by europeans boasted larger human anthills than any here of course the spaniards who dominated the richer parts of the western continent built on the wreckage of what the copperskinned natives had done before they arrived atlantis was different atlantis was a fresh start crosstopped spires dominated hanovers skyline churches here and farther north were anglican or belonged to one of the sterner protestant denominations officially new hastings and points south were also anglican unofficially popery thrived there the southerly english settlements in atlantis were a lifetime older than the reformation kings had always had trouble enforcing their will here sensible sovereigns didnt try too hard victors mouth tightened george iii and his ministers seemed unwilling to stay sensible along with the spires masts in the harbor reached for the sky some of them were as tall as any church steeple not only merchantmen lined the quays but also english frigates and ships of the line redcoats garrisoned hanover the locals had and did not enjoy the privilege of paying for quartering them when the travelers rode into town more english soldiers were on the streets than victor radcliff remembered seeing since the war then the redcoats and english atlanteans fought side by side against france and spain they were comradesinarms they were friends the redcoats in hanover neither looked nor acted like friends their faces were hard and closed they carried bayoneted muskets and stayed in groups when they went by locals called insults and curses after thembut only from behind so the soldiers had a hard time figuring out whod done it instead of going straight to his printer victor called at the house of erasmus radcliff his second cousin once removed the discoverers family had flourished mightily in english atlantis and no doubt radcliffs and radcliffes and other kinsfolk with different surnames were busy helping to turn what had been french atlantis upside down and inside out erasmus these days headed the trading firm william radcliff had brought to prominence a hundred years before he looked like a prosperous merchant he wore a powdered wig a velvet jacket the color of claret and satin breeches he had manicured hands an exquisitely shaved face and a gentlemans paunch his eyes were a color somewhere between blue gray and green and as warm as the atlantic off the northern reaches of iceland yes its very bad he said as a servant with the map of ireland on his face brought in ale and smoked pork for him and victor blaise was taking his refreshments with the house staff t always think it can get no worse and i always find myself mistaken hanover has not the feel of a garrisoned city as it did when i was here year before last it has the feel of an occupied city victor raised his mug your health coz and yours erasmus radcliff returned the compliment they both drank victor praised the ale which deserved it erasmus waved the praise aside you would know what occupation feels like wouldnt you from your campaigns in the south well by god here we find ourselves on the wrong end of it how dare the crown treat us like so many frenchmen his voice was soft and mild which only made the indignation crackling in it more alarming we cost england money victor answered in their way king georges ministers are merchants too they want to see a return on their investment if they so badly want money of us let them ask our parliaments for it his cousin said london has no more right to wring taxes from hanover than hanover has of taxing london the difference being that we presume not whereas london does the other difference being that london can put soldiers into hanover whereas we cannot garrison london victor said dryly erasmus radcliffs response to that was so comprehensive so heartfelt and so ingenious that victor stored it away for future reference but he asked a blunt question of his own dislike it as you will coz but what do you propose to do about it erasmus sent him a look filled with dislikeand with reluctant respect damn all i can do about it as we both know too well oh indeed victor radcliff nodded and since we know it whats the point to so much fussing and fuming do you know of the newfangled steamdriven engines theyre using in england to pump water out of coal mines erasmus asked when victor nodded his cousin went on they have a valve that opens when the pressure from the steam inside grows too great absent this valve the boiler itself would burst all atlantis curses england by cursing we harmlessly vent our steam did we not this island might explode or will you tell me im mistaken ill tell you you may be victor replied for all atlantis does not curse england much of hanover may but hanover however loath you are to hear it is not atlantis it never has been please god may it never be as things stand most of atlantis is content with england or at least resigned to her were it otherwise the explosion you speak of would have come long since his cousin seemed even less happy than he had a moment earlier erasmus victor judged didnt care to hear that hanover and atlantis werent synonymous few hanoverians did pity victor thought because its true whether they care to hear it or not that it has not come does not mean it will not come erasmus said at last these valves can fail these steamdriven engines can blow up i have heard of several such misfortunes and when they do when they do victor things are never the same afterwards for anyone who chances to stand in the way victor eyed him was erasmus hiding a message there victor laughed at himself for even wondering if erasmus was hiding a message he was hiding it in plain sight way make way there bawled the teamster atop the brewery wagon he cracked his whip above the four big strong horses hauling the caskfilled wain then he cracked it again this time in front of the nose of a man who didnt step aside fast enough to suit him the man swore but flattened himself against the side of a building nonetheless he wore a knife on his beltwho didnt but a man with a belt knife was even more disadvantaged against a bullwhip than against the rapiers some gentlemen still carried to mark their status you had to be able to judge when picking a fight made sense and when it was only foolishness victor radcliff had stepped to one side as soon as the teamster started shouting the heavy wagon clattered past iron tires banging and sparking on cobblestones puddles from the last rain lingered between the stones and in the holes where a few of them had come up the wagon wheels splashed passersby but not too badly a sign hanging above a small shop creaked in the morning breeze custis cawthorne printing and persuasions the neatly painted letters proclaimed the breeze carried the smells of sea and smoke and sewage like any other town hanover dumped its waste into the closest river for ultimate disposal in the ocean manuscript under his arm victor ducked inside a bell over the door jangled the shop was gloomy inside it smelled of wood and paper and sweat and ink a harassedlooking prentice fed sheets into a press one after another a printer worked the lever again and again another prentice stacked the newly printed broadsheets custis cawthorne watched the work from behind the counter therell be a mistake somewhere the printer said mournfully there always is perfection they say is for the lord alone they dont usually know what theyre talking about but when it comes to printing im persuaded they have a point and how are you your radcliffishness i thought i was pretty well till i set eyes on you victor replied cawthorne gave back a sepulchral smile he was tall and thin and stooped with a fringe of white hair clinging to the sides and back of a formidably domed skull you do me too much honor sir he said of course when it comes to honor i hold with falstaff so any honor would be too much is that the latest effusion from your goose there under your arm maybe i should pluck you for quills next timeyou seem prickly enough and to spare victor said and here i was going to do you an honor cawthorne stared reprovingly over the tops of his goldrimmed spectacles they were of a curious design he had devised himself a horizontal line across each lens separated weaker and stronger magnifications so he could read and see at a distance without changing pairs a likely story victor said more likely you were about to set some libel against me in type oh any printer from croydon down to the border of spanish atlantis could do that custis cawthorne said dismissively but noi had something new and interesting and perhaps even important to tell you and did you want to hear it it is to laugh go ahead say your say radcliff replied he laughed at himself why should i waste my time encouraging you youll do as you please anyhow you always do do what thou wiltthere is the whole of the law or so said a wiser man than i cawthorne might have beenprobably wasthe wisest man in atlantis by mentioning someone he reckoned wiser he reminded his audience of that truth because you make yourself so obnoxious i ought not to tell you fats ce que voudrais said victor who also knew his rabelais he surprised the printer into laughter by knowing to hear custis cawthorne guffaw anyone would think him fat and jolly not a somberseeming beanpole victor didnt know how he brought forth such a sound from that narrow chest but he did i shall do exactly that the printer said after guffaws subsided to chuckles hear me then when that indifferently written drivel of yours victor bowed your servant sir plenty of rope for all the critics to hang themselves that was from rabelais too if you were my servant id thump you the way you deserve as things are all of atlantis has that privilege cawthorne said before victor could ask him what he meant he went on here is the honor i propose giving you setting your work with the first font of type made on this side of the atlantic we not only speak english in atlantis we write it and we print it with or without let or hindrance from the socalled mother country socalled victor raised an eyebrow your ancestors did not come from england there was a cawthorne aboard the st george which you know as well as i the printer said but a proper mother knows when her offspring is grown and ready to set out on his own she does not garrison soldiers on him to keep him from leaving home if i were an englishman i would clap you in irons for that victor said if you were an englishman i would despair of atlantis custis cawthorne replied but since by the favor of providence you are not i still have some hope for us and i also have some hope of turning your manuscript to print without too much butchery along the way multifarious as your flaws may be you do write a tolerably neat hand i hope you will not do yourself an injury giving forth with such extravagant praise victor said nothing too serious anyhow cawthorne said and a good thing too for a visit to the sawbones is likelier to leave a man dead than improved he had a point doctors could set broken bones and repair dislocations they could inoculate against smallpoxand in atlantis towns they did so more and more often that scourge still reared its hideous head but less often than in years gone by doctors could give opium for pain and could do something about diarrhea and constipation past that a strong constitution gave you a better chance of staying healthy than all the doctors ever born victor doled out such praise as he could they do try and much good it does them or their sorely tried patients cawthorne said are you done insulting me and physicians victor asked can i make my escape and let you get back to reviling your prentices and journeymen i do less of that than i like these days custis cawthorne answered good workers are hard to find even bad workers are hard to find the good ones would sooner set up for themselves whilst the bad ones try to squeeze more money out of an honest man than theyre worth did some honest man tell you that radcliff asked innocently ah a fellow who fancies himself a wit but overestimates by a factor of two the printer said you had better go all right before i thrash you in a transport of fury im leavingand quivering in my boots the bell rang again as victor went out onto the street custis cawthornes voice pursued him if you think youre quivering now where will you be in five years time on my farm working and writing victor thought i hope more brandy erasmus radcliff inquired victor was feeling what hed already drunk but he nodded anyway his cousin poured for both of them with becoming liberality your health victor said a little blurrily and yours erasmus drank whew after the first swallow numbs your gullet the rest doesnt taste quite so much like turpentine we dont make it as well as they do in europe victor agreed but it will leave a man wobbly on his pegs which is a large part of the point to the exercise we can live with this you can perhaps erasmus radcliff said i find myself compelled to which is not the same thing if england treats us unjustly our only recourse is to refuse intercourse with her which keeps us from importing anything finer than this firewater i believe is the term they use in terranova i could easily trade with france or holland and once again have a source of fine brandy save that the royal navy would impound or sink my ships if i presumed to try this leaves me with nothing to do nothing whatsoever what do you want from me i cant change anything about it victor said no one in london will listen to me not to the extent of changing set policies because i ask it the policy is to squeeze all the revenue england can from atlantis it is the same policy england uses wherever she rules yes i know but most places have to put up with it because they needs must buy some large proportion of their necessities from the mother country his cousin replied that is no longer the case with us we can subsist on our own and england pushes us toward demonstrating the fact with every illadvised tax she tries to ram down our throats he drained his glass and filled it again he would be crapulent come morning now now he seemed determined what we have here may not always be as good but we can make do with it i suppose so victor also drank more he couldnt let erasmus get too far ahead of him custis cawthorne said he would print my latest from type cast here in atlantis not brought from england yet another example erasmus agreed he paused then went on you do realize that if my fellow settlers keep me from trading with england whilst the english prevent me from dealing with anyone else i shall in due course commence to starve victor radcliff looked around the wellappointed office where they drank whaleoil lamps lit it almost as bright as day some strange and almost obscene fetish from the south pacific shared pride of place in a cabinet of curiosities with a bejeweled elephant from india and the mineralized skull of a longsnouted creature from southern terranova none of those would have come easy or cheap neither would erasmus desk a triumph of marquetry in multicolored wood i concede the eventuality coz but it does not strike me as imminent victor said perhaps not then again i am more fortunate than many in similar straits erasmus replied not everyone has so much to fall back on when times get hard no sooner were those words out of his mouth than someone started pounding on his front door the octagonal window in the office rattled in its frame at the insistence of the blows that doesnt sound good victor said a knock in the nighttime is never good news his cousin said and he could only nod the pounding stopped as abruptly as it had begun one of erasmus servants brought a plainly dressed man who smelled strongly of horse into the office mr mitchell from croydon the servant said and so it was richard mitchell was a leading goldsmith in the northern town and a leading light in the struggle to turn atlantis against the mother country his pamphlet called where now was banned wherever the english could seize it for gods sake radcliff give me a drink he said without a word erasmus did mitchell a squat powerfully built man gulped it ann he seemed to notice victor for the first time what you here too just as well its started up north what do you mean victor and erasmus asked together they heard we had guns they marched to get them they did too or some of thembut we gave them a black eye and a bloody nose in the getting its war up there radcliffswar i tell you and it will be war here too war all through this land unless youre a pack of spineless poltroons he slammed down his mug fill it up again atlantis and liberty chapter victor radcliff looked at the english soldier the redcoat standing on a hanover street corner glowered back he carried a flintlock musket with its long bayonet it was about as tall as he was he had pale blue eyes yellow hair and pimpled skin almost pink enough to belong to an albino had he known who victor was he might have tried to seize him if the atlantean settlements had risen against the unloved and unloving mother country they would need someone to lead their soldiers without false modesty radcliff knew he had more practice at that than any other man born on this side of the ocean no doubt some english officers knew it too but the knowledge hadnt trickled down to this spotty young fellow he just disliked being looked at move along you he growled in a clotted barely comprehensible northern accent yes indeed victor touched the brim of his hat i never argue with a man with a gun damned well better not the redcoat said victor thought that was what he said anyhow he swallowed so many vowels it was hard to be sure what blaise swallowed was a chuckle oh no you never argue with men with guns the negro said not much you dont hush victor looked back over his shoulder to his relief the redcoat was paying attention to a pretty girl crossing the street not to him any more you dont want to give him ideas hes liable to come up with them on his own even if you dont him blaise didnt bother hiding his scorn he wouldnt know an idea if it walked up and honked in his face by such idioms did the atlantean distinguish himself from the englishman the irony was that honkers had grown rare on this side of the green ridge mountains the enormous flightless gooselike birds were like oil thrushes unlucky enough to hatch from the egg without fear of man as settlers advanced honkers retreated or rather they died in place and their haunts grew ever scarcer and more remote custis cawthorne had written a pamphlet arguing that land should be set aside so honkers and other native productions of atlantis could have somewhere to survive it struck victor as a good idea most of custis cawthornes ideas were good that didnt mean it was likely to happen people wanted to grab land not set it aside for anything somebody shouted from a second or thirdstory window the devil fry all murdering english dogs there there he is victor might not have known just where that cry came from but the young english soldier pointed like a hunting dog at his shout four more redcoats charged out of an eatery when they saw where he was pointing they rushed in a pistol shot rang out other gunshots answered it a redcoat lurched from the building right hand clutched to left shoulder blood welled out from between his fingers brighter than the dyed wool of his coat more gunshots boomed victor heard the crash of breaking furniture and several voices high and shrill with pain and fury a couple of minutes later the other three redcoats came out dragging a wounded local the man was bloodied and battered but he had no quit in him his head came up atlantis and freedom he called in a great voice one of the redcoats hit him in the face shut up you bloody bigmouthed bastard shame a woman screeched atlantis and freedom the prisoner cried again this time the english soldier clouted him with his musket butt the local went limp in the other redcoats arms shame the woman said again m maybe youd better let him go a bareheaded shockhaired prentice said his hands balling into fists maybe youd better bugger off sonny a redcoat answered he had a corporals stripes on his sleeve and a scarred weasely face that warned hed give trouble no matter the mess in which he found himself maybe id better not the prentice set his feet several other atlanteans ranged themselves behind him more english soldiers came out of the cookshop the sun glittered off the sharp edges of their bayonets last chance boy the corporal said not unkindly otherwise well stick you and well gut you and youll end up dead never knowing why what do we do blaise asked in a low voice try to keep the town from blowing up victor answered the times not ripe no matter what he thought his opinion turned out not to be the one that counted one of the men behind the bushyhaired prentice stooped to grub a cobblestone out of the ground he flung it at the redcoats it caught a soldier in the ribs he said oof and then ow and then fuck your bleedin mother a split second after the curse passed the redcoats lips muskets leveled at the crowd of atlanteans fire the corporal shouted triggers clicked descending hammers scraped flints on steel sparks fell into flash pans the guns bellowed sending up clouds of acrid gunpowder smoke most of them bellowed anyhow flintlocks were imperfectly reliable the english soldierys muskets were also imperfectly accurate some of the shots went wide one of them shattered a window well off to the side of the crowd but men screamed men fell and men who didnt scream or fall hurled more stones at the redcoats one of them had a pistol which he discharged the ball hit the weasely corporal in the arm what he said made the other soldiers obscenity sound like an endearment the sound of gunfire brought more redcoats at the run more atlanteans boiled out of houses and shops the two sides hurried towards each other like lodestone and iron the englishmen had discipline and firearms and bayonets the atlanteans had fury and whatever makeshift weapons they could snatch up and numbers the fury kept them from fleeing when the redcoats shot and stuck some of them what the atlanteans did to a couple of redcoats they managed to grab a paving stone sailed past victor radcliffs head he ducked as automatically and uselessly as a man did when a musket ball came too close for comfort if it was going to hit you it would before you could do a damned thing about it there were fights to join and fights to stay away from this struck victor as a fight to stay away from hed faced more dangerous enemies with qualms no worse than those of any reasonably brave man when he had though hed done it with some purpose in mind if this melee had any point at all he couldnt see it he pulled blaise into a narrow stinking alley he didnt know where it went but it led away from the madness that had kindled here they are liable to tear this whole big place down blaise said mournfully that they are victor agreed theyre liable to tear atlantis apart while theyre doing it too what can we do the negro asked get away live through this see what happens next try to shape what happens next have you got any better ideas if you have spit em out by god id love to hear em but blaise shook his head if we gonna get away we better do it right now he said that struck victor as one of the best idea shed heard in a long time the two of them wasted not a moment using it hanover writhed under martial law the redcoats strode through the streets by squads when they went by ones or twos or even by fours or fives they were much too apt to be mobbed rocks and crockery and the contents of chamber pots came flying out of upperstory windows blaise had already escaped the city he and victor had gone their separate ways precisely because they were known to stick together blaise had got away clean victord expected nothing less englishmenatlanteans toohad trouble taking black men seriously and now it was time for victor to get away himself if he could coming into hanover hed worn the clothes of a prosperous farmer which he was leaving the city he was by all appearances a downattheheels shoemaker he even rode a swaybacked nag the kind of horse such a man would have if he had any horse at all the english had checkpoints west of hanover they also had men scattered between the checkpoints if you got caught trying to sneak out you landed in real trouble things at the checkpoints were supposed to come closer to routine theyd better victor thought up ahead of him the redcoats were searching a fat mans carriage the fat man didnt like it and let them know he didnt im a loyal subject of good king george its not right for you to treat me like a common criminal he said everybodys a loyal subject when he talks to us said the underofficer in charge find anything charles no sergeant hes not a smuggler anyhow said a soldier presumably charles do we strip him to his drawers no i expect hes clean the sergeant nodded to the fat man pass on you strip me to my drawers the fat man spluttered youll win few friends playing such games and do you think we care the sergeant said if you settlers werent in revolt we wouldnt have to worry about keeping you from sneaking guns out of hanover if you havent got guns who cares if youre friendly or not now get going or we will find out if your linens clean still spluttering the fat man rolled on the soldier called charles gestured victor radcliff forward and who are you friend he asked no friend of yours victor thought my name is richard saunders he replied some radcliffs and radcliffes favored the english the clan was too large to have uniform opinions but if the redcoats knew they had hold of victor radcliff theyd never let him go well saunders what are you doing coming out of hanover the sergeant asked where are you bound im heading for hooville victor answered which was true although he wouldnt stop there then he blossomed into invention i was seeing my solicitor my uncle just died childless and looks like ill have to go to law with my cousins over his property and estate he tried to seem suitably disgusted the sergeant and charles and the rest of the redcoats put their heads together are you loyal to his majesty king george iii the underofficer demanded fiercely of course i am victor lied without compunction as the redcoat had said to the fat man who would tell georges soldiers no and the english soldiers crooked grins said they understood the likely reason for his answer then you wont mind if we search you the sergeant asked yes ill mind victor said not much i can do about it past minding though is there too right theres not friend charles used the last word to suggest anything but its literal meaning why dont you get down from that sorry piece of crowbait youre riding sams a good horse victor protested the redcoats laughed in their boots he would have laughed too they patted him down and looked inside his saddle bags they found nothing to make them suspiciousvictor wanted to look as harmless as he could the sergeant still seemed unhappy youve fought in war he said and it wasnt quite a question victor nodded i fought the french here back about the time your beard sprouted the english underofficer scratched at a side whisker we were on the same side then england and atlantis i am on englands side still victor radcliff said once more yes of course you are the sergeant didnt believe it not for a second but he had no real reason to disbelieve it no proof radcliff was anything but what he claimed he looked unhappy but he jerked a thumb toward the swaybacked horse climb on your old screw and get out of here obliged victor pretended not to notice his reservations when he mounted sam the deep curve in the horses spine left the stirrups only a few inches above the ground he pressed his knees against the animals sides and flicked the reins away sam went hed get where he was going but he wouldnt do it in a hurry dont look over your shoulder victor told himself he didnt want to give the redcoats any more chances to see his face sam ambled along the soldiers could still call him back they could but they didnt the road swung around behind a stand of native pines only then did victor breathe easier he was riding a better horse by the time he came to hooville someone took sam back to the farm where hed labored for a lot of years maybe his role in helping victor escape hanover would be celebrated in songs and paintings in years to come he couldnt have cared less all he got out of it were a couple of carrots blaise waited in hooville good to see you he said when victor rode in i wasnt sure i was going to well neither was i victor said but here i am they didnt know they had me in their hands and now they dont and so they wont custis cawthorne is loose too hes on his way to new hastings blaise said good for himand thats the right place for him to go too radcliff said new hastings held fewer loyalists than any other town in english atlantis other places might be noisier in their disapproval of the mother country but it ran deeper and wider there than anywhere else not everybodys going to get away though the redcoats do hold hanover blaise said what can we do right now i dont quite know if this is truly war victor radcliff no doubt looked as unhappy as he sounded if this was truly war atlantis stood alone against the mightiest empire in the world if this is war i see only one advantage on our side blaise raised an eyebrow well thats one more than i see oh weve got one victor waved to the barmaid for another mug of flip hed drunk enough that he should have felt it but he didnt or not very much as she set the mug in front of him he went on were a long way from england she cant move quickly against us and she wont find it easy or cheap to ship soldiers across the sea after a moments consideration blaise said huzzah victor wondered whether the negro had been so sardonic in the african jungles where he grew up or whether blaise had learned it from him if the latter was true as he feared then he had a lot to answer for sardonic or not the negro had a point with his sour acclamation atlantis had merchantmen and fishing boats to oppose the royal navy farmers to face professional soldiers she was short of gunpowder and even shorter of firearms and she was short of peopleand how many of the ones she had would take englands side what will the french down south do blaise asked good question radcliff said french atlantis had passed under english rule only a dozen years before since then the more numerous englishspeakers had flooded into lands formerly barred to them would the older settlers rise against king george or against the interlopers disrupting their way of life have you got an answer blaise seemed surprised to discover his mug of flip was also empty he waved for a refill too only well have to see victor replied the barmaid didnt come back for blaise as fast as she had for victor was that because he was servant not master because he was black not white or only because she had other orders to fill first sometimes you could read too much into things that in fact carried no great meaning sometimes you could miss meanings in things that seemed ordinary at first blaise brushed two fingers of his right hand against the dark skin of his left forearm victor had seen negroes use that gesture before it meant you did that because of my color his factotum knew what he thought then and he knew what he thought of victors comment as well is that good enough no victor said honestly but its what weve got when he came to his farm he found a delegation from the atlantean assembly waiting for him the settlements had tried protesting to england one by one only to learn that the mother country didnt want to listen to them then theyd all joined together thinking atlantis might be heard if only it spoke with a single voice thus far the evidence was against them isaac fenner had red hair and ears that stuck out from the sides of his head like open doors he was a solicitor from bredestown a few miles up the brede from new hastings and spoke for the older city as well matthew radcliffe from avalon on the west coast was bound to be some sort of cousin of victors but neither had set eyes on the other before this meeting the westerner was short and stocky he looked travel worn one of the farm cats had taken a liking to him and fallen asleep on his lap he absently stroked its back while sipping rum punch everyone called robert smith from croydon in the north i uncle bobby hed carried the name since he was young victor didnt know why he wondered if smith did himself uncle bobby was also drinking rum punch with the singleminded diligence of a man who needed it from the south came two men abednego higgins and michel du guesclin maybe higgins stood for the englishspeakers down there and du guesclin for the frenchmen or maybe things had just worked out that way they were both very tall the one broadshouldered the other slim as a rapier du guesclin victor knew was somehow connected to the kersauzon family as prominent down there as radcliffs and radcliffes were in english atlantis as soon as victor came inside and saw them margaret said they want to talk to you well i expected they could find rum and something to mix it with somewhere closer than here he answered his wife sent him an exasperated look no they want to talk to you about something important i was afraid they did victor radcliff was also afraid he knew what the gentlemen of the atlantean assembly wanted you arent going to throw them out despite the way meg said it it wasnt really a question victor sighed no i suppose not as if in ironic counterpoint to that matthew radcliffe raised his mug in salute abednego higgins tossed a wellgnawed chicken bone onto the platter from which hed taken it when it was meatier the gentlemen from the assembly did not expect to be sent on their way with another sigh victor stepped past his wife and nodded to them hello my friends he said wondering how big a lie he was telling radcliffe from avalon raised his mug again du guesclin full of french politesse bowed in his seat uncle bobby grabbed the bull by the horns saying do you recall what the discoverer did when the black earl tried to tax him without his leave yes i recall victor answered every schoolchild in english atlantis knew what edward radcliffe had done when the exiled richard neville earl of warwick tried to set himself up as king in atlantis what had happened then helped shape atlantean history for the three hundred years between that day and this but robert smith went on as if victor hadnt spoken he died thats what he did he died fighting tyranny and his sons put it down for good that was the story schoolboys learned some people said what had actually happened was more complicated victor radcliff didnt know he hadnt been in new hastings back in isaac fenner was descended from the first man to die in atlantis and if some tales were true from the girl the black earl had taken as his bedwarmer maybe even from neville himself he said the damned englishmen still havent learned their lesson they think they can tax us as they please do we let them get away with that do we let them make us into slaves both du guesclin and higgins shook their heads at that rhetorical question they owned slaves copperskins from terranova to the west and negroes like blaise brought in to do hard work in a climate not well suited to white men maybe that gave them extra cause not to want to be enslaved themselves maybe it meant they feared their own bondsmen would rise against them given even half a chance maybe they had reason for such fears we are in arms around hanoveryouve seen that for yourself radcliff uncle bobby said and we are in arms in croydon too we rose before hanover did he spoke with a northerners pride doing anything ahead of hanover and new hastings mattered a lot up there what has this got to do with me victor asked much in the way almost eighteen centuries before jesus had said if it be possible let tins cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt jesus must have known it wouldnt be possible and in the same way victor knew what it had to do with him if jesus could hesitate he thought he was entitled to do the same now smith spoke as to a child we are at war with england victor the settlements have armies we need to join them into one army into an atlantean army we need a man under whom they will be glad to combine a man who can command them who else but you during the war against french atlantis france and spain victor had been the highestranking atlantean soldier fighting alongside the redcoats he was now expected to oppose wasnt one war enough for one man i should sooner stay here on my farm and live as an ordinary private person he said as if activated by some clockwork mechanism the delegates from the atlantean assembly shook their heads in unison if you sit on your hands here well lose abednego higgins said bluntly ii a raison michel du guesclin agreed he continued in accented english i can think of no other english man the french of the south will follow do you want to let the discoverer down matthew radcliffe added if we lose this fight england will do to atlantis what the black earl damn him tried to do to new hastings come on coz isnt fighting those bastards from across the sea in your blood in the last war the men from across the sea had been allies and vital allies at that they hadnt sought to ram taxes down the atlanteans throats not then afterwards though afterwards was another story as afterwards so often was up until a little more than a century before avalon had been a pirates roost did matthew radcliffe carry some of the freebooters blood in his veins victor wouldnt have been surprised his distant kinsman certainly seemed ready even eager to brawl this wont be the battle of the strand one fight and its over victor warned this will be a war like the last oneworse than the last one unless i miss my guess england wont want to let us go our own way no she wants us to go her way and she aims to drag us along if we dont care to follow on our own isaac fenner said is that what you have in mind for atlantis till the end of time radcliff is that why your forefathers first took folk away from the greedy kings and nobles on the other side of the sea there were days when victor radcliff wished he sprang from a less illustrious family this was one of those days people expected things from him because of who his forefathers were he could have done without the compliment if it was one england is the greatest kingdom in europe england is the richest empire in the world he said even if she runs short of her own soldiers she can buy poor men from the german princes to do her fighting for her we are what we are can we fight her and hope to win can we bend the knee to her and look at ourselves in the glass afterwards matthew radcliffe returned you are our best hope coz but you are not our only hope we aim to fight with you or without you chances with you are better than without you though du guesclin said they are abednego higgins agreed we need a general we can all respect if anybody in atlantis fills the bill youre the man ive never been a general the protest died before victor let it out what atlantean had hed led a goodsized force of soldiers in the field which put him one up on almost everyone else who opposed england you gentlemen are mad he said one last protest uncle bobby stood up from his chair to bow we are sir we are he agreed but its a grand madness will you join us in it victor looked around hed been comfortable here ever since coming home from the war against france and spain hed wanted to live out the rest of his days as a gentleman farmer not as a man of war but if atlantis called on him what could he do but answer the call he sighed join you i will i note that it was our idea not mine may none of us ever have cause to regret it oh i expect we will sooner or laterprobably sooner abednego higgins was a man of melancholy temperament victor wasnt or not especially but he suspected the same thing but then all five men from the atlantean assembly crowded around him pumping his hand and slapping his back and telling him what a lion what a hero he was if hed believed a quarter of what they told him he would have been sure he could run every redcoat out of atlantis by day after tomorrow at the latest fortunatelyor odds were unfortunatelyhe knew better news from the east came slowly that was one of the reasons victor radcliff had settled where he did more often than not he was happier not knowing his livelihood didnt depend on hearing things before other people could if he was going to take up the sword again though must you do this margaret asked she hadnt wanted him going off to fight the french atlanteans and their overseas reinforcements either and they werent even married then if i dont someone else willand worse he said the setdements are going to rise up against england no theyve already risen up and they wont quiet down till they win or till theyre too beaten to fight any more the redcoats have pulled out of new hastings the redcoats had pulled out of new hastings more than two weeks before hed only just got the news that was one of the reasons he needed to travel east farming might not depend on the latest news war did what difference does it make to you whether king george orders atlantis about or we make our own mistakes his wife demanded i dont want anyone across the sea telling me how many pounds i owe on this farm victor said if some englishman can do that he can take it away from me too so can a honker from new hastings meg retorted properly speaking only people from new hastings and perhaps bredestown were honkers englishmen were in the habit of using the name foror againstanybody from atlantis at least i have some say in what those people decide victor said london wont pay attention to me london never pays attention to atlantis not unless someone else is trying to take it away or unless parliament decides it needs to squeeze money from us whether london takes it or we do the moneys gone margaret said victor grunted i should like some choice in where it goes london will use it to pay fat sweating soldiers to tyrannize over us whereas if we spend it ourselves well use it to pay fat sweating soldiers to keep england from tyrannizing us his wife broke in he stared at her such sarcastic gibes were usually his province he couldnt even tell her she was wrong because she was much too likely to be right if atlantis was to cast off the mother countrys yoke it would need to assume the trappings of other nations he said the most he felt he could say theyll be our soldiers not redcoats or those german barbarians from brunswick and hesse and god knows where oh hurrah meg said do you think theyll come cheaper on account of that he didnt answer mostly because he thought no such thing understanding as much meg gave him a knowing nod i see what would you have me do victor asked tell the gentlemen of the atlantean assembly that ive changed my mind and will not fight for them they will carry on regardless the only difference being the greater likelihood of their defeat and our subjection i would have you margaret radcliff broke off tears filling her eyes what i would have you do doesnt matter the only thing that matters is what atlantis would have you do atlantis would have you carry on till you catch a musket ball in your teeth and then proclaim you a fallen hero to rally more fools to the cause again she was much too likely to know what she was talking j about as patiently and calmly as he could victor said i dont intend to get shot meg who does she retorted but the graveyards fill up even so died for his country much too young the tombstones say i want you to live for your country if you think i want anything else you are very much mistaken victor said but atlantis is my country shall i pretend i have not got one or that i care not who rules here nooo meg said slowly in a way that could mean nothing but yes then she sighed a wintry sigh it may be necessary victor but that makes it no easier for me im sorry by god i am sorry i wish england werent doing any of this id like nothing better than to live here in peace and bring in my crops every fall victor said but life gives what it gives not what you like he wished he could talk about passing the land down to their children to say anything along those lines though would only dredge up pain older and deeper than any about his marching off to war losing children young was hard on men but harder on the women who bore them they both knew how the argument would end he would leave the farm and lead whatever armies the atlantean assembly scraped together against the ferocious professionals from the mother country hed served with those professionals in the war against the french atlanteans and france and spain he knew their virtue their unflinching courage their skill fighting alongside such men was a pleasure fighting against them would be anything but he rode out the next morning meg saw him off biting her lip and blinking against more tears blaises wife seemed no more enthusiastic about his military venture once out of reach of the farmhouse victor asked did you have fun getting ready to go on your way fun blaise rolled his eyes i dont know if i would call it that stella wanted me to stay right where i was you know how women are i have some idea anyhow victor said id better after all these years but the thing needs trying i dont believe anyone can do it better than i can and you will help me a great deal even with you i do not know if it can be done i do know it would be harder without you i thank you blaise said i tried to explain this to stella he needs someone to take care of him i said no one can do that better than i can i told her she did not want to listen to me not even when i talked about freeing the colored folk down in the old french settlements did she want to hear me victor radcliff grunted uneasily freedom from england for the white man was one thing freedom from the white man for the black was something else again one thing at a time victor thought and rode on chapter hastings struck victor as old the first english settlement in atlantis had more than three hundred years of history behind it now next to london or paris rome or athens that was but the blink of an eye next to anywhere else on this side of the atlantic it seemed as one with the pyramids and the sphinx the church and some of the buildings nearby dated from the fifteenth century the church had originally been catholic of course how could it have been anything else dating as it did from before the reformation anglicanism and sterner protestant sects predominated in atlantis these days but not to the extent they did on the other side of the ocean england had needed many years to take a firm grip on these settlements now wanting to make it firmer yet she had a war on her hands soldiers encampments dotted the fields outside of town the men in them wore whatever they would have worn at home they carried whatever muskets they happened to own none but a few veterans of the fight against french atlantis had the faintest conception of military discipline but they were theretill the terms for which theyd enlisted ran out anyhow and they were enthusiastic they cheered victor whenever he flags some showed honkers others fierce redcrested eagles real honkers and the eagles that preyed on themand on menwere rare almost to extinction in this longsettled part of atlantis they were growing scarcer everywhere from what victor had heard that was the least of his worries turning enthusiastic militia men into real soldiers was a bigger one keeping those militiamen fed well enough to fight might have been a bigger one yet and dealing with the atlantean assembly towered over all of the others it was victor supposed as close to a native government as atlantis had but it wasnt very close atlanteans had never liked being governed that was one of the reasons they or their ancestors came to atlantis in the first place it was one of the reasons they fought england now and it was one of the reasons the assembly was what it was and wasnt anything more it couldnt tax it could ask the settlements for money to support it and what it did but couldnt compel them to give it any it decided things by twothirds majority vote if fewer than twothirds of the settlements voted in favor of any measure it failed if twothirds or more did vote for it it passedbut still wasnt binding on the settlements whose delegations voted no it wasnt quite the polish liberum vetobut it wasnt far removed either with an organization like that the atlantean settlements seriously proposed to beat the greatest empire the world had seen since roman days that struck victor as madnessa glorious madness maybe but madness even so it struck blaise the same way you know the english they are going to fight he said when he and victor got settled into their room at an inn not far from the old redwood church well yes victor agreed splashing water from the basin onto his hands and face whiskers rasped under his chin he hadnt shaved coming down from his farm unless he was going to grow a beardsomething only frontiersmen did in atlantishe needed to take care of that he went on we wouldnt have come here if they were just going to sail away but this atlantean assembly this militia blaises african accent made the words sound faintly ridiculous by the way he shook his head that was the least of how he felt about them they are a joke if they had to decide to go to the privy they would shit themselves halfway there victor snorted not because he thought the negro was wrong but because he thought blaise was right theyre what atlantis has he said i know blaise replied this is what worries me maybe you should go home and not tell the english you were ever here too late for that victor radcliff said we are going to fight them the way things are we cannot avoid fighting them we have a better chance if i do what i can than if i dont i had to explain all this to my wife before we set out i know blaise said again i had to explain to my wife too i know what england has now i see what we have i think i was a fool he didnt say he thought victor was a fool that would have been rude whether he thought it or not was a different question no one is keeping you here against your will you were a slave in french atlantis you are no mans slave nowcertainly not mine victor said if you do not care to be here you may leave you may surrender to the english and tell them everything you know chances are theyll make you an officer if you do thank you but no blaise replied with dignity atlantis is my land too now i do not want to leave it my roots here are not as old as yours but they are firm i want to make this place better if lean victor radcliff held out his hand in that we are certainly agreed blaise clasped hands with him the atlantean assembly met in the church it being the building in new hastings best suited to containing their number on sundays most of the assemblymen worshiped there some few from new hastings and points south were of the romish persuasion and found other ways and places to commune with god as they saw fit and from croydon in the north came benjamin benveniste the assemblys one and only jew some people said he was the richest man in atlantis others more conservative called him the richest man not a radcliff or radcliffe benveniste would always laugh and deny everything victor didnt know if the jew was wealthier than some of his own merchant kinsmen he was sure benveniste had more money than he did himself what difference does it make benveniste replied when another assemblyman asked him just how rich he was the more i have the more others think they can take from me wealth is a burden nothing less the other assemblyman was from new grinstead a backwoods town with not much wealth and not much else wistfully he said id be a donkey if it meant i could carry more chasing money too hard will make an ass of anyone benjamin benveniste saida shot close to the center of the target well what does that make you the other assemblyman said benveniste sent him a hooded glance a patriot sirif you will let me be we have room for everyone here custis cawthorne said before the man from the backwoods could reply why look at me they have even made room for a scurrilous printer next to that what does it matter if youre christian or jew or mahometan plainly several people thought it did matter none of them felt like antagonizing cawthorne thoughhe could be as scurrilous in oral debate as he was when setting type i am able to care for myself custis benveniste said i didnt do it for you cawthorne sounded surprised i did it for atlantis ah the jew nodded well that i have no trouble with by easy stages the debate drifted around toward formally appointing victor radcliff commander of the atlantean forces in arms against the british empire nothing the atlantean assembly did seemed to move very fast when men from all the settlements came together to protest to the mother country that was one thing when they aimed to conduct a war against that mother country it was liable to be something else again victor wondered if telling the assemblymen as much would do any good he decided it would only put their backs up he would have to work with them forhow long till the war was over one way or the other if it was the other we have to win custis cawthorne said if we lose they will hang us pour encourager les autres do i say that correctly monsieur du guesclin if you mean it ironically then yes replied the man from what had been french atlantis otherwise you would do better to say pour deeourager les autres getting my neck stretched would certainly discourage me cawthorne said but i was alluding to the eminent voltaires remarks about the reason why the english hanged admiral byng several assemblymen smiled and nodded so did victor radcliff who admired voltaires trenchant wit but a storm cloud passed across michel du guesclins darkly handsome features speak to me not of that man if you would be so kind he believes not in god nor in the holy catholic church look around you monsieur cawthorne advised not unkindly i will not speak of any mans belief in god save my own and then only with reluctance but you will find precious few of romish opinions here in new hastings oh i understand that but you are protestants from the cradle and so i can partly forgive your views since you know no better du guesclin said with what was no doubt intended for magnanimity this thing of a voltaire however knows and knowing rejects for this he is far worse god will have somewhat to say to him when he is called to account he may render unto god the things that are gods cawthorne said what were engaged in doing here is ciphering out how not to render unto caesar the things caesar thinks are his he turned and nodded to victor how do we best go about that general radcliff how many men had gone from major to general while skipping all the ranks in between victor couldnt think of many but cawthornes question would have perplexed a man whod held every one of those ranksvictor was sure of it i have no detailed answer for you sir not knowing what the enemy will attempt he said in general we should do our best to keep him from holding and occupying our leading towns and not allow him to split atlantis so he can defeat in detail our forces in the various parts as always the devil is in the detail cawthornes eyes twinkled behind his spectacles so that he looked like a skeleton pleased with itself several atlantean assemblymen groaned or flinched at the pun those whod missed it looked puzzled still smiling slightly cawthorne went on and they are now strongest at hanover yes and at croydon victor radcliff replied we must do everything in our power to keep their two armies from joining forces that seems sensible the escaped printer said nevertheless we will try not to hold it against you before victor had to respond to that matthew radcliffe asked him how do you view the situation in the west through a glass darkly victor told his distant cousin a ripple of laughter ran through the assembly he wondered why he meant it i have visited avalon and new marseille only once most of my life has passed on this side of the green ridge mountains as you well know i understand the importance of holding all we can there but i would be lying if i said i had any certainty as to ways and means an assemblyman he didnt know said it sounds as though we have too much to do and not enough to do it with it sounded that way to victor too admitting as much would probably result in the army of the national assembly getting a new commander on the instant with a shrug he replied sir i can but promise my best effort and full dedication to victory i do not believe it will come swiftly anyone who does in my view has charged his brier with something stronger than pipeweed he got another laugh for something he didnt intend as a joke after more questions and more backandforth among the illustrious assemblymenthey all thought they were anyhowthey finally got around to calling the question no one voted against putting victor in charge of their makeshift army although several assemblymen abstained if things went wrong later they could say it wasnt their fault if things went wrong later chances were what they said wouldnt matter a farthings worth somewhere close to two thousand men had gathered outside of new hastings victors first order of business was to give them the rudiments of drill so they couldwith luckperform as an army not a mob veterans from the war against french atlantis had some notion of marching and countermarching and deploying from column to line and other such mysteries understanding them well enough to teach them to men who had no notion they existed though in the whole encampment victor found two men he trusted with the job one was a deserter from the redcoats a barrelchested sergeant whod fallen in love with an atlantean barmaid and changed sides because of her tim knox had a manner that brooked no argument and a voice that carried halfway to hanover the other drillmaster was blaise a few people objected to taking orders from a negro victor had seen that in the last war too after blaise knocked the stuffing out of a couple of the grumblers the rest of the men stopped complaining blaise took it all in stride in africa my clan wouldnt want to do what a white man said either he remarked had you ever seen a white man before you were brought to the coast and sold victor asked him once a trader he died of a fever in our village blaise said we took what he hadiron needles and little shears and the like the women were so happy he smiled at the memory poor trader wasnt victor radcliff said true blaise nodded you white men have learned all sorts of tricks we dont know everything from those good needles ours are bone and not so slenderto books and guns and ships but you have not got the trick of staying healthy in our country radcliff had heard the same thing from men who dealt in slaves off the african coast theyd sounded irked notrelieved the way blaise did victor had another question for blaise one that mattered more than how africans thought about white men are we ever going to make soldiers out of these militiamen maybe blaise said chances are about the time their enlistments run out ha victor said not that blaise was kidding since the war that swallowed french atlantis militias had sadly decayed there was no one left to fightthe spaniards in the south werent going to cause trouble so why worry about drilling unless hanover went to war with new hastings people in atlantis could live in peace and they did and because they did most of them didnt know the first thing about soldiering even the young men who took up arms against england werent thrilled about learning either do the best you can thats all victor said if we can keep our armies in the field for a whileand if we can keep the same people in themthe men will pick up what they have to know if we cant we lose blaise said radcliff nodded i know i figured that out too quite a few people in the atlantean assembly havent yet but they are supposed to be the smartest men in atlantis blaise said so they are victor agreed and if that isnt a judgment on all of us i dont know what would be one more thing too he waited till the negro made a questioning noise then went on in their infinite wisdom theyre the ones who chose me for chief general makes you wonder eh blaise said not a word the courier rode into the encampment outside of new hastings five minutes after victor radcliff had sat down to half a fat roasted capon with starberry sauce spooned over it the green sauce tart and sweet at the same time came from one of atlantis few native berries a product of the thinly settled southwest it went well with chicken and even better with greasier fowl like duck and goose a sentry let the courier into victors tent making him pause with a bite halfway to his mouth yes he said sir the english are coming the courier said and then could i have a bite of that im powerful hungry victor liked white meat better than dark he tore off the drumstick and handed it to the newcomer as the fellow started to eat victor demanded where are the english coming the courier had interrupted his supper he saw no reason not to return the disfavor wumbumpf the courier said with his mouth fullthat was what it sounded like anyhow would you care to try that again victor asked the man swallowed heroically weymouth he managed and took another bite this one even bigger than the last ah victor said that did make sensean unpleasant amount of sense in fact weymouth was a small coastal town that lay between new hastings and hanover closer to the latter victor would have said the english were welcome to the placeif ever a town had a fine future behind it weymouth was the oneif only it didnt have a sizable arsenal he couldnt affordatlantis couldnt affordto lose the tons of powder and lead bars stored there as things were he wasnt sure how much he could do about it if the enemy started out closer to weymouth and moved first maybe he should just send as many wagons as he could and hope to salvage at least part of the military supplies when did they march he asked how fast are they going is anyone trying to hold them back powerful thirsty too the courier said at victors shouted order he got a mug of beer he drained it at one long blissful pull his adams apple bobbing up and down as he swallowed then he told victor what he knew general howe wasnt moving south very fast he didnt think he needed to even though loyalists had told him about the armory he didnt believe the atlanteans had an army that could fight his he also didnt believe they would even if they could militiamen and enthusiastic volunteers between hanover and weymouth were doing their best to make him think twice they were shooting at his men from behind fences and from the woods they were blocking the roads with barricades of rocks and fallen trees one enterprising group had dammed a roadside stream and turned the roadbed to water and mud no the redcoats werent making good time which meant it behooved the atlanteans to hurry if they wanted to hold weymouth victor set them in motion the morning after he got the news the english were advancing on the town he wanted to leave new hastings at the crack of dawn in fact the army started marching more than two hours later the column straggled much more than it should have too men fell out whenever they grew tired or got sore feet at every stream and pond militiamen splashed water on their faces when sergeants and officers screamed at them to keep going the soldiers yelled back as far as they could see they were in this because they felt like it or for a lark that the war and what came from it might be important didnt seem to have entered their heads they might have advanced ten miles by the time they halted for the evening a properly trained army would have gone twice as far seeing that victor was almost ready to despair if they get there before us he groaned then we dont stop them blaise finished for him the negro grunted with relief as he took off his boots ive got sore feet myself im more used to riding than to marching good for you victor said snapping his fingers youve reminded me of something anyhow whats that blaise examined his heels and the balls of his feet and the bottoms of his toes i can send horsemen ahead of the main body maybe theyll keep the redcoats out of weymouth till the rest of us get there victor scowled blackly or maybe theyll stop at every tavern along the way drink rum pinch the barmaids and never get there at all christ maybe theyll ride off toward the green ridge mountains after butterflies nobody knows till i try itim sure the dragoons dont i dont think theyll go chasing butterflies general blaise spoke with exaggerated care as if humoring a lunatic victor radcliff felt fairly lunatic just then well maybe not he allowed though he had no enormous confidence they would do what he wanted he summoned the leaders of the mounted infantry and gave them their orders youre sending us off as a forlorn hope then said a bright young captain named habakkuk biddiscombe forlorn hope was what people called the advance parties who tore up the abatis in front of enemy earthworks those parties got the name because not many of the men in them usually lived through the attempt radcliff shook his head no captain i want you to delay the redcoats yes but i dont want you to throw away your mens lives or your own doing it you want us to fire and fall back then another officer said yes victor nodded gratefully that is exactly what i want of you the only way we can fire and fall back is to get well north of weymouth before we meet the enemy habakkuk biddiscombe said wed best commence straightaway if we are to have any hope of gaining so much ground bless my soul victor murmured someone grasped the essence of the situation then radcliff made himself nod i couldnt have put it better myself habakkuk in that case lets get moving captain biddiscombe herded the other officers of dragoons out of victors tent a few minutes later some loud and profane swearing came from the mounted infantrymen a few minutes after that aided by a waxing gibbous moon they rode out of the camp heading north can they get there soon enough to do any good blaise asked i dont know victor answered i do know they have a better chance setting out now than they would if they left tomorrow morning and i thinki dont know yet but i thinkcaptain biddiscombe will get everything they have to give from them and maybe a little more besides an officer like that is worth his weight in gold and maybe a little more besides blaises voice was sly yes by god victor nodded every once in a while maybe a lot more besides victor ordered the buglers to wake the army before sunrise so the men could start marching at first light by the groans and oaths that greeted the horn calls the buglers won no friends doing it in an army that elected most of its officers and underofficers friendship was important victor didnt care as far as he was concerned getting to weymouth was important everything else could wait militiamen gnawed hard bread and gulped tea or coffee or beer the army drove some unhappy beeves with it too the cooks knocked a few of them over the head just enough to leave everybody dissatisfied with the portion he got victor radcliff was certainly dissatisfied with his portion this is some of the most odious beef i ever had the misfortune to eat he said better than no beef at all blaise said grease running down his chin better than slave rations too and we wont work as hard when we fight as i did out in the fields sergeants dont have whips either do you feel the lack victor inquired not altogether ironically only every now and again blaise answeredalso not altogether ironically he took another bite of beef he had better teeth than victor did dentistry wasnt quite hell on earth but it came close even after heroic doses of brandy and opiumor of laudanum which combined the twolosing a tooth hurt like blazes as long as your men fear you worse than they fear enemy musketry theyll hold the line victor said thats what we need blaises wave took in the atlantean armys encampment can we fight the redcoats with troops like this he asked seems to me we had better men when we took on the french settlers and we had england to back us up then toowe didnt go against her the second is true of course victor said as for the first he shrugged this is a raw force no one would say any different but as soon as the men gain some experience their enlistment time runs out and they go home blaise broke in that isnt what i was going to say dammit victor burst out which made it no less true he sighed and took a careful bite of his tough stringy beef before long we shall have to improve our system of recruitment in the meanwhile what choice have we but to do the best we can with what the atlantean assembly in its infinite wisdom has seen fit to give us if we lose a few times how well we fought wont matter yes blaise was ruthlessly pragmatic again radcliff thought his comment altogether too likely still the first few times i would not be completely discontented with any result that demonstrates we can confront english soldiers on terms approximating equality our men need to believe thatand so does the enemy if it be true blaise said yes if victor radcliff might not have admitted that even to his wife as much to raise his own spirits as for any other reason he went on the last time around you will recall we fought not only french settlers but also french regulars we did well enough against em too i see no reason we cant do the same against king georges redcoats am i overlooking anything only that when we fought the french all these settlements joined together against them the negro said how many settlers now aim to fight on king georges side victor grunted uncomfortably hed already talked about loyalists he knew too well that this fight would split families it had already split some custis cawthornes press and his formidable wit were at the atlantean assemblys disposal richard cawthorne his eldest son was royal governor of freetown south of new hastings richard was not the man his father was but he was by all accounts capable and conscientious a good enough servant for the king not many settlers who aim to fight for king george are in camp with us here victor said again trying to buck himself up nooo blaise said which sounded like agreement but was anything but he found another unpleasant question to ask but how many of em are hotfooting it off to general howe to tell him how many men weve got and how theyre accoutered by the time we fight hell know everything about us except the holes in our stockings well its not as if we wont know as much about his men radcliff replied patriots came south with word of howes movements and of his regiments and more than a few redcoats having come to atlantis wanted nothing more than to strip off their uniforms and either join the assemblys army and take aim at their former comrades or to go off into the wilderness where neither side would trouble them again how soon before we meet him blaise asked two or three days victor said three i hope that will mean our skirmishers are making his march a misery it will also mean weve passed through weymouth and saved whats in the arsenal we wont get powder from england any more either not unless we take it from the redcoats baggage train after we beat them blaise understood how war worked all right i hope we can do that i expect we will some of the time but we are going to have to make our own too if we need to depend on what we can steal were ruined victor said from horseback he urged his men to hurry north every so often a horseman would come down and tell him where general howes army wasor rather where it had been when the horseman rode off to report on it victor had to calculate how long it had taken each rider to come from one army to the other that told him about where the redcoats were at any moment and about how fast they were coming whole countrysides in arms against em one scout told him theyve got to battle their way past every copse of trees and every stone fence within range of the road to weymouth good victor said he scowled at the map he held open between his knees how much nonsense would his horse put up with before it tried to buck him off onto his head if he was doing his sums correctly howe and the englishmen ought to be about there he did some more sums in his head then he blinked in sudden glad surprise by god we really may get to weymouth ahead of them who would have believed it way they go stealing anything that aint nailed down no wonder everybody wants to take a shot at em the atlantean scout said well yes victor radcliff hid as much of a smile as he could the redcoats thievery was far from unique the french atlanteans had robbed just as enthusiastically in the last war so had the english atlanteans come to that soldiers in the atlantean assemblys armyhis armywere bound to plunder too victor dared hope they would mostly steal from farmers who favored king george sometimes though it didnt do to inquire too closely heavy wagons carried hogsheads of gunpowder out of weymouth and down toward new hastings the atlantean soldiers moved off the road to let those wagons by where all the other traffic had had to move aside for the armys sake other wagons brought muskets and lead away from the redcoats victor was glad to see them even if weymouth fell the precious munitions stored there wouldnt fall into english hands his men burst into cheers when they entered weymouth victor felt like cheering himselfhed got there ahead of general howe he wondered how long it had been since weymouth heard much in the way of cheering the town stank of cod with hanover to the north and new hastings to the south it would never get very big or very prosperous a lot of the shops hadnt been painted or spruced up for a long time why bother the shopkeepers seemed to say some of them came out into the street to clap as the atlantean army went by barmaids handed out mugs of beer and kisses church bells clanged dogs yapped as if possessed not all the locals seemed delighted to see the settlers in arms one weathered fellow a cigar clamped in his jaws looked more as if he was counting them than applauding them would he slip off and tell general howe what he knew as victors scouts had been doing for him the chances seemed good both sides in this fight would have plenty of spies with the arsenal evacuated victor could have let howe have weymouth sooner or later though the atlanteans would have to fight if they let the redcoats march here and there unhindered they werent an army at allthey were only playing at being one victor looked for favorable ground on which to make a stand he found what he wanted about five miles north of the town a stout stone wall led from the road to the beach a grove of apple trees off to the left covered that flank all he had to do was barricade the roadway and he would block the redcoats path and force them to fight axes rang out among the apples men and oxen dragged fallen trees to block off the space between the grove and the stone wall victor set up his fieldpieces where they could rake the oncoming english soldiers he wished they didnt burn so much powder at every shot yes hed got that store out of weymouth but even so the sun was setting in the direction of the green ridge mountains when he got the position strong enough to suit him that was just as well scouts said howes men were only a few miles away the atlanteans ate at their posts they bragged about what they would do to the enemy come morning and then like any innocents they slept chapter drums and fifes woke the atlantean rebels with the eastern sky going from gray to pink the men staggered out of tents and uncocooned from tightwound blankets they yawned and rubbed their eyes and swore sleepily it was as if they only half rememberedor didnt want to rememberwhat lay ahead the cooks served bread and meat and coffee the men might have hit their wives if theyd got food like that at home here they ate without complaint they seemed glad to get any food at all gnawing on a chunk of halfraw beef between two slabs of badly risen bread victor remembered from the way his beltd pinched in campaigns gone by that they were right to be glad up ahead musketry in the distance said farmers and hunters were still harassing the redcoats they werent even militiamen and had no connection to the atlantean assembly or anyone but their neighbors if howes men caught them the usages of war said they could hang them but catchmg franattreurs wasnt easy all they had to do was hide their firelocks and then they were just men ambling down country tracks shoot at redcoats the idea would never once cross their minds victor stepped out in front of the abatis to survey the ground once more the english would have to charge uphill to come at his men that would make things harder for them too he nodded to himself he wanted to make things as hard as he could for the enemy because he knew the redcoats were better soldiers than his own men were a fieldpiece boomed maybe howes troopers had got a good shot at some of their tormentors maybe they just wanted to scare them off victor thought they had a pretty good chance of doing it too men whod never had cannon aimed at them found it terrifying radcliff had faced field guns before and he wasnt enthusiastic about it either here came the redcoats mounted men rode out ahead of the main column on foot when the riders spied the obstruction ahead they wheeled their mounts and galloped back to report the news wont be long now men victor called to his own army pretty soon well give the damned english what they deserve the atlanteans raised a cheer they didnt know what they were getting into not yet pretty soon theyd find out they would never be the same again neither the ones who died nor the ones who lived watching the redcoats deploy from column into line victor tried to fight down his jealousy hed put the atlanteans through their evolutions in the fields outside new hastings he knew how raw they were seeing those same evolutions performed by professionals for whom they were second nature rubbed his nose in it lines perfectly dressed regimental banners and union jacks waving in the breeze off the ocean the english troops advanced victor looked nervously out into the atlantic to his vast relief he saw no warships their fire could have enfiladed his line and made him fall back and he had no answer for them three hundred years earlier a fishing boat with a few swivel guns helped in the battle of the strand blasting sir richard neville off his horse made sure atlantis would have no native kings naval gunnery had come a long way in those three centuries and now the artillery was on the kings side come back general someone called from behind the abatis you dont want to make yourself a bullseye for them victors uniform wasnt so resplendent as all that he would have felt embarrassedto say nothing of weighted downby all the gold braid and medals and buttons english generals wore to declare who they were but a man standing out in the open in front of his sides works was bound to be a target victor picked his way back through the abatis tangled branches it wasnt easy that was why the obstruction was there thinking of the way the opposing general dressed reminded him of something riflemenaim at their officers he shouted the more of them we kill the better off we are he didnt have that many riflemen most of the ones he did have came from the backwoods where every shot had to count a rifle was accurate at three or four times the range of a smoothbore musket but was also slower to reload and quicker to foul its barrel an atlantean field gun roared victor watched the ball kick up din in front of the english line and bound forward it bowled over two redcoats like ninepins other soldiers smoothly stepped forward to take their places more atlantean guns fired enemy fieldpieces replied a rending crash said a ball smashed a gun carriage that cannon was out of action for the rest of the battle enemy bugles blared the soldiers in the first two ranks brought their muskets down to the horizontal their bayonets flashed in the sun barbarians facing the roman legions must have known that shock of fear as the legionaries spearheads all glittered as one it had lost none of its intimidation over the centuries between caesars day and victor radcliffs the bugles blared again here came the redcoats at a steady marching pace the first ranks muskets probably werent even loaded general howe wanted them to win with the bayonet if they got in among the atlanteans chances were they would too only a few of victors men had the sockets and long knives that turned muskets into spears the rest would have to fight back with clubbed guns or with knives a cannon ball tore through the redcoats ranks injured men fell or fell out others moved up to replace them the soldiers knew getting killed or maimed was all part of the job they didnt get excited about itunless it happened to them atlantean riflemen started firing a captain or major his epaulets proclaiming his rank clutched at his shoulder and went down another officer fell a moment later and then another the ones who remained kept coming english officers werent professionals like the men they led that didnt mean they lacked courage though on the contrarya man who showed fear in front of his fellows was hardly a man at all wait till you can see what theyve got on their buttons then blow em all to hell a sergeant shouted to the musketeers he led good advice their guns werent accurate much farther out than that now someone else yelled and a blast of fire ripped into the english soldiers redcoats staggered redcoats stumbled redcoats screamed redcoats fell and the redcoats who didnt stagger or stumble or scream or fall came on another volley tore into them and another the third one was noticeably more ragged than the first by the time it came the enemy was almost to the wall and the abatis the blast of lead proved more than even the bravest or most stoic flesh and blood could bear sullenly the redcoats drew back out of range now and then stopping and stooping to help a fallen comrade cheers rose from the atlanteans we whipped em by jesus somebody cried which set off new rejoicing knowing the men his army faced victor wasnt so sure and damned if the redcoats didnt reform their lines and make ready to come at the atlanteans again their field guns turned on the abatis across the road the fallen trees might hinder soldiers but they didnt keep out roundshot a man hit square by a cannon ball turned into something only a butcher would recognize and a man speared by a branch a cannon ball tore loose was in no enviable situation either a few atlanteans couldnt stand the cannonading and fled they were raw troops men whod never come under fire before most of the new men stood it as well as any veterans victor was proud of them he was also astonished though he never would have told them so on came the englishmen again this time they sent fewer troops against the stone wall and more against the area protected by the abatis this time too they stopped and delivered two volleys of their own before rushing the atlantean field works bullets snapped past victors head a wet thud said a man next to him was hit the atlantean clutched his chest and crumpled to the ground his musket falling from his hands victor snatched up the firelock he aimed at a redcoat pushing through the abatisa man from howes forlorn hope if the gun wasnt loaded what do i lose he thought and pulled the trigger the musket bucked against his shoulder the redcoat went down grabbing his leg victor had aimed at his chest with a smoothbore you were glad for any hit you got another man from the forlorn hope fell half his jaw shot away but the english soldiers were making paths their friends could follow and follow the redcoats did some of them fell more stepped over corpses and writhing wounded and set about doing what they knew how to do massacring amateurs who presumed to stand against them the atlanteans were brave in closequarters fighting like that it probably did them more harm than good they rushed forward clutching any weapons they hadand the redcoats emotionlessly spitted them with their bayonets the englishmen had the edge in reach and they had the edge in training and they used both without mercy victor might have fed his whole force into the fight as a man fed meat into a sausage grinder the atlanteans would be gone and they would have gone down he saw as much a little more slowly than he might have back he yelled fall back the atlanteans obeyed him with more alacrity than theyd ever shown marching north from new hastings theyd had enoughtheyd had too muchof the horrible redcoats watching them break away from the english troops victor tasted gall he wondered if the rebellion would smash to bits at the first test form ranks he shouted hoping they would give them a volley he added praying they would show them youre not whipped he said fearing they were and damned if the atlanteans didnt obey him again the ranks werent neat enough to delight an english drillmasters heart the volley was on the ragged side too but it was enough to knock the redcoats back on their heels theyd come after the settlers aiming to break them all at onceand theyd got a nasty surprise withdraw fifty yards and give them another one victor commanded the men he led did as he told them to this volley was fuller thicker than the one before more english soldiers went down now the redcoats seeing that they couldnt force a decision with the bayonet alone began loading their muskets again too they rebuilt their own battle line with marvelous hasteand much bad language from their sergeants and they traded several volleys with the atlanteans both sides banging away at each other from less than a hundred yards that was warfare as it was practiced on the battlefields of europe organized mutual slaughter more bullets cracked past victor radcliff than he could keep track of none of them bit he had no idea why not either god loved him or he was luckier than he deserved hed begun to think he was luckier than he deserved in the men he led too they stood up under that pounding as well as the redcoats oh a few men slipped off toward the rear but only a few victor told off several companies of new hastings troops to serve as his rear guard no settlement not even croydon in the north despised royal authority more than new hastings having disposed of one wouldbe king on their own soil new hastings men had little use for anyone else who tried to tell them what to do they held off the redcoats and let the rest of the army fall back toward weymouth then they too broke free general howe showed little appetite for the pursuit less than victor would have in his place maybe that said something about him maybe it said something about what the atlanteans had done to his army even in defeat victor radcliff looked around for blaise he found the negro with a bloody rag wrapped around the stump of his left middle finger stupid thing he said hurts like a mad bastard too he looked more angry than stunned as wounded men sometimes seemed get some poppy juice from the surgeons victor told him it will dull the pain a little anyhow plenty need it more than i do blaise said plenty need it less too go on thats an order victor said what point to being a general if you couldnt tell a sergeant what to do blaises yes sir was as mutinous an acceptance as victor had ever heard but it was an acceptance hed take what he could get he hadnt beaten the english but hed given them a better fight than they must have dreamt of in their wildest nightmares hed take what he could get there too the retreat went on he had no choice about taking that the atlanteans fortified weymouth if general howe wanted to break into the seaside town with men shooting at him from behind barricades and out of windows and ducking back around corners he was welcome to try so victor thought anyhow his men also seemed ready for another crack at the english hell yes let em come one of them said well give em a bloody nose and whip em back to their mamas general howe unfortunately didnt seem inclined to play victors game his warships perhaps slowed by contrary winds arrived two days later they lay offshore and bombarded the town the atlanteans field guns fired back but that was more to make the men feel better than for any other reason threeand sixpounders couldnt reach the menofwar and might not have been able to pierce their thick oak timbers even if they had when a ball from a twentyfourpounder hit a house or an inn on the other hand the building was likely to fall down and when a ball from a twentyfourpounder hit a man or several men what happened after that wasnt pretty the gravediggers got more work than the surgeons did the ships were still there the next morning as soon as the sun climbed up out of the atlantic they started cannonading weymouth again they fired slowly and deliberately one roundshot every few minutes again the atlanteans returned fire but with no great hope of success they fearfully awaited each incoming cannon ball flash and smoke came first after thembut well after proving sound traveled slower than lightcame the boom from the gun victor had the displeasure of watching each roundshot arc through the summery air toward weymouth then another crash would announce more destruction the slow steady bombardment had a horrid fascination to it victor almost forgot to breathe as he waited and tensed himself before each new explosion he hoped each round would fall harmlessly yet feared each one would not surgeons and dentists worked as fast as they could to get the agony over with in a hurry the royal navy here operated in just the opposite way their officers wanted the atlanteans to suffer for a long time victor radcliff figured that out right away the royal navy officers also wanted something else they wanted to use the deliberate cannonading to blind the atlantean rebels to everything else that was going on they got what they wanted too along with everyone else in weymouth victor spent the day staring fearfully out to sea bracing himself for the next thunder from a gun sir general radcliff sir by the exaggerated patience in the mans voice hed been trying to draw victors notice for some little while huh victor said in less than a minute now one of the guns on the fleet out there would speak what else mattered next to that he found out sir weve had a deserter come in youd better hear what hes got to say about general howes army general howes army victor said slowly he realized that confident in the works in and around weymouth hed almost forgotten about the redcoats and he belatedly realized that wasnt the smartest thing he could have done he blinked then blinked again like someone coming out from under the spell of that french charlatan mesmer flash boom a roundshot bigger than his clenched fist flying through the air swelling swelling crash the royal navy did its best to keep him bemused but hed been distracted pulling him back under the spell wasnt so easy all right bring this fellow to me hed seen a lot of english soldiers like this one the two chevrons on the fellows left sleeve proclaimed him a corporal he was short and skinny and pockmarked he had two missing front teeth his pale eyes wouldnt light on victor he looked like a man who would cheerfully murder for the price of a pot of ale he also looked like a man who would keep coming forward no matter what any opponent tried to do to his battle line well victor said well its like this your honor the corporal said in a clotted london accent general owe es moving inland around your bloody flank e aims to get between you and new astings e does sweet suffering jesus victor said that would put himand the atlantean assemblyin a very nasty spot if it was true he eyed the deserter and you came in to tell me this because flash boom flying roundshot crash the redcoat hardly seemed to notice let alone get excited why your honor ill bloody well tell you why he brushed his chevrons with a scarred hand on account of over there ill be an old man by the time i make sergeant if i ever do i took the kings shilling to keep from starving well ive done that any road but if i want to make summat of myself if i want to be a lieutenant saylike a lot of englishmen he pronounced it leftenantive got a better chance ere than i ever wouldve there and so i lit out i did lots of englishmen came to atlantis because they thought they could do better here than in the cramped traditionfilled mother country this corporal wasnt the first deserter from howes army nowhere near but none of the others had brought such important news whats your name victor asked him pipes your honor he answered daniel pipes all right pipes im going to send out riders to check what youve said victor feared he knew what they would find the deserters news had a dreadful feel of probability to it he went on if they show youre telling the truth youre sergeant daniel pipes on the spot how high you climb after that is up to you the redcoat stiffened to rigor mortislike attention his salute might have been turned on a lathe a couple of watching atlantean soldiers sniggered that kind of stern discipline was what they were righting against but victor knew it had its merits in winning wars much obliged your honor pipes said hash boom victor watched the cannon ball come in crash i think were the ones obliged to you he said how big a march had general howe stolen how much bigger would it have been if not for daniel pipes radcliff sent out the riders hed let the ships distract him but he wouldnt make that mistake any more what other mistakes he might make he would discover only by making them a new question rose in his mind how often could he count on help from english deserters that brought up another new question how often would atlantean deserters help the enemy he knew hed already lost some men to desertion he hadnt thought till now about how much it might mean hash boom pause crash screams followed this shotit must have come down on a building with people inside victor swore no wonder the royal navy had been able to mesmerize him for a while the next roundshot missed him by only about twenty feet nasty thing pipes observed he hadnt flinched as the big iron ball bounded by neither had radcliff it wasnt the same as a bullet snapping past victor didnt know why it wasnt but he was sure of the fact a couple of hours went by the bombardment went on he thanked heaven the cannonading hadnt started a fire in weymouth that was nothing but luck as he knew too well fire was any towns biggest nightmare once it took hold it was next to impossible to quell hoofbeats clopped on dirt as a horseman trotted in well victor called theyre moving all right the scout answered heading around our left flank but i think you can still pull out all right thats what she said victor remarked and the horseman laughed his men werent sorry to leave weymouth who in his right mind would have been he marched away from the little seaside town as quietly as he could the longer the royal navy took to realize he was gone the better boom crush he couldnt see the flash or the flight of the ball any more the sound though the sound pursued can those ships do this at new hastings too blaise asked we do have forts there but i dont know if they would stop them victor answered mmkmtn the negro said a fraught noise if ever there was one how are we ever going to win the war then that was a better question than victor radcliff wished it were most of atlantis is out of the range of the royal navys guns he said that was true he was less sure how helpful it was if the atlantean assemblys army couldnt safely stay by the coast the enemy gained an important advantage atlantis had ships of its own as befit a land that made much of its living from fishing and whaling and slaving and trading with the mother country and when the mother country wasnt looking trading with other people too some of them went armed piracy wasnt what it had been in the wild days of avalon more than a hundred years before but it wasnt dead either how many carried enough guns to face a royal navy frigate any victor knew too well none could face a firstrate ship of the line if howe comes at us and the ships come at us can we hold new hastings blaise persisted we can try victor said that didnt sound strong enough even to him so he added we have to try blaise nodded and didnt say anything more it was less of a relief than victor had thought it would be general howes skirmishers pushed toward the coast the atlantean armys skirmishers pushed them back and took a few prisoners they hauled one of them in front of victor radcliff the redcoat acted more aggrieved that hed been caught what are you buggers doing marching along down here he said they told us you were still back in bloody weymouth well youve learned something then havent you victor answered the prisoner scowled at him whats that not to believe everything you hear victor said blandly what the redcoat said then wasnt fit for polite company the atlanteans gathered around him laughed he seemed even less happy about that the atlanteans thought he got funnier as he got louder general howe began pressing harder on the atlantean armys flank that was a problem victor could deal with though a small rear guard sufficed to slow down the redcoats and let the rest of his men get ahead of them on the road down to new hastings he wondered what would happen when he got there by now the atlantean assembly would know he hadnt held weymouth would they take his command away from him he shrugged if they did they did that was all the next interesting question would be whether he could hold new hastings it certainly had better works than weymouth did but like weymouth it was a seaside town if the royal navy wanted to lie offshore and bombard it victor didnt know how he could respond he shook his head that wasnt true he knew how he couldnt he didnt like that but he knew it and if he lost new hastings the echo of its fall would reverberate throughout atlantis if new hastings came under the redcoats boots would the rest of the land think the fight was still worth making victor really had no idea about that nor did he want to find out the best way to keep from finding out would be to hold new hastings he hoped he could another rider came in from the west theyre starting to turn in on us for true sir he reported they would victor said and then did you see any fence or stone wall that runs more or less north and south something we could fight behind i mean plenty of em the man answered these new hastings folk theyre as bad as the people up by croydon for walling themselves away from their neighbors by the way he talked he came from somewhere close to freetown well to the south of new hastings he could sneer at new hastings folk as much as he wanted but his own settlement held a far higher proportion of men loyal to king george he wasnt thoughand hed given victor radcliff the answer the atlantean commander wanted to hear good victor said if they want to charge us across open country theyre welcome to pay the butchers bill theyd done that north of weymouth and come away with a victory anyhow victor hoped general howe didnt care for what hed paid to get his victory he shouted orders swinging the atlantean army out of its retreat and off to the west to face the redcoats again he also sent more horsemen out ahead of his infantry he wanted them to lead the english army straight toward his that way he wouldnthe hoped he wouldntget taken in the flank once hed set things in motion he turned back to the courier whod brought word of howes swing take us to one of these fences glad to do it general the man brushed the brim of his tricorn with a forefingerprobably as close to a salute as victor would get from him the first fence to which he led the atlanteans wasnt long enough to let all of them deploy behind it victor didnt want them out in the open trading volleys with the redcoats the english were better trained than the settlers they could shoot faster and could also take more damage without breaking and if it came down to a charge and handtohand fighting all the redcoats had bayonets and so they went a little farther northwest and found a stone wall that seemed perfect it was more than a mile long and almost chest high if the musketeers steadied their firelocks on top of it as they shot they were likely to do better than smoothbores commonly could too sheep grazed in a broad meadow on the far side of the fence they looked up in mild surprise as the atlanteans took their places they didnt know enough to run if general howe declined this engagement victor radcliff suspected a good many of his men would enjoy a mutton supper tonight but howe did not decline victor saw the rising cloud of dust that marked the redcoats approach he listened to occasional pistol shots those would come from the two sides horsemen skirmishing with one another some of the atlantean mounted soldiers wore green coats others were in homespun and had only weapons and determination to mark them as fighting men they took refuge at either side of the atlantean position the english horsemen by contrast recoiled when they saw the enemy in arms in front of them they didnt push the attacknor would victor have in their place instead they rode back to give their commander the news that the rebels were waiting for them howes infantry came out onto the meadow not quite half an hour later victor peered at them through a brass spyglass a golden reflection caught his eye he had to smile there stood an english officergeneral howe himselfstaring back through a telescope almost identical to his own victor didnt much like what he saw he hoped the enemy general was even less happy with what his spyglass showed him field guns unlimbered and deployed to either flank of the redcoats english artillerymen opened fire maybe they hoped the cannonading would terrify their raw opponents a couple of balls slammed against the stone wall but didnt break through then one took off the head of a tall soldier who was looking out at the martial spectacle in front of him his corpse stood upright fountaining blood for several seconds before it finally fell even victor thought that might be plenty to frighten his men but it didnt seem to did you see seth there one of them exclaimed didnt know he had so much blood in him another replied sure went out in style didnt he the first man said nothing but admiration in his voice in spite of himself victor radcliff smiled the atlanteans were turning into veterans in a hurry general howes men were already veterans without fuss or wasted motion they swung from column to line of battle staying out of range of both muskets and rifles as they took their places victor ordered his handful of field guns into action they knocked over a few redcoats the rest kept on with their evolutions as if nothing had happened drums and fifes moved the englishmen forward the field guns cut swaths in their advancing ranks they closed up and kept coming victor wondered if they would charge with the bayonet again he hoped so he didnt think they would be able to stand the gaff if they tried but howe proved able to learn from experience having suffered from one charge he had the redcoats halt about eighty yards from the fence that sheltered the atlanteans the first rank went to one knee the second stooped to fire over their shoulders the third stood straight fire victor yelled and the atlantean volley went in before the english soldiers could start shooting redcoats crumpled redcoats writhed and redcoats opened fire musket balls smacked the stone fence and they smacked soft flesh atlanteans screamed atlanteans reeled back clutching at themselves the first three ranks of redcoats retired and began to reload the next three stepped forward the first of them went to one knee the second stooped the third stood straight they all fired together then they retired and also began to reload three more ranks of english soldiers delivered another volley by that time the first three ranks were ready to fire again they did then the regulars charged theyd taken casualties all through their volleysthe atlanteans had blazed away at them too and victors menthose of them still on their feetdelivered a couple of more ragged volleys as the redcoats rushed at them a few fieldpieces fired canister into the english soldiers the sprays of lead balls tore holes in the redcoats ranks they came on regardless at the wall they stabbed with their bayonets driving the atlanteans back then the englishmen started scrambling up and over more of them got shot doing that once they dropped down on the east side they lashed out with those bayoneted muskets again at close quarters victor radcliffs men had no good answer for them guts spilled out onto the trampled bloodstained grass back victor shouted back form lines give them a volley he wondered if the farmers and cobblers and millers and ropemakers and horse dealers would listen to him theyd faced the redcoats twice now and been forced from strong positions both times why wouldnt they want to break and run after that they didnt not so neatly as their foes would have done it they drew back fifty yards formed up and gave howes men a volley fire rippled up and down their ranks any english sergeant worth his stripes would have screamed at them for such ragged shooting some of the atlantean sergeants did scream at them victor was just glad theyd fired at all give them one more he yelled one more and then fall back again this volley was even more ragged than the one before had been the atlanteans remained in order though a force in being theyd hurt the redcoats too victor could see a lot of dead and wounded english soldiers on both sides of the wall he could also see a lot of dead and wounded atlanteans the army that held the field was the one that won the battle so it had been in ancient days and so it was still general howes army would hold this field as it had held the one north of weymouthas it now held weymouth itself they arent so tough somebody not far from victor said the settlers withdrew give us big old knives on the end of our firelocks and well make em sorryjust see if we dont damn right lemuel the fellow next to him replied they both nodded as if to say well thats settled victor had lost two bat ties and one town all of a sudden he didnt feel nearly so bad chapter new hastings again victor radcliff had hoped he wouldnt see it so soon hed hoped he wouldnt see it at all hed dreamt of driving the redcoats before him as if he embodied the horsemen of the apocalypse why not drive them back to hanover why not drive them out of hanover out of atlantis altogether well now he knew why not general howes soldiers were better trained than his the royal navy had cost him more trouble than hed expected too and so new hastings again he went to the ancient redwood church to report his two failures to the atlantean assembly those worthy patriots would already know hed lost two battles if anything outran the wind it was rumor but the forms had to be observed the assemblymen were his superiorsthe only superiors he had they were as much of a government as the rebellious settlements had here and there english governors persisted nobody said much about that to custis cawthorne stolidly victor told the assembly what had happened we did succeed in removing the munitions from weymouth before english forces reached the town he said did you succeed in removing weymouth itself an assemblyman asked his name if victor remembered rightly was hiram smith he came from new marseille in the far southwest unfortunately no victor answered smith went on as if he hadnt spoken i think you did sir you removed it from free atlantis and returned it to king george a low ripple of laughter ran through the church a split second later it came echoing back from the high vaulted ceiling mr smith you may have your sport with me if it please you victor answered not showing the rage that griped his belly we did i believe what we could do with what we had the men showed themselves to be uncommonly brave they fought hard and spiritedly holding their ground well against professional soldiers and retaining their morale even when fortune failed to smile on them true they did not triumph but even in defeat they cost the enemy dear and they remain both willing and able to fight again when called upon to do so any deficiencies in their conduct must accrue to me not to them custis cawthorne rose and straightened he made something of a production of it as he made something of a production of most things looking out over the tops of his spectacles at the gentlemen of the atlantean assembly he said my friends i should like to propose a resolution concerning general radcliff say on mr cawthorne said redheaded isaac fenner who held the gavel you will anyhow your servant sir cawthorne dipped his head in fenners direction be it resolved then that we imitate the roman senate after the battle of cannae the worst defeat rome ever knew the conscript fathers voted their official thanks to the surviving consul caius terrentius varro because he had not despaired of the roman republic let us confer the same honor upon general radcliff for the same reason it is so moved fenner said do i hear a second he heard several cawthornes motion swiftly passed fenner nodded to victor radcliff you see we do not despair of you and may you never have cause to despair of us thank you and thank you all victor was more moved than hed imagined he would be let me also say i hope and pray we suffer no defeat worse than these two for they truly were close hardfought struggles we have shown king george and his ministers that we can confront their minions in arms custis cawthorne said we have not shown that we can beat them hiram smith put in that may not prove necessary cawthorne said as long as we stay in the field as long as we fight as long as we annoy we drain englands treasury and make her people despair of victory sooner or latergod grant it be soonerthey will tire of trying to force us to an allegiance we detest there are more ways to win a war than by gaining glory on the battlefield none surer smith said none quicker isaac fenner nodded to victor what are your views in this regard general winning in the field is victory radcliff replied not losing in the field may eventually be victory depending on our continued resolve and englands eventual impatience i prefer to win if forthright victory eludes me i will do what i can to maintain the fight that seems reasonable fenner said judiciously try it anyway custis cawthorne added as always mr cawthorne your sentiments do you credit fenner said credit is all very well but cash is better the printer replied as we are discovering to our dismay isaac fenners large ears twitched cawthorne had struck a nerve the atlantean assembly had no sure power to tax it could ask the parliaments of the several settlements for cash but they were under no obligation to give it any if they didntwhich happened much too oftenthe assembly paid with promissory notes not gold or silver the war was still young but merchants already traded those notes at a discount have you gentlemen any further need of me victor asked i thank you for the great honor you have conferred upon me but i believe it would be best if i returned to my troops and saw to the defenses of this city i think weve finished with you custis cawthorne looked around the assembly seeing no dissent he went on and i am glad todays resolution pleases you it is after all worth its weight in gold the full force of that didnt strike victor till hed left the old church then belatedly it hit him like a ball from a fortytwopounder he staggered in the street and almost bumped into a woman in a lacy bonnet she sent him a reproachful glare as she sidestepped your pardon maam victor said the woman only sniffed and hurried away victor shook his head still chuckling under his breath that old reprobate he ought to be ashamedexcept he has no shame at all blaise looked at his hands they hadnt been soft before even so they were blistered and bloody now i dug in front of nouveau redon he said since then i forgot how much of soldiering is pick and shovel work missing one finger couldnt have made things any easier he rubbed grease on his abused palms by his expression it didnt help much a privilege of being a general was not having to imitate a mole victor radcliff clucked when that figure of speech crossed his mind england had moles so did the mainland of europe and so did terranova atlantis had none nor any other native viviparous quadrupeds but for bats in their place burrowing skinks went after worms and underground insects here his ancestors had left england more than three centuries before habits of speech from the mother country still persisted though he wondered why sometimes the spade is as useful as the musket he said trying to clear his mind of moles sometimes being on the wrong end of the one hurts almost as much as with the other blaise replied tartly he might have been right about that whether he was or not fieldworks would help the atlanteans hold general howes army away from new hastings victor worried less about the royal navy here than he had up at weymouth unlike the smaller town new hastings already had seaside works to challenge warships theyd been built to hold off the french but no law said they couldnt fire at menofwar flying the union jack afterwards radcliff remembered hed had that thought only a few minutes before the distant thunder of cannon fire from the coast made him jump big goddamn guns blaise remarked arent they just victor said and ran for his horse the beast stood not far away he untied it sprang up onto its back and rode for the shore as fast as it would carry him sure as the devil english frigates and menofwar tried conclusions with the coastdefense batteries if they could smash the forts and silence the guns they would be able to bombard new hastings at their leisure the menofwar carried bigger guns than any the forts mounted but the starshaped forts had walls not of oak but of bricks backed by thick earth their long twelvepounders could shoot as far as any warships guns and they could fire redhot shot which was too dangerous to use aboard ship if a redhot ball lodged in a manofwars planking somewhere right around here all those years ago edward radcliffe and his first party of english settlers had landed theyd killed honkers and fought against redcrested eagles now reckoning themselves englishmen no more their descendants fought against redcoats and royal navy alike crash a big cannon ball from one of the english ships smashed bricks in a forts outer wall but the earth behind the bricks kept the ball from breaking through cannon inside the fort bellowed defiance gray smoke belched from their muzzles they might well be using the powder saved from weymouth at least one ball struck home victor could hear iron crashing through oak across close to half a mile of water he hoped it was a redhot roundshot and that the english warship would catch fire and burn to the waterline none of the royal navy vessels out there did he might have known they wouldnt that would have been too easy they went right on exchanging murder with the seaside forts and one of them noticed the lone man on the strand maybe a seagoing officer turned a spyglass on victor and noticed he was dressed like an officer any which way two or three cannon balls whizzed past him and kicked up fountains of sand unpleasantly close to where he stood he wasnt ashamed to withdraw one man armed with sword and pistol was impotent against a royal navy flotilla or was he one man with sword and pistol was certainly one man armed with a working brain victor smiled to himself he could almost hear custis cawthorne asking the question in just those terms more than a hundred years before the pirates of avalon had discommoded a fleet of atlantean english and dutch menofwar with fireships a few fishing boats were tied up at the piers that jutted out into the sea the wind lay against them though whatever victor came up with that wouldnt work despite the cannonading atlantis flag still flew defiantly over the forts the union jack differenced with a redcrested eagle displayed in the canton from a distance it hardly looked different from the flag the enemy flew we need a better banner victor thought one that says right away who we are he suddenly started to smile again by god he said better banners came in all sortsor they might victor shouted for runners and sent the young men to the forts before long a new flag went up over them as well as over the city as a whole no doubt the officers of the flotilla could make out what that flag meant it warned that yellow fever was loose in new hastings that flag told a great thumping lie the yellow jack hardly ever came this far north it broke out in freetown now and again and more often down in what had been french atlantis but while atlanteans knew that englishmen might well not the warning of flags wouldnt keep the royal navy from bombarding the forts it might prevent a landing by royal marines and it might make general howe think twice about assailing new hastings no general in his right mind would want to expose his troops to yellow fever howe would think the atlantean rebels were welcome to a town stricken by the disease he might even think it gods judgment upon them whatever he thought he would think staying away was a good idea that much victor foresaw he didnt tell the men of the atlantean assembly that the flags lied sometimes the less you told people the betteror more secret some of them rapidly discovered pressing business well away from new hastings they preferred risking capture by general howe to the yellow jack isaac fenner came up to victor and said i had not heard this plague was among us neither had i victor didnt care to use the lie direct even if the lie indirect troubled him not at all the current speaker of the atlantean assembly raised a gingery eyebrow i see so the wind sits in that quarter does it it does radcliff replied and i will add sir that your discretion in this regard may keep it from swinging to some other less salubrious one salubrious is it fenners eyebrow didnt go down youve been listening to custis again better entertainment there than in most of the taverns victor said and less chance of coming away with a chancre or anything else you dont want you may tell him sir i rely on his discretion then you must believe all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds fenner said i do believe that candidly victor said and the speaker winced victor went on whether the same may be said for the world in which we find ourselves may be a different question so it may isaac fenner agreed cawthornes experience as he will tell you at any excuse or none is that three may keep a secretif two of them are dead i should hate to impose such terms on the illustrious members of the atlantean assembly however tempting that might be victor said fenner grunted laughter victor added do tell him i dont want him haring out of town and risking his freedom for nothing i shall do that fenner glanced off to the northwest where general howes redcoats hung over new hastings like a rainfilled thunderhead and i trust that if the need for us to hare out of town should arise you will tell us in good time so we can tend to it without undue difficulty you have my word victor said he wouldnt have minded if the englishmen caught and hanged a few atlantean assemblymen nor would he have been surprised if fenner also had a list of men he reckoned expendable comparing the twoand say custis cawthornesmight have been interesting to say nothing of entertaining after the war is won victor told himself he smiled to himself doing anything at all after the war was won would be very fine maybe rumors of disease in new hastings gave the redcoats pause maybe howe would have gone after bredestown any which way the english commander seemed to like moving inland and then turning back toward the coast word of the deployment toward bredestown reached isaac fenner as soon as it reached victor radcliff that was no great surprise fenner came from bredestown and people from the threatened city naturally appealed to the man who represented them fenner came to the camp outside of new hastings to confer with victor can you save bredestown from the tyrants troops he asked im not sure victor said slowly even by trying to do so i risk losing that town and new hastings both in what way fenner asked his tone leaving no doubt that anything victor said would be used against him sighing victor answered that royal navy flotilla still lies offshore if we march up the brede toward bredestown the enemy is bound to learn of it what save the fictitious fear of the yellow jack then prevents him from landing a force of bullocks and sailors and seizing new hastings before we can return if the seaside forts fall as they may well from a landward assault nothing hinders the english warships from adding their weight of metal to the small arms the marines and sailors will have to hand under these circumstances i fear nihil obstat to use the popish phrase if we were to save bredestown from the redcoats like a lot of men from the city up the brede fenner thought it was at least as important as new hastings few people not bredestown born and bred shared that opinion victor didnt instead of coming out and saying so which would have affronted the speaker of the atlantean assembly he replied we have no assurance of holding bredestown even with all our forces collected in it and i would rather not do that if i can find any alternative why not fenner asked sharply because it lies on the north bank of the brede victor said i have never yet seen a manual of strategy advocating taking a position on a riverbank if there is danger of being pushed back which would be the case there what difference does it make fenner said several bridges span the stream at bredestown no doubt sir but if we have to try to cross them in a hasty retreat under fire from the enemys guns victors shudder was altogether unfeigned meaning no disrespect but i would prefer not to have to essay that would you prefer bredestown to fall into the blooddripping hands of king georges butchers then isaac fenners voice and the temperature of his rhetoric both rose dramatically as if he were making a closing argument in a court of law that didnt impress victor radcliff i know who the enemy is he said i surely fought alongside a good many of the redcoats now opposing us when we conquered french atlantis they are not fiends in human formalthough i may have to qualify that opinion if they import certain copperskinned mercenary bands from terranova do you suppose they would fenner asked anxiously if they use mercenaries at all i think them more likely to bring in german troops braunschweigers and hessians and the like germans are better disciplined and better armed victor paused on the other hand copperskins cost less that will matter to his majestys skinflint ministers even if not so much to him confound it fenner said you are telling me bredestown will fall and we can do damn all to stop that if we cant beat the damned englishmen why did we go to war against them because the other choice was submitting to tyranny and oppression victor said it looks as though we must submit to them anyhow fenner said you gentlemen of the atlantean assembly determined to take arms against king george you summoned me from a peaceful life as farmer and author to lead them victor said if now you repent of your determination or you would sooner have some other commander you need but say the word i assure you i will return without complaint and without regret to the life that late i led we entrusted you with command on the belief that you would lead our troops to victory against the redcoats fenner said instead we have suffered two sanguinary defeats we face the loss of bredestown the safety even of new hastings is far from assured your excellency i will say two things in response to that victor radcliff ticked them off on his fingers first i strongly believe general howes victories to have been far more bloody than our defeats he held the ground after both encounters but paid a high price for it and second sir mark this and mark it wellthe only assured safetys in the grave anything this side of it is subject to time and chance the speaker of the atlantean assembly sniffed loudly if you made as good a general as you do a philosopher mr radcliff i would face the coming struggle with the utmost confidence i on the other hand knowing my limits as a philosopher would face it with trepidation verging on terror victor replied your limits as a general are what concern me isaac fenner said we cannot simply abandon bredestown to the redcoats the atlantean assembly deplores the moral effect such an abandonment would have on atlanteans and on terranovans and europeans favorable to our cause for the reasons i just outlined to you your excellency holding it seems unlikely and all the more so unless you intend to risk new hastings victor said or has the assembly some clever stratagem in mind by which both towns may be preserved in our hands we hope and trust sir that you are the repository of such stratagems fenner answered he scratched his chin then leaned close to victor may i rely on your discretion here if you may not sir you chose the wrong general fenner grunted a pointa distinct point very well then this is for your ears and your ears alone do you understand say on victor told him if bredestown must be lost then it must fenner looked like a man with something sour in his mouth visibly pulling himself together he continued but bredestown must not be seen to be cravenly lost we must not appear incapable of fighting for it even if we prove incapable of holding it does that make any sense to you at all general whatever our weaknesses may be you do not care to advertise them to the world victor said slowly that is the nub of it yes isaac fenner sounded relieved victor got the feeling that had he failed to divine it he would have returned to the retirement of which hed spoken the head of the atlantean assembly went on socan you bloody howes men before you pull away i can try sir radcliff answered that is my home you know i shall rely upon you to make them pay a high price for it fenner said ill do what i can sir victor said that satisfied fenner which was fortunate because victor knew whether the speaker did or not hed promised nothing bredestown lay twenty miles up the river from new hastings victor thought it was the secondoldest english settlement in atlantis but wasnt quite surefreetown might have been older he knew some restless radcliffe had founded it in those longvanished days twenty miles inland were plenty to get away from your neighbors if only that were still true now victor marched his field artillery his riflemen and a regiments worth of musketeers up the brede from new hastings he left the rest of his force behind to make the royal navy think twice about landing marines the enemy admiral wouldnt be sure he hadnt left the whole army behind the enemy general wouldnt be sure he hadnt brought everyone along neither of them would be able to talk to the other not quickly or conveniently and so taking advantage of their uncertainty victor could do what isaac fenner wanted whether that was a good idea hed find out as the redcoats advanced on bredestown riflemen harassed them from trees alongside the road victor made sure all the snipers he sent forward wore the green coats that marked uniformed atlantean rebels general howe had started hanging snipers captured in ordinary coats hed sent the atlanteans a polite warning that he intended to treat such men as franctireurs victors protest that not all atlanteans could afford uniforms and that green coats were in short supply fell on deaf ears under the laws of war howe was within his rights to do as he did and victor knew some of the snipers were plucky amateurs not under his command or anyone elses but their own he also knew hanging them was more likely to make atlanteans hate england than to make them cower in fear if general howe couldnt see that for himself he watered the rebellion with the blood of patriots the more he did the more it would grow the redcoats came on despite the snipers the riflemen who obeyed victor radcliffs orders fell back into bredestown they went on banging away at the enemy from the houses on the northern outskirts of town if the atlantean assembly wanted victor to fight for bredestown he would do his best to oblige that august conclave general howe went on learning from some of his earlier battles he didnt send his men against bredestown in neat rows but in smaller more flexible storming parties if this is the game youre playing he seemed to say i can play too and so he could up to a point but victor had posted more riflemen in some of the houses closer to the brede as the redcoats pushed deeper into bredestown after cleaning out the first few houses there they got stung again english field guns unlimbered a couple of them set up too close to their targets riflemen started picking off the gunners before the cannon could fire the redcoats hastily dragged the guns farther away cannon balls could knock houses down a roundshot smashing into a wall sounded like a pot dropped on cobbles through his spyglass victor watched the redcoats cut capers when their artillerymen made a good shot after a while the riflemen fell silent that had to be what general howe was waiting for satisfied hed beaten down the opposition he finally formed his men in neat lines and marched them into bredestown closer and closer they came at victors orders the surviving riflemena larger fraction than howe would have guessedheld their fire he wanted the redcoats to draw near general howe might have learned something from his earlier fights but he hadnt learned enough several houses in bredestown concealed not riflemen but the meager atlantean field artillery the guns were doubleshotted with canister half a dozen musketeers standing near victor fired in the air to signal the field guns to shoot they roared as near simultaneously as made no difference the blasts of lead balls tore half a dozen great gaps in the english lines even from close to half a mile away victor heard the screams and moans of the wounded and dying hed hoped such a disaster would give the redcoats pause he knew it would have given him pause but hed reckoned without the english soldiers doggedness they stepped over their dead and injured comrades reformed their lines and trudged forward once more two or three of the atlantean guns fired again fresh holes opened in the ranks of general howes men again the redcoats reformed again they came on teams of horses pulled some of the field guns back toward the brede victor realized he would lose the restand lost guns were an almost infallible mark of a lost battle dammit i didnt intend to win this one victor muttered but he hadnt intended to lose cannon either whats that sir blaise asked nothing victor said which wasnt quite true up till now everything had gone the way hed planned it the field guns had taken such a toll among the redcoats hed started to hope they would cave in if you let your hopes take wing like that you commonly ended up sorry afterwards victor did in short order his riflemen and musketeers fought from house to house but they were outnumbered and he discovered the redcoats didnt seem inclined to take prisoners in this fight anyone they caught they shot or bayoneted he didnt like the reports he got on that but he also didnt know what he could do about it some of the smoke that rose from bredestown had the fireworks smell of black powder more and more though brought a fireplace to mind dry timber was burning how much of bredestown would be left by the time the fight for the place was over a runner came back to him colonel whitings compliments sir the man panted but he doesnt know how much longer hell be able to hold his position the redcoats are pressing pretty hard when dominic whiting said the enemy was pressing pretty hard any other officer would have reported disaster some time earlier from what victor had seen whiting liked his rum but he also liked to fight not only that he was good at it which not all aggressive men were my compliments to the colonel and tell him hes done his duty victor said i dont want him getting cut off he is to retreat to the bridges over the brede tell him that very plainly and tell him it is an order from his superior yes sir ill make sure he understands the runner sketched a salute and hurried away victor radcliff sighed when general howe told one of his subordinates to do something he could be confident the man would jolly well do it discipline in the english army wasnt just a matter of privates blindly obeying their sergeants it ran up the whole chain of command an atlantean officer would obey his superior if he happened to feel like it if he thought obeying looked like a good idea if saturn aligned with jupiter and mars was in the fourth house he wouldnt do it simply because hed got an order if atlanteans didnt love freedom and individualism they never would have risen against king george they wanted to go on doing as they pleased not as someone on the other side of the ocean wanted them to do a lot of the time they didnt want to do as someone on this side of the ocean wanted them to do either how were you supposed to command an army full of dedicated freethinkers anyway carefully victor thought it would have been funnywell funnierif it didnt hold so much truth you could tell a redcoat what to do hed do it or die trying if an atlantean didnt see a good reason for an order hed tell you to go to hell to victors relief dominic whiting did see a reason for the order to fall back so did his subordinate commanders if he couldnt get his majors and captains to obey he had as much trouble as victor did with him the order to retreat must have looked like a good idea to everybodyone more proof that howes men were pressing whiting hard an old man leaning on a stick came up to victor look what theyve done to our town he shouted in a mushy voice that proclaimed hed lost most of his teeth im sorry sir victor said the old man cupped his left hand behind his ear victor said it again louder this time sorry sorry why didnt you stay away from bredestown then the graybeard said they would have too and everything would have been fine things didnt work that way no matter how much victor wished they did explaining as much to the old man struck him as more trouble than it was worth and he had other things to worry about hed picked troops to get his men back over the bridges in good order the retreating soldiers didnt want to listen to them atlanteans seldom wanted to listen to anybodyone more demonstration of the thought that had occurred to him not long before he had hoped to have a cannon firing across every bridge to make sure english soldiers couldnt swarm after his own men losing some of the guns at the north end of bredestown ruined that scheme he posted three and sixpounders where he could and squads of musketeers where he had no guns the redcoats didnt push toward the bridges with great elan they might have suspected he had something nasty waiting for them again hed lost the battle but mauled the enemy while he was doing it he had he supposed met isaac fenners requirements once all the atlantean soldiers made it to the bredes south bank victor dealt with the bridges gunpowder charges blew gaps in a couple of stone spans his men poured tubs of grease on the wooden bridges and set them afire without boats general howes troops wouldnt cross here the closest ford was another twenty miles upstream he sent a detachment to hold it for a while well he said to no one in particular we did what we came here to do he would have felt happier about things if the moans of the wounded didnt make him wonder if it was all worthwhile chapter general howes army did not pursue victors as the atlanteans fell back toward new hastings the redcoats seemed content for the momentwith bredestown victor radcliff was not content to yield it to them his men had fought well but again not well enough a messenger from the atlantean assembly rode out to meet him halfway between bredestown and new hastings victor eyed the man with he hoped wellhidden apprehension what new disaster had the assemblymen sent him out to report general i am told to inform you yes out with it maybe victors apprehension wasnt so well hidden after all several hundred new recruits await your attention on your return sir i am also told to let you know that more than a few of them gave as their reason for volunteering the strong opposition the forces under your command have offered against the english tyrants murderers you are they do the atlantean assembly sent you to me for that victor couldnt hide his surprise bad news usually traveled faster than good and with reason bad news was the kind you had to do something about right away if you could most of the time good news could wait but the courier nodded thats right sir mr fenner and mr cawthorne both told me to tell you they know you are doing the best you can and the rest of atlantis seems to know it too well well victor said that didnt seem enough somehow so he said it again well well the splutters bought him a few seconds to think please convey my gratitude to the gentlemen of the atlantean assembly and particularly to mr cawthorne and mr fenner ill do that sir the messenger said thank you ill thank the recruits myself when i get back to the coast victor said the assembly has been gracious enough to note that i did not despair of the republic the same holds true for these volunteers and in rather greater measure if i fall finding a new general will be easy enough but if no one chooses to fight for atlantis our cause is dead dead beyond any hope of resurrection thats a fact now the man whod come out from new hastings sounded surprised not a fact you think about every day though is it maybe not victor knew damn well it wasnt the powers that be didnt want potential fighting men to realize how the shape of the future lay in their hands if they sat on those hands no war could go on for long the messenger sketched a salute well then im off ill pass things on like you said and i know your sergeants will whip the new chums into shape pretty damn quick his chuckle held a certain amount of anticipation gloating that too victor judged he felt better the rest of the way back to new hastings he wondered why nothing had changed general howe had still seized bredestown the second or thirdoldest city in english atlantis the redcoats were still likely to move on new hastings a regiments worth of raw volunteers wouldnt slow them down much less hold them back but the spirit that brought forth a regiments worth of raw volunteers would eventually if atlantis didnt lose the war before england got sick of fighting it that could happen it could happen much too easily as victor knew much too well i have to make sure it doesnt thats all he murmured easy enough to say something like that keeping the promise might prove rather harder small bands of atlantean cavalry still roamed north of the brede every so often they managed to cut off and cut up a column of supply wagons coming down to general howe some of what they took supplied the atlantean army instead some they kept and some they sold they thought of it as prize money as if they were sailors capturing enemy ships prize money though was a longestablished official custom theirs was anything but victor didnt complain he wouldnt complain about anything that made his men fight harder they didnt just loot he would have complained if they were nothing but brigands hed been back in new hastings only a few hours when a troop of horsemen brought in a glumlooking prisoner we caught him in civilian clothes general like you see one of the troopers said no wonder their captive looked glumthe laws of war said you could hang an enemy soldier caught in civilian clothes what else was he then but a spy how do you know hes a soldier at all victor asked the atlanteans whod brought in the captive we found this here on him sir one of the men handed him a folded letter radcliff unfolded it and read it it was a letter from general howe to the officer in charge of the royal navy detachment that was harrying new hastings you were going to give some kind of signal from the shore and theyd send a boat for you so you could deliver this victor asked the captive the man stood mutefor a moment then one of the atlanteans whod brought him in shook him like a dog shaking a rat answer the general you silly bugger if you want to go on breathing uh thats right the captive said unwillingly did you men read this victor asked the atlanteans whod caught him enough to see what it was one of them answered enough to see that you needed to see it right away and i thank you for that victor radcliff said but id like to read you one passage in particular general howe writes as before the resistance offered by the atlanteans in bredestown was unsettling even daunting they withdrew in good order after inflicting casualties we are barely able to support this rebellion has a character different from and altogether more serious than what we were led to believe before we embarked upon the task of suppressing it he folded the paper thats you hes talking about gentlemen think hell pack up and go home then asked the big man whod shaken the prisoner if he thinks he cant win why keep fighting reluctantly victor shook his head if howe kept advancing in spite of his losses victor wasnt sure he could keep him out of new hastings he didnt tell that to the atlanteans lest they be captured in turn or infect their comrades with the doubt theyd caught from him what he did say was no i think we need to give him a few more sets of lumps before hes ready to do that well we can take care of it the big atlantean said the others nodded they knew less than victor they didnt worry about things like why they didnt have more bayonets or where the gunpowder for the battle after the battle after next would come from that made them more hopeful than he was maybe their hope would infect him plaintively the englishman theyd captured asked what will you do to me ought to knock you over the head and pitch you into the brede better than you deserve too one of the atlanteans said the prisoner turned pale no no victor said cant have that or howes soldiers will start knocking our men over the head after they catch them ill fight that kind of war if i must but i dont want to well keep him as a prisoner till hes properly exchanged thats all thank you kindly your honor the englishman said if you let me go ill give my parole not to fight until im exchanged sorry i think wed do better to hold you for now victor replied let general howe think his letters been delivered he turned to the atlanteans whod captured the man keep him with our other prisoners and keep an eye on him we dont want him slipping away while our backs are turned right you are general the big man said he set a hand the size of a ham on the prisoners shoulder come on you the englishman perforce came the atlantean soldiers led him away victor radcliff slowly read through howes letter once more he nodded to himself nice to learn he wasnt the only commander with worries anyhow after taking bredestown the redcoats lay quiet for a fortnight licking their wounds victor thought though he had no idea whether that was the explanation then general howe cautiously began moving skirmishers down the brede toward new hastings atlantean skirmishers met them right away victor didnt want howe coming after him maybe a show of force would persuade the english that an attack on the oldest town in atlantis would prove more trouble than it was worth on the other hand maybe it wouldnt the redcoats kept pushing forward victor sent more of his army back toward the west to delay them he wished he could write general howe a stiff letter the continual pressure the englishman applied to his forces struck him as not the least bit sporting then nature took a hand it rained buckets sheets hogsheads the brede turned into a raging brown torrent that threatened to burst its banks and lay new hastings waste before howe could every road for miles around became a kneedeep quagmire and every firearm became no more than a fancy club or a wet spear if steel squelched when it struck flint no spark flew and keeping powder in the priming pan dry was a separate nightmare victor wished for a thousand armored knights all carrying lances as long as the rain lasted they might have driven the redcoats from the field but it wouldnt last he knew that all too well he set his men to work on field fortifications north and south of the brede if the english army wanted to try to bull through to new hastings he aimed to set as many obstacles in its path as he could no matter what a man aimed at he commonly got less victor did here earthworks sagged to muddy lumps as soon as they were built trenches turned to moats just as fast and rumbles of mutiny came from the soldiers they think youre trying to drown them blaise reported he eyed the general commanding maybe theyre right too no radcliff shook his head that is not so im trying to keep them from getting shot when the fighting picks up again but the rain drummed down on his tent he was standing in mud he had a cot that being one of the privileges a general enjoyed so he slept dryexcept when the tent leaked too many of his men slept in the open if they slept at all he sighed well give it up then sooner or later though the sky will clear after a week and a half it did general howe tried to get his army on the move as soon as he could which turned out to be too soon wagons and guns bogged down in the gluey mud the redcoats advance stopped almost before it got started if we could get at em we could slaughter em reported a scout charged with keeping an eye on the enemy some of their oxen are in it up to their bellies so are ours victor replied and what sort of time did you have coming back to bring your news to me wellthe cavalryman grimaced it wasnt what anybodyd call easyi will say that victor didnt attack the sun made everything from the grass to the soldiers wet clothes steam victor wondered how much of their powder was dry enough to fight a battle enough to shoot at all he had a few men fire their muskets most of the firelocks went off that was about as much as he could have hoped for even in the driest weather misfires were all too common scouts reported hearing musket fire from the redcoats too though theyd thought better for the moment of moving forward no doubt general howe was also making sure his soldiers could shoot if they had to sergeants exhorted men to push oily rags through their musket barrels to hold rust at bay radcliff could only hope the stubbornly independent atlanteans would listen over in the english army other underofficers would be telling the men they led the same thing the redcoats would obeyvictor was mournfully sure of that at last slowly and cautiously they did edge forward once more victors men skirmished and sniped from behind fences and trees the englishmen caught a sniper who was wearing a green coat and cut his throat leaving his body for his comrades to find we ought to do that to the next redcoat we catch a rifleman raged if they want to fight filthy we can fight filthy too his comrades shook their fists and shouted agreement do you intend this to be a war without quarter victor wrote to general howe if you do sir we shall endeavor to oblige you but murdering men taken prisoner only adds cruelty to the conflict without in the least changing its likely result he added details about the killing and sent oft the note under flag of truce an english junior officer carrying a white flag brought the enemy generals response the next day please accept my apologies and my assurances that such distasteful incidents shall not be repeated howe wrote the men responsible have been punished he didnt say how victor radcliff muttered to himself was it enough victor used a penknife to trim a quill then dipped the tip of the goose feather in a bottle of ink so long as these assurances be respected and observed we shall not reply in kind he wrote but if we meet with such barbarities again you may rely on our ability and intention to avenge ourselves by whatever means seem fitting very respectfully your most obedient servant he signed his name the subaltern whod brought general howes reply waited for victors the young man saluted as he might have done for his own commanding officer he took victors letter performed a smart aboutturn mounted his horse and rode off toward his own lines wars politesse as formal as a gavottes victor thought it doesnt stop us from killing one another it doesnt even slow us down much but it does make sure we do it by the rules his chuckle held a distinctly wry edge blaise had never got used to those rules he thought they were nothing but white mens foolishness he might have been right still and all though the whole business might have ended up even worse without them a few days later victor was wondering how the whole business could end up any worse the redcoats probed at the lines hed tried to set up to hold them away from new hastings they probed and they found that the lines werent nearly so solid as hed wished they were too many of his men hadnt learned how to stand up under an artillery bombardment most cannon balls harmlessly buried themselves in wet earth or went skipping over the landscape dangerous only if you were rash enough to try to stop one with your foot every so often though a roundshot would mash a manor two or three meninto a crimson horror not usually seen outside a slaughterhouse it was worse when the cannon ball didnt kill right away then the luckless soldiers shrieks spread his agony to every man who heard them and when the atlanteans having seen a few red horrors and heard a few agonized shrieks streamed out of a length of trench their opponents ruthlessly competent went in and took it away from them that threatened more atlantean companies with enfilading fire clever enough to see as much the men from those companies would pull back too and so little by little victors defensive position dissolved like a salt statue in the rain he wished for more rain the sun smiled down from a bright blue sky the small puffy clouds drifting across it only mocked his hopes he had to fall back two or three miles closer to new hastings and try to set up new positions from which to withstand the english advance one of his captains asked whats to keep that bastard howe from doing the same thing all over again victor radcliff gave him a bleak look nothing i can see he did set his riflemen to sniping at the english artillerists if the redcoats had trouble serving their guns they wouldnt be able to hurt his men so much the next time around he could also hope they wouldnt be able to intimidate the atlanteans so much and he sent a message back to new hastings warning the atlantean assembly he might not be able to hold the town you must prepare yourselves to leave expeditiously he wrote much as i regret to state it i cannot promise new hastings security nor your safety in the event the city falls he was watching the redcoats get ready to assault his newest makeshift defensive works when a horseman leaned down and thrust a folded sheet of paper into his hand from the atlantean assembly general he said thank you victor said though he didnt want his elbow joggled at just that moment no matter what he wanted he unfolded the paper he had to hold it a little farther from his eyes than he would have liked his sight was beginning to lengthen but isaac fenners hand was large and clear thank you for alerting us to what may come fenner wrote if need be we shall evacuate confident the fight will continue even without this town and expecting you to bloody the tyrannous foe here as you did at bredestown is everything all right sir blaise asked and then a moment later is anything all right now that you mention it radcliff replied no isaac fenner was a very clever manno doubt about it no doubt also that he would never make a soldier the atlanteans had had an easy retreat from bredestown if they were driven into new hastings where would they go once driven out again yes where victor asked himself he might need an answer soon anything i can do the colored sergeant inquired can you make the redcoats disappear can you give the atlantean assembly a dose of common sense victor said let me have a rifle sir and ill see what i can do about general howe blaise never lacked for confidence marksmen with rifles did their best to pick off enemy officers deliberately trying to assassinate the english commander however struck victor as surpassing the limits of decency moreover the redcoats were altogether too likely to try to return the disfavor he hoped that consideration didnt influence him too much when he replied im not sure how much point there would be his secondincommand is said to be a skillful officer kill him too blaise was ready to be as ruthless as the situation requiredor a bit more so if the opportunity arises victor said and not another word blaise snorted he knew victor wouldnt do anything along those lines victor did send out more snipers to try to discourage the redcoats from advancing they picked off a few englishmen maybe they slowed the enemys movements a little victor knew too well they didnt slow them much general howe methodically formed his men for the assault on the atlanteans positions in front of new hastings he put most of his strength on the right watching that victor realized what it meant if the english attack succeeded howe would try to pin the atlanteans against the brede and pound their army to pieces it had better not succeed then victor thought he shifted men to shore up his own left and moved cannon to cover that part of the field too he also posted a couple of companies to try to hold the road east to new hastings in case his army had to retreat down it by holding them out of the battle he made it a little more likely that the army would need to retreat but he also made it more likely that the force as a whole would survive to him that counted for more howe opened with a cannonading like the one that had frightened the atlanteans out of their lines farther west this time to victors vast relief his men seemed less alarmed atlantean guns tired back at the english troops every so often a roundshot would knock down a few men the redcoats stolidly reformed and held their ground victor hated and admired them at the same time they were too damned hard to beat on they came advancing to the music of fife drum and horn sunfire flashed from their bayonets the inexperienced soldiers facing them feared cold steel almost as much as they feared artillery they had reason to fear it too it gave the redcoats the edge in the handtohand atlantean muskets thundered the volley was sharper than it would have been when the uprising began victors men couldnt match howes in drill or discipline but knew more of the soldiers trade now than they had when the fighting started a great cloud of grayish smoke obscured the field and victors view of the oncoming englishmen not even his spyglass helped he swore how could he know what was going on through that manmade fogbank here and there fresh shots rang out from the atlantean position some musketeers having fired once could reload fast enough to send another threequarterinch ball against the redcoats before the foe reached them most men unfortunately werent so skilledor so lucky for a few seconds victor let hope run away with him maybe the insurrectionists fearsome volley had knocked howes men back on their heels some storms of lead were too much to bear hed seen that himself fighting against the french settlers in the last war and in the fight north of weymouth only a few weeks before some storms were but not this one the english soldiers burst through the smoke and began jumping down into the trenches that sheltered the atlanteans not only were the redcoats muskets bayoneted they were also all loaded while too many of victors men still struggled with powder charge and wad and ball and ramrod the atlanteans fought hard victor had seldom seen his summer soldiers do anything else if courage and ferocity were all it took to win the day but coldhearted professional competence also had its place and the redcoats had more of that than his men did while they also didnt lack for courage fighting and cursing the atlanteans fell back one wellsited gun loaded with canister shredded half a dozen redcoats no matter how perfectly disciplined the englishmen were that horrific blast slowed down their pursuit victor wouldnt have wanted to storm forward when he was all too likely to get blown to cats meat either half an hour later seeing that howes infantry would let his battered army escape again he said the best thing he could well were still in the fight by god yes sir blaise agreed and we still stand between the enemy and new hastings so we do but for how much longer victor wondered he didnt care for the answer he foresaw because he didnt he called for a messenger a young man on horseback rode up and touched two fingers of his right hand to the brim of his shapeless straw hat it might have been a salute it was more likely nothing but a friendly wave what do you need general the youngster asked take word to the atlantean assembly victor said tell them theyd better get out of new hastings while the going is still good by the time victors battered force limped into new hastings the atlantean assembly was already gone some people claimed the leaders of the rising against king george had fled north across the brede and then west towards atlantis sparsely populated interior others said theyd gone south in the direction of freetown and the formerly french settlements beyond victor had no sure way to judge which report was true when he rode into new hastings from the west men who had reason not to desire the return of english rule were abandoning the city in both directions had the royal navy not lain offshore he suspected plenty of people would also have fled by sea he wondered which way to take the army he was tempted to make his best guess about which way the atlantean assembly had gone then head in the opposite direction that way he could fight general howe without the useless advice and even more useless orders the assembly gave him reluctantly he decided that wasnt the proper course this wasnt his solo struggle against the redcoats it was atlantis fight if anybody represented atlantis the assembly did and if it was cantankerous and confused it accurately portrayed the people it served after some thought he took his own force north over the brede once more in the french settlements his men might be thought of as invaders no less than general howes they would also be reckoned no less english than the redcoats at least by the inhabitants whod dwelt in those parts longer than ten or fifteen years he sent messengers to the seaside forts ordering their garrisons away with the rest of his force they were precious far beyond their numbers in atlantis skilled artillerists didnt hatch from honkers eggs or maybe they did for the big flightless birds and their eggs were regrettably scarce these days especially in the bettersettled eastern regions the artillerists also brought out their lighter guns the ones that could keep up with the army they drove spikes into the touchholes of the heavier cannon and broke up their carriages doing their best to deny them to the enemy some of his men carried bits of this and that with them as they crossed the bridge over the brede loot from new hastings shops victor kept quiet about it many of those shops had been abandoned the proprietors who stayed behind were mostly men who favored king george radcliff would lose no sleep to see them plundered fires broke out in the old town even before the atlantean army finished evacuating it victor did hope the ancient redwood church would survive it had already seen two wars and three centuries losing it now would be like losing a piece of what made atlantis the way it was such considerations didnt keep him from blowing up the stone bridge after his army was over it the artillerymen from the forts did a firstrate job dropping part of the elliptical arch into the brede general howes men would take some time to repair it with luck that would mean theyd have a hard time pursuing the battleweary atlanteans victor hoped for luck as far as he could see his side hadnt had much up till now he was sure the english commander would laugh at him and complain that the redcoats hadnt caught a break since the fighting started no general since sulla had ever thought of himself as a lucky man come on come on victor called we can stand here gawping while new hastings falls but we cant stop it what we can do is get away and keep fighting we canand wed better so get moving boys well beat them next timesee if we dont he wondered if they would laugh at him or jeer at him or just ignore him and go their separate ways if they did he didnt know what he could do about it he didnt have much in the way of coercion ready to hand right now armies sometimes fell apart and damn all you could do about it to his surpriseno to his slackjawed amazementthe soldiers raised a cheer he doffed his tricorn to them the cheers got louder well whip em yet general somebody shouted you see if we dont damned right somebody else yelled huzzah for general radcliff and the national assembly someone else said that won him three cheers each louder than the one that had gone before the assembly had voted him their thanks because he hadnt despaired of the cause after a defeat the men he led seemed to deserve those praises more than he did he doffed his hat again and waved it and waited for the cheering to subside thank you men thank youfriends he said huskily thank you for the faith you show in me and thank you for the faith you show in atlantis as long as atlantis has faith in you i know we cannot possibly lose this war the redcoats have more training but you are fighting for your country for your homes in the end that will make all the difference in the world over on the other side of the brede general howes soldiers would be marching into new hastings they already held hanover and croydon farther north and most of the smaller towns along the coast in those parts too they had to think they were strangling atlantis freedom the way hercules strangled the serpents in his cradle when victor was down as he was now he had to think they were right but were they fighting had hardly touched the southem settlements or the west coast of atlantis and more to the point it had barely reached into the interior no english soldier had come within many miles of chasing margaret off the radcliff farm maybe im not lying to these fellows after all then victor thought by god i hope im not england sees the coast because thats what she trades with but atlantis is bigger than that atlantis was when you got right down to it several times larger than england scotland wales and ireland put together one of these days it would grow richer stronger and more populous than king georges realm when you looked at things that way how outrageous of georges soldiers to try to hold this land down by force for the moment though england was a man grown atlantis only a stripling no matter how much promise atlantis held england was strongerand better able to use the strength it had now staying in the fight wearing the enemy down that was what atlantis would have to do lets go men victor called we need to get away we need to make sure the damned redcoats cant catch us till were ready for them he respected howes engineers too much to imagine a blown bridge would keep them on the wrong side of the brede very long and we need to get in touch with the atlantean assembly again to find out what they require of us did i just say that he wondered but he did no doubt about it even if hed been at least half glad the assembly wasnt telling him what to do every chance it got if he had to decide everything on his own he would turn into something closer to king than to general the only thing he knew about kings was that he didnt want to be one dark clouds blowing over the green ridge mountains swept in front of the sun the day got cooler in a hurry all at once the air tasted damp more rain was coming for that matter fall was coming how much longer would either side be able to campaign in any serious way one thing rain would do as it had before it would turn the roads to mud the redcoats would have a devil of a time catching up to his army in bad weather their force would bog down worse than his in fact because they had more artillery and a bigger more ponderous baggage train his horse snorted softly its nostrils flared if that didnt mean it smelled rain he would have been surprised if i have a winters worth of time away from the english a winters worth of time to train my men to turn them into proper fighters victor radcliff nodded to himself even now the atlanteans proved they could confront hardened professional soldiers from across the sea with drill with discipline wouldnt they be able to rout the redcoats he hoped so sooner or later atlantis would likely need victories not just hardfought defeats chapter victor radcliff was a muchtraveled man all the same he didnt think hed ever been in horsham before he wasnt completely sure if atlantis had less memorable places than horsham hed long since forgotten about them a couple of tavernsone of which had a few rooms for benighted travelers and called itself an inna few shops a gristmill a smithy a few streets worth of houses horsham the atlantean assembly had come through the town he heard that at least a dozen times as he ate half a greasy capon at the tavern that didnt put on airs the men of the assembly had kept on heading northwest which only proved they had better sense than victor had credited them for they could have stayed here i dont know why they didnt said the girl who brought him the capon and fried parsnips and beer he could have told her but shed doubtless lived her whole life here and so didnt know any better besides she was blueeyed snubnosed and fullfigured that had more to do with his discretion even with rain pattering down he preferred his tent to anything horshams inn offered he was about to blow out the candle when a sentry nearby challenged someone victor reached for a pistol hed told blaise he didnt want to play the game of assassinations he had no guarantee general howe felt the same way a voice came out of the darkness it was a vaguely familiar voice but victor couldnt place it especially through the muffling raindrops then the sentry stuck his head into the tent despite a broadbrimmed hat water dripped from the end of his nose he sneezed before he said your cousin matthews here to see you general bless you jack and for gods sake tell him to come in before he drowns victor said he and matthew radcliffe were cousins but hardly more than in the sense that all men were brothers still the atlantean assemblyman from avalon wouldnt have come back from wherever the assembly had gone unless something urgent was going on victor hoped he wouldnt have anyway once inside the tent matthew shook himself like a wet dog he was as soaked as the sentry or maybe worse he sneezed too victor produced a flask of barreltree brandy here he said a restorative youre a good man general damned if youre not matthew radcliffe took a hearty nip ahh thatll warm me up or i hope it will i hope to jesus something will did you see noahs ark when you rode back here victor asked gravely after his own pull at the flask he didnt faze the man from the west see it the old man dropped me off just outside your camp generous of him victor wasnt about to let anybody outcalm him but small jests went only so far especially by the dim light from a candle why did you need to see me in weather like this because in honkers millwhich is where the assembly is right now and may stay a whilei met a man whod come over the mountains with news from avalon matthew radcliffe punctuated that with another sneeze god bless you victor drank from the flask again i dont suppose the news is good if it were it could have waited the bad is what they have to tell you as soon as they can too right his distant cousin agreed and i have bad news to give you all right the english damn their black hearts landed a band of coppers kin warriors from terra nova south of our town theyve got hatchets and bows and arrowsand muskets and powder and ball the englishmen gave emand theyre robbing and killing and burning and raping as they please to tell you the truth theyre having a rare old time good lord victor had talked about copperskinned mercenaries with isaac fenner but hed really expected to have to deal with germans terranovas east coast across the hesperian gulf from atlantis was dotted with dutch and english and spanish settlements there had been french settlements there too but king louis lost those along with the ones hed ruled here in atlantis white men were spreading into the interior of northern terranova but more slowly than they were in atlantis the barbarous copperskins fought against themor sometimes as here fought for them what can we do general matthew radcliffe asked can you spare men to send over the mountains or around the coast by sea the avalon militia is trying its best but a lot of our men have already come east to right the redcoats traveling across atlantis mountainous spine still wasnt easy small bands could make it living off the land as they went with farms and villages few and far between a real army was liable to starve on the way west most of the time sailing would have been a better bet in merchantmen or in fishing boats now now the royal navy was much too likely to snap them up like a cat killing mice that tried to sneak past it if i send a hundred men most of them ought to get to avalon victor said slowly and most of the ones who do ought to be able to fight how many copperskins did the english turn loose over there i dont know exactly matthew radcliffe replied im not sure anyone does knowexcept the savages and the damned sea captain who brought em may the devil fry his soul as black as his heart is already well are a hundred soldiers and your militiamen enough to put paid to them victor asked if they arent i fear you have more trouble than i know what to do with me i fear the same thing matthew said but god bless you general ill take your hundred men and gladly theyre a hundred more than i reckoned youd give me we have to hold avalon its our window on terranova victor radcliff said one of these days travel across atlantis will be easier the west will be more settled avalons the best harbor there far and awaynew marseille doesnt come close if the royal navy ties up in avalon bay if the union jack flies on the hills there theyve got us by the bollocks and theyll squeeze too theyll squeeze like anything god bless you matthew radcliffe said again too many easterners cant see any of that we ought to pay king george back for trying to bugger us this way that wasnt quite the figure of speech victor had used but it got the atlantean assemblymans meaning across matthew turned the subject anything left in that flask slosh a little victor handed it to him here god bless you one more time his cousin tilted his head back his throat worked he set the flask down not any more by christ he bared his teeth in something more snarl than smile but what the devil can we do to england in terranova the settlements there are quiet quiet as the grave if you ask me quiet as the tomb those bastards dont give a farthing for freedom if theyd risen with us king george would have a harder time of it to hell with me if he wouldnt am i right or am i wrong general oh youre rightno doubt about it i wish you werent but you are victor stared sorrowfully at the empty silvered flask which gave back what candlelight there was he wished he had another nip of his own well no help for it not right now anyway we ought to send missionaries to them the way the spaniards send missionaries to the copperskins theyve conquered matthew radcliffe said if they can turn nasty savages into papists cant we turn nasty englishmen into freedomlovers missionaries for a moment victor chuckled at the other mans conceit then his gaze focused and grew more intense like the suns rays brought together into a point by a burning glass missionaries he said again this time in an altogether different tone of voice youve got some kind of scheme matthew said tell me what it is instead of answering him directly victor clapped on a hat and stuck his head out into the pouring rain he spoke with jack for a minute or two the sentry let out a resigned sigh then he squelched off into the darkness you have got some scheme matthew radcliffe sounded half curious half accusing who me victor by contrast did his best to seem innocence personified by the look matthew sent him his best came nowhere close to good enough the assemblyman kept shooting questions at him victor ducked and dodged and finally said youll find out soon i hope that also failed to leave matthew radcliffe serene in due course jack returned thanks to the rains steady hiss he almost got back to the tent by the time victor made out his soggy footfalls and he came closer yet before victorand matthewcould hear that he wasnt alone whos he got with him matthew asked our very own jesuit panting to bring the heathen english settlers of terranova to the true faith of freedom ignoring the sarcasm victor radcliff nodded as a matter of fact yes right on cue the tent flap opened the man who stumbled inside didnt look like a jesuit or any other kind of missionary he looked like a drowned ratan angry drowned rat whatever this is couldnt it wait till the bloody morning he asked his accent strongly english matthew radcliffe glanced toward victor you have your own pet spy he inquired the newcomer glared at matthew you have your own pet idiot he asked victor matthew let me present to you master thomas paine victor said before things went beyond glances and glares master paine this is matthew radcliffe member of the atlantean assembly from avalon heand all atlantiscan use your persuasive abilities what persuasive abilities matthew radcliffe looked unpersuaded so did paine what does he need from me that i cant give as a soldier i did not come to atlantis for any reason but to seek my own freedom and some way to make a tolerable livingwhich i could not do in the mother country tell him whats happened by avalon matthew victor said and his distant cousin did victor went on if we can stir englands terranovan towns to rebellion she wont be able to do things like this to us again and she will have to divide her attention fighting two wars at once matthew still seemed dubious meaning no disrespect to master paine but why should he be able to rouse englands settlements on the far side of the gulf when weve had no luck at it up till now because he is the best speakerand especially the best writerwho backs our cause victor answered you give me too much credit paine murmured id better not victor told him better than uncle bobby better than isaac fenner than custis cawthorne for gods sake matthew radcliffe shook his head i dont believe it victor took a rumpled damp poorly printed flyer from new hastings out of a jacket pocket men are born and always continue freein respect of their rights he read the end of all political associations is the preservation of the natural rights of man and these are liberty property security and resistance of oppression the exercise of every mans natural rights has no other limits than those which are necessary to secure to every other man the tree exercise of the same rights the law ought to prohibit only actions hurtful to society what is not prohibited by the law should not be hindered nor should any one be compelled to that which the law does not require he looked up reading by candlelight was a trial you will have heard that i am sure who do you suppose wrote it isnt it from custis pen i always thought so matthew said victor set a hand on thomas paines wet shoulder meet the author if he cant set terranova alight no one will make it catch well maybe matthew radcliffe said you want me to go to terranova general paine sounded less than delighted at the prospect you want me to put aside everything i have in atlantis cross to avalon and sail over the hesperian gulf matthew radcliffe started to make apologetic noises victor cut him off master paine you are at the moment a common soldier in the atlantean army what precisely is it you have to give up pray tell thomas paine opened his mouth to answer then he closed it again before a single word crossed his lips he gave victor a crooked grin instead put it that way general and youve got a point can he really fire the terranovans matthew asked victor radcliff nudged paine what was it you said about william the conqueror and about how little hereditary monarchy means better matthew should hear it from you than from mei wouldnt get it right all i said was that a french bastard who landed with armed bandits and established himself as king of england against the consent of the natives was in plain terms a very paltry and rascally original paine quoted himself with obvious relish you see victor said to matthew all they have to do is listen to him even a little and hes bound to infect them you make me sound like the smallpox paine observed no you inoculate men with freedomand theres no inoculation against you victor said as for terranova better to inoculate than never by god paine and matthew radcliffe both winced the latter still seemed to need convincing maybe he said again give him something else victor told paine am i then auditioning for the stage paine asked for the most important stage of all the stage of the world victor radcliff replied that seemed to get home to the wet incendiary from england his voice grew lower deeper and altogether more impressive as he said call to mind the sentiments which nature has engraved in the heart of every citizen and which take a new force when they are solemnly recognized by all for a nation to have liberty it is enough that she knows liberty and to be free it is enough that she wills it you see victor said to matthew once more he can do it and do you propose to command me to make terranova free thomas paine asked i trust you note the irony involved i note it yes victor answered but having joined the atlantean army you do leave yourself open to command you know if you command me in any soldierly way i will obey you paine said but if you command me to play the politico do you not agree that that takes me out of the soldiers province master paine you are a weapon of war no less than a sixpounder victor radcliff said i hope you can harm the enemy more than any mere cannon might even one doubleshotted with canister will you tell me i may not aim you and fire you where you will have the greatest effect we need you master paine matthew radcliffe added the generaland yourselfhave persuaded me if terranova rises against king george too that all but guarantees the safety of avalon and the rest of western atlantis it ensures that the redcoats cannot carry copperskins across the hesperian gulf to harry our western settlements thomas paine sneezed bless you victor said paine waved that aside he rounded on matthew theyre carrying savages across the sea to assail us i had not heard that nor had i till he brought me word of it victor put in it is the truth damn them matthew radcliffe said then i must domust doeverything in my power to oppose them i had not thought they would stoop so low as to loose the copperskins against their own kith and kin thomas paine turned back to victor he sneezed again then he said if i am your weapon general aim me and fire me as you think best this kings wicked minions must be checked thank you victor said not until later did he wonder about the propriety of a commanding general thanking a common soldier at the moment he asked matthew radcliffe will you undertake either in your own person or through your fellow westerners to convey master paine to avalon as expeditiously as may be and thence to one or another of the english towns of eastern terranova whichever may seem most advantageous at the time i will general matthew replied to paine he added rest assured you also have my thanks and that of the atlantean assembly victor also didnt marvel at that till after the fact let me lay hold of my chattels such as they are and i am your man from that time forward paine said using barbarians to lay waste to civilization is to me unconscionable if the kings ministers and admirals fail to find it so what are they but mad dogs who deserve no better than to be hunted out of this land without waiting for an answer he plunged out into the rain afireeater matthew radcliffe observed making ready to follow him victor radcliff shook his head not quite he is a firekindler others will eat the flames he sparksand may they choke on them amen matthew squelched off into the night after thomas paine general howe seemed content to enjoy his control of most of the northeastern coast of atlantis in his shoes victor might have felt the same way the redcoats held most of the richest parts of the land and most of the towns that deserved to be styled cities from london that might have seemed almost the same as crushing the atlantean uprising underfoot on bad days it also seemed almost the same as crushing the uprising to victor radcliff but only on bad days when he looked at all the things hed failed to do holding hanover and new hastings topped the melancholy list beating the english in a pitched battle anywhere came next hed come close several timeswhich did him less good than he wished it did if he could have given the redcoats a black eye in any of their fights along the brede new hastings would still lie in atlantean hands the assembly would send its decisions and requests to the settlements from the oldest town in atlantis not from the grand metropolis of honkers mill an edict coming out of new hastings seemed much more authoritative than one emanating from a backwoods hamlet with a silly name winter gave victor the chance to drill his troops new recruits kept coming in both from the interior and from the coastal regions where king george nominally reigned supreme that was encouraging less so were the atlanteans who headed for home when their enlistment terms expired there were at least as many of them as raw replacements victor sent a letter to the assembly urging it to enlist troops for longer terms for the length of the war if at all possible the assembly forwarded the letter to each settlements parliament maybe those august bodiesthe ones not under the english boot anyhowwould do as he asked or maybe they wouldnt neither he nor the atlantean assembly could compel them sometimes he wondered whether the atlanteans wanted to rule themselves or whether they wanted no rulers at all they didnt give their assembly much to work with the english parliament had the power to tax its own folk it wanted the power to tax the atlanteans too victors people didnt aim to put up with that they didnt aim to put up with taxes from the atlantean assembly either anyone who tried to tax atlanteans did so at his peril victor also wondered how his people expected to pay for the war if they werent taxed the assembly was doing the best it could issuing paper money it promised to redeem with gold or silver once the war was won when the uprising began that paper was almost at par with specie but it seemed to lose a little value every day how long before the assemblys paper was worthless victor feared the time would come sooner than he wished what would the assembly do then he didnt have the slightest idea and suspected they didnt either in the meantime the war went on his drill sergeants did their best to turn the recruits into men who could march and deploy and follow orders without fussing about it too much despite his great chest tom knox died of some lung ailment victor mourned the english deserterhe might have ended up a major had he lived the atlanteans did get a handful of a new kind of recruits professional soldiers from europe who saw a need across the sea and hastened to meet it some of them were frankly horrified at what they found a proper soldier one said in a thick german accent you tell him what to do and by god he does it or he dies trying you atlanteans you always must know why before you do anything it is of time a waste it is aa foolishness by the way he said that he couldnt think of many worse names well ill tell you baron von steuben victor said steuben was no more a baron than he himself was a king the german captain also had no right to the aristocratic von but he was far from the first man to improve his past on coming to atlantis and the idea of being drilled by a european nobleman appealed to the atlantean soldiers victor went on and what ill tell you is this officers can be wrong too knowing why they want you to do something isnt so bad the men do fight hard theyve stood up to the redcoats plenty of times they hadnt stood up quite well enough but he didnt dwell on that english regulars isaregood troops steuben admitted but maybe your men win if they move faster if they dont spend time with questions always foolishness yes that did seem to be the nastiest printable word he used maybe victor didnt think so but he didnt feel like arguing the point he did want to make sure the german captain knew what he was up against no matter how fine a drillmaster you may be sir i dont think youll cure atlanteans of needing to know why that would take an act of god not an order from a mere man i shall petition the lord with prayer steuben said if he loves your cause he will do what is needful they do say the lord helps those who help themselves victor remarked were trying to do that against the english he kept sending out little bands to harry the redcoats moving small units and keeping them supplied was easier than moving and subsisting his whole army would have been he gave men who performed well on the practice field the chance to test what theyd learned against some of the sternest instructors in the world if his raiders won they came back proud and delighted and if they lostwhich they did sometimesthey didnt lose enough to endanger his main body or to hurt morale much one band of horsemen reached the sea near weymouth its not redcoats everywhere habakkuk biddiscombe reported to victor theyre like any other men they mostly stay where its warm and cozy if we broke in amongst em with a big enough force they wouldnt know what the devil to do its a thought victor said his own soldiers as he knew full well wanted to stay warm and cozy tooand who could blame them if they got through the winter and started the second year of the war as a force in being wasnt that a sizable achievement all by itself it seemed so to him the young captain a born attacker had different notions if it all goes well we might threaten hanover we might even run them out of it one of the prisoners we took says they havent got that many men there they cant garrison and campaign very well not at the same time neither can we victor said mournfully a solid company of croydon men had just marched off to the north their enlistments were up and they didnt intend to stay around one minute longer than they were obliged to the english occupied the town that gave their settlement its name if that bothered them they hid it very well we ought to try biddiscombe persisted what would happen to a junior officer in a european army who kept on arguing with the general commanding victor wondered if he ought to ask baron von steuben he enjoyed watching the german gutturally sputter and fume victor was sure a persistent captain like this one would be hanging his career out to dry but habakkuk biddiscombe didnt have a military career to worry about when the war endedin victory or defeathe would go back to whatever hed done beforehand and so he didnt worry about speaking his mind now we could use a win he told victor as if the general didnt know and i think we could get one without a great deal of trouble the redcoats arent within miles of being ready for us they dont mink wed be stupid enough to do any serious campaigning in the wintertime victor thought he hadnt expected the atlanteans would either the younger officers enthusiasm made him wonder if he was making a mistake by doing what the english looked for they look for me to have an ounce of sensemaybe even two ounces still if he fought the kind of war general howe would approve of wasnt he bound to lose howe had the professional soldiers the atlanteans by the nature of things were amateurs they had fire and dash to offer not stolid obedience shouldnt he take advantage of that if he could make the english react to him instead of his having to respond to howes every carefully planned advance do you know victor said slowly i believe i shall hold an officers council if we decide the attack can go forward with some hope of success i expect well put it in captain biddiscombe stared dyou mean that he answered his own question you do mean that by god general i never dreamt id convince you never in a thousand years life is full of surprises victor radcliff said may king georges soldiers not enjoy the one they get soon officers council or not hed made up his mind now if he could bring it off the weather had gone from rain to freezing rain and sleet to snow victor hoped it would stay cold he wanted the roads frozen so his men could make good time on them if the atlanteans had to slog through mud to get at the redcoats they could come to the battle late and worn out his first target was a fort on the outskirts of a town named sudbury it was farther north than weymouth farther south than hanover and about thirty miles inland general howe had run up several such fortresses to try to keep the atlantean army away from the prosperous and wellsettled seacoast the intrepid biddiscombes raid was one thing an attack by all the force the atlantean assembly could muster would be something else again i hope victor thought he didnt let his men conceive that so much as a single solitary worry clouded his mind much of the art of command consisted of acting unruffled evenor rather especiallywhen you werent press on lads press on he called before long well subsist ourselves on good english victuals well wear good english boots on our feet again he hoped quite a few of the atlanteans werent wearing anything resembling good boots now the men whod served longest and done the most marching suffered worst some of them had wrapped cloth around their boots to hold uppers and soles together and to try to keep their feet dry a few soldiers had only clothsor nothing at allon their feet they tramped along anyhow if they eagerly looked forward to a little plunderingwell who could blame them in earlier times sudbury had made turpentine from the conifers in the dense atlantean forests after some years of settlement those forests were nowhere near so dense as they had been once upon a time these days wheat fields replaced woods the atlantean army marched past snowcovered stubble more snow swirled around them victor blessed it it helped cloak them from the garrison inside the works on the western edge of town the sentries the atlanteans seized were too astonished to let out more than a couple of yelps that the wind drowned they seemed almost relieved to be taken it gave them the chance to go back to the atlanteans camp and get out of the cold forward as fast as you can victor called if we get ladders up against their palisade before they start shooting the forts ours he almost managed it his men were throwing fascines into the ditch around the palisade when a redcoat on the wall fired at them and raised the alarm victor heard soldiers inside the fort yelling in dismay he also heard their feet thudding on the wooden stairs leading up to the walkway hurry he shouted hurry for your lives ladders thudded into place against the wall atlanteans swarmed up them the redcoats tipped one spilling soldiers into the ditch an englishman killed the first greencoat coming up another ladder but the second atlantean shot the defender in the face the english soldier fell back with a howl clutching at himself by the time another redcoat neared the ladder the atlanteans were already on the walkway after that taking the fort was easy the attackers badly outnumbered the men who were trying to hold them back before long white flags went up and the redcoats threw down their muskets we never looked for you blokes a sergeant complained to victor most of our officers are still in town like are they victor said tonelessly and the underofficer nodded the english officers probably had lady friends in sudbury once the town was retaken people whod favored king georges soldiers were liable to have a thin time of it well that was their lookout victor sent men into sudbury with orders to capture any redcoats they found there he added if you can keep them all from getting away with luck well be able to roll up several of these forts maybe we will push all the way to the sea the ease with which the fort by sudbury fell made him think of grander things one english officer wearing a shirt and nothing more leaped onto a horse and made his getaway victor wouldnt have wanted to try that in warm weather the englishmans privates were going to take a beating several other officers and other ranks less ins trepid gave themselves up what are you doing here a captured lieutenant asked with what sounded like unfeigned indignation fighting a war in the name of the atlantean assembly and of the lord jehovah victor told him what art you doing here in this land you only oppress by your presence obeying the orders of my king and my superiors the lieutenant had nerve he added he is your king too i remind you my king would not send soldiers to invade his country he would not arrest subjects who had done him no wrong neither would he tax subjects who have no say in his governing councils victor replied if king george stopped doing such things he might be my king as it is he shook his head as it is you are welcome to him the english officer would have argued more he might have surrendered but he hadnt changed his mind but victor radcliff took a winners privilege and walked away from him he didnt have to listen to nonsense if he didnt feel like it his men plundered the fort and their prisonersand sudbury too for it had lain quiet in enemy hands they marched away better fed better shod better clothed and better armed than theyd arrived they marched away with silver and a bit of gold jingling in their pockets too after nothing to spend but atlantean paper of shrinking value hard money seemed doubly welcome to them two days later they fell on halstead fifteen miles south of sudbury the englishman unencumbered with trousers had ridden north so victor dared hope the redcoats in halstead didnt know his army was on the march and so it proved the fort there which was weaker than sudburys fell even more easily than the first one had and halstead hadnt stayed quiet while occupied only a few days before the atlanteans arrived someone had knocked an english corporal over the head and so the whole garrison there stayed in the fort victor thought he swept up every last redcoat in the neighborhood if i can seize one more fort he told blaise that will open the way for a march to the sea why not the negro replied chapter due south of halstead only an easy days march away lay pittmans ferry the english had a fort there too not far from the creek that necessitated the ferry and made the town spring up near it town and fort both lay on the north bank of pittmans creek that helped determine victor to move down and attack it he wouldnt have to worry about gathering boats to cross in a rush he set his men on the southbound road the morning after halstead fell they showed more confidence than they had when they were approaching sudbury with two english forts behind them why shouldnt they expect the next one to be easy they were better fed and clothed and shod and accoutered than they had been then too the men who carried bayoneted muskets seemed especially proud of them the redcoats had used them to fearsome effect now atlanteans could too pistols boomed up in the vanguard dont like the sound of that blaise remarked nor do i victor radcliff agreed well well have to see what it was a rider eventually came back to tell him they had pickets posted on the road damn them the man reported we went after em good but i think some of em got away damnation victor said and then something really flavorful the cavalryman stared at himdid generals talk that way this one did when he got such news taking a fort by surprise was one thing taking a fort that was ready and waiting was something else again we can do it said a soldier whod heard the news in an instant the whole army seemed to be chanting we can do it pulling back would wound their spiritsvictor could see that at a glance going on would hurt a lot of their bodies the general commanding needed to be no prophet to foresee that what he couldnt see was how to withdraw in the face of their insistent chant he wished he could well well have a go he said at last the redcoats might have heard the cheers in pitt mans ferry in case they hadnt he added doubletime boys well get there before they expect us drummers and fifers gave the army its new marching rhythm the men werent far from pittmans ferry they wouldnt get too worn to fight even if they doubletimed it all the way victor hoped they wouldnt anyhow he rode forward himself with the vanguard to reconnoiter the fort the untrimmed pine logs from which it was built made it a dark blot against the snow and against the painted planks of pittmans ferry now victor swore at the swirling snow as he raised the spyglass to his eye to survey the structure he wanted to sec as much as he could but the weather hindered him frowning he passed the telescope to the cavalry officer who commanded the vanguard tell me what you think theyre up to captain biddiscombe if youd be so kind all right general habakkuk biddiscombe raised the glass slid the brass tube in ever so slightly and peered ahead puzzlement in his voice he said they dont seem to be up to anything do they well i didnt think so victor answered i wanted to know how it looked to you maybe theyre feigning this to draw us on or maybewho knows well find out pretty soon though when his foot soldiers came up half an hour later he pointed them at the fort they knew what to do some would attack two sides as soon as the defenders rushed to hold them out the rest would assault the other two and the fort at pittmans ferry fell as easily as the one at halstead hadmore easily than the one at sudbury the atlanteans dragged the dejected english captain in charge of the place in front of victor radcliff didnt you know we were on the way victor demanded no dammit the redcoat said sullenly why not captain didnt your pickets warn you our outriders thought some of them got away they did the english officer made as if to spit in disgust whether over himself or victor the atlantean didnt know in any case a growl from his captors dissuaded him angrily he went on they came in but i didnt believe em who would a winter campaign pshaw no wonder we surprised you victor murmured none so blind as those that will not see the devil may quote scripture to his purpose the captain said i am not the devil sir and neither is that scripture victor said it is reverend henrys commentary on the book of jeremiah but it is not the prophet speaking in his own person you might say i dont care what it is not to the extent of a fart in a thunderstorm the redcoat said miserably you will eventually exchange me or parole me will you not that is the custom with prisoners of war yes victor spoke as if to an idiot child what else were they to do with prisoners knock them over the head it was easier than holding them and feeding them but otherwise had little to recommend it so victor thought anyhow the english captain saw things differently general howe will skin me like an ermine when he finds out how i lost this fort theyll cashier me and disgrace my familys name forever sudden hope flared in the mans eyes will you uprisers take me on well no victor needed to think about it but not for long true the atlantean army was short of trained capable officers but while this fellow might be trained hed just proved himself incapable a pity the captain said i dont know how i am to go on would you be kind enough to take me to some small room lock me in and lend me a loaded pistol then no i wont do that either victor said if you choose to dispose of yourself sir that is between you and god if you seek to make me a party to your deed however i must decline he made sure the unhappy officer marched off into captivity with the rest of the english garrison once the campaign ended and the need for secrecy with it they could be properly exchanged victor radcliff couldnt have been more delighted with what his ragtag force had done it wasnt so ragtag as it had been before the campaign began either the atlanteans might have had a lean time of it during the winter but their enemies were living well part of that came from supplies fetched across the ocean part from plundering the countryside now the atlanteans made some of the enemys bounty their own still what had he accomplished if he stopped here and drew back nothing that would last and nothing that would more than annoy general howe whereas if he struck for the coast if you do you may lose your whole army normally that thought would have been plenty to hold him back not here not now after the series of defeats hed suffered during the summer didnt he have to remind the english that atlantis remained a going concern didnt they need to see they couldnt march where they pleased whenever they pleased he thought they did and so he ordered now we move on weymouth one of these days victor supposed atlantis would be thickly settled north and south east and west that day wasnt here yet he was reminded it wasnt with every mile toward the coast his army gained general howe wasnt so foolish in trying to confine the rebels to the interior howe skimmed the fat off the rich populous seaside regions that way and left his foes with whatever they could gather from the rest farms clustered close together here even though the english had occupied these parts for a while plenty of livestock remained victor requisitioned what he needed paying with the atlantean assemblys banknotes what makes you think i want these arsewipes a furious farmer howled theyll never be worth more than the dingleberries they leave behind would you rather we gave you the bayonet instead victor asked mildly the farmers bravado deflated like a pricked pigs bladder the real trouble was a good many people who dwelt near the ocean were loyal to king george some farms the atlantean army passed were bare of livestock and of people the men women and children had fled their own countrymens advance that they should want to do such a thing was demoralizing it was also dangerous they would bring word to the redcoats in weymouth that the atlanteans were coming no surprises any more victor said gloomily i wanted to descend on them before they knew i was there wont happen blaise said i know victor answered when this war ends we shall have to settle accounts with all the traitors still living amongst us i fear it will prove neither quick nor easy his mouth twisted one way or another he was bound to be right about that but if the redcoats prevailed the hunt would be on for everyone whod risen against king george on for me and mine he thought which made matters unmistakably plain on pressed the army northeast toward weymouth they made good time the roads were frozen hard and the men better shod than they had been at the start of the campaign if english captives with rags on their feet came down with chilblains too bad victors worst dread was a thaw that would turn the roads to mud that would slow the army to a crawl scouts reported an english detachment moving into place to block the atlanteans how big a detachment victor asked the men looked at one another almost in unison they shrugged dont rightly know general one of them answered they had horse out in front so we couldnt push on and take a good gander at the foot a pox victor muttered was he rushing into a trap or were the redcoats trying to bluff him out of a prize he could win well from which direction do they come from the northeast or from the southeast he asked if the former the english force likely came out of weymouths garrison whichhe thoughtwas none too big if the latter then he might be heading toward the bulk of general howes army sallying from new hastings he knew too well how poor his chances were of beating it in the open field one or two scouts pointed southeast the rest northeast after some shouting and namecalling the minority swung to northeast like a compass swinging towards a lodestone victor hoped they swung because they were persuaded and not like the lodestone because they had no choice he turned to one of the young messengers who always rode beside him tell the musicians to play form line of battle if you would be so kind he said form line of battle yes general eyes bright with excitement the messenger set spurs to his horse and galloped away atlantean evolutions were smoother than they had been the summer before compared to the redcoats though victors men still wasted too much time and motion deploying from column to line baron von steubens guttural obscenities helped chivvy them into place with cavalry out in front and off to either flank they tramped forward across frozen fields horse pistols and carbines boomed up ahead of victor so did a field gunobviously one that belonged to the english snow and scattered trees kept him from seeing what was going on when his men didnt come pelting back with enemy riders in pursuit he took that for a good sign forward he ordered doubletime we will support the horse with all the force at our disposal urged on by their musicians the atlanteans hurried toward combat any sensible man as a cynic like custis cawthorne would have been quick to point out would have turned around and hustled off in the opposite direction the most a soldier could hope for was not getting shot all his other possibilities were much much worse when you looked at it like that war seemed a mighty peculiar way to settle disputes and yet the men smiled and joked as they advanced theyd just overrun three english forts in a row they thought they could beat redcoats any time anywhere the summers defeats seemed to lie as far behind them as crcy and agincourt quite a few of the men whod lost those battles had gone home since maybe enthusiasm could make do for experience there stood the english line drawn up at the top of a small swell of ground well god be praised victor murmured unless the enemy was hiding some huge force beyond the crest this was only a detachment and the atlanteans handily outnumbered it the officer commanding the redcoats must have seen the same thing at about the same time too late for himhe had little choice now but to accept battle the atlanteans had drawn too close to let him pull back they would have harried him all the way to weymouth his chances here might not be good but they were better than the ones retreat offered well lap round his flanks victor said if we can get in behind him the game is up to keep the english soldiers from meeting that threat he also threw in a frontal assault most of the greencoats who went straight at the enemy had captured bayonets tipping their flintlocks the redcoats wouldnt have things all their own way in the handtohand as they so often did they gave the atlanteans a volley victors menthe majority still standing at any ratereturned it the redcoats reloaded with urgent competence the atlanteans closed on them yelling like fiends if they could turn it into a melee before the englishmen recharged their muskets they did or most of them did soldiers swore and screamed and stabbed at one another the atlanteans were bigger men than their foes the english still had more experience and knowhow had that frontal attack been the only string in victors bow it would have failed but with his superior numbers he could outflank the redcoats to left and right the foe couldnt stand and fight the atlanteans directly in front of him not when men to either side poured enfilading fire into his ranks if the english held their ground they might get cut off and surrounded they wouldnt last long after that common soldiers saw the dangeror simply panicked depending on ones point of viewbefore their officers did they started streaming away from their battle line some left by squads in fair order and kept firing at the atlanteans who harried them more simply tried to save their own skins they went off every man for himself when greencoats challenged them they were quick to throw down their musketsif theyd held on to them and raise their hands about half the english force fell back toward weymouth in a compact mass victor let them go wiping them out or forcing their surrender would have been more expensive than it was worth he had another victory crows and ravens and vultures spiraled down to feast on the bounty laid out for them surgeons did what they could for the wounded from both sides they gave them bullets or leather straps to bite on as they probed for musket balls and sutured bayonet wounds for amputations the surgeons had a little opium and a lot of barreltree brandy to dull the torment all that might have slightly softened the shrieks rising to the uncaring sky it assuredly did no more it might not even have done so much do we press on general habakkuk biddiscombe asked victor eyed the twisted bodies and the trampled bloodsplashed snow he listened for a moment to the cries of the wounded then he did what he had to do like pharaoh he hardened his heart and made himself nod yes captain biddiscombe we press on the redcoats in weymouth were as ready to receive victor radcliffs atlanteans as they could be given their usual practices and the weather their practices meant they were not in the habit of digging entrenchments under any circumstances the weather which froze the ground hard meant they would have had trouble trying it even had it occurred to them he sent a messenger into town calling on the english commander to surrender tell him i am not sure i can answer for my mens behavior if they take weymouth by storm he instructed the man if he thinks us no better than a pack of bloodthirsty copperskins it may frighten him into yielding i get you general the messenger tipped him a wink ill make us out to be most especially frightful he rode in under flag of truce when he came back that afternoon he handed victor a note from the english commanding officer i must respectfully decline your offer the man wrote and i fear i cannot answer for the conduct of my soldiers once they have a pack of rebels in mr sights im sir your most obedient servant major henry lavery he wont quit general the messenger said so i gather victor radcliff replied this major lavery did not lack for nerve or style well if they wont do it of their own accord we shall have to make them he wondered if he could and what the butchers bill would be he wondered all the more because a pair of royal navy frigates lay just offshore bombardment from the sea had hurt him when he held weymouth how much more would it hurt him while he was trying to retake the town instead of trying to storm weymouth he sent his riflemen forward to take up positions as close to the outskirts as they could whenever you see a redcoats head i want you to put a bullet through it he told them dont let the enemy move in the streets by day the riflemen nodded but one of them asked what if they come out after us we can shoot straighter than they can but musketeers put a lot of lead in the air if they come out fall back victor answered i do not ask you to personate the spartans at thermopylae you are there to make their lives miserable not to sell your own dear that satisfied the marksman and his comrades they worked their way forward from tree to fence to woodpile before long the rifles sharp authoritative reports began to ring out now singly now two or three at a time the men would victor supposed shift their positions after every shot or two he wondered how the redcoats liked them he got his answer when a cannon inside weymouth boomed the roundshot smashed a pile of wood but the sniper whod fired from behind it had moved on ten minutes earlier victor was more than pleased to see the english waste such a good shot atlantean rifles went on barking as long as the light lasted they would take until the day before forever to wipe out the enemy garrison but they made the redcoats shun the streets and slink around like weasels one of the marksmen came back to victor at sundown and said i shot me a major or maybe even a colonel how can you be so sure victor asked well general if he wasnt a big officer he mustve been one of those whatdoyoucallemspeacockslike on account of he sure did have some fancy feathers the atlantean answered all right thats good news maybe it will stir the english out of their lair come tomorrow radcliff listened to himself once he said that out loud it struck him as much too likely and he hadnt done anything about it in the fading light he ordered his musketeers and his fieldpieces forward if the redcoats did come out he wanted to be ready to receive them they didnt emerge right away as soon as the eastern sky paled enough his riflemen started shooting into weymouth again a horsefly couldnt do a horse much real damage but could drive it wild anyhow victor hoped for the same effect and he got it the redcoats in weymouth sallied forth just after the church bells in town rang ten as soon as they left the cover of houses and shops the marksmen began to fire at their officers as the sniper had said the evening before those splendid uniforms made them stand out they fell one after another and so did the common soldiers unlucky enough to be stationed near them the english troopers advanced anyhow victor might have known they would they barely needed officers to tell them what wanted doing they went after the riflemen with professional competence and perhaps unprofessional fury victors marksmen fired and fell back fired and fell back some of them didnt fall back fast enough the ones the redcoats caught had a hard time surrendering then the english force came into range of the atlantean artillery which lurked just inside an orchard cannon balls tore bloody tracks through the enemys ranks the attackers swung toward the guns victor wanted nothing more than for them to charge canister and grape would do worse than roundshot ever could but even if many of their officers had fallen the redcoats knew better than to expose themselves to that kind of murderous fire they swung away again and went back to chasing the riflemen forward victor shouted and the main body of the atlantean army moved up to support the marksmen they outnumbered the soldiers whod sallied from weymouth their lines hadnt been thrown into disarray by a long pursuit encouraged by three easy wins and a successful skirmish they thought they could do anything that went a long way toward making them right the redcoats dressed their ranks faster than victor would have dreamt possible they thought they could do anything too theyd fought in europe in india in terranova some of them would have fought in atlantis against the french theyd also had good luck facing the rebellion from their own kinsmen here no wonder they thought they could win again fire victor yelled as the english drew near flintlocks clicked priming powder around touchholes hissed then the muskets boomed some of the redcoats went down the rest kept corning they didnt fire if they could stand the gaff if they could get in among their foes they thought they could win the battle with the bayonet theyd seen how much the atlanteans feared cold steel in earlier fights another volley tore into them more english soldiers fell by then the survivors were very close they were close enough in fact to see that most of the atlanteans also carried bayoneted muskets as they had in the skirmish on the hillcrest all that plunder from the english forts was corning in handy true the greencoats werent masters of the bayonet the way the english were but they were most of them big strong men skill counted but so did reach and ferocity and so did numbers and the atlanteans had the edge there as the two lines met in bloody collision victor wondered how much weight each factor carried before long one side or the other would give way flesh and blood simply couldnt stand going toe to toe like this for very long spirit oozed from the redcoats first victor sensed it even before they began to fall back part of it he judged was their surprise and dismay at not sweeping everything before them they should have known better theyd beaten the atlanteans in the summer yes but theyd never routed themand the atlanteans had just forced many of them back into weymouth now they were routed themselves some fled back across the snow toward the town others raised their hands in surrender and still others the stubborn few went on fighting and made victors men pay the price of beating them give up victor called to the knot of embattled englishmen some of your friends have got away what more can you hope to do now they kept fighting then the atlanteans wheeled up a couple of fieldpieces and started firing canister into them one round from each gun was enough to make the redcoats change their minds the men still on their feet laid their muskets in the snow and stepped away from them the ones blown to rags and bloody shreds didnt need to worry about it any more victors men hurried forward to take wallets and muskets boots and breeches and bayonets he told off enough greencoats to ensure that the prisoners wouldnt be able to get away with the rest of his army he pressed on toward weymouth had the remainder of the english garrison wanted to fight it out street by street and house by house they could have made taking the place devilishly expensive victor might have made that kind of fight it didnt seem to occur to the redcoats perhaps that sniper had killed major lavery the day before and taken the linchpin out of their resistance badly beaten in the field the english survivors must have concluded they couldnt hope to hold weymouth they chose to save the remains of their army instead they marched off to the south toward new hastings in good order flags flying and drums beating they might have been saying that if victor wanted to assault them they remained ready to give him all he wanted later he wondered whether he should have swooped down on them maybe their demeanor intimidated him or maybe he focused so completely on taking weymouth he forgot about everything else whatever the reason he let them go and rode into weymouth at the head of his army some people in the seaside town greeted the greencoats with cheers here and there a young womanor sometimes one not so youngwould run out and kiss a soldier victor suspected a baby or two would get started tonight and not by the mothers husbands but some houses and shops stayed closed up tight shuttered against the new conquerors and against the world victor knew what that meant the people in those places would have been too friendly toward the redcoats now they feared they would pay for it and they were likely right if not at his hands then at those of their fellow townsfolk that was a worry for another time victor had plenty to worry him now the royal navy frigates naturally realized weymouth had changed hands they started bombarding the town one of their first shots smashed a house belonging to somebody victor had tagged as a likely partisan of king georges the unhappy man his wife and two children fled my baby the woman screamed my babys still in there the man wouldnt let her go back willies gone joan he said hesgone he dissolved in tears his wifes shrieks redoubled thats what you get for backing england victor almost said it but checked himself at the last moment however true it might be it was cruel he would only make these people hate him morehe wouldnt persuade them that they should take up the atlantean cause better silence then he pulled most of his men out of range of the frigates guns but he also fired back at the warships with a couple of sixpounders he ran out onto the strand hed made that gesture of defiance before and felt good about doing it again weymouth is ours it said this time though the frigates were waiting for it they opened a furious fire on the field guns one roundshot took off an artillerymans head another pulped a man standing on the opposite side of the sixpounder yet another wrecked the other fieldpieces carriage and killed a horse victor got the intact gun out of there right away and the surviving gunners and horses with it the other gun lay on the sand till night fell a monument to the folly of repeating himself we did it you did it blaise didnt let a small failure take away from a larger success so we did victor didnt want all the credit now we have to see if we can hold what weve taken they couldnt however much victor radcliff wanted to believe otherwise that soon became plain to him it wasnt just because the royal navy kept sending heavy roundshot crashing into weymouth but people friendly to the atlantean cause sneaked up from new hastings to warn him that general howe was getting ready to move against the captured town with most of his army getting a large force ready to march didnt happen overnight for anyone and howe valued thorough preparation over speed victor had the time to hold an officers council and see what the armys leaders thought to his amazement some of them wanted to hold their ground and fight the redcoats general howe purposes bringing a force more than twice the size of ours with abundant stores of all the accouterments of war he said how do you gentlemen propose to stand against him we can do itdamned if we cant habakkuk biddiscombe said if we lead em into a trap like we can slaughter em like so many beeves victor couldnt tell him he was out of his mind the french atlanteans had done that very thing to general braddocks army of redcoats south of freetown victor counted himself lucky to have escaped that scrape with a whole skin he did say beeves are rather more likely to amble into a trap and rather less so to shoot back that won him a few chuckles but intrepid captain biddiscombe was not so easily put off if we do thrash em general we throw off the english yoke once for all they cant treat us like beeves either i dont intend to let them do any such thing victor said cut good von steuben boomed no point throwing away an army on a fight we dont win thank you baron victor said and then to biddiscombe how did we learn of howes planned movement patriots from new hastings told us the captain answered at once and do you not believe traitors from weymouth are even now telling general howe of our debate victor said only the englishmen will style them patriots reckoning our patriots traitors the cavalry officer opened his mouth then he closed it again well that could be so he said his tone much milder than it had been a moment before we cannot hope to lay a trap where the foe is privy to our plans victor said can we beat him in a standup fight anything is possible habakkuk biddiscombe didnt want to admit the atlanteans werent omni capable anything is possible victor agreed not everything however is likely i find our chances of success less likely than i wish they were since i do i should prefer to retire rather than fight debate didnt shut off right away if atlanteans were anything they were full of themselves everyone had to put in his pennys worth baron von steuben was rolling his eyes and muttering by the time victors views carried the day the greencoats got ready to abandon weymouth quite a few locals also abandoned the town theyd given king georges partisansthe ones who hadnt escapedsome rough justice if general howes troops returned they feared a dose of their own medicine we are not running away victor told anyone who would listen we won every battle we fought we returned to the atlantic after the english thought they had barred us from our own seacoast we proved that atlantis remains hostile and inhospitable to the invaders he got cheers from the men who marched with him and more cheers from the families that were leaving weymouth to go with the greencoats not one word he said was a lie he still wished he could have told his army something else he wished he could have followed captain biddiscombes advice and fought back in the last war he might have no defeat he suffered then would have ruined englands chances and those of the english atlanteans against the french now all of atlantis hopes followed his army he couldnt afford to throw them away and now he was older than hed been then did that leave him less inclined to take chances he supposed it did general howe has to win he has to beat me to crush me he thought all i have to do is not to lose if i can keep from losing for long enough england will tire of this fight dear god i hope she will but his doubts were for himself alone he kept on exuding good cheer for the men around him maybe blaise suspected what his true feelings were blaise would never give him away though and hed proved one thing to general howe anyway the atlantean uprising was not about to fold up and die chapter victor radcliff admired his splendid new sword the blade was chased with silver the hilt wrapped in gold wire the atlantean assembly had given it to him in thanks for his winter campaign thatbrieflybrought the rebels back to the sea blaise admired the weapon too you going to fight with that he asked i can if i have to victor said they gave it to me as an honor though and because its worth something how much that last would matter was anyones guess yes if things went wrong he might be able to eat for several months on what he got from selling the sword but if things went wrong odds were the english would catch him try him for treason and hang him what price fancy sword then blaise changed the subject not going to snow any more is it i dont think so victor answered cant be sure not here but i dont think so the west coast of atlantis warmed by the bay stream custis cawthorne had christened the current in the hesperian gulf already knew springtime the lands on the east side of the green ridge mountains had a harsher climate by god i hope it isnt the negro shivered dramatically i never knew there was such a thing as cold weather not like you get here he shivered again the language i grew up talking the language i talk with stella has no word for snow or ice or hail or sleet or blizzard or anything like that in africa we didnt know there were such things frost frostbite no we never heard of them spring seems better after winter victor said blaise whod grown up in endless summer looked unconvinced victor tried again and winter has its advantages do you like apples he knew blaise did what if i should blaise asked cautiously apple trees will grow where theres no frost theyll flower but they wont bear fruit they need the frost for that so do pears blaise considered if i had to give up apples or give up snow i would give up snow he said what about you well maybe victor had seen lands without snow it rarely fell on avalon and never on new marseille but he didnt hate cold weather the way blaise did depends on what youre used to i suppose i wouldnt want it hot and sticky all the timei know that neither would i it should be hot and dry sometimes blaise said one or the other was all i knew till i came here before long it will be hot and sticky again victor said the negro nodded and smiled in anticipation they could talk about the weather forever without doing anything about it one of the reasons to talk about the weather was that you couldnt do anything about it before long victor would have to decide what he could do about the english invaders even now they might be trying to decide what to do about him he stepped out of his tent blaise followed everything was green but then everything in atlantis was green the year around unless covered in snow or imported from europe or terranova fruit trees and ornamentals did lose their leaves along with rhymes and songs they let atlanteans imagine what winters were like across the sea greencoats marched and countermarched they would probably never grow as smooth in their evolutions as the professionals they faced but they were ever so much better than they had been a robin perched in a pine burst into song englishmen said atlantean robins behaved and sang just like the blackbirds they knew back home atlantis had birds the people here called blackbirds but they werent much like atlantean robinsor the smaller redderbreasted birds that went by the same name in england or even english blackbirds it could get confusing the war could get confusing too both sides had got some unpleasant surprises the first year victor hadnt imagined king georges government would send so many men to atlantis or that they would secure the coast from croydon down to new hastings and general howe hadnt looked for the kind of resistance the atlanteans had put up so deserters assured victor anyhow he wondered what atlantean deserters told the english general that atlantean paper money lost value by the day that morale went up and down for no visible reason that equipment left a lot to be desired all trueevery word of it but if the deserters told howe the atlantean army didnt want to fight he had to know they were liars they couldnt match the redcoats skills or their stoicism but they didnt lack for spirit and how were the english soldiers spirits these days victors best measure of that was also what he learned from deserters if what the englishmen who came into the atlanteans lines said was true their countrymen were surprised and unhappy the war had gone on this long before they crossed the ocean their officers told them they would put down the rebellion in weeks if not days radcliff discounted some of what he heard from them they had to be discontented or they wouldnt have deserted in the first place and they wouldnt have been human if they didnt tell their captors what they thought the atlanteans wanted to hear still he did think they were having a harder time than theyd expected he wanted them to go on having a hard time if they had a hard enough time for long enough they would give up and go home or they might decide they werent doing enough and send in more soldiers as far as victor knew the mother country was righting nowhere else at the moment england had more men than atlantis she could raise more troopsif she had the will and if she stayed untroubled elsewhere victor wondered how thomas paine was doing among the english settlements of northeastern terranova if those towns and their hinterlands also rose in rebellion king georges ministers wouldnt be able to focus all their attention onand send all their redcoats toatlantis if paine had turned the terranovan settlements all topsyturvy word of it hadnt come back to atlantis victor shook his head after that thought crossed his mind word of whatever paine was doing hadnt reached him that wasnt necessarily the same as the other news crossed the green ridge mountains only slowly and if terranova did have trouble word of it might have reached english officers in croydon or hanover or new hastings without spreading any farther those officers certainly wouldnt want him to find out he pulled a small notebook and pencil from a waistcoat pocket more spies in citiespaine he scribbled one of these days if and as he found the time he would do something about that or tell off someone else to do something about it he started to put the notebook away then caught himself he jotted another line copperskins around atlantis hed heard next to nothing since sending his hundred men against the terranovan savages the english had landed south of avalon to harry the west coast if anyone on this side of the mountains knew more about that than he did it was his distant cousin matthew radcliffe victor sent a rider off to the atlantean assembly with a letter for him the man came back a few days later with a letter from matthew my dear generali regret to state i can tell you nothing certain the assemblyman wrote only rumor has reached me or rather conflicting rumors i have heard that our men have routed the terranovan barbarians contrariwise i have also heard that the copperskins have slaughtered every atlantean soldier sent against them afterwards denuding the corpses of hair and virile members as souvenirs of their triumph where the truth falls will i doubt not emerge but has yet to do so i remain very respectfully your most obedient servant his signature followed drat victor folded the letter as if washing his hands of it is the news bad general like any messenger the fellow whod brought the letter wanted to be absolved of its contents bad victor considered he had to shake his head no the principal news is that there is no sure news and that is bador at least i wished it to be otherwise what can you do about it the man asked victor radcliff considered again he could go himself to investigate if he didnt mind entrusting command in the vital eastern regions to someone else he could send someone he trusted to see what was going on around avalon if he didnt mind depriving himself of that mans services for some weeks or he could simply wait to see which rumors proved true had any of the rumors matthew radcliffe cited been that the royal navy was about to try to seize avalon he would have dispatched someone on the instant to investigate as things were with a sigh and a shrug he answered i believe i shall await developments both in the west and here i do not think ill need to wait long in either case salty pork sausage hard bread and coffee enlivened with barreltree brandynot the worst breakfast victor radcliff had ever had as far as he remembered his worst breakfast was some raw pine nuts and a roasted ground katydid the flightless bugs grew as big as mice you could eat them if you got hungry enough and victor had atlantis hadnt had any rats or mice till they crossed the atlantic with the first settlers now they were as common in towns and in farms as they were back in england away from human settlement the pale green katydids still prevailed as he had more than once before victor wondered why atlantis had no native viviparous quadrupeds but bats england and europe did so did terranova yet atlantis which lay between them in the middle of the ocean didnt it was as if god had arranged a special creation here many of his former productions were far scarcer than they had been when edward radcliffe came ashore in englishmen who felt unfriendly called atlanteans honkers yet the great flightless birds were extinct in settled country east of the green ridge mountains they were rare anywhere east of the mountains and growing scarce in the wilder west too the same held true for the great redcrested eagles that had preyed on themand that also didnt mind preying on people and sheep atlantis used the redcrested eagle to difference its flag from englands but the bird itself was seldom seen these days oil thrushes though less drastically reduced than honkers or eagles were less common than they had been few eastern farmers found enough of them to render them down for lamp oil the first settlers tales said that had been a common practice along with people the oil thrushes had to worry about foxes and cats and wild dogs these days even in the woods there were more and more mice oak and ash and elm and nut trees grew in the woods too while deer roamed where honkers had taken all in all atlantis became more like europe year by year victor resolved that it wouldnt come to resemble europe in one way it wouldnt supinely submit to rule from a tyrannical king if general howe didnt understand that general oh general when somebody called for him like that victor knew the news wouldnt be good he wished hed poured more brandy into the coffee he still could but no he gulped a last mouthful of sausage for a second it didnt want to go down he felt like a small snake engulfing a large frog then it headed south and he stepped out of his tent im here he called what is it well general now we know how come the redcoats aint come after us even with the weather getting good and everything the courier replied hed dismounted and was rubbing his blowing horse perhaps you do if so you have the advantage of me victor said if you would be so good as to share your enlightenment sure will the man went on rubbing down the horse there you go boy the redcoats well the truth of it is most of the bastards in new hastings climbed into ships and sailed away sailed away where victor demanded to hanover to croydon back to england if it was back to england theyd won the war hadnt they nope none of them places the courier said word is the ships they were on sailed south south to freetown to the settlements we took away from france general im mighty sorry but i dont know the answer to that the man replied i dont believe anybody does except the damned englishmenand they didnt tell anybody too bad victor radcliff said more often than not somebody blabbed to a whore or a saloonkeeper or a friend maybe someone had but the courier hadnt got wind of it then something else occurred to victor how big a garrison did they leave behind not too big the courier said and if we try and take new hastings away from them what happens wherever they are heading farther south that question had claws as sharp as those of any redcrested eagle are they taking the war into the old french settlements if they seize tight hold of those can they move up against us the way kersauzon did do i want to find out he knew he didnt general how in blazes am i supposed to know that the man whod brought the news sounded reproachful victor couldnt blame him he didnt know the answer himself he only knew england had widened the war and hed have to find some way to respond he muttered under his breath one more thing he didnt know was how the still largely french population of the southern settlements would react when english and english atlantean armies started marching and countermarching down there many french atlanteans resented england for taking their settlements away from king louis and bestowing them on king george but they also resented english atlanteans for swarming down into their lands and grabbing with both hands after the conquest and of course settlers from england and france had been rivals here since the longvanished days of edward radcliffe and francois kersauzon other related questions bubbled up in victors mind how much would the whitesfrench and english alikein the southern settlements resent the redcoats if general howe tried to weaken slavery down there how much help would he get from the enslaved negroes and copperskins in the south if he did and what would france do when a large english army started traipsing through lands that had been french less than a generation before maybe nothing but maybe not too even though france had lost settlements in atlantis in terranova and in india shed recovered from the late war remarkably well if she wanted to resent english incursions she could or am i letting hope run away from reality victor wondered he couldnt judge what france was likely to do he could think of three men from the atlantean assembly who knew more about that than he did isaac fenner custis cawthorne and michel du guesclin the courier said you look like you just had a good idea general do i victor radcliff shrugged well i can hope so anyway deliberating in a threehundredyearold church in a town of respectable size the atlantean assembly made people who saw it in action think of the english parliament that had treated atlantis so shabbily deliberating in a chamber that was half a taverns common room and half a tent run up alongside to give more space in a hamlet with the illustrious appellation of honkers mill the assembly seemed oddly diminished the men were no less eloquent the issues they debated no less urgent but their setting made them seem no more than farmers gathered together to grumble about the way life was treating them new hastings was a city honkers mill would never be anything but a village the honkers that had helped name it were long gone the stream that powered the gristmill was too small to float anything more than a rowboat the road that crossed the stream went from nowhere to nowhere as far as victor was concerned it went through nowhere traversing honkers mill isaac fenner had got word of general howes movement south before victor brought it that encouraged victor the assembly needed to know what was going on if it was to make sensible decisions to have a chance to make sensible decisions anyhow victor thought cynically even knowing what was going on some atlantean assemblymen hadnt the vaguest idea what to do about it but fenner wasnt of that ilk the clever redhead from bredestown nodded when victor told him what was on his mind general howe doesnt expect his move to stir up the french else hed not have done it fenner said of course that doesnt necessarily prove hes right what can we do to help make him wrong victor asked if we fight with france on our side were much better off than we are fighting alone weve already done some of what we need weve stayed in the field against england isaac fenner answered weve shown were an army not a rabble that melts away when things turn sour your winter raids went a long way toward proving that we didnt vote you your fancy sword for nothing im glad to hear it victor touched the goldwrapped hilt for a moment the french will have heard of this then rely on it fenner told him even though they no longer have settlements here they are well informed as to what transpires in these parts and they will also know of howes incursion capital this being so how do we cast the incursion in the worst light possible victor asked isaac fenner smiled at the way he phrased the question i know the very man to do it provided we can get him to france you will i daresay be better able to judge the likelihood of that than i and this nonpareil would be victor asked why master cawthorne of course fenner seemed disappointed he couldnt see that for himself imagine custis in paris a man should not have to enjoy himself so much even for the sake of his country victor chuckled yes i can see how he might have a good time there the other question is how will the french receive him if he is but one more english atlantean to them i judge him to be of greater value here oh no general no fenner shook his head if any of us has a reputation in paris custis is the man in part for his printing in part for his dabbling in natural philosophy and in part because they reckon him a delightful curmudgeon if you can imagine such an abnormous hybrid well then to paris with him victor said he may lose some dignity coming to france in a fishing shallop or a shallowdraught smuggler but i expect hell be able to make up for that i should be astounded if you were mistaken isaac fenner smiled again this time in a distinctly lickerish way the pretty women of paris will greet him with open armsand i shouldnt wonder with open legs as well victor radcliff sighed you remind me how long ive been away from meg we are all having to do without companionship or to make do by the way fenner said it he hadnt always slept alone since victor hadnt either he couldnt very well reproach the other man but he did miss his wife relief was not the same thing as satisfaction fenner went on if a fourth part of what i hear is true general howe has made do quite well i shouldnt wonder if hes sailing south not least because hes gone through all the willing women of new hastings he does have that reputation victor agreed so did general braddock and deservedly so i will say that had no part in braddocks failure and death south of freetown and general howe has fought better than i wish he would have regardless of his lechery a pity fenner said and victor nodded the assemblyman from bredestown went on i have heard he left behind only a very small garrison is that also your understanding not a large one certainly victor replied as we shall move south after him come what may i assure you i purpose investigating the situation in new hastings if we can recapture it that will mark a heavy blow against englandfar heavier than when we reclaimed weymouth during the winter new hastings is and always has been atlantis cradle of freedom fenner said seriously for it to groan no more under the spurred boot of tyranny would be wonderful i should greatly appreciate anything you can do toward that end i assure you if you help me ill help you isaac fenner wasnt so crass as to come straight out and say that he got the message across all the same ill do what i can victor said i understand why you dont care to have the atlantean assemblymen continue meeting here in honkers mill oh my dear fellow you couldnt possibly you havent been here long enough on brief exposure this place is merely stifling not until youve had to endure it for a while does it become truly stultifying boredom dies here of boredom heh victor said though he didnt think fenner was joking i wonder what cawthorne and du guesclin think of howes incursion in my opinion fenner said sagely theyll be against it and so they were michel du guesclin couldnt have opposed it more vigorously had he rehearsed for a year bad enough to have english atlantean settlers on what was french soil he said worse to have so many english ruffians tramping through as if they owned the countryside urn king george believes he does he believes he has since the end of the last war victor pointed out du guesclin waved his words aside what can you expect from a german he said a blockhead a stubborn blockhead his majesty the king of england is assuredly nothing more assuredly his soldiers will arrest you for treason if they hear you saying such things victor reminded him i doubt you shall inform on me du guesclin said which was true you believe then that the french settlers are more likely to resist the redcoats than to oppose an army mostly made up of english atlanteans victor said michel du guesclin nodded i do i believe this to be especially probable if the soldiers from england show an inclination to interfere with the institution of servitude as it is practiced there i see that had already crossed victors mind how much would howe care how much help would he get from the negroes and copperskins in the southern settlements if he interfered with slavery those were questions easier to ask than to answer victor found another one of a similar sort and asked it anyway what about the settlers from english atlantis who moved south after the last war du guesclins shrug was peculiarly gallic there i fear you would be better able to judge than i being one yourself you will naturally have a better notion of the english atlanteans desires than i ever could if i might venture to predict however please do victor broke in i highly value your opinion thank you very well then my guess is that some will favor the german dullard on the english throne while others will oppose him as seems true here farther north if general howe should move against slavery he will make more enemies than friends among the english atlanteans many of them after all moved south in hopes of acquiring a plantation did his lip curl ever so slightly victor radcliff wouldnt have been surprised the plantations english atlanteans wanted to acquire would have been made by french atlanteans who died during the last war whether in battle or from disease a lot of them would have left widows but no heirs not all those widows were too fussy to look down their noses at vigorous atlanteans of english blood either one more question if i may victor said du guesclin regally inclined his head he looked down his nose at english atlanteans though he tried not to show it most of the time victor went on how will france respond to this latest english move frenchmen from france are proud they were not born in distant settlements i must tell you monsieur le general that i am equally proud i was not born in france du guesclin replied i do not know what goes on there especially with this new young king france will do whatever she does it may prove wise or foolish it will prove to be in what she imagines to be her interest custis cawthorne i suspect would make a bettercertainly a more dispassionatejudge than i i was going to speak with him anyway victor said thanks to your advice ill do it now it wasnt easy to live well in a place like honkers mill even the locals had trouble managing it oh they mostly stayed dry and they seldom went hungry but animals in the forest could match that so could the inhabitants of backwoods towns all over atlantis even in honkers mill custis cawthorne lived well he smoked the mildest pipeweed he ate the finest poultry and beef and mutton he drank the smoothest barreltree rum the best ale the finest wine brought upby whom at whose large expense not his assuredlyfrom the south he enjoyed the companionship of not one but two of the prettiest women for miles around how do you do it victor asked when one of those women the younger a buxom blondeadmitted him to cawthornes presence if you are going to live you should live cawthorne declared it probably sounds better in latin but its just as true in english what can i have betsy bring you dont be shyive got plenty ale will do i want to keep my head clear victor didnt say anything about whatever cawthorne was drinking he knew from experience that the printer wouldnt have listened to him if he had betsy smiled provocatively as she handed him the mug with some regret victor declined to be provoked he saluted cawthorne your health and yours god save the general cawthorne could be provocative too even if less enjoyably than betsy after drinking he inquired and what is the generals pleasure one of the things i desire to know is your view of the french view of the english incursion into the former french settlements there victor smiled at his own convoluted phrasing i cant imagine that paris will be delighted custis cawthorne answered nor is it in our interest that paris should be victor nodded isaac fenner said the same thing did he cawthorne sounded less than pleased so i am doomed not to be original then ignoring that victor went on he also said you were the right man to ensure that paris was not delighted and to incite the french against england if that be at all possible how would you like to sail east and try your luck along those lines fenner said i was the right one to go to france not himself cawthorne asked victor nodded again the printer let out a rasping chuckle well in that case i must beg his forgiveness for the unkind thoughts about him that just now went through my mind paris i would be smuggled there i suppose disguised as salt cod or something else as tasty and odorous its likely i fear victor admitted we are not going to be able to challenge the royal navy on the high seas any time soon so long as i make myself into a stench in the nostrils of king george i shant complain overmuch cawthorne said i doubt not that one of my ancestors was a fisherman precious few atlanteans whose families have been here a while and cant claim that i certainly can victor said radcliffe radcliffes custis cawthorne pronounced the e that should have stayed silent if not for you people wed probably all be speaking breton or french or basque or something else no one in his right mind would care to speak it could be victor hadnt much worried about that get ready to leave honkers mill get ready to sail i shall make arrangements to take you out of atlantis by way of some port or another the english arent watching too closelymaybe even new hastings new hastings eh do you think so behind his spectacle lenses cawthornes eyes were keen so you will be moving south after general howe will you i thought as much you cant just let him have the south or we may never see it again that did occur to me yes victor said news travels fast you and isaac have both heard of howes move while i wondered if i was bringing word of it here news travels fast cawthorne agreed a touch of smugness in his voice it traveled fast when it came anywhere near himnot because hed produced a newspaper but because he was who he was draining his mug of ale he added i shall have to give betsy and lois something to remember me by they arent likely to forget you victor said true cawthorne said more than a touch of smugness surfacing now i hope i shant forget them french popsies are enough to make a man forget everything but his last nameand if hes lucky his wallet i shall rely on your superior experience there victor told him get your hands on a french popsy and i guarantee you a superior experience custis cawthorne replied enough victor said laughing he switched to french to ask does your wit work in this language as well by god i hope so custis cawthorne had a better accent than victor did he actually sounded like a parisian where victor talked like a french atlantean settler which would have left him seeming a backcountry bumpkin if he ever had to present himself at versailles he smiled at the unlikelihood of that english atlanteans sounded like bumpkins to the aristocrats commanding regiments of redcoats too of course so did most of the aristocrats own soldiers so things evened out cawthornes other friendlois yes a statuesque brunettegrabbed victors sleeve as he was about to leave are you going to take custis away from us she demanded atlantis needs him victor said gravely atlantis was not configured to do what she told it to do as far as victor knew neither was anything else betsy and me we dont want him to go away lois said we never had fun like this before he came to honkers mill how did she mean that do i really want to know victor decided he didnt he can help bring france into the war against england he said so what lois returned why should the likes of us care one way or the other who wins what difference would it make to her very little victor could see maybe your children will care he said and retreated with her laughter ringing in his ears chapter bredestown fell the english garrison fired a few shots for honors sake and then marched away down the brede toward new hastings exultantly the atlanteans pursued taking back their first city the city that still thought of itself as atlantis leader hanover new hastings never had cared a farthing for hanover would be a strong blow against king george but new hastings didnt fall no one could say that the redcoats lacked for clever engineers theyd worked all winter to fortify the landward approaches to the town worsecertainly from victors perspectivetheyd taken big guns off some of their warships and mounted them in their fieldworks some of those guns seemed to fire roundshot as big as a mans head one cannon ball sent a column of almost a dozen men to the surgeonsor to the gravediggers after that the atlanteans lost their zeal for approaching the enemy works the redcoats might not be there in numbers but they could badly hurt any assault victor tried and so victor swung south without trying one he didnt expect the english garrison to come out after him he hopedhe prayedit would but he didnt expect it the redcoats would have been giving themselves into his hands their commander to victors disappointment saw that for himself blaise laughed at him you want the duck to walk into the oven and roast itself the negro said well yes victor admitted in some embarrassment why should i work hard if the other fellow can make things easy for me just because he can doesnt mean he will blaise said which was true even if unpalatable how much french do you recall un petitpeujespere victor answered et tu la mime chose blaise said and then in english french was the first white peoples language i learned after the slavers brought me here some of it got beaten into me and that stuck the rest i use english all the time now except when im with stella his wife came from the same part of africa he did till victor got to know blaise he hadnt thought that africa might have as many languages as europe he wondered why not he knew terranovan copperskins spoke many different tongues maybe it was because blacks looked more nearly alike to him than copperskins did how did whites look to terranovans and africans that was an interesting question one of these days maybe hed ask blaise about it for the moment he had more urgent things to worry about first and foremost was keeping freetown in atlantean hands if it still was maybe general howe had sailed for the southernmost goodsized town in english atlantis rather than heading farther south and if he had maybe freetown had opened up for him it had always been a royalist centerespecially when viewed from the perspective of new hastings or even hanover push it boys push it victor called weve got to keep freetown living up to its name the men seemed eager to march he cherished that knowing there would be times when they werent they also had enough to eat which wasnt always true and the roads were good hard enough to march on but not summerdry so that travelers choked in their own dust and advertised their coming from miles away victor breathed a sigh of relief when freetown welcomed him as warmly as the place ever welcomed anybody who wasnt born there his own name was in good odor in these parts hed helped defend freetown against an attack from french atlantis fifteen years earlier he would have put more credit in that if he hadnt had redcoats as allies then freetown also remembered them fondly discovering the place wasnt flying the union jack victor sent a messenger back to honkers mill tell them that if custis cawthorne wants to head for france this may be the best place to leave from ill do it general the man promised brushing the brim of his tricorn with a forefinger freetown fishermen said theyd seen the royal navy sailing south past their home they said as much after atlantean soldiers sought them out and grilled them anyhow they showed no great desire to come forward on their own and share what they knew talking to one of them victor radcliff said we might have walked into trouble if youd kept your mouth shut he got back a shrug i just want this war to end one way or the other the fisherman said dont much care which how many people felt the same way how many went a plague on both your houses when redcoats or greencoats came near them more than a few unless victor missed his guess most of the time that didnt matter it might have here i think you just helped us take a step toward winning he told the fisherman huzzah the fellow said what difference does it make to me dyou think the cod care one way or the other youll have more places to sell them when atlantis is free victor refused to say or even to think if atlantis is free and some nosy bastard seeing how much i caught and how much he can tax me for it no the fisherman didnt care for the war or freedom or anything else victor radcliff raised his right hand as if taking an oath if the day comes when atlantean officials do such things pick up a musket and march on them by god youll see me marching on them too he still failed to impress the freetown man you dont catch on general i dont want to march on anybody i dont want anybody marching on me either i just want to get left alone and not be bothered is that too damned much to ask yes victor thought i was going to give you a couple of pounds for what you knew he said if you dont want to be bothered ill keep them in my wallet the fisherman turned out not to have anything against money going into his pocket no matter how little he liked paying taxes he left victors presence happier than hed entered it that didnt happen every day victor supposed he should have cherished it he made a quick tour of freetowns oceanfacing forts the royal navy hadnt cared to test them by landing here as far as victor could see the sailors had missed a chance they could have put an army of redcoats ashore with little risk from these popguns maybe general howe thought he could win the war farther south heres hoping hes wrong blaise said when victor mentioned that yes victor said heres hoping howe could land wherever he chose he had plenty of time to maneuver after landing too ships sailed faster than men marched and they sailed all through the day and night while marching men had to rest determined to do what he could victor sent riders ahead of his army urging the former french settlements to call out their militias and resist the redcoats wherever the enemy happened to come ashore even if they all obeyed the summons he wondered whether he was doing them a favor the english soldiers would likely go through raw militiamen like a dose of salts he shrugged if he couldnt stop the enemy he had to try to slow them down moving south from freetown took him back in time when he was a younger man hed fought french settlers and french regulars again and again in these parts the redcoats were his allies then hed been glad to lean on their skill and courage now he had to beat them if he could corning up from the south french atlanteans had named the river that ended up dividing their land from that of the english the erdre coming down from the north at about the same time english atlanteans called the same river the stour since the english prevailed in their war the latter name was heard more often these days the bridge over the stour closest to the sea was fine and new and wide roland kersauzons french atlanteans had burned the old one behind them when they crossed back into their own territory after their defeat south of freetown the new one intended as a symbol of unity was mostly stonework fire wouldnt bring it down hogsheads of black powder probably would blaises eyes seemed to get wider alter the atlantean army crossed into what had been french atlantis when the men stopped for the night he took special care to clean his musket you are among friends you know victor told him am i the negros voice was bleak on this side of the river the law says i can be a slave on this side of the river maybe even now is the master i was running from when we first met he squinted at the rod he was using to push an oily cloth down the flintlocks barrel no ones going to put chains on you by god victor said not unless i wander away from the army and somebody knocks me over the head blaise answered i got no freedom papers how could i when i ran off it could happenit has with others well stay out of dark corners and dont go off by yourself victor said past that my guess is anybody who wanted a slave would be afraid to buy one whod worn three stripes on his sleeve blaise thought that over his smile would have made any slaveholders blood run cold youve got something there put together an army of blacks and copperskins and all this part of atlantis runs for its mother victor radcliff laughed even if his heart wasnt in it he hoped blaise couldnt see that one of these days atlantis would have to face up to slavery and either let it go or decide it was a positive good and cling to it more tightly than ever he had the bad feeling that that choice would prove rougher and nastier than the one between the atlantean assembly and king georgewhich was proving quite rough enough on its own he also had the bad feeling that that struggle shouldnt start till this one was over one thing at a time he thought sometimes accomplishing even one thing at a time seemed much harder than it should have general radcliff general radcliff someone shouted blaises grin reverted to its usual mocking self somebody needs you he said we can talk about this other thing some more later all right victor said sometimes not accomplishing something didnt seem so bad he waved and raised his voice here i am whats the trouble something had to be bunged up people didnt yell for him like that when everything was rosy a cavalryman came over to him theres frenchies shooting at us when we try and forage he said theyre coming out with all kinds of daft nonsense like here we are invading them again oh victor swore in english french and for good measure spanish he wished the atlantean army included more french settlers hed tried to include some of the ones he did have in all of his foraging parties why didnt these frenchies want to listen to the people who tried to tell them we arent after themwere fighting the english without being in the least gallic the cavalrymans shrug was a small masterpiece of its kind why general on account of theyre french i reckon can you tell me more than that victor clung to patience they say were robbing them again same as we did before the horseman answered but were not were paying for what we take victor eyed the man whod brought him the bad news you are paying for what you take are you not yes general butter wouldnt have melted in the horsemans mouth but they dont fancy our money and thats the lords truth radcliff took the lords name in vain again his army couldnt pay gold or silveror even copperfor what it requisitioned from the countryside it paid in paper printed by the atlantean assembly possibly printed by custis cawthorne in person if all went well in the war against england that paper might be redeemable for specie some day as things were it was worth what people decided it was worthat the moment not so much with better choices victor wouldnt have been delighted to get atlantean paper himself but the french atlanteans had no better choices they could take the paper money they were offered which was worth some thing or they could take nothing or they could get killed and have their property run off anyway victor couldnt see anything else they might do do you want to go softly or do you want to crush them blaise asked i was wondering the same thing victor answered ill try to go softly at firsti dont want to make them hate us more than they do already the cavalryman put in more than that victor agreed the war is against king george if we have to fight the french settlers too that only makes things harder if they join general howe that also makes things harder so i want to keep them sweet if i possibly can blaise made a discontented noise deep in his throat victor might have known he would french atlanteans were enemies to the negro and always would be he had his reasons for that victor even sympathized with them but his own concerns overrode them he shouted for a groom to fetch his horse lets see if theyll listen to me he said what if they dont the cavalryman asked they will wish they would have victor replied he found his cavalrymen just outside musket range of a stone farmhouse and bam he could see men moving around inside the house maybe friends had gathered together to oppose the cavalry or maybe it was one of the huge families common in atlantis he rode forward under flag of truce is that smart general one of his men asked even if they fire chances are theyll miss victor answered he raised his voice and switched to french i am general radcliff i wish to parley a farmer stuck his head out a window you wish to steal you and all the other english atlanteans we will pay you for what we take victor answered in worthless paper the farmer jeered it is not worthless victor said which was technically true he went on your only other choice is to die fighting we have no quarrel with you but we must eat so must we the farmer said and how do you propose to kill us if you attack we will shoot you down as you come we know how to deal with mad dogs by god you cannot force us from this house it is our patrimony we do not want to fight you but we will if we have to victor couldnt let the farmer get away with too much or he would spend the next five years parleying at every little homestead in french atlantis we will bring up our cannon and knock your patrimony down around your ears the fanner disappeared back into the house victor could hear argument inside but couldnt make out what was going on some of the defenders seemed to realize they couldnt hold out against field guns victor didnt want to slaughter them but war made you do all kinds of things you didnt want to do when the farmer came back to the window he shook a fist at victor you are a bad chalice he shouted which was anything but an endearment from a french atlantean i will take your paper and you will redeem it or i will hunt you down and make you sorry it is agreed victor said if the rebellion won the atlantean assemblys paper would be redeemedhe hoped and if the uprising failed more people than this rustic would be on his trail he gave the man the paper money as the cavalrymen rounded up livestock this looks like a lot the french atlantean said if it really were a lot though youd give me less he wasnt wrong the farmers whose ancestors had sprung from britanny and normandy were commonly canny and he seemed no exception do please rememberyou have one other gift of me victor said oh the farmer quirked a bushy eyebrow and what may that be your life monsieur i was not joking about the artillery i know the farmer said if i thought you were i would have shot you out of the saddle we dont have to love each other all we have to do is work well enough to keep from shooting victor said you have more guns which makes this easier for you to say the farmer repliedand again he had a point since he did victor tipped his hat and rode away no one from the farmhouse or the bam shot him in the back which was as good a bargain as he could hope for general howes army landed at cosquer the oldest french town on the coast victor had expected that the only other choices the redcoats had were to land at st denis a seaside hamlet south of cosquer or to sail around the spanishheld southern coast of atlantis and put in at new marseille or even at avalon no one could stand against them in the west but they would be too far away from the more settled regions to harm the uprising much nouveau redon again blaise asked when the news came in i dont think so victor answered nouveau redon up the blavet from cosquer had been french atlantis greatest fortress till english soldiers and settlers besieged and took it the siege involved cutting off the unfailing spring that watered the town without it nouveau redon had to rely on the river and was far more vulnerable than it had been now we have to see how many people in these parts bend down and kiss king georges boots blaise said victor had trouble imagining the king of england in boots apart from that blaise knew his onions if the locals flocked to the union jack the war down here would be hard if they didnt in that case general howe would have more work to do blaise also had other things in mind even if he didnt mention them now plenty of people in these parts cared not a farthing for either king george or the atlantean assembly but those people had skins either black or coppery and people with white skinspeople who counted in other wordscared not a farthing for what they thought most of the time victor wouldnt have cared either he owned no slaves and had no great love for men who did then again he also wasnt one of the stubborn hotheads who thought negroes and copperskins should all be free if they made their owners money he was willing to let them go on doing that if they rose up against general howe and the redcoats he was willing to let them do that too if they rose up against the atlanteans that was a different story and they might because howe had little to lose in inciting them to rebellion hed shown farther north that he wasnt afraid to play that card blaisevictor said what is it general by the way the colored sergeant said it he was a naturalborn innocent victor smiled if he believed that he was dumb as a honker i must make myself clear here blaise he said we didnt cross the stour to free the slaves we came down here to free ourselves from the english once we manage that we can look at the other too but i fear we cant even look at it till we free ourselves do i make myself plain enough the negros scowl said he made himself much too plain general howe wont care about any o that blaise said which paralleled victors thoughts of a moment before much too closely whatever he tries to do we will set about stopping him the atlantean general said and we will not do anything or say anything about the way of life in these parts unless we have no choice in the matter do i also make myself plain there ill say what i please about it blaise retorted its filthy its wicked by god i should know i wouldnt have run off if it werent victor wasnt so sure about that some peopleblacks whites copperskinsfelt the urge to be free so strongly they would run from even comfortable surroundings but blaise had been a field hand not a house slave so he was likely telling the truth in the grand scheme of things it didnt matter much and victor radcliff had to worry about the grand scheme of things one of these days this whole business will sort itself out blaise he said you know thats true as well as i do if you think a little youll know this isnt the right day dont want to think blaise said sullenly want to he mimed aiming a flintlock and pulling the trigger one thing at a time ive said as much before victor sounded as if he was begging and he was most of the time we have enough trouble managing that when we try to do two things at once we go to the devil he can have the bastard who brought me over here the whitetoothed dealer who sold me and the mangy hound who bought me blaise said if anything in your religion is true theyre all bound for hell i am a christian victor said so was blaise most of the time but victor had grown up with and in his faith and took it as much for granted as the air he breathed coming to it first as an adult blaise enjoyed tinkering with it and trying to figure out how it worked much as a watchmaker might enjoy disassembling a complicated clock and then putting it back together blaise looked at him now you are a christian when it suits you you are a christian to white atlanteanseven to white englishmen when will you be a christian to niggers and mudfaces only in southern atlantis a region with reddish dirt would that have stuck as an insulting name for copperskins victors cheeks heated one thing at a time he said yet again once we drive the english from this land we can make it what we want it to be for everyone who lives everyone how long will you and i be dead before that day comes blaise asked victor wasnt fifty yet while blaise wasnt far from his age he didnt want to claim theyd see the day hed talked about well he wanted to but blaise would only mock him if he tried he did say i think it will take longer if england wins general howe cares more about slaves because he can use them against us than for any other reason and you are proud this is so because blaise asked try as victor might he found no good answer for that blaises smug look said he hadnt thought victor would victor hadnt seen the blavet for a long time the river was at least as important in the history of french atlantis as the brede was to english atlantis hed crossed it several times during the war and more than once before that and hed helped besiege and capture nouveau redon even though the french thought the fortress impregnable custis cawthornes judgment on that had been an impregnable position is one in which youre liable to get screwed as usual pungent and cogent at the same time since taking nouveau redon radcliff had assumed the french atlanteans would love him better at a distance no one from the south had ever told him he was wrong either that left him sad but unsurprised but among the things war made you do were ones youd stay away from in peacetime and so here he was on the river again peering across to the south bank to see if he could spy any sign of general howe and the redcoats no unusual plumes of smoke in the sky no hanging dust that told of an army marching up a dirt road howes men were somewhere on the far side of the blavet but farther off than victor had feared flapjack turtles swimming in the river stared only their heads and long snaky necks above water they made good eating but you had to treat them with respect a big one could bite off a finger worse things than flapjack turtles lurked in the rivers down here too spanish atlanteans called them lagartoslizards english atlanteans mostly used the biblical word crocodiles bridges still spanned the blavet a sure sign fighting in these parts hadnt been going on for long are we going to cross general habakkuk biddiscombe asked the cavalry officer sounded dubious for which victor could hardly blame him all the same he answered yes i think we are we came down here to fight the enemy not just to keep an eye on him yes sir but sure enough even the pugnacious biddiscombe seemed unhappy if they get between us and the river after we go south of it his voice trailed off again if they get between us and our homes you mean victor said habakkuk biddiscombe nodded gratefully yes sir that is what i mean if they do that were in a pile of trouble then wed be wise not to let them dont you agree victor said we would yes biddiscombe nodded again but not everything in war happens the way you wish it would if you know what i mean victor would have been happier if he hadnt had a similar thought not long before all we can do is our best he said i am confident every man here will do that if you are not i hope you will point out the likely shirkers to me so we can separate them from this force as soon as may be oh no general i think everyone will fight hard biddiscombe said hastily i just dont know how much good it will do i see victor fought to hide a smile your concern is not for the common soldiers but for the competence of their commanding general that is a serious business i worry about it myself habakkuk biddiscombe opened his mouth then he closed it again without saying anything and then sketching a salute he jerked his horses head around and retreated in disorder if beating the enemy proved as easy as routing atlanteans everything would go very well indeed after crossing the blavet victor thought about leaving a force behind to protect the bridge in the end he didnt no force of reasonable size would be able to stall the redcoats long he decided the men would be better used with his main body there they might keep the english from approaching the bridge to begin with he did send cavalrymen riding in all directions the sooner he learned exactly where general howe was the better if major biddiscombepromoted after his winter heroicsseemed eager to get away neither he nor victor had to remark on that an english atlantean and his frenchspeaking wifea soldiers widow from the last warcame into the armys encampment to complain why are you requisitioning from us the man asked what did we ever do to you would you go to general howe the same way victor asked by thunder i sure hope so the prosperous farmer replied i suspect hed clap you in irons if you tried but never mind radcliff said we need supplies an army does not subsist on air i wish mine did it would make the quartermasters job easier but until that day comes victor spread his hands in apology how do you expect people to rally to the redcrested eagle if you plunder the countryside the farmer demanded plunderers dont commonly pay victor said as he had so often before the english atlanteans wife proved she understood the language by letting out an unladylike snort and what is your paper good for she asked before making an even more unladylike gesture to show what it was good for after the war is won it will be as good as silver and gold victor insistedhopefully and on the twelfth of never theyll put a crown on my head and feed me pudding all day long the farmer said well sir you have got another choice victor said oh whats that the man perked up we could kill you both and burn the farmhouse over your heads victor said with no expression in his voice or on his face if hed made it sound more like a threat he might have frightened the farmer less the man eyed him to judge whether he was joking well take your paper he said quickly whatever he saw must have convinced him victor meant every quiet word that was wise on his part for victor did should have killed him anyway blaise said when victor told the story back at camp now he will take the atlantean assemblys paper and then say bad things to his neighbors even so that struck victor as all too probable all the same he said our names would be blacker if we started killing everyone we didnt trust after blacker came out of his mouth he wished it hadnt so many phrases in english werent made to be used around free negroes to his relief blaise didnt call him on it instead saying maybe better to lose reputation than to let some of those people hurt us maybe victor said some loyalists would end up getting hurthe was sure of that some had already he went on general howe doesnt hang people just for being on our side either i dont care to give him the excuse to start you white people blaise shook his head you and your rules for war its not quite so bad with them as without them victor said half the time i still think you are crazy every one of you blaise said why not all the time victor inquired because i remember you can make ships to sail from africa to atlantis you can make guns you can make whiskey and rum you can make books blaise named the things that impressed him most my people they cannot do any of these so if you are crazy you are crazy in a clever way crazy like a fox wed say victor replied foxes little red jackals blaise said and victor supposed they were the negro went on i hear tell these foxes dont live naturally in atlantis i hear tell people bring them is this so radcliff nodded it is no fourlegged beasts with fur but for bats lived in atlantis before people brought them here some of your beastshorses and cows and sheep and pigs i see why you brought them but why foxes they kill chickens and ducks whenever they can in england hunting them is a sport victor answered people wanted to do the same here i take it back you white people are crazy blaise said you bring in beasts that cause so much troubleto hunt them for sport well i didnt do it myself victor said and i dont suppose the lizards and snakes and oil thrushes here thank whoever did i believe there were no fourlegged furry beasts here before people brought them they would have eaten up all the oil thrushes like foxes blaise snapped his fingers we have no stupid birds like them in africa as far as victor knew there were no such stupid birds in england or europe eitheror in terranova come to that there werewhat were they calleddodos i think the name was on little islands between africa and india were blaise echoed were people ate them and ate them and now none are left victor said with a shrug i suppose the oil thrushes and honkers will go that way too before too many more years pass all gone how strange blaise said before he could say anything more a cavalryman rode into camp shouting general radcliff general radcliff sir victor ducked out of his tent im here whats wrong the hubbub made him sure something was we found the redcoats general the rider answered he pointed southeast theyre headin this way chapter well we crossed the river to find them victor radcliff hoped he sounded calmer than he felt the sun was sinking toward the green ridge mountains how close are they will they get here before night falls or can we fight them in the morning in the morning id say the rider replied then he shook his head or maybe not if they push their march hard to be sure damnation victor muttered under his breath he couldnt stand people who couldnt make up their minds and he had to rely on what this fellow said no matter how indecisive it was he did the best he could he sent out pickets to cover a fanshaped arc from due south to northeast of his position if general howe did try a forced march the atlanteans would slow him down and warn the main body of his approach victor didnt really anticipate it howe made a better strategist than a field commander on campaign hed proved several times that he didnt move as fast as he might have better to send out the pickets without need than to get an ugly surprise though if we dont fight the redcoats this afternoon we will fight them on the morrow he told the men still in camp clean your muskets riflemen take especial care with your piecesthey foul worse than smoothbores cooks ready supper now if we do tight today better to fight on a full stomach thanks to their foragers they would have enough to eat for the next couple of days after that they would need to shift again and take what they could from some other part of formerly french atlantis victor wondered how the english troops were subsisting themselves did they have a wagon train from cosquer and the ocean did boats bring their victuals up the blavet or were they foraging like the atlanteans it didnt matter now it might if he routed them and fell on their baggage train he laughed at himself he was nothing if not ambitious he had yet to beat the redcoats in a pitched battle and now he was thinking about what might happen after he routed them if he wasnt ambitious hed slipped a cog somewhere no sudden spatters of gunfire disturbed the rest of the afternoon general howe hadnt eaten hot terranovan peppers or anything else that made him break out in a sweat of urgency more riders came in victor got a better notion of the enemys position and an english atlantean whod settled south of the blavet rode into camp just after sunset he introduced himself as ulysses grigsby i hear the redcoats arent so far off he said i hear the same victor agreed gravely you aim to fight em grigsby asked the thought had crossed my mind victor admitted why do you wish to know if this stranger was some loyalist spy he might imagine he could waltz away with the atlanteans battle plans if he did he was doomed to a most painful disappointment but ulysses grigsby said on account of if you do i know a damned good place to do it at he was between forty and fifty skinny and weathered if he hadnt seen a good many outoftheway places victor would have been surprised he smelled of sweat and pipeweed oh you do victor said grigsby nodded victor eyed him if you try to put us in a bad spot or in a good one where general howe knows of some weakness and can use it i promise you it will be your final mistake and if i tell you nothing but the plain truth the other man returned then atlantis will have cause to be grateful victor said we are not in an ideal position to show our appreciation at the moment things being as they are but once we prove to england we are not to be defeated and she leaves off trying to subjugate us we shant forget our friends if that is not enough for you sir i will tell you good evening and be damned to me grigsby suggested you said it not i victor answered hen grigsbys chuckle was dry as dust in an august drought well ill take you there now if you like he chuckled again bring as many guards as you please you dont need to its inside your picket line but i expect youll bring em anyhow youve no reason to trust me yet you got past the pickets unnoticed i gather victor said i sure did but dont fret yourself that dry chuckle came out once more i expect theyd likely spy an army as tried the same one may hope radcliff wasnt about to let anybody hed just met outcalm him ulysses grigsby laughed yet again between the two of them they could probably evaporate the blavet well lets get going said the english atlantean whod settled south of the old dividing line sooner you see im not a prevaricating son of a whore sooner you can commence to ciphering out how to steer general howe into your jaws prevaricating victor echoed not without admiration he would have bet grigsby was selftaught hed known several atlanteans like that they would trot out the proofs of their learning whenever they could wellbuilt women often wore decollete dresses for similar reasons of display he took along half a companys worth of soldiers if that force couldnt let him get away from an ambush then it couldnt and he and atlantis would have to lump it he watched grigsby out of the corner of his eye the other man gave no sign of wanting to betray him to the enemy of course if he was worth anything at all in this game he wouldnt as twilight deepened a poorbob somewhere under the trees loosed its mournful twonote call it sang once more then fell silent as the riders got closer if redcoats skulked nearby the night bird likely wouldnt have called at all more than a few people reckoned hearing a poorbob unlucky this once victor took it for a good sign not much farther grigsby said a few minutes later still ought to be enough light to let you see what im going on about that would be good victor said which got one more chuckle out of his guide grigsby reined in and gestured this here is the place youre the general expect youll see what ive got in mind victor looked east the direction from which howes army would advance he eyed the ground on which his army would fight if things went well slowly thoughtfully he nodded promising mr grigsby promising he said but i am going to keep you under guard till after the fightings over even so he waited to see whether the leathery settler got angry grigsby only nodded back didnt reckon youd tell me any different he replied doesnt look like ill have to wait real long any which way youre right victor said it doesnt the atlantean soldiers grumbled when their sergeants and officers routed them from their bedrolls well before sunup the next morning the sergeants and officers having been awakened earlier still so they could rouse the men had already done their own grumbling stonyhearted they ignored the honking from the common soldiers tea and coffee and breakfast helped reconcile the troops to being alive the eastern sky went gray then pink then gold as sunrise neared stars faded and disappeared the thirdquarter moon went from gleaming mistress of the heavens to a pale gnawed fingernail in the sky keep moving blaise called to the atlanteans near him as they marched along every step you take you have less excuse for tripping over your own big clumsy feet when they got to ulysses grigsbys chosen battlefield a lot of the men murmured appreciatively as baron von steuben had noticed one difference between atlanteans and englishmen was that atlanteans liked thinking for themselves instead of letting somebody else do it for them most of victors troopers imagined themselves captains if not generals they could seeor believed they could seewhat would happen if the redcoats came up that road through the meadow as victor made his dispositions his soldiers dispositions grew cheerier by the minute might evenve been worth booting us out of bed so bloody early a rifleman called to radcliff so glad you approve victor said you wont get higher praise than that grigsby remarked victor nodded dont i know it spatters of musketry started up off to the east victor had sent reinforcements to his pickets during the night he wanted his men to harass the redcoats if they chose the wrong roads and to leave them alone if they came along the ones he wanted this was the tricky part if the atlanteans guided too openly howe would wonder why wouldnt he little by little the gunfire faded away ulysses grigsby sketched a salute damn me if i dont believe youve brung it off well we can hope so victor answered he had his men and fieldpieces deployed the way he wanted them he needed to make general howe think he was ready to fight here but not that he was excessively eager about it for that matter he needed to make himself feel the same way the spot ulysses grigsby had suggested looked good but he wouldnt know it was till the fighting ended and if grigsby had somehow contrived to play him false it would prove to be not so good as it seemed in that case the english atlanteans fate would prove less pleasant than grigsby wished skirmishers forward victor commanded he had to look as if hed just stumbled upon this position and chosen to fight here more or less on a whim soldiers sniping at the redcoats and trying to slow down and disrupt their advance would add a convincing touch cavalrymen rode back through the advancing skirmishers theyre coming the riders shouted and some added obscene embellishments on the theme victor radcliff surveyed the field i do believe were ready to greet them properly he said and then to ulysses grigsbys guards take the gentleman back and keep him out of the way till we see how things develop after that well know whether he stabbed us in the back or we should pat him on his come along you growled the sergeant in charge of the guards youre an endearing chap arent you grigsby said the sergeant looked at him as if flies buzzed around him in an open field no come on i said you certainly did grigsby came victor eyed his men behind a stone wall they shouldnt disconcert the redcoats general howe knew the atlanteans liked to fight from cover when they could sometimes theyd made english troops sorry others the redcoats had managed to storm their positions in spite of everything when the redcoats came to close quarters their skilland viciousnesswith the bayonet gave them the edge more gunfire erupted up ahead that had to be the skirmishers fighting a delaying action against the english yes here they came firing and falling back the musketeers who could shoot more quickly helped keep the redcoats off the riflemen who could hit from longer range come on come on victor radcliff waved his hat you can do it the lines just ahead now most of the skirmishers took their place behind the stone fence some went off to the surgeon either under their own power or helped by their friends brave banners from the atlantean regiments fluttered in the morning sun and more brave banners appeared from out of the sun it didnt seem that an english squad could march into battle without drums thumping and flags flying much less a company or a regiment had trees sprouted flags in place of leaves victor would have thought birnam wood was out looking for dunsinane when general howe and his officers spotted the flags marking the atlantean position they paused well out of rifle range and methodically dressed their lines very faint in the distance sergeants angry shouts reached victors ears he smiled underofficers seemed much the same regardless of army or uniform with his spyglass he found general howe a slightly less gorgeously clad officer was talking to the english commander the lowerranking man pointed to the woods ahead and to either side of the stone fence the atlanteans defended victor idly wondered if that was richard cornwallis or some other english officer whod fought the french atlanteans the last time around whoever the englishman was general howe didnt want to listen to him howe pointed to the atlantean banners then waved his hand the spyglass didnt let victor recognize expressions but he had no doubt what that dismissive gesture meant the english commander did it so well he might have used it on the stage the other officer tried once more this time howes gesture seemed more imperious than dismissive stop bothering me and carry out your ordersthat was what he had to mean the junior officer saluted and rode away whatever he was thinking he perforce kept it to himself howes field artillery deployed the men performed their evolutions with admirable speed and precision victor would have found them even more admirable if they werent aimed at his men one after another the english cannon boomed a roundshot roared over the atlanteans another smacked the fence they sheltered behind flying chunks of stone wounded several men atlantean cannon posted by the fence thundered a reply a lucky shot from one of them knocked a wheel off an english gun carriage the enemy field piece pointed at an odd angle as if trying to stand up straight while drunk artillerymen rushed to repair the wounded cannon another atlantean roundshot plowed through several ranks of redcoats before finally losing its momentum victor heard those distant soldiers shriek their comrades dragged badly hurt men off to the surgeons and took their places without any fuss the slaughter machine that was an english army tramped forward to the beat of the drum and the wail of the fife dont shoot too soon you damnfool musketeers that had to be an atlantean sergeant no officer would have shown common soldiers so much scorn the man went on you just waste powder and lead if you do we can get more lead out of your thick skulls but we really are low on powder a cannon tore another furrow in the english ranks the redcoats closed up and kept coming riflemen opened fire on them those men could have won the war singlehanded if only they reloaded faster since they didnt musketeersbe ready victor shouted that command wasnt in the manual of arms the men knew what it meant all the same victor hoped they did anyhow hed yelled himself hoarse instructing them as they marched from their encampment to this position now had they listened would soldiers pay attention when you tried to get them to do something they werent used to doing musketeersfire that wasnt victor several sergeants and officers yelled the same thing at the same time the muskets roared darts of flame spat toward the oncoming redcoats a young fogbank of fireworkssmelling smoke rose above the stone fence in back of which the atlanteans sheltered surprisingly few englishmen fell the ones who didnt let out a cheer full of as much relief as ferocity the fifes and drums picked up their rhythm the redcoats doubletimed toward the fence at a shouted command their bayoneted muskets lowered in a glittering wave of sharp steel victor tensed if things went wrong now it would be embarrassing fatally embarrassing most likely and things went wrong all the time in war anyone whod done any fighting knew that why didnt the rest of the atlanteans and then all of a sudden they did hed posted men and field guns in the trees in front of and to either side of the stone fence all the banners stayed in plain view behind the fence a welldisciplined englishman like howe might conclude from that that all the atlanteans also stood behind the fence such a conclusion was reasonable it was logical unfortunately for the redcoats it was also wrong dead wrong musketry and canister tore into the english soldiers from both flanks the soldiers in back of the wall abruptly stopped shooting high on purpose muskets werent very accurate under any circumstances but they could hit more often than they had been how the redcoats howled victor whooped and flung his hat in the air and danced an ungainly dancehis side of it at least with blaise they havent learned one damned thing since general braddocks day he shouted to anyone whod listen not one damned thing how do they ever win battles let alone wars blaise asked because theyre brave victor answered because other people are just as stupid as they are but not today by god no not today blaise agreed they cant get through and they cant get away either the redcoats tried charging the stone fence if they could smash the atlanteans there they would fight on their own terms once more not on victor radcliffs several scorching volleys showed them they couldnt dead and wounded men lay drifted in front of the fence and the galling fire from right and left kept costing them more casualties and they were altogether unable to answer it general howes down somebody shouted the news blazed up and down the atlantean line fast as a quickburning fuse it is like braddocks battle blaise exclaimed marching blithely into a trap general braddock had nearly killed english hopes in atlantis along with most of his own soldiers victor and the english atlanteans he led were the ones whod got the redcoats remnants away from the french atlanteans who would extricate this batch of redcoats anyone at all punish them boys victor shouted make them pay for all theyve done to us whooping with delight the greencoats did theyd won skirmishes over the winter but never before a pitched battle against the english considering all the close fights theyd lost the year before they had a lot to pay back they did their best to settle the debt all at once english trumpets blared the foot soldiers stopped trying to force their way over the stone fence that was plainly impossible which hadnt kept them from going on with the attack only the trumpeted order to pull back ended the selfinflicted torment victor admired the redcoats discipline more than their common sense they sullenly reformed their ranks and began to march away do we pursue sir habakkuk biddiscombe asked victors first impulse was to say no he didnt want to throw away the fine victory his men had already gained but the english soldiers had to be more rattled than they seemed didnt they if he pushed them theyd go to pieces wouldnt they he decided he had to find out the only thing better than a fine victory was a great victory if you were going to get one you had to take a chance now and then yes by god we do pursue he exclaimed thank you sir the cavalry officer exclaimed a broad grin spreading across his face i was afraid id have to do something insubordinate to get that order out of you to thwack you with a big stick was what he had to mean victor grinned back well youve got it now make the most of it well do that very thing general biddiscombe started shouting orders of his own victor radcliff realized he knew exactly what he intended to do how long had he been working that out since the moment he first saw this position chances were well good officers needed to think ahead and that reminded victor of something he called for a runner when the young man appeared before him he said my compliments to mr grigsbys guards james and they may release him it seems plain enough that he didnt purpose betraying us to general howe right you are sir james sketched a salute and darted away victor wished for that much energy himself horsemen and field guns went after the retreating redcoats so did the foot soldiers whod pummeled them from the trees andvictor watched in amazed delightdamned if the redcoats didnt fall to pieces right before his eyes in the space of a few minutes an army turned into a panicstricken mob men threw away packs and muskets to flee the faster will you look at that victor said to blaise will you look at that weve whipped them theyve never been beaten like this not in atlantis i dont know when they last got beaten like this back in europe what do we do now blaise asked ill tell you what victor answered custis cawthorne must be in france by this time we make sure he knows about it and we make sure he lets the french hear about it if they help us our chances go up frances navy has got better a lot better since the last time she fought england blaise was more immediately practical no no i mean what do we do with all the prisoners we are taking what do we do with all the muskets and things the redcoats throw out oh victor felt foolish yes what hed talked about also needed doing but what blaise talked about needed doing right away we especially need to round up bayonets with a little luck well never run short of them again and we need to see if weve captured any supply wagons the ones they make in england are better than any we have here i will give those orders blaise hurried away victor whistled softly the whole war had just changed he hadnt yet proved that generalship being equal atlanteans could match englishmen in the open field but if the atlanteans had even slightly better generalship they could not only match the redcoats but beat them i told you so for a moment victor thought the words came straight from his own spirit then he realized ulysses grigsby had come up beside him he nodded yes mr grigsby as a matter of fact you did that took the wind out of grigsbys sails with a wry chuckle he said how am i supposed to stay sore at you when you go and admit something like that plenty of people would think it was easy victor assured him i hope i know what gratitudes worth ulysses grigsby hesitated then plunged and speaking of which your excellency any chance you might reward me in specie instead of paper you didnt get something small from me you know i do indeed and i would be glad to give you specie if only i had any to give that wasnt the full truth but victor didnt think the other man needed to know everything about how the atlanteans financed their war he went on i will put the question to the atlantean assembly if the conscript fathers choose to reward you in the fashion you request no man will be happier than i oh one man will i reckon grigsby jabbed a thumb at his own chest gold and silver they last who knows what atlantean paper will be worth ten years from now meaning no disrespect general but who knows if itll be worth anything ten years from now our best chance to have it at par with specie is to win this war against england victor said thanks to you mr grigsby were far closer to that goal than we were at this hour yesterday damn right we are thats why i want specie grigsby had the simple rapacity of a redcrested eagle victor didnt care why the other man had warned the atlantean army as long as he had nothing else mattered the sun was going down in crimson glory over the green ridge mountains when several grinning atlanteans led an english subaltern carrying a flag of truce into victor radcliffs presence what can i do for you lieutenant victor asked though he supposed he already knew the answer my name is fleming generaljohn fleming the young englishman said i have the honor to convey general cornwallis compliments to you and to ask if your side having prevailed today would be gracious enough to return general howes body for proper interment do you suppose we would bury him improperly victor asked with some asperity we are not barbarians sirunlike the terranovan savages england loosed against our western settlements please excuse me that is not what i meant it is not what general cornwallis meant either lieutenant fleming said quickly well i am pleased to have general cornwallis compliments in days gone by as you may know we fought on the same side victor said so perhaps you will be so kind as to explain to me what he did mean certainly sir fleming said if a fight went badly for you would you not sooner be buried by your friends than by your foes i would sooner not have to make such an unhappy choice but i do see what you mean victor answered we have captured more than a few of your wagons in the pursuit i shall return one of them to you with general howes bodywhich i assure you has not been badly plundered what does that mean lieutenant fleming could also sound sharp he is fully accoutered victor said when i first saw his body his purse was empty whether he went into the battle with it empty i fear i cannot say he spread his hands war is what it is true enough the english officer sighed but he nodded i accept your assurances on that score if you would like to take back as many other bodies as the wagon will carry you may do so having won victor could afford to be generous about trifles he did believe the redcoats would have returned the favor had things gone the other way very good of you sir john fleming sketched a salute if i may look at the bodies since you make this offer a grimace got past the correct mask hed worn i fear my older brother captain james fleming is among the fallen several men saw him go down in front of that damned stone fence you defended so stoutly oh my dear fellow my deepest sympathies you should have spoken sooner victor exclaimed may i give you brandy or rum as with an amputation they will dull the worst pain a bit no thank you i can in good conscience transact military business with you but meaning no disrespect i would rather not drink with you i understand i am sorry victor raised his voice and waved when a messenger came up he said fetch a torch and lend lieutenant fleming here every assistance in examining the english dead he believes his brother lies among them if he should prove correct captain flemings body will go back through the lines with him along with general howes and as many others as a wagon may hold yes sir the messenger nodded to the english officer thats mighty hard you come with me well do what we can for you very well i am as grateful as one can be under the circumstances lieutenant fleming followed the messenger toward the redcoats tumbled corpses more he takes more we dont have to bury blaise remarked i dont think one wagonload will make much difference victor paused but i must admit i wont be on the business end of a shovel cither worth remembering blaise said no doubt hed been on the business end of a shovel during his days as a slave but slaves worked as slowly as their overseers would let them get away with free men had a different rhythm victor had used a shovel often enough on his farm in building fieldworks and in burying his children when they died too young after a while the wagon rattled off toward the east victor didnt ask whether lieutenant renting had found his brother it might matter to the redcoat but it didnt to him he did what he had to do next without waiting for morning he sent a messenger off to the atlantean assembly with word of the victory he also recommended that the assembly get the news to france as soon as it could when the french learned the locals had beaten english regulars in a pitched battle they might have a higher regard for this uprising then again they might not but the atlanteans had to find out if custis cawthorne cant talk king louis into coming in on our side nobody can major biddiscombe said when victor told his officers council what hed done just so victor said of course given how badly the french had lost in their last fight with england the painful possibility that no one could persuade them to try again was very real we ought to chase the redcoats all the way back to cosquer biddiscombe added we ought to take the place away from them again if we can if they have no fieldworks in place around it which i confess to finding unlikely if the royal navy does not lie close offshore victor said i am anything but eager to face bombardment from big guns i cannot hope to answer i had enough of that up in weymouth enough and to spare habakkuk biddiscombe looked discontented he sounded more than discontented nobody ever won a tight by reckoning up all the things that might go wrong before he started perhaps not victor said but plenty of officersthe late general howe being only the most recent examplehave lost battles by failing to reckon up what might go wrong i trust you take the point sir biddiscombe didnt like it no matter how intrepid he was though he wasnt blindly intrepid he could smell something if you rubbed his nose in it reluctantly he nodded i think i do general good as victor had with the english lieutenant he threw his own subordinate a sop i also trust you will pursue vigorously the more english stragglers we scoop up the more muskets and wagons and god willing cannon we capture the better our cause will look here and up in honkers mill and in due course in france blaise said it would seem strange fighting on the same side as france after going against her in the last war the redcoats were on our side last time victor reminded him war and politics are like that when lieutenant fleming came in to ask for howes body he gave me general cornwallis compliments our old friendand i did count him a friendnow commands the enemy could something like that not happen in africa or do your tribes never change alliances i suppose it could blaise said but i think you white men are more changeable than we it could be so victor said still youve also talked about the things we know how to do that your people dont learning such things comes with being changeable too i think it comes from being changeable dont you i suppose it could blaise said again well its an argument for another time not for a council of war victor said he could see that some of his officers would have said the same thing if he hadnt better to beat them to the punch he went on the argument for this council is how best to exploit our victorythe victory that you won gentlemen they raised three cheers theyd chewed over too many narrow but undeniable defeats victory tasted so much better chapter cosquer didnt fall easily victor had hoped it might but hadnt really expected it to he remembered how well cornwallis then a lieutenantcolonel had fortified freetown after general braddock fell the new english commander was no less diligent now his engineers no less clever and the redcoats in the works remained ready to fight maybe they werent quite so eager to face the atlanteans in the open field as they had been but they didnt mind letting victors soldiers come to them why should they when they hoped to bloody the locals on the cheap but victor didnt oblige them attacking field works was a fools game or a desperate mans he wasnt desperate and he hoped he wasnt that kind of fool anyhow even if he had been tempted to assault cornwallis entrenchments knowing royal navy frigates and ships of the line lay offshore would have made him think twice their firepower didnt reach far inland but within its reach he had nothing that could reply to it heavy guns on land sat in forts they moved slowly if they moved at all ships carried them faster than unencumbered men could march as fast as cavalry scouts could ride can we starve them out blaise asked unhappily victor shook his head not as long as they rule the sea they can bring in food from other parts of atlantis or even all the way from england what are we doing here then blaise asked a much more than reasonable question holding them in victor answered they cant do anything much as long as we pen them there blaise grunted neither can we yes we can victor said it again we can they have to beat us to make us quit fighting all we have to do is show them they cant do that as long as we stay in the field as long as we prove to them they cant do whatever they please in atlantis they will lose im not sure they understand that yet im not sure how long they will need to understand it but we have to keep fighting till they do however long it takes the negro grunted again but on a different note anyone who knows you knows how pigheaded you are victor assumed a pained expression stubborn please people you dont like are pigheaded your friends are stubborn or hold to their purpose stubborn then blaise said after a pause to show he was thinking it over you are yes but can you keep your army stubborn he knew how to get to the bottom of things all right he always had victor said the only thing he could i aim to try anyhow he wondered whether cornwallis would get reinforcements from farther north if the english officer did victor feared he had a decent chance of breaking out of cosquer what would he do then what could he do fight more battles like the ones the redcoats and atlanteans had tried the year before what would that prove that the redcoats were better than the settlers in the open field if they didnt get careless it might not even prove that the atlanteans were improving with every fight they had they might not match cornwallis veterans yet but they were getting close greencoated riflemen sniped at the english soldiers in the trenches that wouldnt decide anything victor knew it and cornwallis had to know it too but it did sting the redcoats and they seemed to be without riflemen of their own to reply in kind maybe it could sting them into doing something foolish victor also had to keep his own men from doing something foolish habakkuk biddiscombe wanted to storm cosquer we can beat them general the cavalry officer insisted by god we can and then everything below the stour is ours for good if i order an attack we will make one victor said until i order one we wont i dont think we can succeed i do biddiscombe said when you wear a generals sash you may use your men as you can find best victor said as patiently as he could for now though the responsibility still rests on my shouldersand there are times when i think atlas had it easy holding up the heavens believe me there are times when i think the cavalry officer left it there which was bound to be lucky for both of them then general cornwallis solved the atlanteans problem withdrawing from his fieldworks he did it with his usual skill he left fires burning in the works all night long to fool the atlanteans into thinking his men still occupied them by the time the sun came up to show they had gone they were already back in cosquer and they and the rest of the redcoats with them were climbing into boats and going out to the warships anchored offshore it was as if cornwallis were saying well if you want cosquer so much here it is and be damned to you victor did want cosquer but not at the price of bringing his soldiers under the royal navys guns if the redcoats were pulling out hed let them go he unlimbered his field guns and fired at them from long range he probably knocked over a few of them but they had to know as he did it was only more harassment it didnt change their evacuation a farthings worth once the english army had boarded the warships sails blossomed on their masts slowly at first but then building momentum the ships sailed off toward the south where do they think theyre going habakkuk biddiscombe sounded angry as if he suspected victor had been listening in on cornwallis deliberations and hadnt told him do they think they can land in spanish atlantis and then come back up and go on with the war that way i wouldnt be surprised if they do victor answered have you ever had anything to do with the dons not me the prospect seemed to affront the major english and french atlanteans both looked down their noses at the spaniards farther south spain had a rich empire in terranova but her atlantean dominions were an afterthought and had been for many years most spanish settlers here were men whod failed or hadnt dared try in the broader lands beyond the hesperian gulf the dons also had a reputation for being uncommonly cruel to their slaves one reason uprisings always bubbled just below the surface for my sins i have victor told biddiscombe they are the touchiest human beings god ever made if cornwallis landed at gernika say without their leave they would drop all their private feudsof which they have a great plenty believe meto do him all the harm they could im sure he loses sleep over that scorn filled habakkuk biddiscombes voice spain had and had earned an unenviable military reputation the only reason england hadnt seized spanish atlantis at the end of the last war was that she hadnt thought it worth seizing but victor said rile a spaniard and hell try to kill you without caring for his own life a spanish army is nothing much spanish bushwhackers its no accident that guerrilla is a spanish word biddiscombe said a few spanish words victor hadnt thought he knew when he ran out of foreign incendiaries he added you can bet cornwallis feels the same way about them no doubt victor said but the question is how they feel about cornwallisand about whether he purposes landing there at all where else would he go down to the islands biddiscombe answered his own question with a shake of the head not likely thatd take him clean out of the war he has to head for spanish atlantis no one has to do anything victor spoke with great conviction by the way habakkuk biddiscombe eyed him he might suddenly have started spouting blaises language cosquer greeted the incoming atlantean army the same way it had probably greeted the incoming english army with indifference new hastings was a trifle older but cosquers founder francois kersauzon had stumbled upon atlantis even before the radcliffes people in cosquer remembered even if hardly anyone else in these modern times did they looked down their noses at all latecomers some of them still spoke buzzing breton instead of french or english victor didnt think all the strange names he heard riding into cosquer were compliments as long as no one did more than mutter in a halfforgotten tongue he didnt care he went on to the quays hoping some longshoreman or tapman or even doxy had heard where cornwallis planned to sail no one who might have seemed to want to tell an english atlantean though the tapmen and doxies were willing enough to take his mens silver as for the longshoremen how soon will you get out of here asked one of the few who condescended to speak to victor at all when were ready victor said how soon will you learn some manners when im ready the local answered cheekily dont hold your breathmanners are for friends i am not your enemy you should be glad of that victor said stinking saoz the longshoreman said and turned away that one victor did know the fellowd called him an englishman save that name for cornwallis he said im an atlantean by god a saoz is a saoz no matter where hes whelped the longshoreman answered god may care about the details but i dont god has better sense than you do victor rode away to see if he could find answers anywhere else but no one in cosquer seemed to know anything no one who did seemed inclined to tell it to a saoz anyhow to victor they amounted to the same thing then he got a rush of brains to the head he hunted up blaise and handed him some money whats this in aid of the negro asked take off your uniform put on some ordinary clothes none too fancy victor answered wander through the taverns buy yourself a few drinks see what you can hear about where the english went maybe i wont hear anything blaise said maybe you wont victor agreed but maybe you will too make them think youre a slave on a toot white people talk too much in front of slaves they think the slaves arent listening or cant understand blaise raised an eyebrow i know things like that he brushed two fingers of his right hand against the back of his left to show off his black skin and to remind victor how he knew why do you know them radcliff used the same gesture the negro had because im a white man myself and i know how white men think i would have thought the same wayi did think the same waybefore i met you i hope i know better now ah blaise said and then well maybe you do with that faint praise victor had to be content off the negro went on his mission of espionage victor fell asleep before he came back from it lamps werent bright enough to tempt the general to stay up long after the sun went down he did wonder whether blaise would remember what hed heard come morning and when he got a look at blaise the next morning he wondered even more oh my he said sympathetically oh dear with trembling hand blaise reached for a tin mug of coffee he was badly the worse for wear the whites of his eyes yellowish and tracked with red dont know why you brew that hellwater you call rum he said people feel mighty bad after they drink it mighty bad he gulped the steaming coffee then gulped again hoping it would stay down most folks dont worry about the day after while theyre drinking victor observed that goes for blacks and copperskins and whites alike i expect it goes for chinamen too but i cant prove iti dont know any after one more gulp blaise seemed to decide things would stay where he wanted them to well he said no one will ever tell me i did not earn the money you gave me last night no one is trying to victor said did you learn anything except that a hard night leads to a harder morning oh doesnt it just blaise agreed with the fervor of a reformed sinner or perhaps not completely reformed he held out the tin cup saying have you got any brandy to help me take the edge off not many atlanteans with pretensions to being gentlemen failed to carry a flask victor had one you never could tell when you might need a nip against the cold or simply want one victor poured a careful dose into blaises coffee obliged sir the negro drank he nodded oh yes much obliged better now victor inquired some blaise nodded he didnt seem to fear that his head would fall off any more or even to hope it would having been through some long drunken nights himself victor knew progress when he saw it he tried again how much of what you heard in your tavern crawl do you recollect anything interesting maybe blaise took another sip of the improvedno here in french atlantis they would call it correctedcoffee people seem to think cornwallis will come up on the west coast one of them called it buggering a sheep heh victor radcliff said uneasily the redcoats could steal a march on him over there sure enough atlantean forces even counting the men sent west to fight the copperskins the english had imported were thin on the ground but having landed there what could cornwallis do next cross the green ridge mountains and return to the more settled parts of the country maybe if he landed at new marseille or one of the smaller towns south of avalon hunting was still supposed to be very easy in the southwest even so how sure are these ah people did they hear his plans from some english officer or are they guessing the way you will when you dont know some of them sounded pretty sure blaise answered i dont think i heard one of them say an englishman told him what the redcoats were doing but they thought they had a good notion all right victor paused eyeing the negros decrepit condition he decided something more than that was called for i thank you blaise you did everything you could and you did atlantis a good turn i hope so blaise seemed to have gone through the mill all right what are you going to do now even more than to be or not to be that was the question victor had even more trouble than hamlet had coming up with a good answer unhappily he said i dont know getting our army across to new marseille we might do it or we might lose two men out of three sick or starving if we try taking a lot of men across atlantis has never been easy you were going to do it when we were down in the spaniards country till the royal navy came and took us back to freetown blaise said still unhappily victor nodded we were in trouble then and wedve been in worse trouble if wed had to try it and we had a lot fewer men then than we do now more settlers in the back country now than there used to be blaise observed thats so victor admitted what he couldnt very well deny but he went on are there enough to subsist us on the way i think not whatever we need well have to fetch with us or kill along the way blaise said honkers oil thrushes deer that run wild through the woods rabbits too i suppose i hope we arent down to eating turtles and frogs and snakes by the time we get to the hesperian gulf and we cant very well kill cannon along the way somehow or other well have to get our field guns over the mountains i dont look forward to that mountains down here are lower than they are farther north some tracks through them too blaise said i was thinking about running off that way but i decided to go north instead i hear there are villages of runaway blacks and copperskins across the mountains ive heard it too victor said i dont know if its true oh i think so blaise sounded more certain than he had when he was talking about what the english intended how much did he know how much of what he knew would he tell a white man a good deal and not very much respectivelythat was victors judgment and all things considered who could blame him for that marching west had all the appeal of grabbing a snake by the tail to find out if it was venomous not marching west struck victor as even worse thoughthat was waiting for the snake to bite you and so without enthusiasm but without shirking he got ready to leave cosquer behind he left a garrison in the town he didnt want the royal navy simply sailing in and retaking it as soon as he marched away that also gave him an excuse to take fewer men over the green ridge mountains he gratefully seized on any excuse he could get he and the army hadnt gone more than a few miles up the south bank of the blavet when a rider from out of the west came up to them victor eyed the fellow in bemusement cornwallis couldnt have got to new marseille yet could he and even if by some miracle of perfect winds and wild sailing he had news that he had couldnt have come back across the mountains and it hadnt brandishing a rolled and sealed sheet of paper the horseman said general i bring you this from the atlantean assembly at honkers mill he managed to invest the little towns silly name with a dignity it certainly hadnt earned this turned out to be the floridly official thanks of the atlantean assembly written in magnificent calligraphy by some secretary who probably had no other talent he could sell victor held it out for his soldiers to see finishing they sent it to me but it belongs to all of you the men cheered the courier handed him another smaller rolled and sealed sheet isaac fenner gave me this to give to you just before i set out did he what fenner said privately might be more interesting than the public proclamation it accompanied victor popped off the seal with his thumbnail and unrolled the letter fenners hand was legible enough but small and cramped nothing much beside the secretarys splendid script well done the redhead from bredestown wrote youve given england one in the slats shell be a long time forgetting and something more may come of it not quite certain yet but the chances look better by the day youll know when it happensi promise you that the whole world will know his scribbled signature followed what does fenner say habakkuk biddiscombe asked with the air of a man entitled to know since he was no such thing he only succeeded in putting victors back up that something important will be coming out of honkers mill soon he answered which had the virtue of being true and the larger virtuein his mind at leastof not being informative fenner is full of moonshine promises biddiscombe said no wonder his hair is redit shows hes descended from a fox and not descended very far either if you feel that way im surprised youre not riding alongside king georges men victor remarked oh i hope im a loyal atlantean which i hope ive proved by now too the cavalry officer said but i also hope i know a rogue when i see one and may i be damned if i dont see one whenever i look towards isaac fenner victor radcliff shrugged maybe he is a rogue but so what if he is hes our rogue england has a great plenty of them a few of our own may prove useful as the mild dose of smallpox in inoculation commonly holds the stronger sickness at bay major biddiscombe allowed still and all i doubt ill be much impressed after honkers mill labors to bring forth a ridiculous mouse good to know you remember your horace victor murmured all we can do is wait to see what happens there while we do our best down here have you ever crossed the mountains before no sir biddiscombe said i like the comforts of civilization i can live without them when i must but i prefer not to not the worst attitude you seem to cope in the field well enough your servant sir habakkuk biddiscombe doffed his tricorn at the praise but radcliff hadnt finished well need your talents as we travel and those of the ruffians you lead youll be widely spread out in front of the army to find trouble before it finds us and to forage for the main body well do all we canyou may rely on that biddiscombe said and well slaughter every honker and oil thrush we come upon up in hanover and new hastings ive heard people who style themselves natural philosophers say we should try to preserve the honkers and other unique natural productions of atlantis to let forthcoming generations see and study them alive rather than from specimens and stories victor said general meaning no disrespect to such people but talk is cheap biddiscombe said id like to hear them babble about not shooting honkers after they try to cross the mountains and get to new marseille overland if they didnt declare that there ought to be a bounty on the big stupid birds id be astonished well now that you mention it so would i victor admitted an empty belly makes a stern taskmaster habakkuk biddiscombe nodded i should say so and how many natural philosophers so called have ever known its pinch why ask me the next time you keep company with one enquire of him victor said and in the meanwhile why dont you go keep some order among your horsemen ive had enough of you he meant but he didnt say it he would have if biddiscombe had argued with him but the cavalry officer for a wonder too took the hint just as you say sir he replied sketching a salute and rode away what does fenner have in mind blaise asked quietly as quietly victor answered i truly dont know hes being coy whatever it turns out to be i hope it proves as important at he thinks thats all nouveau redon again this time traveling from east to west the town wasnt what it had been it never would be again not unless someone found a way to resurrect the spring that had watered it several ingenious engineers and charlatansthe difference between the two wasnt always easy to see in advancehad tried but none with any success these days nouveau redon drew its water out of the river that lay below the heights it commanded that made it easy to besiege despite its stillformidable works people said it was a sicklier place now than it had been when the spring gurgled up through the living rock victor didnt know for a fact that that was true but hed heard it more than once he didnt stop at the town skirting it to the south his foot soldiers didnt seem sorry not to have to climb up to it the cavalry whose horses would have had to do the work might have had a different view victor didnt ask them he was starting to find dealing with habakkuk biddiscombe as wearing as the intrepid horseman probably found dealing with him he wanted to force the march if the redcoats got there before him then they do thats all he told himself sternly if he confronted them with a few hundred starving skeletons he wouldnt do atlantis cause any good and that would happen if he pushed too hard hed leave men behind all the way to the mountains and all the way across them as well the quartermasters at nouveau redon were unenthusiastic about turning loose of what they held in their storehouses that was as victor had seen before an occupational disease of quartermasters these fellows had a worse case than most only a direct order made a couple of them condescend to come down and talk to him were here to protect these stores general and to preserve them one of the men said importantly why victor radcliff asked why the quartermaster echoed he and his comrade looked at each other that didnt seem to have occurred to either of them why victor repeated whats the point of protecting and preserving the supplies in nouveau redon again hed taken the officers by surprise at last the fellow whod spoken before ventured a reply i suppose to keep them in readiness in case they were to be required by some military situation aha victor struck like a lancehead or some other southern viper the quartermaster officers flinched as if he really did have fangs he wished he didhe would have bitten both of them in lieu of that he said do your excellencies suppose a march west from here in the direction of the hesperian gulf might possibly be a military situation requiring the release of stores from nouveau redon it might said the quartermaster who talked more he wasnt about to admit anything he didnt have tooh no not him let me ask the question another way gentlemen victor said in his iciest tones do you suppose that if you dont turn loose of what i need i wont cashier the lot of you and clap you in irons you cant do that the quartermaster gasped watch me victor said i took nouveau redon back in the days when it didnt need to haul water up from the blavet i can damn well take it again if i have to cornwallis and i were on the same side then i didnt think you were on his side now perhaps i was wrong general that is an insult the man from nouveau redon said stiffly his colleague nodded not by the way you act it isnt victor told them this is a military necessity you have the supplies i need you can release them to me in accordance with the orders i am lawfully entitled to give by virtue of my appointment at the hands of the atlantean assemblyor you can declare yourselves the foes of atlantis freedom which will it be gentlemen he drew his sword the quartermasters as befitted their unmilitary soldiering were unarmed but victor didnt assail them directly instead he drew a circle in the ground around their feet be so kind as to answer me before you step out of that he said not sheathing the blade the quartermaster whod been quiet up till then spluttered we are not antiochus officers general hed had some classical education too then victor grinned savagely thats true youre my subordinates can you imagine what a roman general would have done with a set of insubordinate officers lucky for both of you that we dont crucify these days or youd have more in common with our savior than you ever wanted when the men from nouveau redon tried to retreat he held them in place with the swordthey hadnt answered him youll get what you want the talkier one said with a sudden access of spirit he added we commonly find it wiser to humor madmen if you drive me mad with excuses whos to blame victor slid the sword back into its sheath go on both of you and remember one thing atlantis isnt big enough for you to hide in if you play me false once you get back inside those walls they hurried away supplies started corning out of nouveau redon victor nodded to himself he hadnt expected anything else blaise was of less sanguine temperament where victor saw things going well the negro saw things that might go wrong what happens if once we get farther away they stop sending wagons after us he asked simple victor answered i send back a detachment and i start hanging quartermasters pour encourager les autres he quoted custis cawthorne quoting voltaire since french was the first white mens language blaise had learned he followed with no trouble he smiled like a crocodile like a wolf an englishspeaker in a land where there were wolves would have said yes that will work he said those people they put on uniforms but they would piss themselves if they had to fight victor nodded i shouldnt wonder he said but have you seen how many soldiers do piss themselves or shit themselves when they almost get killed you cant always help it i dont think ive ever done it but i know ive come close what about you ive seen it blaise replied i never quite did it myself i wouldnt admit i was close if you didnt say the same thing first im the general people will think im brave till i do something to show them im not victor said i wish they felt that way about me blaise shrugged wont happen not the color i am folks see a black man they think hes a nigger hes a coward makes it easier for them to keep slaves i reckon they do the same damn thing with copperskins too wouldnt be surprised victor said hed heard africans were made house slaves more often than terranovan natives were they were reckoned less likely to stab their owners in the middle of the night and abscond after setting the house afire but anyone who thought blaise and a lot of blacks like him were docile would make his last mistake nouveau redon fell well behind the green ridge mountains rose higher in the west supply wagons kept coming blaise nodded in somber approval you did put the fear of god in them he said heres hoping the real worry is what happens once we cross the mountains victor said wagons wont be able to follow us then we manage one way or another we manage blaise said which left victor wondering which of them was the sanguine one after all he also wondered what isaac fenner had been talking about in his last note usually victor grimaced whenever a courier from honkers mill came up the atlantean assembly couldnt run his army from a distance which didnt always keep it from trying that left him with the unwelcome choice between idiotic obedience and mutinous disobedience if they told him what they wanted and then let him try to do it if he expected that to happen he was sanguine all right or possibly stark raving mad now though he would have welcomed news from the backwoods capital and no doubt because he would have welcomed it none came he wondered whether couriers could follow over the mountains too hed soon find out a rider caught up with the army just before it started heading up into the foothills the man was brandishing a big sheet of paper even before he came up to victor proclamation he shouted the atlantean assemblys proclamation well lets see it victor said gruffly he sometimes thought the assemblys proclamations came three for a farthing two of the conscript fathers couldnt blow their noses at the same time without convening a meeting to issue a solemn proclamation commemorating the occasion he quickly read through this one what does it say someone asked its aa proclamation of liberty he answered it says that king george has mistreated the settlements so badly no one here can stand to live under him any more it says the settlements are free independent states from now on and it says they come together of their own free will to form what it calls the united states of atlantis it says were as much of a country of our own as england or france or spain or holland and it says well fight to the death to hold the rights god gave us he waved the proclamation of liberty himself god bless the united states of atlantis the united states of atlantis the soldiers shouted and down with king george and as many other things in those veins as they could come up with this time isaac fenner was right the assembly hadnt done anything small chapter fog drifted in front of victor radcliff like a harem girls veil in a spicy story about the life of the ottoman sultan here and there he could see fifty yards ahead maybe even a hundred but the men to either side of him were indistinct to the point of ghostliness one of those ghosts was blaise are we still going west he asked i think so victor had a peer at a compass to be sure he nodded in some relief yes we are you could have fooled me blaise said come to that you could be fooling me now id never know the difference we may not keep on going west for long victor said the pass through the green ridge mountains twisted and doubled back on itself like a snake with a bellyache a path of sorts ran through it but only of sorts travelers had passed this way bound for new marseille an army never because the pass climbed the weather here reminded victor of that farther north not only was it moist it was also surprisingly cool ferns and mushrooms grew lush one horse had eaten something that killed it in a matter of hours seeds a toadstool victor didnt know neither did anyone else that discouraged the men from plucking up mushrooms which they eagerly would have done otherwise pines and towering redwoods grew on the slopes above the pass they hadnt been logged off here as they had so many places farther east strange birds called from the trees blaise pointed atone when the fog thinned is that a green woodpecker i think it may be victor answered the bird drilled on a branch proving what it was never seen one like that before blaise said neither have i victor wondered whether some wandering naturalist had ever shot a specimen did a preserved skin sit in a cabinet in the museum in occupied hanover or perhaps across the sea in one in london or was the woodpecker nondescript new to science he shrugged he had more urgent things to worry about getting through the pass came first getting to new marseille with his army more or less intact ran a close second then came beating general cornwallis and driving him away next to those victor couldnt get excitedhe couldnt let himself get excitedabout a green woodpecker a man slipped on a wet fern or on some muddy moss or a rotten mushroom and landed hard on his backside he took the name of the lord in vain as he got to his feet you dont want to say such things eb chided one of his comrades god he punishes blasphemy well i expect he must eb responded if he didnt why would he afflict me with idiots for friends you come down the way i did youre just naturally going to let out with something with a bit of spice to it but you shouldnt you mustnt his friend said earnestly for all you know god made you fall just then so he could test you if he did things dont look so good for you eb had one hand clapped to his bruised fundament he clapped the other to his forehead god knows everything that was or is or will be aint that right i should hope it is his friend answered all right then in that case he knew ahead of time id call on him like when i slipped there so how can he get angry at me for doing something he knew i was going to do anyhow that isnt how predestination works ebenezer sanders and you know it blamed well now ebs friend sounded shocked you sound like a parrot giving back what the preachers say eb replied the only one who knows is god preachers are nothing but damn fools same as you and me his friend spluttered no more words seemed to want to come out though blaise showed victor he wasnt the only one whod listened with interest to the argument asking do you think god knows everything ahead of time do you think we do things because he wills it victor shrugged im a christian manyou know that but im with eb on one thing the only one who knows god is god hes the only one who can know people do the best they can but theyre only guessing i suppose so blaise pursed his thick lips gods in africa dont pretend to be so strong well except the muslims god is he the same one you worship to victor what blaise called muslims were mahometans hed also discovered blaise knew more about them than he did he shrugged again i cant tell you a little to his surprise the answer made blaise smile one thing i have to sayyoure an honest man when you dont know something you say so you dont try and talk around it the way so many people do do they do that in africa too victor asked instead of smiling blaise laughed oh yes ohhh yes doesnt matter what color you are not for that black or white or copperskinned lots of folks wont even tell themselves they dont know something i know its true of white men radcliff said i shouldnt wonder if youre right for the others youd best believe i am sir blaise sounded absolutely certain and if your fancy ships find an island full of green men or maybe blue some of them will talk bigger than they know too that set victor laughing right againno doubt about it green men he chuckled at the conceit you never can tell the negro said i wouldnt have believed there were white men till i saw oneand till our enemies sold me to them i wouldnt have believed a lot of the things that happened to me after that either it hasnt been all bad has it you wouldnt have met stella if youd stayed behind in africa victor said no but she was taken and sold too blaises face clouded and what white men do withdo totheir slave women it isnt good its maybe the very worst thing about keeping slaves the worst do you tell me black men dont treat slave women the same way victor asked or copperskins or the green and blue men on that mysterious island out in the pacific oh no sir we keep slaves too some of us and our men futter the women blaise answered but that doesnt make it right not for us not for you not for nobody do you say im wrong before victor could say anything blaise added so the settlements of atlantis are the liberated united states of atlantis how can they be really when so many folk in them arent liberated at all victor discovered he had no answer for that on the downhill slope general one of the scouts told victor no doubt about itnot a bit good victor said if its true he appendedbut only to himself aloud he asked have you come this way before not me the scout said and victor discounted the report almost as steeply as atlantean paper money was discounted against specie but the fellow went on the frenchie im riding with has and he says the same thing well good the reports value jumped again victor wished atlantean paper would do the same maybe the proclamation of libertyand his victory outside nouveau redonwould help it rise here in the wilderness money didnt need to be the first thing on his mind he and his men couldnt get their hands on any they hadnt brought with them and couldnt buy anything they hadnt likewise brought along life would have been simplerbut less interestingwere that more widely true he sucked in a lungful of hot humid air he wouldnt breathe any other kind this far south in the lowlands on the west side of the green ridge mountains the bay stream brought warmth up from the seas to the southwest and western atlantis got its share before the current went on towards europe victor had heard custis cawthorne and other savants speculate that absent the bay stream europe would be as chilly as was the land at corresponding latitudes of northern terranova he didnt know enough to form an opinion pro or con there from everything he could see neither did the savants that didnt stop them from speculating or even slow them much beards of moss hung from horizontal branches hed seen that farther south on the other side of the mountains mostly down in spanish atlantis some people called the stuff spaniards moss in fact when you found it at all in the east at these latitudes it was more like the down beginning to sprout on a youths face than a proper beard hunting parties brought back plenty of oil thrushes their flesh though greasy was quite good the southwestern quadrant of atlantis was most thinly settled and oil thrushes were still common for which he was grateful they made good eating and one bird was a meal for anywhere from two to four soldiers depending on how hungry they were he looked forward to gnawing meat off a leg bone himself the wings werent big enough to be worth bothering with hed just finished supper when a commotion at the edge of the camp made him hurry over to see what was going on a soldier clutched his leg another man pointed to the beaten corpse of a colorful little snake it bit him the pointer said he stepped on it and it went and bit him the snake had been minding its own business what was it supposed to do when somebody trod on it victor eyed the remains stripes of red and black and yellow get him to the surgeons victor said lets hope they can do him some good it hurts the bitten man said am i going to die i dont think so victor lied without compunction if that was a coral snake as he feared the atlantean might very well coral snakes lurked in undergrowth they hid beneath chunks of bark they didnt go out of their way to strike people but when they did he tried to stay cheerful the surgeons will give you plenty of whiskey to keep your heart strong well hot damn the sufferer exclaimed take me to em by jesus he died the next morning unable to breathe his heartbeat fading to nothingness sorry general one of the surgeons told victor we did everything we knew how to do but his shoulders wearily slid up and down if a poisonous serpent bit you you were in gods hands not any surgeons im sure you did victor said well bury him and well go on nothing else we can do on they went some supplies did come over the green ridge mountains after themsome but not enough victor would have been more disappointed had he expected anything more the path west to avalon was far and away the best on this side of the mountains hed never thought he could keep an army of this size supplied from the far side of the mountains even on that track this route to new marseille didnt compare well the hunting was better down here hed told himself that before he did once more hoping he was right redcrested eagles screeched from cypresses seeing and hearing them raised victors hopes the eagles were dangerousmen reminded them of honkers their proper prey but in this part of atlantis redcrested eagles could more readily find that proper prey and if they could people could too so victor hoped anyhow and habakkuk biddiscombes horsemen did they brought back more than a dozen of the enormous birds on the backs of packhorses each honker carcass would feed a lot more than two to four soldiers victor imagined his manytimesgreatgrandfather gaping at a salted honker leg in some low tavern in brittany that was how the story of atlantis started with francois kersauzon telling edward radcliffe about the new land far out in the sea the english had always put more into this land and got more out of it so victor thought anyhow any french atlantean ever born would have called him a liar to his face his horse splashed across a stream a frog as big as his fist hopped off a rock and churned away he hoped there were no crocodiles or socalled lizards in the water theyd come far enough south to make it anything but impossible especially on this side of the mountains blaise took the notion of crocodiles in stride they have bigger ones back in africa he said well theyre damned well welcome to them too victor said maybe one of these is big enough to eat up general cornwallis when he gets off the boat by new marseille blaise said how much does he know about crocodiles only what he learned the last time he was in atlantisif he learned anything at all victor answered they havent got any in england its colder there than it is by hanover no wonder people from england want to come here blaise said he came from a land with weather worse than spanish atlantis weather like that surely came from satan not from god good christians denied the devil any creative power such weather was the best argument he could think of for turning manichee its not always sticky dry half the year but always warm all what youre used to blaise said the first time i found out what winter was like i thought the world had gone mad i was afraid it would stay cold like that forever i wondered what id done to deserve such a thing but now that you know better arent you glad youre not in a bake oven all the time victor asked blaise shrugged this right here this is not so bad by the way he said it he was giving the local weather the benefit of the doubt to victor this right here was an alarmingly authentic approximation of a steam bath a wise man who lived a long time ago said custom was king of alla fancier way to say all what youre used to i suppose me id prefer something cooler even here it will get cooler in the wintertime blaise made that sound like a damned shame to victor it sounded wonderful sure enough they bowed to different kings of custom but neither one of them bowed to the king of england with a little luckand with good fortune in warthey never would again victor had heard that runaway negroes and copperskins lived in villages of their own on the far side of the green ridge mountains stories said they tried to duplicate the life theyd led before they were uprooted and brought to atlantis hed never known whether to believe those stories they sounded plausible but anyone above the age of about fourteen needed to understand the difference between plausible and true the stories turned out to be true habakkuk biddiscombes men led him to what was plainly a copperskin village the huts which looked like upsidedown pots made of bark over a framework of branches were like none hed ever seen before near them grew fields of maize everything was deserted when he rode up to look the place over some of the savages are bound to be watching us from the woods biddiscombe said gesturing toward the tall trees surrounding the village but even if they are we wont get a glimpse of them unless they want us to or unless they make a mistake victor said that does happen every now and again not often enough the cavalry officer said and victor couldnt disagree with him biddiscombe continued now that weve found this place i suppose youll want us to tear it down if the weather were even a little wetter id say burn it but too easy for the fire to run wild the way things are the weather was wet enough to suit victor and then some why would we want to wreck the village he asked in genuine surprise these copperskins have done nothing to us his surprise surprised habakkuk biddiscombe theyre runaways general biddiscombe said as if that should have been obvious to the veriest simpleton and so it was but its consequences werent at least to victor well yes he replied they seem to be happy enough here though if we rob them of their homes they may try to hunt us through the woods they arent our enemies now and id sooner try not to make them hate us unless we have some reason for doing so theyre nothing but runaways biddiscombe repeated copperskin runaways at that leave them alone leave this place alone that is an order victor said so the cavalry officer could be in no possible doubt if they harry us we shall make them regret it until they do i prefer to concentrate on the english who truly are the enemy do i make myself clear abundantly biddiscombe might have accused victor of picking his nose and then sticking his finger in his mouth carry out your orders thenand no accidental destruction for the sport of it either victor did his best to leave no loopholes in the orders by habakkuk biddiscombes expression hed just closed one the horseman had thought about using he wondered if he would have been so firm about protecting a village built by negro runaways somehow whites had an easier time looking down their noses at blacks than at copperskins blaise wouldnt have approved of that which made it no less true before long victor became pretty sure his men would be able to keep themselves fed on the road to new marseille he must have put the fear of god in the quartermasters at nouveau redon supplies did keep coming over the green ridge mountains they werent enough by themselves to victual the soldiers but they were ever so much better than nothing with oil thrushes and honkers with fish and turtles taken from the streams and with snails almost the size of roundshot and big fat frogs taken by the french atlanteans in the army the men got enough to eat marseille victor knew lay in the south of france maybe that was why the french atlanteans had named their western town after the older city the weather here certainly was southern in nature it was hot and humid the army could have marched faster in a cooler climate too much haste here and you were much too likely to tall over dead a handful of soldiers did they got hasty lonely graves like the one for the man bitten by the coral snake the rest of the army pushed west victor waited for someone to come over the mountains and tell him general cornwallis had pulled a fast one landing his army somewhere on the east coast of atlantis if the english commander had radcliff didnt know what he could do about it not right away local militias would have to try to keep the redcoats in play till he shifted his men back to the east and how obedient his army would stay after getting marched and countermarched like that was anyones guess but habakkuk biddiscombe brought a couple of french atlanteans before him i found them fleeing from the west biddiscombe said i dont talk much of their lingo but i know you do by his tone speaking french lay somewhere between affectation and perversion ignoring that victor asked the strangers why were you running through the woods because swarms of soldiers have landed in new marseille one of the men answered when soldiers come out of nowhere it is not good for ordinary people he eyed victor and the troops he led as if they proved the point very likely in his eyes they did are their warships still in the harbor victor asked they were when we left the french atlantean said his comrade nodded after a moment so did victor the royal navy wouldnt drop cornwallis on this halfsettled shore and then sail off to do something else far away it would support him and if need be take him somewhere else victor tried a different question did anyone try to fight to hold the redcoats out of new marseille both french atlanteans looked at him as if they had trouble believing their ears the one whod spoken before said suicide is a mortal sin monsieur he didnt add and you are an idiot but he might as well have his manner would have offended victor more if he hadnt had a point have you heard of the proclamation of liberty victor asked it announces that atlantis is to be free of the king of england forevermore has anyone given this news to the english soldiers in new marseille the refugee enquired in return we are on the way now to deliver the message victor said when the hammer hits the anvil the little piece of metal in the middle gets flattened the french atlantean said was he a blacksmith his scarred and callused hands made that a pretty good guess whether he was or not his figure of speech seemed apt enough victor had to pretend he didnt understand it will you guide us to new marseille and help us take your town back from the invaders the local and his friend looked anything but delighted do we have another choice he asked bleakly in a word no victor said this is a matter of military necessity for the united states of atlantis les etatsunis datlantk he thought it sounded quite fine in french if the refugees thought so too they hid it well the one who did the talking for them said how generous you are monsieur you offer us the opportunity of returning to the danger we just escaped you escaped it alone you return to new marseille with the army of the atlantean assembly at your back victor said and where is your navy to drive away the english ships the french atlantean asked victor would rather have heard almost any other question in the world one way or another well manage he said gruffly the french atlantean had no trouble understanding what that meant there is no navy of the atlantean assembly he said since he was right victor could only glare at him nevertheless we shall prove victorious in the end he declared but the end monsieur is a long way away the other man said in the meanwhile much as i regret to say it i fear i prefer the chances of the englishmen good day he wanted nothing to do with the proclamation of liberty or any other idealistic project he wanted nothing more than to be left alone but king georges forces and the atlantean rebels seemed unlikely to pay the least attention to what he wanted an eagle screeched overhead victor looked up as hed thought it wasnt the redcrested eagle that stood for the uprising but the smaller less ferocious whiteheaded bird instead of boldly attacking honkersand livestock and menwhiteheaded eagles ate fish and carrion one of their favorite ploys was to wait till an osprey caught a fish and then assail the other bird till it gave up its prize as far as victor was concerned the whiteheaded eagle made a fine symbol for england he laughed at himself he might have become a fair general but he knew himself to be the worlds most indifferent poet and he would never get better if he couldnt come up with imagery more interesting than that victor stood on a rise a couple of miles east of new marseille peering down into the town and its harbor through his brass telescope he muttered under his breath the redcoats were there in force all right they had already ringed new marseille with field fortifications theyd gone to some effort to conceal their cannon but he could still pick out the ugly iron and brass snouts and general cornwallis couldnt hide the royal navy ships that had brought him here and still supported him they filled the harbor of new marseille more anchored offshore avalon bay farther north could have held them all with ease because new marseilles harbor was so much less commodious it had neither the checkered past nor the bright future of avalon a little warbler with a green head hopped about in the tree that shaded victor the tree itself a ginkgo was curious not only for its bilobed leaves but also for its existence others like it grew only in china scholars had expended gallons of ink trying to explain why that should be so custis cawthornevictors touchstone in such matterswas of the opinion that none of them had the slightest idea but that they were unwilling to admit as much thinking about the ginkgo and about custis made him wonder how the printer was doing in france he also wondered how news of his victory over general howe and the subsequent proclamation of liberty would go over there all he could do was wonder and wait and see he didnt think he could do much more about new marseille if he hurled his army against those works the redcoats and the royal navy would tear it to shreds if he didnt sooner or later cornwallis would come after him the english could bring in supplies by sea he was proud of keeping his army fed in its overland march across atlantis if it had to stay where it was for very long though it would start running out of edibles he contemplated the prospect of retreating across atlantis after a moment he shuddered and did his best to think about something else he almost wished he hadnt crossed the green ridge mountainsbut if he hadnt he would have tamely yielded western atlantis to the enemy sometimes your choices werent between bad and good but between bad and worse blaise came up beside him what do we do now general the negro asked one more question victor didnt want to hear he parried it with one of his own what would you do in my place blaise eyed the redcoats fieldworks he didnt need the spyglass and the details it revealed to come up with a reasonable answer wait for whatever happens next he said that is a strong position mighty strong it is isnt it victor said mournfully i wish our engineers were as good as theirs why arent they blaise asked because we never needed professional soldiers till this war started victor said i suppose the united states of atlantis will from this time forwardand it will have them too but we dont have them yet worse luck that made blaise grunt thoughtfully too peaceful for our own good were we you wouldnt think such a thing could be so i fear it is victor said in mournful tones blaise grunted again well if my tribe had more warriors and better warriors i never would have crossed the sea id still be back there still talking my own language he spoke several incomprehensible syllables full of longing your life might have beenwould have been i suppose easier had you stayed in africa but i would have missed a friend victor set a hand on the negros shoulder too late to worry about it now blaise said you are a friend but this is not my land it never will be the united states of atlantis should be any free mans land victor said more stiffly than hed intended to should be yes blaise used that gesture victor had seen before from him brushing two fingers of his right hand against the dark back of his left easier to talk about should be than is mmm maybe so we do what we cannothing more to do victor said we arent perfect nor shall we ever be but we keep heading down the road and well see how far we fare he got one more grunt from blaise heading down the road on the backs of blacks and copperskins not on the backs of freemen regardless of their color victor said uncomfortably this time blaise didnt answer at all that might have been just as well the united states of atlantis might be heading down the road towards a place where a man of one color was reckoned as good as a man of another victor wasnt sure the land was heading toward that place but it might be he was sure it hadnt come close to getting there all of which brought him not a hairsbreadth nearer to deciding what to do about new marseille attacking those works looked like something only a man who craved death would try going back the way hed come yielded atlantis west of the mountains to england and god only knew what it would do to the armys morale unfortunately things being as they were he couldnt simply stay where he was for very long either he ordered his men to start digging works of their own if the redcoats came after them they had to be able to hold their ground if they could as far as he could see general cornwallis would have to be a fool to attack him but maybe cornwallis was a fool or at least would turn out to be one this time victor could hope so anyhow he realized he wasnt in the best of positions when hoping for a foes mistake was the best he could do a couple of days went by not much came from the far side of the green ridge mountains the hunters shot less than hed wished they would too before long the army would get hungry it might get very hungry he began planning an attack it wasnt one he wanted to make but when all his choices looked bad he had to pick the one that wasnt worst hed thought about that not long before and now it stared him in the face again still if he could take new marseille from the english hed redeem this campaign if he could and then to his amazement the redcoats abandoned the town they did it with their usual competence leaving fires burning in their outworks to fool his men into thinking they remained there through the night when the sun rose the last few englishmen were rowing out to the royal navy ships the warships sails filled with wind and they glided off to the south victors first thought was that smallpox or the yellow jack had broken out in cornwallis army but the english commodore could scarcely have let soldiers onto his ships in that case knowing only his own ignorance victor rode into new marseille if the locals were glad to see him their faces didnt know it they seemed more frenchand more superciliously french than most southern folk on the other side of the mountains englishmen englishspeaking atlanteans if they recognized the difference they didnt let on and they seemed proud of themselves for their frenchness dont you know why this cornwallis individual absconded one of them demanded no victor replied and i wish i did well its all because of king louis of course the local told him perhaps you would be good enough to explain that to me victor said the king of france hadnt done much lately not that he knew about but he knew less than the local did word came here that france has declared war against the rascally english the fellow said and oh yes what victor asked now eagerly and recognized your united states of atlantis the man told him chapter habbakkuk biddiscombe rode back to victor radcliff with a selfsatisfied smirk on his face radcliff eyed the cavalry officer a trifle apprehensively biddiscombe wore that smirk when things were going very welland when they were going anything but which would it be this time do i realty want to know victor wondered i have news general biddiscombe said portentously i thought you might victor said otherwisei do hope you would have stayed in your assigned position with the men you lead that failed to quash the bumptious cavalryman biddiscombe also failed to disgorge whatever hed brought back sighing victor prompted him and that news is without question general my men have reached the eastem slope of the green ridge mountains from the pride in his voice habakkuk biddiscombe had only a little less to do with that eastern slope than the almighty whod created it in the first place well i am glad to hear that victor meant it his men wore lean and hungry looks and did not wear them gladly well be much better able to subsist the soldiers once we return to civilization civilization biddiscombe flared a nostril and curled his lip nothing but frenchies and not a devil of a lot of them some english atlanteans too victor said mildly and dont be too quick to sneer at the french we stand a much better chance to make the proclamation of liberty good with france fighting england at our side england licked france the last time they quarreled biddiscombe said you ought to know about that eh sir you helped england do it england and english atlantis together beat france and french atlantis victor was stretching a point he did tell the truth for this part of the world in terranova in india on the continent england had done fine against france with no help from atlantis but france shorn of much of her former empire would be fighting a smaller war this time victor went on add frances weight to ours and the pan swings down till the frenchies jump out of it and run away they can afford to do that we cant no habakkuk biddiscombe wasnt convinced victor tried a different tack news that france was in the war made cornwallis pull out of new marseille as fast as he could go he must think it means something so must his commodore more likely theyre a couple of little old ladies biddiscombe didnt bother hiding his scorn general cornwallis isnt i assure you as you said a moment ago i ought to know about that and the royal navy isnt in the habit of giving little old ladies command of a flotilla victor wanted to shake sense into the younger man the main thing holding him back was the nearcertainty it would do no good he did say having a real navy on our side is bound to help the french have worked hard to build up their fleet since the last war theyre still french so how much good will all that work do yes biddiscombes opinions were strongand fixed victor shrugged if they make england pull ships away from atlantis that will let us get back some of our strangled commerce it may let us build warships of our own or at least get more privateers out on the sea fleabites the cavalry major scratched melodramatically we arent going to land greencoats outside of london it isnt in the cards victor held tight to his patience enough fleabites and georges ministers will decide we make england itch more than were worth thats the best hope we have as far as victor could see it was atlantis only hope he didnt say that it would be just his luck to dent biddiscombes confidence when he didnt mean to fleabites biddiscombe repeated then he made handwashing motions he would have been a natural up on stage well general now that ive given you the news i will return to my men good day sir his salute was one more piece of overacting he booted his horse off toward the east riding after him to give him a proper boot in the backside was a temptation victor had to fight hard to resist one of the messengers who habitually accompanied him said that man is nothing but trouble not without regret victor shook his head if he were nothing but trouble i could dismiss him in good conscience but hes more dangerous to the english than he is to us are you sure sir the youngster asked sure enough victor said nobody else could have done what he did last winter all right the messenger didnt seem to think it was and his men did a great deal to keep us fed while we were on this side of the mountains victor added my biggest worry was that wed get so hungry wed come to pieces that didnt happen and our cavalry are the largest reason it didnt yes general the messenger said resignedly he sounded more interested as he asked what will we do once we get back to the east first thing we must do is find out where cornwallis has landed victor replied after that after that well do whatever looks best the messenger looked dissatisfied victor would have too getting an answer like that he would have thought the person who gave it didnt trust him that wasnt true here he wouldnt have kept the young man in his service without thinking him reliable but he had nothing better to say maybe alexander the great or julius caesar knew what he would do months before he finally did it maybe but victor had trouble believing it he would have bet general cornwallis felt the same way in that at least the two of them were well matched after a spell marching through the wilderness even scattered farms and occasional villages seemed downright urban to victor unfamiliar faces some of them belonging to women taverns shops for a little while till he got used to them again they almost overwhelmed him he sent a rider to the atlantean assembly announcing that new marseille was in atlantean hands once more he also sent messengers to the coast to pass on that same news and to see what he could learn of cornwallis movements even on this side of the green ridge mountains keeping his army fed was harder than he would have liked the locals whether of french blood or english resented having to part with their grain and livestock one of them bluntly asked what have you done for me that i should cough up my hardwon substance for your ragamuffins here we hope to free you from the king of england and his greedy lawless officials victor said is that such a small thing king george never bothered me his own self and i never saw any of his officials way the devil out here thats why i dwell in these parts the man replied but you now general youre the one hauling off my wheat and my cattle why shouldnt i get my firelock and go after you you may do that if you like victor said politely if you do and if we catch you i shall regret giving the order for your hanging which doesnt mean you wont do it the farmers voice was bleak that is correct sir it doesnt mean i wont do it victor agreed were you in my place you would act the same way i assure you it could be so the farmer said but if you were in ray place well youd think about getting out your firelock and doing something about it out of slightly more than idle curiosity victor asked have you radcliff blood on my mothers side the man answered but theres a devil of a lot of atlanteans who can claim it one way or another even a lot of the frenchies if you listen to them if the whole mob took up arms against you youd lose he was bound to be right about that but they wouldnt victor had quite a few cousins he knew about in the army and doubtless many more of whom he knew nothing he said most of them would sooner fight for atlantis than against her thats a fancy way to say you arent robbing most of them right this minute the farmer certainly had his share of radcliff directnessand then some i am not robbing you sir victor said stiffly you are being repaid with paper the atlantean assembly will make good come victory preachers talk about heaven but they dont cobble the road for you the farmer said i expect its the same way with your precious paper and it looks like itd be scratchy if i used it on my backside i am doing the best i can to compensate you had i gold or silver enough i assure you i would spend them victor said the rustic eyed him i may even believe you odd as it seems but you havent got em which is the point of it eh victor wondered whether he ought to post a guard to keep an eye on this farm after he rode away from it if the farmer came after him with a musketor more likely with a rifleodds were he stood a good chance of hitting what he aimed at in the end victor didnt no one tried to assassinate him so he supposed hed judged the locals temper correctly hed also judged that not trusting the fellow would more probably set him off than acknowledging that he had reason to complain but there was nothing to be done about it a rider came back reporting that wherever general cornwallis was he wasnt at cosquer somewhere in the north then victor radcliff murmured unless hes gone to gernika that is to spanish atlantis i wouldnt think so blaise said but he might have had the fleet turn around and head for avalon once it got out of sight victor shook his head i would believe that at some different time in the war but not now i dont follow you blaise said all the reasons he left new marseille are reasons he wouldnt go to avalon victor said he needs to put his ships between the french fleet and our east coast france could break into croydon or new hastings or maybe even hanover without the royal navy to hold her at bay cornwallis redcoats are less important right this minute but he has to have those ships in place he waited while blaise thought it over after a moment the negro nodded now that you point it out to me i see it he said i dont think i would have on my own in my head i can picture how war works on land but out on the ocean he broke off grimacing all i know about the ocean is i dont want to go out on it any more its rather different when now victor was the one who stopped in sudden embarrassment blaise grinned crookedly when you are not chained belowdecks with niggers packed in tight as so many hams he suggested thats not exactly what i was going to say victor heard the stiffness in his own voice why not its the truth blaise looked down at his wrists i used to have scars from the chains but they are gone now i wonder when they went away he shrugged ah well what difference does it make the scars on my heart the ones on my spirit those never heal up you have not got a bad life here victor still sounded stiff even to himself no i have not i have a good wifeherself brought hither against her will but good even soand i have a good friend blaise said but it is not the life i would have chosen for myself and that makes a difference too imagining himself making the best of things in a jungle full of lions and elephants and black men speaking peculiar languages victor could only nod hanover general cornwallis was at hanover in cornwallis place victor supposed he would have gone to hanover too it was the biggest city in atlantis and the best port on the east coast though less centrally placed than new hastings or freetown it did let the redcoats strike to north or south he set his own men moving north and east back toward the settlements of english atlantis from which most of them had sprung they grumbled as hed known they would they would have grumbled more had he pushed them harder he would have too were he more confident of supplies he was still close to the green ridge mountains and settlements still sparse some of his men were willing enough to march toward the settlements from which theyd sprung they werent exactly the ones victor would have had in mind though they were soldiers whose terms had expired when they came back to the farms and towns in which theyd grown up they werent going to fight theyd just head for home sorry general one of them said and he even sounded as if he meant it i signed up for a year and thats all i aim to give he produced a dirty muchcreasedandfolded sheet of paper that showed he had indeed met his promised commitment it only irked victor more god damn it to hell he ground out i begged the atlantean assembly that henceforward all terms of enlistment were to be for the wars duration dont reckon they listened to you yes the soldier did sound sympathetic which was the last thing victor radcliff needed with a whimsical shrug the insufficiently embattled farmer added and what else is new not a thing victor said heavily not a stinking thing well thats one letter i shall have to write over again he did too when the army stopped for the night when he sanded the sheet to blot up excess ink he was amazed smoke didnt rise from the paper hed put heart and soul into the missiveand spleen as well he glanced down at his midsection yes if his spleen wasnt well vented by now it never would be he stepped out of his tent and shouted for a messenger the youngster who came up to him looked alarmedhe was usually a quieter man right this minute victor cared nothing for what he usually was he thrust the letter at the youth get this to the conscript fathers in honkers mill quick as you can ill do it general the young man said but how come youre so allfired angried up all of a sudden because as near i can tell the assembly and the settlements parliaments are doing their level best to lose us the war victor answered you wouldnt think the gentlemen there assembled could be such dunderheads would you especially not after france has come into the war on our side i mean but they are by god a thundermugs got more sense in it than half the heads at honkers mill that won him a chuckle from the messenger who asked what have they gone and done now sir they keep recruiting shortterm soldiers thats what why would i want men who can go home just when im likely to need them the most answer me that if you please beats me the messenger sounded much too cheerful but then why shouldnt he recruiting soldiers and retaining them wasnt his worry it was victor radcliffs and it was supposed to be the atlantean assemblys expecting the assembly and the parliaments with which it had to dicker to remember as much was evidently too much to hope for the messenger rode away victor stood outside the tent listening till the horses hoofbeats got too distant to make out and then a little longer besides when he finally went back inside and lay down on his cot he wondered whether hed sleep he tossed and turned for some time just when he was sure the atlantean assemblys idiocy would cost him a nights rest he dozed off next thing he knew the armys buglers were blowing morning assembly instead of tea or coffee he drank a brew of roasted native roots and leaves he made a point of eating and drinking no better than the men he led even wellsugaredthat the atlanteans could dothe brew tasted nasty worse it was less invigorating than the ones that had to be imported but it was what the cooks had left so radcliff drank it enjoy your coffee general said the man in the dirty apron who filled his tin mug it was no more coffee than victor was czar of all the russias and enjoying it stretched the bounds of probability if it didnt break them a man could learn to tolerate it and victor had none of that showed on his face or in his voice much obliged innes i expect i shall he said and smiled when he said it sometimes you had to deceive your own men as well as the enemy more soldiers whose terms had expired marched away from the atlantean army to victors wellconcealed surprise fresh companies joined him some of them had enlisted for six months or a year he gave their men a choice they could fight the english till the war ended or they could go home at once do whichever suits you he told them i am better off without you than i would be to have you for a short term if i must plan my campaigns around your enlistments i would do better to pray general cornwallis mercy now he exaggerated most of the time shortterm soldiers were better than no soldiers at all to his relief most of the new recruits agreed to serve for the duration ha blaise said only shows the dumb strawfeet dont know what the devil theyre getting into i shouldnt be amazed if you were right victor agreed then he chuckled strawfeet is it oh they are general you can tell by looking at them blaise said atlantean drillmasters often despaired of teaching country bumpkins the evolutions they needed to learn if they were to move from column to line of battle or do any of the other things soldiers had to do baron von steuben frequently ran out of english when he tried to show them what they needed to do they couldnt understand his german but it sounded as if it ought to be worth remembering among the worst complaints the drillmasters had was that raw recruits couldnt reliably tell their right feet from their left they did know the difference between hay and straw though drill sergeants tied a wisp of hay to their left feet and straw to their right hayfoot a drillmaster would call strawfoot hayfoot strawfoot it was an awkward makeshift but it worked and more and more often atlantean veterans called new men strawfeet von steuben called them everything he could in english and worse than that auf deutsck naturally the new men were inclined to resent the name just as naturally the veterans didnt care there had already been several scraps about it victor expected more to come as long as veterans and recruits didnt squabble with the redcoats in front of them he wouldnt worry a courier rode up i have a letter for you general from the atlantean assembly he said importantly oh you do do you victor growled he took the letter broke the seal and unfolded the paper it was to his utter lack of surprise a missive censuring him for what the assembly characterized as his illbred illtempered intemperate and altogether illadvised communication of the twentyseventh ultimo had they recalled him from his command he would have gone home without a backwards glance if they didnt care for the way he was carrying on the fight they could go ahead without him but they didnt do that several of his officers were convinced they could command atlantis forces better than he the atlantean assembly and he might snap at each other but the assembly wasnt minded to give any of those ambitious officers a chance to show what they could do a small force of foot soldiers skirmished with the atlantean army after it crossed the stour victors men took a few prisoners as the enemy fell back they brought them to the commanding general shall we hang these traitor bastards from a branch sir one of the guards growled the prisoners looked frightened except for wearing brown coats rather than green they also looked just like their captors you cant do that we fought fair one of them said his accent was the same as that of the man who wanted to hang him and well it might have been they were both atlanteans probably from the same settlement victor radcliff glowered at him so youll spill your blood for a king who wont lift a finger for you he said he is my king england is my country the prisoner set his chin hes your king too by god and englands your country atlantis is my country i have no king victor said his men cheered some of their captives looked defiant others alarmed victor turned to his troops did they fight like soldiers we are soldiers another prisoner said third company of king georges atlantean rangers thats me shame one of victors men said several others hissed they might have started hanging the atlantean rangers then but victor held up a hand no we shant do that he said not if they didnt play the savage against us its easier to start hanging people than to stop theyve got it coming one of his men said hotly goddamned traitors traitor yourself a captive yelled and almost won himself a hempen cravat in spite of everything victor could do he had to draw his fancy sword which he supposed balanced out the letter of censure to keep his atlanteans from lynching the bold prisoner no he shouted what will they do if they take some of our men next time do you want a war like that some of his men nodded which scared him but more looked worried a war like that could keep on poisoning atlantis long after it ended how many feuds how many barn burnings and stock killings and murders from ambush for revenge would spring from it too many victor might have had to point that out but his soldiers could see it once he did the men from king georges atlantean rangers remained prisoners of war after the excitement was over blaise said none of those scuts even thanked you not a single one i didnt expect it of them victor answered why not the negro exclaimed if not for you theyd be dead he laid his head on his shoulder and stuck out his tongue as if hanged if that isnt worth some thanks what is patiently victor said if they thanked me they would have to own to themselves that im not such a bad fellow then they might have to own that my cause isnt so bad and then they might have to wonder about the one they chose how many people care to do that here not many is it different in africa everything here has more gears turning round everything blaise did not sound as if he were complimenting atlantis victor shrugged it is what we have changing from belonging to the king to belonging to ourselves is hard enoughthe rangers show as much but if you want to change human nature at the same time he shook his head good luck to you thats all i dont believe it can be done and you expect men to live without a chief or a king or whatever you call him blaise shook his head too laughing at the silly notion he was no political philosopher but he had a keen feel for what was real no victor said only without a leader who can do as he pleases no matter what the laws say only blaise threw his own words in his face good luck to you thats all habakkuk biddiscombe thought each of his schemes was finer than the one that had gone before it we can spirit cornwallis out of hanover and strike off the enemys head he told victor did he mean that as a figure of speech or literally however he meant it victor shook his head i dont think thats a good notion why not biddiscombe swelled and turned purple victor wondered if hed explode no man was ever so enamored of his own schemes as the cavalry officer but victor ticked off points on his fingers itemchances of success strike me as slim itemany men captured whilst making such an attempt would assuredly wear a noose soon thereafter and itemeven if your plan should be accomplished in every particular so what habakkuk biddiscombe gaped what dyou mean uh general i told you what would happen then indeed you did but i say again so what someone might well capture me if that unpleasantness came to pass this army would continue the struggle under our secondincommand we might do as well with him as we have with me for all i know we might do better though i dare hope not why do you suppose the redcoats to be in a different situation well biddiscombe faltered isnt the best man commonly placed in command again in our case i dare hope so yes that may be true but it is also possible that the general commanding is but the most senior officer present general cornwallis is not elderly and is clever but i doubt he will ever be spoken of in the same breath with gustavus adolphus or turenne another man thrust suddenly into his place might well match his accomplishments only reason you dont want to try it is on account of im the one who came up with it anger clotted biddiscombes voice if you or your nigger thought it up youd be all for it he turned on his heel and stormed away blaise appeared as if by magic did i hear somebody call me nigger he could hear that word where he might miss others well who could blame him what man with the faintest hope of being a gentleman wasnt sensitive to slights he did you did victor said wearily he meant nothing by it though he was in a temper at me not at you huh blaise said a wordless sound packed with disbelief anybody says nigger he means something by it all right he spoke like a man very sure of what he was talking about chances were he had every right to be even so victor said i showed him how and why his harebrained scheme was harebrained and he responded with all the gratitude you might expect what scheme is this blaise asked victor explained the negro grunted well you told him true that scheme is harebrained from mouth to arsehole victor would have said from top to bottom which didnt mean he disagreed with the more pungent phrase sometimes habakkuk simply needs to get things out of his system he said blaise grunted again if hes costive let him take one of those little pills thatll shift him he rolled his eyes those little pillsll shift anything no doubt victor knew the ones blaise was talking about they were made from antimony if you had trouble moving your bowels you would swallow one a few hours later you would think a barrel of black powder had gone off in your gut they werent cheap but they did the trick all right you could if you were so inclined rescue the little devil from the chamber pot wash it off and save it for the next time you needed it ought to knock him over the head blaise returned to the subject at hand that will get things out of his system too and it will save you trouble you see if it dontdoesnt he corrected himself before victor could hell be all right victor said blaise rolled his eyes once more he was as stubborn as habakkuk biddiscombe if in a different way he would have been highly offended had victor said so so victor didnt he did remember the conversation for a long time afterwards every so often a loyalist would take a potshot at victors soldiers from behind a roadside tree then try to get away rebellious atlanteans who fired at redcoats marching past were heroes at least to other rebellious atlanteans when victors men captured the loyalist snipers they hanged them without ceremony cornwallis soldiers did the same thing to the insurrectionist marksmen they caught every printer who favored the atlantean assembly damned them to satans fiery furnace as murderers on account of it victor radcliff noticed the irony which didnt mean he intended to stop hanging loyalist francstireurs one of them put on a brave show saying i am proud to die for my king you wont be once the rope goes around your neck victor predicted and you arent dying for your king you could have been as loyal to george as you pleased so long as you didnt fire at my men from ambush i should prove myself a traitor to my sovereign did i not take up arms against those treacherously in arms against him yes the loyalist had pride it did him no good you and your friends should have joined a properly enrolled company then victor said coldly the man was hanged with the three or four other bushwhackers victors soldiers had flushed out of the woods they died hard strangling from the nooses instead of getting their necks broken as a proper hangmans knot might have done or it might not have when they were hanged from branches instead of getting a long drop from the gallows blaise eyed the limp bodies and discolored faces with cold dispassion all he said was they had it coming i think so too victor said but if you listen to the likes of them were the ones who deserve to dance on air dance on air the negro tasted the words i like that its not mine i fear victor told him i dont know where i first heard it use it as you please people will understand you when you do all right blaise glanced toward the corpses again they dont dance theyd had their feet tied together and hands bound behind them ive seen livelier jobs with the legs free victor said gnawing on the inside of his lower lip at the memory only a cruel man could enjoy the spectacle believe me they are enemies blaise said why should i be sorry to watch enemies die i have nothing against enemies dying victor replied but rejoicing in suffering even in an enemys suffering strikes me as unchristian maybe i dont make such a good christian then blaise said he and his wife had gone to church with victor and margaret most sundays since the fighting in french atlantis ended he attended divine services with the other soldiers in victors army radcliff suddenly wondered how much he really believed how much of his piety was no more than fitting in where he had to live and how much of his savage creed from africa still lurked below no matter what he wondered he didnt ask papists and protestants of all sects and even jews joined together in the atlantean assembly and in its army if there was room for all of them wasnt there also room for one perhaps unregenerate african despite the snipersmost of whom being as woodswise as victors men escaped instead of getting capturedthe army pressed on toward hanover more loyalists not daring or caring to meet it in arms fled before it with nothing but what they could carry men who preferred the atlantean assemblys cause gleefully swooped down on the homes and fields and livestock they abandoned buggers made us sweat while they was in the saddle one man told victor now lets see if they ever set eyes on what used to be theirs again strict justice might have made victor speak of courts and due process of law well use them as they deserve he said and the local nodded a few days later the army was camped near a village called brandenburg a cavalryman rode up to victor after a sketched salute the man asked general have you seen major biddiscombe i needed to ask something of him but hes nowhere about i havent got him victor answered he thought no more about it till the army was getting ready to move out the next morning there was still no sign of habakkuk biddiscombe a man whod been on sentry duty said he rode out past me not long after we stopped here he said he was going to reconnoiter what lay ahead by himself victors eyebrows leaped toward his hairline the sentry only shrugged you know how he is victor radcliff did much too well even for major biddiscombe thats excessive he said when he comes in ill give him a talkingto hell remember for a month of wednesdays the sentry laughed but victor wasnt joking only habakkuk biddiscombe didnt come in victor feared hed fallen into the hands of english scouts or local loyalists the only trouble was his own scouts turned up no signs that the enemy was operating anywhere close by another fear began to grow in himand not in him alone how bad was that last quarrel you had with him sir blaise asked well it wasnt good no one would accuse victor of exaggerating anyhow uhhuh blaise said thoughtfully then he asked how much harm could he do us if he went over to cornwallis he wouldnt do that victor squawked and he could hear himself protesting too much after a moment he added i hope he wouldnt do that which was nothing but the truth chapter habakkuk biddiscombe not only went over to general cornwallis and king george he reveled in his treason to him of course it seemed anything but what man ever acted for any save the highest motives none not if you asked the actor himself a scout brought back a broadsheet from a village still under the redcoats control it was called the true relation of colonel habakkuk biddiscombe formerly of the rebel cavalry huh blaise said when he saw that he won himself a promotion for running off he did thirty pieces of silver victor said bitterly i wonder if he would have stayed had i granted him higher rank he sighed well never know now biddiscombeor more likely some proenglish hack purporting to be biddiscombecharacterized the atlantean assembly as a witches sabbat of betrayal he called the army that fought on behalf of the assembly a pack of starveling hounds remarkable alike for savagery and cowardice and he described victor radcliff as the blackest traitor since judas a man likely to be mentioned when anyone turned his coat and an oaf masquerading as a general a leader utterly incapable of recognizing and acknowledging a clever stratagem remembering the cavalryofficers scheme hed turned down victor suspected that at least came straight from biddiscombe what do you aim to do about thisthis arsewipe general the scout inquired victor felt of the paper i think id sooner use a handful of leaves he said the scout and blaise both laughed victor went on what can i do about it if the famous colonel biddiscombe should dare lead enemy horse against us we shall try to shoot him out of the saddle of that i have no doubthe betrayed the soldiers he formerly commanded more foully than any others here for he enjoyed more of their trust other than killing him first chance we find i know not what course to take me id sooner catch him alive blaise said then i could roast him over a slow fire and turn him on a spit so he got done on all sides he grinned evilly easy enough to tell with a white man eh and that would give the dirty scut plenty of time to think on his mistakes before he gave up the ghost devil take me if i dont fancy the sound of that myself the scout exclaimed so long as we kill him that will suffice victor said blaise was born a savage of course but men who favored the atlantean assembly and those who remained loyal to king george were roasting each other over slow fires oh not where the main armies marched and countermarched but in the countless little ambushes and affrays that would never make the history books or change the wars result by one iota but went on nonetheless and those men on both sides gleefully played the savage without blaises excuse well go on victor said as he had so many times if we can winkle them out of hanover that will be a great triumph for us and a great disaster to them and if habakkuk biddiscombe has to sail off to englandon which he has never in his life set eyeseven that will be enough devil it will blaise muttered but not loud enough for victor to call him on it victor was anything but sure they could squeeze cornwallis out of hanover even if they didnt they might reach the sea and cut the english coastal holdings in half that would be worth doing in and of itself go on they did loyalists skirmished with them like king georges atlantean rangers these men fought as soldiers not in ambuscades sometimes redcoats stiffened their ranks sometimes they managed well enough on their own victor ordered his own men to treat them as prisoners of war when they were taken if they meet us fairly we must return the favor he insisted and his troops obeyed him more often than not even so an unfortunate number of such captives were shot trying to escape he wondered whether he should issue harsher orders in the end he decided not to issuing orders that werent likely to be obeyed only damaged the force of other commands before long a scout carried another broadsheet back into his encampment this one announced the creation of something called biddiscombes horsed legion volunteers in the legion would root out eradicate extirpate and utterly exterminate the verminous rebels opposing in arms his brilliant majesty good king george most printers worked in the coastal towns the english held victor found one back in brandenburg who was loyal to the atlantean assembly he had the man crank out a counterblast one warning men who leaned toward king george that no individual from the cavalry formation styled biddiscombes horsed legion who may be captured by the armies of the atlantean assembly shall under any circumstances hope for quarter no horsed legion appeared victor wondered whether cornwallis had had second thoughtsand if he had whether habakkuk biddiscombe was contemplating desertion from the english cause probably not victor decidedthe cavalry officer had to know atlantis would never take him back biddiscombe had made his bed now he had to lie in it even if it proved uncomfortable victor also wondered when the french declaration of war would produce soldiers on the ground in atlantis indeed he wondered if it ever would in the last war the french managed to convey one small army across the atlantic all their later efforts failing their navy was stronger now was it enough stronger it had better be he thought his own men made vastly better soldiers than they had when they first enlisted all the same he could use some cynical hardbitten professionals to show them by example how the job was done meanwhile he used what he had redcoats and loyalists skirmished with his forces before falling back toward hanover cornwallis seemed less interested in fighting big battles than general howe had been before him maybe he was clever howe had tried to crush the atlantean uprising the only thing hed proved was that he couldnt cornwallis by contrast seemed to want to force the atlanteans to crush him as long as he held the towns on the eastern coast the united states of atlantis were only wind and air they werent a nation any more than a man deprived of his head was a man and then to victors surprise he got word that some of cornwallis garrison in hanover was putting to sea and sailing away when he heard the rumor the first time he had trouble believing it but it came to him again the next day brought by a man who didnt know anyone else had carried word ahead of him why would he do that when were pressing him toward hanover victor asked i know the englishmen make good soldiers and i know hanover has good outworks all the same if too many forts are empty of men the place will fall well his second informant was a plump merchant named gustavus vasa rand who plainly enjoyed knowing things the commanding general didnt the man steepled his fingers then tugged at his ear before going on i hear tell the redcoats have themselves trouble somewheres else where radcliff exploded if it was anywhere in atlantis he thought he would have known about it if the english had trouble anywhere in atlantis he hoped he would have helped foment it but gustavus vasa rand replied over in terranova is what folks say some of the settlements there theyve decided they dont fancy king george any moren we do have they victor breathed well well well has anyone reported why they chose this moment to rise up dont you know yes gustavus vasa rand exuded the amiable scorn the man whos heard things feels for the poor ignorant twit he aims to enlighten why this past year or so a demon pamphleteers appeared amongst em hes tossed so much red pepper into the stew even the boring old terranovans cant help breathing fire after they go and eat of it i dare say hes caused king georges men in those parts a good deal of ah pain victor remarked with malice aforethought why so he has one of rands bristly eyebrows rose funny you should put it so general for paines his family name and thomas his christian name victor agreed i am acquainted with the gentleman and with his qualities indeed i sent him west across the hesperian gulf hoping he would do exactly as he has done well good on you then the merchant told him the more toes england has on the griddle the more hopping she needs must do now the look he sent victor was more speculative than pitying a general who could work out a plot and have it come off the way he wanted wasnt some harmless bumpkin but a man who might need some serious watching i am grateful for the news believe me victor said it will surely influence the way i conduct my campaign from this time forward ah influence it how pray gustavus vasa rand leaned forward eager to be even more in the know than he was already but victor radcliff only laid a finger by the side of his nose by your leave sir ill say no more what you have not heard no redhot pokers or thumbscrews may tear from you should the redcoats decide they must learn all the secrets you carry under your hat they wouldnt do that rands voice lacked conviction victor refrained from mentioning one other possibility that the trader from hanover might tell the english what he knew under no compulsion whatsoever some men tried to work both sides at once or pretended to serve one while actually on the other he had spies in hanover he had to assume cornwallis played the same game whilst the hesperians make england divide her forces you may be sure i shall do my best to keep the occupiers ah occupied here in atlantis victor said and sir you may publish that abroad as widely as you please ill do it general you can count on me rand said victor radcliff smiled and nodded maybe the man from hanover would then again maybe he wouldnt if he didnt the world wouldnt end nor would the atlantean uprising and if he did victor hadnt said a word about strategy of course cornwallis would expect him to try to take advantage of what england had to do to try to put down the new rebellion far to the west cornwallis would be right too but how victor would try to exploit the new situation cornwallis wont know victor thought he cant possibly for i havent the faintest idea myself he didnt believe that was what the military manuals meant when they talked about the advantage of surprise but it was what he had now he needed to figure out how to make the most of it several rivers met at or near hanover which helped make it atlantis most important harbor some of the people who argued about such things argued that avalon had a better site they might well have been right but hanover raced towards europe avalon toward terranova when it came to ships and cargoes heading in and out that made all the difference in the world these days cargoes heading in and out of hanover did so for englands benefit not atlantis oh dribs and drabs of what came into hanover got smuggled out to the lands that owed the atlantean assembly allegiance but only dribs and drabs as general howe had before him general cornwallis hoped that keeping his opponents poor would detach them from the united states of atlantis and make them take another look at king george what worried victor radcliff was that cornwallis might be right a patriot without a hapenny in his pocket was only one long stepsometimes not such a long stepfrom discovering he was really a loyalist after all the most important river that flowed into hanover the severn ran down from the north victor led his own army along the north bank of a smaller stream the blackwater that approached from the west why did they name it the blackwater blaise asked whats in there looks like any other water to me to me toonow victor answered but when we get a little closer to hanover well youll see before they came that close to hanover they had to deal with a hastily runup english stockade that blocked their approach to the city one of the popguns inside the stockade boomed defiance at the atlantean army the roundshot it fired fell far short of victors men after the ball stopped rolling one of his gunners picked it up if it fit an atlantean gunand it probably wouldit would fly back toward some redcoats one of these days instead of assaulting the little fortress right away victor marched his troops past it before halting maybe the soldiers inside hadnt sent anyone east toward hanover to warn cornwallis of his advent but if they had the redcoats in the seaside city might sally forth to see if they could smash the atlantean army between themselves and the garrison they may think they can get away with that but i dont aim to let them victor told his assembled officersand inevitably blaise whom everyone took for granted by now how will you stop em general one of his captains asked ill tell you how in the name of the lord god jehovah victor said we shall attack the stockade at midnight tonightthats how once it has fallen all their hopes of playing hammer and anvil against us fall with it the officers buzzed like bees can we do it one of them asked he might not have meant for victor radcliff to hear him but victor did we can sir and we shall he declared the idea may surprise you but i intend that it shall flabbergast the poor foolish englishmen mured up behind those pine and redwood logs flabbergast em i say to that end the atlanteans encamped as they would have done at the end of any ordinary days march they pitched tents they built up cook fires they ambled back and forth in front of and around those fires victor had learned his lessons watching the redcoats abandon positions they could hold no longer if the enemy commander inside the stockade was watching the encampment through a spyglass he would notice nothing peculiar he wouldnt be able to see for instance that the men silhouetted in front of the fires were always the same men a group left behind to make the camp appear normal from a distance even when it wasnt meanwhile the rest of the atlanteans took care to stay out of the firelight victor radcliff led them against the english works the night was moonless and cloudy and dark move as quietly as you can he calledquietly if you fall pick yourself up with no loud profane swearing indeed for such vileness offends against god said a voice out of the blackness well so it does victor agreed but its also liable to mark our advance against the foe unless you have such a clean conscience that you can meet your maker sooner than you might have had in mind keep your lips buttoned the atlanteans did for the most part no cries of alarm rang out from the stockade ahead the redcoats inside the log palisade kept big bonfires blazing the redgold light shone through chinks between one log and another and also lit up the buildings inside the stockade barracks that could double as a redoubt in time of need motte and bailey victor thought the normans used that scheme in england and its still a good one would it be good enough to hold up against complete surprise he had to hope not he also had to hope he could bring off a complete surprise that at the moment remained what barristers called a scotch verdict not proven those bonfires made advancing against the enemy position easier than it would have been otherwise on a night this dark victor might have had trouble finding an unilluminated fortand tramping past it would have been embarrassing to say the least no risk of that not now with so much light behind them with their eyes not accustomed to gloom the redcoat sentries up on the walls might also have a harder time spotting the atlanteans moving up on them again victor dared hope so no one raised the alarm as his men drew near scaling ladders forward he hissed urgently forward they came he pointed toward the fortress do you see where to place them we do that general replied a soldier whod surely been born in ireland then advance against the palisadeslowly till youre discovered and after that quick as you can off went the ladders one by one storming partieshe hoped they werent forlorn hopesfollowed them if everything went well the fort would fall to the atlanteans almost before the enemy inside realized it was under attack but how often did everything go well not often enough as victor had seen too often tonight though the scaling ladders were about to thud into place against the palisade before a redcoat up there let out a startled yelp bloody ell its the bleedin atlanteans a moment later a rifle barked the sentry yelped again this time in pain he had been a dark blotch against the lighter background of the barracks hall now that blotch disappeared atlantis victors men cried as they swarmed up the ladders and the proclamation of liberty and down with king george down with king george it was at least in that one spot so many men in green jackets got up onto the palisade and dropped down into the courtyard behind it the defenders never had a chance only a few shots were fired before the gates swung open someone sang out in an atlantean accent all yours general well done victor said as he walked into the little fortress very well done indeed boys the english captain whod commanded the garrison didnt think so a night attack not sporting he said sourly if you show me where hoyles rules state im not allowed to make one perhaps ill march away victor said or perhaps i wont his men jeered the captain glared and then tried a different tack another thingone of your blighters lifted my pocket watch can you tell me which one victor asked no dammit the english officer shook his head he was tall he was skinny he had an evil leer and foul breath well sir as a matter of fact so do you victor said which won him another glare taking no notice of it he continued you do realize youre describing more than half of my army he wasnt exaggerating most atlanteans seemed tall to their shorter english cousins i shouldnt wonder if more than half your army consists of thieves the captain didnt lack for nerve but victor only laughed and you think yours doesnt by god sir ive served with redcoats before i know better we may be thieves but we arent foul rebels the captain said not yet perhaps you would be surprised though at how many in the atlantean army took the kings shilling first victor responded he couldnt down the english officer who said and what of habakkuk biddiscombe will you tell me he is the only atlantean who at last came to see where his true loyalty should lie all ill tell you of biddiscombe is that sooner or laterlikely soonerhell quarrel with his english superiors as he quarreled with me victor said tightly and i wish them joy of him when he does that actually made the captain thoughtful mm ive met the man and i must say i shouldnt be astonished if you prove right but having antagonized both sides in this struggle where can he go next he can go to the devil for all of me victor said ill tell you where im going next though im going to hanover more often than not the wind blew down from the green ridge mountains toward the sea when it did it carried the spicy resinous scents of atlantis vast evergreen forests with it victor took that odor for granted he noticed it only when it changed as his army neared hanover it did the breeze swung around to come off the atlantic for a while the oceans salt tang seemed to quicken victors pulse was that because all radcliffs and radcliffes sprang from fishermen and so naturally responded to the smell of the sea or did victors excitement grow because the oceanic odor reminded him how near his goal he was some of each he guessed a mans reasons were rarely all of one piece blaise pointed to the river beside which the army marched it did turn black general like you said why because it flows through peat beds under the meadows victor answered you know peat you can burn it blaise said like god was trying to make coal but didnt know how yet victor laughed in surprise he wouldnt have come out with anything so blasphemous but he probably wouldnt have come out with anything so apt either before long the breeze from the east brought more than the odor of the atlantic to his nostrils it carried the smell of smoke with itand also less attractively the reek of sewage that combination always proclaimed a large settlement not far away cities stink blaise complained well so they do victor said do your african villages smell any sweeter blaise clicked his tongue between his teeth erno i didnt think so victor said when i use the privy its not angels that come out no reason your folk should differ there the colored sergeant changed the subject from which victor concluded that hed made his point how do you propose to take hanover away from cornwallis i cant answer that yet i shall have to see just where the english have placed their lines and their forts and how many men they can put into them now that theyre dealing with trouble in terranova too victor said ah blaise said you do make fighting more complicated than it needs to be more complicated than you were used to in africa victor translated but anyoneblack white or he supposed copperskinnedtook what hed grown up with as the touchstone for what was right and proper the rest of his days before long victor had a pretty good notion of the lie of the english works outside hanover and of how many redcoats cornwallis had in them the enemy commander did his best to keep the locals inside his lines cornwallis didnt want them bringing victor such news cornwallis best wasnt good enough his lines leaked the english captain at the fort had been right there were plenty of loyalists and royalists in land held by the forces following the atlantean assembly sometimes they did go over to king georges army as habakkuk biddiscombe had done but that coin had two sides hanover was a fairsized city by anybodys standardsnot london not paris but a fairsized city of course it had its share of people who cheered behind closed doors when the united states of atlantis were proclaimed and of course some of those men seeing liberation as one of victor radcliffs outriders would leave the city to tell him what they knew of its defenses and the soldiers who manned them he made a point of separating his informants one from another he interviewed them one at a time and made a sketch map of what each described if one of them told a tale different from the others he wouldnt put it past cornwallis to try to lead him into a trap he knew he would have done the same thing to the english general had he found the chance adding all the sketch maps together by the time he called a council of war he had a pretty good notion of what wanted doing we will feint here he told his assembled officersand blaisepointing with the fancyhilted sword the atlantean assembly had presented to him a good portion of our field artillery will accompany the feint to make it seem the more persuasive having drawn cornwallis notice thither we strike here he pointed again farther south this time blaise held up his right index finger victor nodded to him what do we do if cornwallis hears of this plan the negro asked he did come up with cogent questions well that depends victor said if i find out ahead of time that hes heard of it the real thrust becomes the feint and the feint the real thrust what if you dont find out general a colonel inquired victor spread his hands in that case we walk into a snare he waited for the startled laughter to die down then added i shall endeavor to extricate the army from it with losses as small as possible at the beginning of this fight the mere thought of losing a battle would have filled his officers with a curious blend of rage and panic now they took the possibility in stride they would do everything they could to win if that turned out not to be enough they would pull back and try something else later what did the bard say about such coarsening victor tried to remember his hamlet and he didthe line was custom hath made it in him a property of easiness shakespeare was talking about gravedigging but he might as well have meant war the proximate cause of so much gravedigging the atlantean officers had that properly of easiness now they were veterans the redcoats had worked the transformation and now victor hopedthey would pay for it general cornwallis warded hanover with a ring of forts these werent timber palisades like the one that had tried to bar the way down the blackwater their outwalls were of thick earth a roundshot wouldnt demolish them as it would smacking into wood or stone instead it would sink deep and disappear without doing any harm trenches and covered ways let english soldiers move from one fort to another without exposing themselves to atlantean riflemen and cannoneers the enemy was as ready as anyone could reasonably be so was victor radcliff he thought he was anyhow in europe mortarsguns firing explosive shells at steep angles so they topped the walls of a fort and came down insidehad given attackers at least a fighting chance when assaulting works the atlanteans had a few iron and brass mortars smuggled in despite the english blockade they had a few more their smiths had made imitating the european models and they had quite a few improvised from hollowedout tree trunks bound with iron bands because a mortars barrel was so short it didnt have to withstand anything like the pressure an ordinary cannon did the wooden mortars seemed to perform about as well as their stubby metal counterparts no one came out to warn victor the english had learned of his plans he suddenly wished he would have established a homingpigeon connection with hanover more than a century before back in the days when avalon was the wickedest city in the world one of the piratical radcliffes had done something like that victor consoled himself by remembering that the piratenot a close kinsman of hishad gone down to defeat despite his pigeons all the same finding a scrap of paper victor scribbled croydon and pigeons on it would he find that scrap again would he remember what the cryptic note meant if he did find it even if he did come across it and did recall would it matter he couldnt know now all he could do was give later the best chance he could off went the detachment that would make the noisy demonstration against the northern part of cornwallis fieldworks most of the ordinary guns went with it it was also brave with banners to fool the redcoats into thinking it held all the units whose standards waved above it before long the thunder of cannon fire and the fierce clatter of musketrya sound much like rocks falling on sheets of iron told him the demonstration was well under way some of those volleys from the muskets could only have come from perfectly trained and disciplined english regiments if the redcoats hadnt taken the feint they never would if they hadnt a lot of his men would get shot soon he was liable to get shot himself he made himself shrug hed done the best he could come on boys he called hanovers got the prettiest women in atlantis people say youll see em for yourselves before long that won him a cheer which he hushed as fast as he could fortunately all the gunfire up ahead meant the redcoats werent likely to notice it he led the rest of the atlantean armyincluding most of the mortar crewssouth at a quick march their comrades had to keep the english troops in front of them busy for an hour maybe a little longer several of his men had grown up in these parts they pointed out paths that ran east toward the weak spot in the works he thought hed found he sent mounted scouts ahead of his main force with luck they would scoop up any redcoat pickets or loyalist atlanteans who might dash east and warn the main english force the atlantean assemblys army was on the way without luck victor refused to dwell on that we will be lucky he told himself as if telling himself something like that would make it come true no horse pistols boomed ahead of the advancing atlanteans victor took that for a good sign his scouts hadnt found a reason to shoot at anyone nor had they run into english cavalryor into biddiscombes horsed legion if it was real and not a figment of some englishman with a quill pen and an overactive imagination almost to the enemys line general said one of the men whod come out from hanover to give victor radcliff what news he had so we are victor agreed one more swell of ground maybe two and theyd be able to see what awaited them just as much to the point the english soldiers in cornwallis fieldworks would be able to see them victor raised his voice form line of battle the atlanteans deployed as if theyd been doing it for years well a lot of them had baron von steuben would have been proud at the last council of war victor had realized his officers were veterans so were many of the troopers he was surprised to hear them cheer as they swung from column to line they hadnt done that since the early days of the war hed assumed they knew better maybe they had too but they also knew what taking hanover back would be worth it was worth a cheer evidently there the man from hanover pointed i see victor said quietly the forts and trenches scarred what had been fields of wheat and barley they were well sited victor had never known english military engineers not to take what advantage of the countryside they could his men would have to charge up a gentle slope to reach the english positions if those positions were packed with redcoats well in that case this wouldnt be one of those lucky daysnot for his side anyhow a musket thundered in the trenches he watched the cloud of gunpowder smoke rise that was a signal shot warning the englishmen up and down the line that the atlanteans were here mortarmen victor shouted then he drew his fancy sword and flourished it over his head come on he cried to the atlanteans whose bayonets glittered in the sun hanover is ours not if the redcoats had anything to say about it they started shooting from the trench cannon boomed from a redoubt several atlanteans went down as a roundshot plowed through their ranks the men who served the mortars did what they could they dropped mortar bombs on the soldiers in the trenches and on the enemy artillerists they didnt take long to find the range hurting the foe was a different story mortar bombs had to be the most irksome weapons artificers had ever almost perfected their fuses proved much more art than science some dropped harmlessly to the ground without exploding some burst high in the air which was frightening and distracting but not even slightly dangerous a few and only a few actually did what they were supposed to do one of the english cannon abruptly fell silent that was good for victors troopers were scrambling through the stakes and felled trees set out in front of the enemy trench line then another wellplaced mortar bomb blew several english soldiers to bloody rags right in front of the gap the atlanteans had cleared whooping victors men rushed forward clearing trenches could be nasty expensive work not this timethe redcoats here really were thin on the ground only a few of them fought when victors troopers bore down on them more threw away their muskets and surrendered or ran from the atlanteans keep moving victor shouted on to hanover on to hanover his men roared english officers shouted too trying to get their men to form up in the open country behind their lines to slow the atlantean advance the redcoats were nothing if not game but then victors mortar crews dropped several bombs on their lines stolid as the english soldiers were they werent used to that kind of bombardment along with sharp volleys from the atlantean infantry it disrupted them and kept them from putting up the kind of fight they might have bit by bit the englishmen decided theyd had enough they retreated to the north and south toward croydon and new hastings church bells chimed in hanover people streamed out into the streets to welcome the atlantean army tears stung victors eyes if he could hold the city hed done one of the things he had to do to win the war chapter hanover not the oldest city in atlantis but the largest and the richest and now in atlantean hands again how cornwallis had to be gnashing his teeth how thomas paine would rejoice when word came to distant terranova if the redcoats hadnt caught him and jailed him or hanged him by now cornwallis of course wasnt the only one gnashing his teeth as the army of the atlantean assembly got ready to winter in hanover quite a few atlanteans who lived in hanover felt the same way some of them were loyalists down to their toes others had made a lot of money providing the redcoats with food and drink and complaisant women one of the locals a fat taverner named absalom hogarth looked apprehensively at victor radcliff victor sat in the study that had once belonged to his greatgrandfather and was now owned by his merchant cousin erasmus a dusty honkers skull stared at him with empty eye sockets along with the antique brass sextant and leatherbound folios it had sat in that study for a long long time absalom hogarth didnt seem to see any of them or the inquiring mind that had accumulated them hogarths gimleteyed gaze was focused on victor as sharply as the suns rays brought together in a point by a burning glass victor had already talked to a lot of people like the tavernkeeper they depressed him but he had to do the job steepling his fingers he spoke in tones as neutral as he could make them you look to have done pretty well for yourself while the english ruled the roost here well general as a matter of fact i did hogarth said that was a response out of the ordinary tell me more victor urged still neutral the taverner shrugged broad shoulders chins bobbed up and down not much to tell the redcoats were here i saw to their wants i wouldve done the same for you and yours by god general i will do the same for you and yours he looked as if he expected victor to pin a medal on him for his selfless patriotism maybe he did more likely years of dealing withand no doubt bilking when he saw the chanceother people had made him a better than tolerable actor let me make sure i understand you victor said slowly please absalom hogarth all but radiated candor you say you will treat us the same way as you treated the english so i do so i shall the taverner sounded proud of himself you say you would have treated us as well as you treated them had we held hanover in their place i not only say it general i mean it then you must be saying that who rules atlantis whether she be free in the hands of her own folk or groaning under the yoke of english tyranny is a matter of complete and utter indifference to you i do say that wait too late hogarth realized the trap had just dropped out from under him he sent victor an accusing stare youre trying to confuse me of course im an atlantean patriot why of course mr hogarth plenty of atlanteans arent plenty of atlanteans in this very city arent victor said i know for a fact that the socalled loyalists had little trouble recruiting their rabble here too many of the atlanteans who fought for king george were anything but a rabble and victor knew it however much he wished they were none of them could recruit me hogarth said virtuously victor eyed his bulk there sir i believe you you are not made for marching and every horse in atlantis must also know relief that you did not choose the cavalrymans life heh hogarth said were his position stronger he might have added a good deal more he tried a jolly fat mans chuckle instead it came off well but perhaps not quite well enough he must have sensed as much for he sounded nervous when he asked ah what do you aim to do with me ive been wondering the same thing mr hogarth victor replied if i treated you as you deserve youor your heirswould have scant cause to love me thereafter he waited for that to sink in by the way hogarth gulped it did on the other hand you cannot expect me to love you for playing the weather vane you have a way with words you do the taverner kept trying here is what i will do victor radcliff said after more thought i will fine you a hundred pounds payable in sterling for giving aid and comfortchiefly comfort or it would go harder for you to the enemy a hundred pounds this time hogarths yelp of anguish seemed altogether unrehearsed a hundred pounds victor repeated be thankful its not more for i doubt not you have it after that you shall do as you offered and serve us in the fashion to which the redcoats became accustomed and if i hear any complaints of cheating or gouging but i wont will i no indeed general i am an honest mannot a a political man but an honest man hogarth said victor radcliff didnt laugh in his face judging him humiliated enough a world that held such oddities as cucumber slugs and flapjack turtles might also hold an honest taverner or two it might but victor didnt think hed ever set eyes on one before he didnt think he was looking at one now either just pay your assessment he said wearily pay your assessment and try to remember youre an atlantean not a damned englishman ill do it absalom hogarth declared and maybe he would and maybe he wouldnt chances were he didnt know yet himself or care there were plenty more in hanover like hogarth men who were loyal or at least obedient to whoeverd paid them last and there were others whod unquestionably leaned toward king george and who didnt care to lean away some were silent others spat defiance at him they called themselves patriots he hated the word in their mouths but had trouble denying the justice of their using it justice the worst offenders no the worst enemies for they thought they were doing the lords work and in no way offending had fled with cornwallis men knowing what was likely to await them if they found themselves in atlantean hands victor didnt hang anyone who remained behind he did send a handful of men out of his lines with no more than the clothes on their backs whatever they held in hanover he confiscated in the name of the atlantean assembly i reckoned your horde a pack of thieves before you broke in one of the men who was to be expelled told him you do nothing to make me believe myself mistaken you love us not victor said if you war against us do you doubt we shall love you not in return a christian man loves his enemies the loyalist returned well then we show our love as you showed yours victor said he pointed north in the direction of croydon and much closer the nearest english lines now get you gone maybe you should have been rougher blaise said after the last of the expulsions and confiscations our men would like to see some of those scoundrels go to the gallows scoundrels is it victor managed a twisted smile sometimes the words you know surprise me sometimes its the ones you dont know did i go wrong is scoundrels not what they are blaise asked seriously scoundrels is what they are victor assured him its a fancy word for what they are but not a wrong one scoundrels blaise said it again with relish i like the sound it makes them seem like dogs like dogs victor was briefly puzzled then he realized what the negro had to mean oh i see like spaniels those dogs yes with the floppy ears blaise said maybe he told the joke to a printer or maybe someone else had the same idea for a few days later a newspaper had a frontpage woodcut of several prominent men leaving the city with sorrowful expressions and big spaniel ears let the dogs go it said beneath the cartoon custis cawthorne showed more witand hired more talented engraversbut custis was in paris these days artistic or not the woodcut struck victor as effective that would do as soon as spring came the redcoats would try to recapture hanover victor was as sure of that as he was of the resurrection and the second coming and it struck him as rather more immediately urgent than either of those he set his men to digging trenches and throwing up earthworks to keep the enemy from getting past them his soldiers concealed their enthusiasm for all that coldweather pickandshovel work very well the most he ever heard any of them say in its favor was a remark from one tired atlantean to his comrade as they both piled up an earthen rampart maybe all this slaving means we aint so likely to get shot maybe the mans friend seemed unimpressed but its near as bad as if we were eh well the first soldier weighed that then he nodded afraid so he agreed mournfully but neither of them stopped working victor didnt mind grumbling william the conquerors soldiers must have grumbled and augustus caesars and king davids as well as long as they did what wanted doing they could grumble all they pleased grumbling only turned dangerous when it started swallowing work english scouts rode down to see what victors men were up to atlantean riflemen fired at the scouts to make them keep their distance every so often a rifleman would knock a scout out of the saddle then the others would stay farther away for a while sometimes patriotic atlanteans would sneak down from the north to tell victor what cornwallis men were up to sometimes victor wasnt so sure whether the atlanteans who sneaked down from the north were patriotic or not but he had soldiers from all over the northern settlements states he reminded himself theyre states now were states now more often than not he could find somebody who knew his wouldbe informants either by name or by reputation he didnt seize the men he reckoned untrustworthy no he thanked them for what they told him and then threw it on the mental rubbish heap he sent them back to the north with as much misinformation as he could feed them maybe cornwallis would realize victor realized he was being fooled or maybe not the chance to confuse king georges commander seemed worth taking as spring approached victor wondered whether the enemy would let him hold hanover undisturbed till summer he wouldnt have done that himself but howe and cornwallis had already tried several things he wouldnt have done himself some of them had worked too worse luck but then three reliable men in quick succession came down to warn him the redcoats were moving at last he put men into his northfacing works he also sent horsemen out beyond those works to shadow the english army cornwallis naturally had his own spies just as patriots hurried south to warn the atlantean army so loyalists galloped north to tell the english what victor radcliff was up to they must have given him a good report of victors field fortifications instead of trying to bull through them cornwallis slid around them to the west he wants to fight it out in the open victor told a council of war he thinks his regulars will smash our atlantean fanners the officers almost exploded with fury hed never heard so many variations on well show him in his life he got a stronger reaction than he really wanted for he retained a solid respect for the men who filled the ranks of the english army they were miserably paid they were trained and handled harshly enough to make a hound turn and snap but they were deadly dangerous with musket and bayonet to hand if he marched out of hanover and lost a battle in the open field he wasnt sure he could fall back into the city and hold on to it and he wanted to keep hanoverno he had to an atlantean presence on the east coast was visible proof the united states of atlantis were a going concern not only that the harbor gave france a perfect place to land troopsif france ever got around to sending them and so victor temporized first lets see how mad we can drive him most of you remember how bad the mosquitoes were down in the south he waited till the other officers nodded anyone whod forgotten what the mosquitoes were like had to have an iron hide victor said i aim to make us into mosquitoes the way we were when the war began sounds pretty general a captain said whats it mean what would cornwallis have done after a question like that had the luckless questioner flogged cornwallis was a goodnatured man as victor had cause to know butmost likely the question would never be asked in an english council unlike rude colonials english junior officers knew their place being a rude colonial himself victor didnt drag the captain off to the whipping post i want to put riflemen or musketeers behind every tree and bush along the enemys line of march i want to capture every man of his who goes off into the bushes to answer natures call i want to shoot the animals hauling his cannon and supplies lets see how much he enjoys an enemy with whom he cannot close does that satisfy you sir reckon so the captain answered but if thats how you aim to fight seems a shame we wasted all that time on closeorder drill wasted baron von steuben roaredactually vasted bout the size of it the captain saidhe didnt seem to care whom he antagonized form square and by the right flank march and deploy from column to line and i dont know what all else this here coming up sounds like a lot more fun before the german officer could murder the man victor said we need both styles and our men are better soldiers because they can fight like regulars as well as guerrilleros closeorder drill improves discipline generally will you tell me im wrong hayfoot strawfoot the captain said reminiscently he spread his hands all right general youve got me there good victor smiled now lets go get the damned redcoats the portly english sergeant was almost beside himself with rage when three grinning atlanteans marched him into victor radcliffs presence hello sergeant victor said what seems to be your trouble are you not relieved to be captured rather than killed relieved sir the word only infuriated the sergeant more i was taken with my trousers down is that any way to fight a war evidently victor answered the atlanteans went from grinning to laughing out loud you shouldve seen him jump when old isaiah here went and yelled hands up or well blow your arsehole off one of them said anotherisaiah by the way he made as if to bowadded he didnt just jump neither he went and shat them fancy breeches had to try and clean em off with some leaves he tore off a bush general the english sergeant cried piteously for how many years had he made his living tormenting the redcoats luckless enough to serve under him and a good living it had been too judging by that bulging belly but now others were giving it to him and he was finding he didnt like it so well if you sniff general you can still smell him isaiah said he let go all rightdamned if he didnt that will be enough of that victor said had his men taken you you wouldnt want them gloating afterwards god bless you sir the sergeant said knuckling his forelock youre a gentleman sir you are a merciful gentleman huh the third atlantean spoke up a great tun like him dont deserve nobodys mercy hes the kind who loots and murders and takes the women upstairs whether they want to go or not victor thought the soldier had made a shrewd guess the sergeant turned the color of paste which said a lot about how shrewd it was i dont know anything about any of that he said but he didnt sound persuasive maybe so then again maybe not victor said the englishman went paler yet victor hadnt thought he could but if he was sweating like that why not sweat something out of him im sure the sergeant does know where general cornwallis is going and what he intends doing once he gets there not only did the sergeant know he was pathetically eager to tell he sang like a nightingale victor had heard the birds in england while european creatures like the wild hog and the rat flourished in atlantis all efforts to naturalize the nightingale had failed after the englishman spewed out everything he knew the atlantean troopers took him away he runs on at both ends seems like isaiah remarked by then more confident he wouldnt be murdered out of hand the sergeant had regained some of his spirit if you were my man id cane you for speaking of me so he said gruffly isaiah gave him a look as cold as the blocks of ice that sometimes drifted down near north cape in winter any man lays a finger on me without my leavea finger mind you let alone a caneill gutshoot him and you your goddamned sergeantship sir youve got a devil of a lot of gut to shoot victor smiled as the sergeant suddenly silenced again trudged away with his captors anyone who thought he could use an atlantean as he used an englishman was liable to get a rude surprise this underofficer had got a whole string of them and yet quite a few englishmen found they liked atlantean ways once they got used to them maybe the sergeant would be one of those hed make a good drillmaster as long as he left his cane behind redwood hill must have held the name for a long time no redwoods grew on it now or for miles around it was crowned by a rank tangle of second growth ferns and bushes and saplings some atlantis native productions and others imported from europe or terranova warred for space and sunlight redwood hill was also crowned by an english observation post an alert man with a spyglass up there could see for a long way he could easily keep an army under observation he might have much more trouble spotting greencoats armed with rifles as one by one they slipped through the second growth toward him victor hoped that would be so and set about finding out empirically rifles banged up near the hilltop before long the greencoats sent a messenger down to victor to report that redwood hill now lay in atlantean hands weve even got the buggers spyglass the man reported capital victor said the art of grinding lenses was further advanced in england than in atlantis now we shall spy upon cornwallis not conversely cornwallis must have foreseen that possibility too it pleased him less than it did victor radcliff he promptly despatched a goodsized force of english regulars to dislodge the atlanteans from the hilltop he also sent a small troop of loyalist riflemen to match wits and weapons with the sharpshooters in green when the atlanteans found themselves hardpressed to hold the crest of redwood hill victor sent more men forward they drove the redcoats down the western slope of the hill until cornwallis fed more englishmen into the fight that meant victor had to reinforce again or yield the crest after hed already done so much fighting for it he wasnt willing to let that happen and plainly the english commander wasnt willing to let him keep it i did not purpose fighting our battle here he told blaise nor do i believe cornwallis purposed any such thing but this fight has taken on a life of its own it is war it has its own purposes the negro spoke as if war were a live thing and one at least as much in control of its own destiny as either of the opposing generals well maybe he wasnt so far wrong he finished if it wants a fight at redwood hill a fight at redwood hill there shall be victor couldnt contradict him a fight at redwood hill there was a most cursed irregular fight mostly because of the terrain the atlanteans were used to fighting from cover whenever they got the chance theyd harried the redcoats looping march down from the north in just that way on overgrown redwood hill not even the english regulars or their officers could dream of advancing in neatly dressed ranks they made their way forward as best they could some came up the narrow paths that led to the top of the hill they could move quickly but they also exposed themselves to a galling fire from the atlanteans lurking in the undergrowth others pushed through the bushes fighting atlanteanstyle themselves that might not have been what they were used to but they managed or maybe they just had a strong disinclination to retreat it amounted to the same thing either way a harder fight than victor would have looked for he also would have guessed that the englishmens red uniform jackets made them better targets but when he inquired of a man who came back from the crest with a minor wound the atlantean shook his head dont hardly seem to matter what with the ferns and the shrubs and suchlike and what with the powder smoke them bastards spy us about as quick as we set eyes on them he held up his right hand which was missing the last joint of the fourth finger i never did see the english son of a bitch who done gave me this go get it bandaged up victor said and then to one of his artillerists can we get our guns up to the top of the hill well general we can try that worthy answered im not so sure how much good itll do though doesnt seem like anybodys all drawn up in rows for us to shoot at does it no victor answered but send a fieldpiece up there anyhow if youd be so kind try to command the biggest path coming up from the west if cornwallis does seek to rush our position thats how hell essay it the artillerist sketched a salute if thats what you want general thats what youll get warm work its liable to be but what can you do he gave his own orders to his crew they limbered up their fourpounder and started for the crest victor hoped he hadnt sent them off to be killed when a soldier talked about warm work he commonly meant he didnt think hed come back from it but even one gun at the top of redwood hill might mean the difference between victory and defeat sometimes a general had to move the pieces across the board knowing they might be taken but the analogy with chess broke down too soon a taken chess piece went into the box to wait for the next game where it would start out fine a dead soldier sprawled in the dirt waiting for a raven to flutter down and peck out his eyes a wounded soldier especially one hurt worse than the fellow with whom hed talked not long before went screaming back to the surgeons who might spare him a swallow of whiskey and a leather strap to bite on before they started carving he might fight again if he was lucky unlucky but he would never be the same afterwards and yet you would assuredly lose if you didnt place your men where some of them would get hurt or killed if you didnt care for that unhappy certainty you should never have tried the generals trade in the first place rather too late to worry about that victor muttered worry about what blaise askedthe mutter hadnt been low enough about whether this cup will pass from me victor said it wont cup blaise briefly looked blank then his face cleared oh the bible he was christian enough to observe the forms of the majoritys religion how much he truly believed victor often wondered but that was between blaise and his god if any not for anybody else he had more urgent things to worry about than blaises relationship to his god too the rattle of musketry from the top of redwood hill grew fiercer and fiercer that alarmed victor for he knew the redcoats could load and fire faster than his men and then his little fourpounder boomed once twice after the second shot it fell silent why victor wonderedand worried were all the gunners dead on the field the fight went on it sounded as ferocious as ever had the fieldpiece knocked in the head of an enemy column advancing up that path from the west or had something else something incalculable from back here happened instead victor decided he had to know he swung up onto his horse im riding up to the hilltop he told blaise you dont want to stop a bullet the negro observed who does victor said blaise exhaled sharply not what i meant atlantis dont doesntwant you to stop a bullet atlantis doesnt want me to lose this battle either not when i might win it by giving orders without delay from messengers rushing back and forth victor replied he started to trot off toward the hill wait blaise called victor reined in his notquiteaide never sounded so imperious without good cause blaise mounted and came after him if youre going to play the fool you should have some other fool beside you honored victor tipped his tricorn honor blaise said white mens madness theyd gone round that barn before instead of starting around it again victor urged his horse forward with the reins and the pressure of his knees blaise followed his elbows flapped as he rode he bobbed up and down far more than a smooth horseman would have all that mightand probably didmake better riders look down their noses at him it didnt stop him getting from hither to yon or even slow him much wounded men staggered and limped down the east side of redwood hill bound for the surgeons litterbearers carried moaning soldiers too badly hurt to get down by themselves one of the walking wounded waved to victor you shouldve seen em general he called seen whom seen them doing what victor asked but by then his horse had carried him past the injured atlantean he didnt want to slow down even to find out more about mm whoever they were blaise understood as blaise commonly did youll know soon enough one way or the other he said victor nodded redwood hill didnt look like much till you rode up it atlantean soldiers trudging up the path toward the crest didnt seem sorry to stop for a moment and wave to their general as he went by will we lick em a man asked of course we will victor answered hoping he was right but a general who let his men see he had doubts didnt deserve his epaulets if a general doubted how could ordinary soldiers do anything else and soldiers who doubted werent men who would stand fast when a general most needed them to a general had to seem confident evenespeciallywhen he wasnt we still hold the crest blaise pointed to the line of greencoats ahead they reloaded and fired at the enemy as fast as they could we do victor fought to keep surprise from his voice too he wanted the words to convey that hed been sure of it all along he dismounted before reaching the crest after tying his horse to a sapling on the reverse slope he finished the climb on foot no point to giving the enemy a large target that shouted heres the atlantean general his gaudy officers uniform would take care of that well enough or maybe too well the field gun stood ready and waiting most of its crew still stood too it had done what victor hoped not what he feared those two rounds hed heard loaded with canister had torn the heart out of an english rush toward the crest dead and wounded redcoats lay in heaps in front of the gun but theyd never reached it right warm work it was general said the artilleryman in charge of the piece i see victor said he heard too few sounds raised more sorrow and pity than the cries of men whod been hurt aristotle called sorrow and pity the essence of tragedy he must have seen his share of battlefields too even in the days before villainous saltpeter they were no place for the faint of heart a musket ball cracked past his head he and the gunner both gave it an automatic genuflection they grinned sheepishly at each other as they straightened even the bravest mans flesh was less heroic than he might wish it not many unwounded englishmen and loyalists were visible if nothing else did their failed charge taught them not to show themselves not on this field and blackpowder smoke and the dust both sides had kicked up helped mask everyones movements a lieutenant held a rifle that with its bayonet was almost as long as he was tall he sketched a salute victor returned it at least half the time nobody gave him proper military courtesy a sketched salute seemed ever so much better than none how do we fare victor enquired well general were still here on the crest with a spot of luck the redcoats wont be able to take it away from us luck victor didnt like the word we need to hold come what may sure enough but i wont turn luck down either the rifleman said that field gun got to the top just at the right time fry me for an oil thrush if it didnt knocked the redcoats charge clear down to the bottom of the hill again if it ran late we might be down at the bottom ourselves over on the other side he jerked a thumb back toward the east so we might victor said uncomfortably and if they were cornwallis would hurl the english regulars at them again driving them in the direction of hanoveror maybe driving them away from atlantis leading city so the union jack could fly there once more amazing to think how much a couple of rounds of canister could do one of these days historians would write blowbyblow accounts of the grand and furious battle of redwood hill would the learned scholars and soldiers give the canister its due or would it fade into the general chaos of battle victor had been through several battles against the french atlanteans and the french that the historians had got their hands on afterwards the descriptions of the fights hed read bore precious little resemblance to the fights he thought he remembered which meant what exactly even now victor wasnt sure maybe the men whod done their best to rival thucydides and tacitus knew better than he did theyd questioned men from both sides some of them had got access to french and english and even atlantean officers papersincluding his own but if what they wrote differed from his memories he didnt have to take them seriously he didnt intend to either three british fieldpieces unlimbered near the base of redwood hill the gunners aimed them with fussy precision victor had never seen a muzzle pointed up so high not even at the siege of nouveau redon what he would have done for some mortars in his baggage train then english and atlantean long guns had tried to reach the french fortress and hadnt had much luck now theyre going to try to blow us off the crest the lieutenant of riflemen said so they are victor agreed the next interesting question is can they do it he eyed the cannon apprehensively somehow a guns bore always seemed two or three times as wide when it pointed straight at you they dont look to have any mortars close by anyhow for which im duly grateful i was just thinking about that mmyes the younger officer said i wouldnt want those nasty bursting shells coming down on my head and thats a fact he paused thoughtfully of course like as not the fusingd leave somewhat to be desired victor radcliff only grunted in response to that atlantis mortars improvised and otherwise had done yeoman duty in breaking the english lines outside of hanover but as the lieutenant said they would have done even more had the gunners been better able to control when the shells detonated artillerymen all over the world wrestled with the problem none with much success the field guns thundered victor watched roundshot speed toward him then he watched the cannon balls fall short smashing through the undergrowth atop redwood hill till they came to rest he hoped they smashed through some redcoats too one of the gunners harangued his comrades they limbered up their teams started hauling the guns up the path toward the crest oh no they dont the lieutenant of riflemen exclaimed well murder the lot of them if they get much closer he sketched another salute and hurried off to instruct his sharpshooters even before the riflemen opened up on the english fieldpieces that atlantean fourpounder started throwing roundshot at them an iron ball smashed the wheel of a field guns carriage that one wouldnt move up any farther then the riflemen did go to work they couldnt fire nearly so fast as musketeers but unlike musketeers they had some hope of hitting what they aimed at out to three or four hundred yards several english gunners went down one after another their friends dove into the bushes to keep from meeting the same fate none of the field guns got close enough to pound the crest of redwood hill as the sun sank behind his troopers cornwallis gave up the assault he sent a man to victor under flag of truce asking leave to gather his wounded and withdraw victor gave it glumly the englishman went back down the hill he could see as well as victor that the atlanteans would hold on to hanover chapter denis was a small coastal town south of cosquer in what had been french atlantis cosquer was an important place and had been for three hundred years st denis wasnt and never had been a few fishing boats went in and out every once in a while a merchantman would put in at its rickety quaysas often as not a badly navigated merchantman that had been bound for somewhere else victor didnt know what made some towns thrive and others falter down in spanish atlantis farther south yet gernika flourished as much as any town in lackadaisical spanish atlantis flourished anyhow not far away tiny st augustine also on the coast drowsed under the semitropical sun yes gernika was older but so what new hastings was older than hanover too but hanover had been the biggest most bustling town in english atlantisin all of atlantisfor a long time now st denis was about to reappear in the history books or at least in the footnotes victor looked down at the note on his desk well erasmus radcliffs desk but victor was using it these days that note still said the same thing it had when he first opened it a few minutes earlier he read it again just to make sure french menofwar and transports had evaded the royal navy and disgorged an army at st denis hed hoped that army would come to hanover it was in atlantis but it was now moving north up the atlantean coast its commander hoped to effect a meeting with the atlanteans in the not too indefinite future i will be damned victor murmured reading the missive from st denis yet again it still hadnt changednot a single word of it the last time french troops landed in atlantis victor and cornwallis then major and lieutenantcolonel respectively neither having yet acquired the exalted rank of general beat them in a series of alarmingly close battles and forced the surrender of those who survived now radcliff would be working with the french commander whatever sort of officer this marquis de la fayette turned out to be against the man whod been his friend and ally in the last war which proved what exactly only that life could turn bloody peculiar sometimes oh yes victor muttered as if i didnt already know that he got to his feet and stretched something in his back made a noise like the cork exploding from a bottle of sparkling wine he blinked then slowly smiled whateverd happened in there he felt better because of it he walked over and picked up the big honker skull william radcliff had acquired back in the last century alas poor yorick he began holding it in the palm of his left hand blaise came in confronted with the spectacle of the commander of the atlantean army spouting shakespeare at the cranium of a longdefunct bird the negro could hardly have been blamed for beating a hasty retreat but blaise was a tough fellow giving the honker skull no more than a raised eyebrow he addressed victor as if the latter had never heard of hamlet are the frenchmen really and truly throwing in with us they are victor answered automatically only then did he set down the skull and send blaise a startled stare how did you know about that by god the letter telling me of it only came just now he pointed to the paper still sitting on the desk no doubt blaise might have been innocence personified if innocence came with slightly bloodshot eyes he explained them and himself but you see general ive been drinking with the lads who brought it to you and they blabbed somewhator maybe a bit more than somewhat oh victor could see what would spring from that youre telling me all of hanover will know of it by this oclock tomorrow and cornwallis will know of it by this oclock day after tomorrow not me blaise shook his head i dont need to tell you any such thing since you already know it as well as i do victor sighed he wanted to start talking to the honker skull again there was at least some hope it wouldnt turn around and repeat gossip as fast as it got it instead he looked up toward the heavens and the god he hopefully believed in dear lord will we ever be able to do anything or even plan anything without letting our foes learn of it almost before we do if ever you want to get ahead of the english blaise said go tell all and sundry youre about to do this make as if youre about to do this but then at the last moment without telling anyone but the few who needs must know turn about and do that instead it will be their ruination ruination he smiled as he repeated the word i do fancy the sound of it ruination victor also savored the word and he savored the conception that had led up to it maybe i should give you my epaulets or maybe i should just remember never to let the fox guard the chicken coop you mean people need to remember things like that blaise said well remembering them is better than forgetting them wouldnt you say victor replied it might be blaise allowed yes as a matter of fact it just might be the french armys rapid progress up the coast stopped just north of cosquer cornwallis regulars in freetownand the depressingly large number of loyalist troops the redcoats recruited in those partsskirmished with the frenchmen fell back a mile or so and then skirmished again they do not fight as regulars properly should fight the brash young nobleman commanding the french force complained in his next letter to victor it is to be expected that regular troops should form line of battle in open country and volley at one another until one side establishes its superiority which the bayonet charge will then enforce but the enemy forces shoot from behind trees and stones and fences as if they were so many cowardly savages oh dear victor said on reading that a comment which worked on several levels the redcoats had learned too much from fighting his atlanteans and they and their loyalists were now giving the previously uninstructed french some unpleasant lessons and france by all appearances had learned very little shed sent another brave young seigneur across the atlantic to lead her army during the last war marquis montcalmgozon ended up dead despite his dash and courage victor had to hope the same wouldnt happen to this fellow he also had to flog his faltering french to respond in writing as well wish for the moon as expect a french nobleman to read english his pen scratched across the sheet of rather coarse paper coarse yes but made in atlantis my dear marquis de la fayette i regret that the redcoats tactics have disconcerted you perhaps the arrival of an atlantean officer of suitable rank to instruct your soldiers might improve the situation yours faithfullyvictor radcliff general commanding off his response went by the fastest fishing schooner then in hanover harbor he wished he could send it by semaphore or heliograph tower unfortunately the enemy controlled most of the territory that lay between himself and the french he had to entrust the communication to wind and wave in due course and not a great deal later than hed hoped he got his reply it was if nothing else short and to the point my dear general radcliff de la fayette wrote i look forward to your joining us at your earliest convenience your most obedient servant staring victor said where the devil did he get that notion what is the trouble now blaise asked i told the french general some officer ofi think i said something like the right rankwould come and show his regulars how to fight in atlantis victor answered and he thinks i meant id go myself he laughed at the absurdity to his surprise blaise didnt maybe you should if the french know the man they fight beside it could be that they will fight better because of it i mean truly know you understand but victor found himself spluttering but he finally managed to put his main objection into words what if cornwallis tries to take hanover away from us again not likely not after he turned away when we beat him at redwood hill blaise answered calmly and even if he does do you think the army can fight only if it has you to tell it how to go about things part of victor thought exactly that he knew better than to admit it though if the cause of liberty had an indispensable man was liberty what the atlantean assembly was really fighting for or would the settlementsnow styled statesmerely be exchanging one master for another slowly victor said when you put it that way i do blaise said besides dont you want to see with your own eyes what these french are like what they can do i saw too much of that in the last war this time at least whatever they can do they wont be trying to do it to me victor wagged a finger at blaise i think youre telling me i should go because you want to get down that way yourself who me butter would have stayed solid forever in the negros mouth i dont know what youre talking about general like fun you dont victor said but all right well see what we can do to get this de la fayettes soldiers moving again you and i good blaise said equably victor hoped it would be a brisk breeze from the north wafted the rosebud out of hanover harbor bound for cosquer or somewhere not far north the schooner had been a big fishing boat before war came to atlantis now she mounted a dozen eightpounders plenty for taking unarmed merchantmen but not nearly enough to stand against even a small english frigate victor radcliff knew he came from a line that had gone to sea for generation after generation he himself however made a most indifferent sailor but he outdid blaise hed seen before that the negro was unhappy aboard ship setting a hand on blaises shoulder he said cheer up friend you wont end up on the auction block after we disembark blaise gave back a sheepish smile you pinned it down general that you did i know here that this is no slaver he tapped his forehead but then touching his belly and his crotch in turn he added here and here though im not so sure i doubt that thatd make sense to someone whos never lain in chains but there it is no ive never done that victor admitted he said nothing about the profit various offshoots of the radcliff and radcliffe clans had made from the slave trade blaise was bound to know already still casting it in his face would be rude instead victor said maybe i can imagine a little of what you went through maybe by the way blaise said it he thought victor was talking through his hat since he had the experience and victor didnt he might well have been right instead of arguing with him victor waited upon the rosebuds skipper a potbellied hanover man named randolph welles what do we do if the royal navy calls on us to stop and be boarded well now general that depends welles pipe sent upsmoke signals if we can run why run we shalli promise you that but if the choice is between letting them board and getting blown out of the water all things considered id sooner go on living he spread his hands as if to say there was no accounting for taste i see victor said and who decides whether we shall run or yield i do randolph welles snapped till that moment victor had thought him mildmannered now he discovered hed labored under a misapprehension welles went on on land you may do as you please sirthat is your province but i am captain of the rosebud general no one elseshe assuredly is my province let there be no misunderstandings on that score they could cause unpleasantness perhaps even worse all right victor wasnt sure it was if welles wanted to surrender when that didnt look like a good idea to him but what could he do about it if the rosebuds sailors seemed inclined to obey their skipper precious little victors best hope then might be diving over the rail and hoping he could swim to shore he wasnt much of a swimmer he could barely see the shore if he didnt want the english to hang him though what other choice had he generals borrowed a lot of trouble any commander worth having needed to worry about how hed respond if the enemy did this that or the other thing many of the things a general could come up with were wildly unlikely most of the things a general could come up with never happened but the day he didnt worry about them would be the day one came true so it proved aboard the rosebud victor worried about what might happen if royal navy vessels came after the schooner she saw never a one as she sailed south past new hastings and freetown she did see a few fishing boats all of them smaller and slower than she was she had favorable winds and a mild sea a day sooner than victor expected her to she slid into the harbor at cosquer even blaise said well that wasnt too bad knowing how he felt about ships victor didnt think he could come out with higher praise than that from his lips even so much seemed extravagant cosquer had started as a specifically breton town you could still hear breton in these parts if you knew which fishermens taverns which sailmakers shops which saltsellers establishments to visit you could also hear english that had been true long before france lost its atlantean possessions but you were most likely to hear french and so victor was not surprised to find himself hailed in that language monsieur le general i am general radcliff yes he replied also in french excellent said the tall lean man standing on the pier i have the honor to be captain luc froissart aidedecamp to the marquis de la fayette horses await you and your own aide who would be victor gestured here is sergeant blaise black who has been my man of affairs since long before this war began captain froissart had bushy eyebrows they jumped when he got a good look at blaises dark impassive face how most extremely interesting he said i am sure the marquis will be delighted to acquaint himself with both of you is it that the sergeant speaks and comprehends french me not a word of your language do i speak or comprehend blaise repliedin french froissart blinked then threw back his head and laughed ueh bum sergeant it seems you are one on whom we shall have to keep an eye you white people have been saying that for as long as i was able to understand your speech blaise said nevertheless saying is easier than doing or i should never have escaped from slavery he eyed froissart with a raised eyebrow the fellow who bought me when i first came to atlantis was a frenchman victor waited to see how froissart would take that this fellow he was not me the french officer said he was not the marquis either or any of the soldiers who have come to atlantis from la belle france please bear it in mind sergeant it was blaises turn to measure to consider well i can probably do that he said at last he might have angered or affronted froissart if not for his earlier gibe as things were de la fayettes aidedecamp nodded judiciously good enough and can you also ride a horse how much you demand of me blaise sounded as petulant as a seventeenyearold girl dreamt of being you victor exclaimed in mock dudgeon he doesnt even ask if i can ride captain froissart made a small production of charging his pipe and flicking at a flintandsteel lighter till it gave forth with enough sparks to ignite the pipeweed in the bowl after puffing a couple of times and ensuring that the pipe would stay lit the frenchman spoke in philosophical tones they warned me atlanteans were different i see they knew what they were talking about who were they victor almost asked in the end though he decided hed rather not know all that mattered was that the french were on atlantean soil and on atlantis side as long as he kept that firmly in mind he could worry about everything else later when camped french regulars pitched their tents with geometrical exactitude the perfect rows of canvas might have been part of a formal garden the effect was pleasing and formidable at the same time the effect the marquis de la fayette had on victor radcliff was almost the same de la fayette was both younger and better trained than victor had expected he also manifested far more enthusiasm for the atlantean cause than victor had looked for it is not just a matter of giving england a finger in the eye pleasant though that may be de la fayette declared but the proclamation of liberty oh my dear sir he bunched the fingertips of his right hand together and kissed themhe was a frenchman all right this document how shall i say it this document shall live on as a milestone in the history of the world the praise sounded even more impressive in french perhaps than it would have in english the marquis did speak english after a fashion but both victor and blaise were more fluent in french and since several of the french officers had only their native tongue they were happy not to have to try to learn atlantis dominant language on the fly you gentlemen certainly have ah made yourselves at home here victor remarked my dear sir de la fayette said again it is from time to time necessary to fight a war no denying that however great a pity it may be still it is not necessary to make oneself unduly uncomfortable while fighting it eh so it would seem victor said and left it there his allies lived under canvas they were as de la fayette said at war but theyd brought over a variety of light ingenious folding furniturenot just chairs tables and writing desks but also bed frames and wickerwork chests of drawersthat let them feel as if they were back in their estates on the loire or the seine and theyd brought over some vintages finer than any victor had ever tasted and some brandies that taught him what brandy ought to be they supplemented those with beer and ale and spirits taken from the countryside and their chef blaise put it best when he said its a wonder you gentlemen dont all weigh four hundred pounds youve got some of the best victuals i ever tasted you do victor agreed he was thinking about letting his belt out a notch merci the marquis said smilinghe was an affable young man no doubt about it i shall pass your praise on to henri who will be grateful for it henri was the genius who did things to poultry and beef the likes of which no atlantean cook had ever imagined captain froissart said you will remember my friends that we get our exercise come what may his colleagues grinned and leered and nodded victor managed a smile himself most of the exercise the french officers got was of the horizontal variety they hadnt been in atlantis long but theyd acquired mistresses or companions or whatever the word was the girls were all uncommonly pretty quite a few of them whatever they were to be called had dark skins victor wondered what blaise would have to say about that blaise took it better than hed expected if you sleep with an officer you get presents you dont see from anybody else he observed you hear things you dont hear from other folk too you do all right for yourself afterwards i bet i wouldnt be surprised victor said and left it there knowing the country between cosquer and freetown better than the newly come frenchhed fought against montcalmgozon and roland kersauzon hereabouts in the last warvictor accompanied the marquis de la fayette on reconnaissance rides to probe the english positions and more than once he accompanied the marquis on very rapid returns to the french armys positions the redcoats also seemed to know the countryside quite well some of the atlanteans who fought on king georges side knew it even better radcliff and de la fayette barely escaped a couple of ambuscades nothing like being shot at when they miss nestcepas de la fayette said after some english musket balls missed by not nearly enough it is an improvement on getting hit victor agreed past that i dont think it has a great deal to recommend it by then they were almost back to the french commanders tent come in and take some brandy with me de la fayette said you will see how much better it tastes now than it would have on an ordinary day when nothing interesting happened i dont know about that your excellency but ill gladly make the experiment victor said one tumbler of brandy became two and then three victor wasnt sure whether the bottled lightning tasted better than it would have on an ordinary day he wasnt sure it got him anymore drunk than it would have on an ordinary day either well before he finished that third tumblerful he was sure it didnt get him any less drunk the marquis seemed convinced hed proved his point as he refilled his own tumbler he solemnly declared there is also something else that improves after one is fired upon to no effect oh victor responded with a certain intensity of his own and what might that be de la fayette got a fit of the giggles it might be any number of things my friend but what it is if you will excuse me for a few seconds he hurried out of the tent without waiting to find out whether victor would excuse him or not that affronted victor which only went to show hed had a good deal to drink himselfnot that he thought of it in those terms at that moment the marquis took longer to return than hed promised that didnt bother victor radcliff who applied himself to the brandy with a dedication suited tohe supposedcelebrating a narrow escape then de la fayette did returnwith his companion a charming and intelligent and victor had seen that she was both young mulatto woman named marie and with the two of them came another pretty girl perhaps two shades darker than marie the marquis introduced her as louise enchanted mademoiselle victor said bowing over her hand with slow exaggeratedwell drunkencourtesy louise started giggling then so did marie as far as victor knew neither one of them had been into the brandy bottle the marquis de la fayette who had laughed so hard he almost fell over victor stared at him in owlish indignation slowly de la fayette straightened even more slowly his laughter faded he was as sober as an inebriated judge when he pointed to louise and said does she suit you victor eh whats that you say victor wondered if his ears were working the way they were supposed to does she suit you de la fayette spoke slowly and distinctly as if to an idiot child but he was not talking about childish things at all i would not make you sleep alone not after you came all this way to show us the tricks of fighting in atlantisand certainly not after you almost got shot a little while ago if you would rather lie down with someone else though that can be arranged victor choked no matter how much brandy hed taken aboard he couldnt very well misunderstand that he wasnt always perfectly faithful when he was away from margaret for a long stretch on the other hand hed never acquired a mistress before he looked at louise she was more than enjoyable enough to the eye is this what you want to do he asked her her skin might be dark brown but her shrug was purely gallic why not she replied that question had a large number of possible answers victor could see at least some of them seeing them and caring about them proved two very different things hed drunk a great deal of the marquis de la fayettes excellent brandy hed been shot at without result as the french nobleman reminded him hed been away from margaret for much too long and louise was sweet to the eye would she be sweet to the touch as well he couldnt imagine any reason why she wouldnt beand he wanted to find out for himself well then he said as if that were a complete sentence as he and louise were heading out of de la fayettes tent and off to his own the french marquis said i hope you have a pleasant evening monsieur le general i should also let you know that your man of affairs will not envy your good fortune for i have arranged companionship for him have you victor said foolishly but why not blaise had been away from stella as long as victor had been away from margaret victor nodded good thats good louise tugged at his sleeve are you coming i am my dear so i am victor said the guards outside the marquis de la fayettes tent presented arms as he and louise left the guards outside his own tent presented arms as he and louise went in they knew what hed be doing in there all right but they were frenchmen too they might envy him but he didnt think theyd blab and if they didwell so what the brandy hed diligently got outside of told him it wouldnt matter a bit the camp bed with which de la fayette had equipped the tent was a masterpiece of compact lightness it promised one person a fine nights sleep victor wasnt so sure it would bear the weight of two and it was decidedly narrow for entertaining he shrugged nothing ventured nothing gained louise was every bit as enjoyable as hed hoped she would be whether she also enjoyed herself well that wasnt a question you wanted to ask a woman who wasnt there because she loved you victor approached the issue by saps and parallels as it were is this but for an evening or will you join me again in the gloom inside the tent her race was unreadable i am to be yours for as long as you wish me to be yours monsieur it general she answered which didnt tell him what he wanted to know does that suit you he asked much as he had in de la fayettes tent and she said why not just as she had then then she asked a question of her own twice do you think i dont know victor said in surprise twice so soon he wasnt such a young man any more he wasnt an old man yet though well lets find out along with potent brandy the marquis de la fayette had brought strong coffee from france victor found himself drinking more of it than he was usually in the habit of doing without it he might have found himself nodding off at any hour of the day or night war had its exertions but so did peace he noticed blaise was also drinking more than his share of that darkroasted coffee a man must keep his strength up blaise said seriously yes victor agreed deadpan he must blaises companion was called roxane if not for the shape of her nose and mouth she might almost have passed for white the french in atlantis had mingled with their slaves for as long as theyd brought africans to this land victor wondered whether dark blaise knew some special sense of conquest lying with a woman so fair wonder or not he didnt ask if blaise wanted to talk about that he would if he didnt anything victor asked would be prying de la fayettes regulars skirmished with the redcoats and loyalists who blocked their way north they made little progress after a while victor said it might be better to pull away from the coast and try to slide around them doesnt look as though youre going to break through but will they not pull away with us to keep us from sliding around by the way the marquis echoed victors technical terms he found them picturesque patiendy victor answered you can use a screening force to harass the enemy and hold them in place while the rest of your army steals a march on them then your screeners follow along leaving the foe racing a fait accompli what an interesting notion what a brave notion de la fayette exclaimed he hesitated once more i am not sure how many of the local women will wish to accompany us on this journey or how many of their owners will allow them to do so cert la guerre victor said gravely true de la fayette sounded mournful but only for a moment it could be could it not that there will be other women in the interior of atlantis well so it could victor carefully didnt smile good we shall proceed then de la fayette declared proceed they did not only did they proceedthey thrived victor had seen enthusiastic foragers before his own atlanteans because of their sadly anemic supply train did a fine job of living off the countryside and that regardless of whether the countryside cared to be lived on but he soon had to own that his own countrymen couldnt match the french regulars for the thoroughness with which they stripped the landscape of everything even remotely edible worn dun rum blaise said perhaps surprised out of english at what the frenchmen could do not even locusts could empty things the way these men do they have locusts in the country you come from victor asked atlantis had a profusion of different kinds of grasshoppers great swarms of locusts such as those that devastated egypt in the bible when pharaoh hardened his heart were fortunately rare oh yes blaise replied they eat our crops and we roast them and eat them but they do more damage than avenging ourselves so makes up for victors stomach didnt turn over though plenty of atlanteans might have out in the woods hed sometimes got hungry enough to skewer atlantis big flightless katydids on a branch and toast them over a small fire they werent even bad so long as you didnt think about what you were eating he suspected more than a few of his soldiers had done the same on the march to new marseille the only trouble here was those big katydids were getting scarce in settled country dogs and cats devoured them without finicky human qualms while mice outbred them and outran them and scurried through the undergrowth in their place the marquis de la fayettes troops were relentless foragers of another sort too victor had never seen so many outraged fathers and husbands as congregated outside the marquis tent de la fayette at first seemed inclined to make light of it i lead soldiers not eunuchs he observed they are men it is war these things happen these things will always happen so long as men go to war were he merely defending a philosophical position he would have had a point rather more than abstract philosophy was at stake however nothing obliges folk here to remain on the atlantean assemblys side victor pointed out if your army makes people hate our cause they will turn to king george and england instead we dont want that you arent campaigning in enemy country you know what would you have me do monsieur de la fayette seemed genuinely perplexed next time you find someone who can point out a womans ravishers with certainty hang them victor said youre joking the marquis exclaimed not a bit of it radcliff answered i hanged a few of my men for crimes like that and i rarely have to worry about them any more but these are soldiers de la fayette said again let them find willing women victor said there are plenty if the people here decide your men act worse than the redcoats theyll shoot at us from behind trees and fences if your soldiers go behind some ferns to answer natures call theyll get knocked over the head theyll have their throats slit i shouldnt wonder if they dont get their ballocks cut off too barbarous de la fayette muttered well so it is but what would you call holding a woman down and forcing yourself on her victor returned half the ones who screech rape afterwards were happy enough while it was going on the french nobleman said it could be but so what that still leaves the other half victor said stubbornly your grace you have a problem here and you dont want to look at it but if you dont youll have a worse problem soon and so will the united states of atlantis i dont intend to let that happen do you presume to give me orders the marquis de la fayette inquired you travel with my army if you recall victor looked through him you travel in my country your grace if you recall de la fayette turned redand turned away victor wondered if hed pushed too hard he couldnt make the frenchman do anything no matter how much he wished he could three days later a girl was able to point out the four men whod taken turns with her what will you do about them she asked de la fayette the smirking soldiers hardly bothered to deny it their bravado turned to horror and disbelief when he ordered them hanged to encourage the others he said after the deed was done so he knew his voltaire too then he asked victor are you now satisfied that you are serious yes and your men will be too victor said and so it proved chapter blaise looked around so did victor radcliff there wasnt much to see ferns and evergreen trees and occasional bits of grass a landscape more nearly atlantean than european where the devil are we blaise asked and proceeded to answer his own question in the middle of nowhere thats where more like the edge of nowhere id say victor answered judiciously honh blaises voice might have served as an illustration for skepticism could voices only have been illustrated i wouldnt be surprised if we saw one of those honker birds like we caught over on the west side of the green ridge if they dont live in the middle of nowhere i dont know what does i should be surprised if we saw one victor said youre always surprised to see them on this side of the mountains im not sure how many are left here or if any are if any are theyd live in a place like this blaise insisted he paused struck by a new thought lot of meat on a honker bird that there is victor said as much as on a deer say i wouldnt mind seeing a deer in these parts either as if to underscore that his stomach rumbled the marquis de la fayettes frenchmen had indeed left the redcoats behind by marching into the interior of atlantis theyd also come perilously close to leaving human habitation behind as a result they were living off the countryside and the countryside had less to offer than victor would have wished things would have been worse were they englishmen or even troops from english atlantis being french they cheerfully gathered the fistsized snails in the woods and made tasty stews of the frogs and turtles they took from the streams they crossed and the ponds they skirted blaise ate such fare without complaint if with no great enthusiasm so did victor whod fed himself on similar victuals in his journeys through the atlantean wilderness but plenty of his countrymen would have turned up their noses till they got hungrier than this anyhow victor might have thought the marquis de la fayette would turn up his nose at a large snail broiled on a stick over a fire the french nobleman ate it with every sign of relish he also failed to falter at flapjackturtle stew to see what he would say victor remarked you can also eat the big green katydids that scurry through the leaves and rubbish on the ground is that a fact rather than disgusted the marquis sounded fascinated you will have done this for yourself i will have indeed victor answered if youre hungry enough youll eat anything you can get your hands on whereupon de la fayette caught a katydid and toasted it over the flames he chewed meditatively you have reason monsieur le general he said when hed finished they may be eaten and as you say hunger likely makes the best sauce no doubt victor answered eyeing the young frenchman was he even twentywith new respect well well blaise said that night as he and victor lay side by side rolled in blankets more to him than meets the eye there is victor agreed that well well secredy amused him his factotum was borrowing the phrase from his own way of speaking pretty soon well have to see how well the frenchmen can fight if they do it as well as they march no reason to worry about them i think they will do all right blaise said french people used me for a slave so i dont love them but in the last war no one ever said the soldiers from france couldnt fight they fought as well as the redcoats did but there were not enough of them to win true every word of it besides they would be embarrassed to fight badly when this bugeating marquis is watching them eh victor said blaise didnt answer a moment later a soft snore passed his lips a moment after that victor was snoring too naturally the marquis de la fayette called the river that divided what had been french and english atlantis the erdre that name had gone into french atlases since the fifteenth century coming from the other side of the border victor just as naturally thought of it as the stour thanks to the way the political winds blew the english name waxed while the french one waned not all the bridges over the river had been destroyed not all of them were even guarded the french army crossed into english atlantis without getting its feet wet and hurried northeast you see victor said to blaise a few days later wed gone farther west than this when we came north with those two copperskins all those years ago i wonder what ever happened to them i suppose they went west over sea to terranova the way they wanted to that was the middle of nowhere blaise would quibble with anyone no that was the end of nowhereand the wrong end too well maybe youve got something there victor admitted remembering the swamps theyd splashed through on the way up to the stour he changed the subject and lowered his voice at the same time what do you think of our french general now also quiedy blaise answered i wonder what hell be like when he grows up victor laughed loud enough to make de la fayette glance his way with a raised eyebrow victor looked back as imperturbably as he could eventually seeing that he wouldnt get an explanation de la fayette gave it up as a bad job victor wasnt sure just how fluent in english he was but suspected he understood more than he let on you are a rascal he said to blaise me the negro shook his head you must be thinking of someone else general victor laughed again not so raucously this time the marquis eyed him once more but soon shrugged and went back to talking with his own officers i wonder what baron von steuben will make of him by now victor took the german soldiers pretensions to nobility for granted so did blaise who asked which is higher a baron or a marquis a baron noa marquis i think im not sure victor scowled no one has much use for fancy titles of nobility in atlantis there are a few knights heremen youre supposed to call sirand maybe a baron or two but not many if we win the war if we cast off king georges rule i dont believe we shall have any nobles left at all everyone will be the same at least in law everyone white blaise said pointedly everyone free victor corrected or what would you be doing with those stripes on your sleeve blaise grunted acknowledging the point without wholly conceding it can this work with everyone the same even in my tribe back in africaother tribes toowe have the chief and other men you have to respect because of who they are how do you say that in english nobles victor suggested maybe blaise didnt seem happy with the way the word tasted not the same i dont think but we have those folk and then we have the ordinary people too law not the same for chief and respectable people no he didnt like noblesand ordinary folk chief makes law how can it stick on him well king louis of france would say the same thing victor answered so would king george even if parliament told him he didnt know what he was talking about how will it work withouta king or nobles i dont know it seemed to go all right in athens in ancient days and in rome ancient days blaise muttered to himself idea seems silly to me you win this war against england you should be king of atlantis that thought had crossed victors mind once or twice who could stop him if he decided to put a crown on his head after he won this war who would want to stop him not many people he could in fact think of only one i dont want to be king of atlantis blaise why not the negro eyed him in honest perplexity what could be better then i would be one of the kingswhat do you saythe kings ministers thats it you would be very rich and i would be rich enough margaret would be queen of atlantis and stella her uh ladyinwaiting why fight to take down one king if all you do is set up another one in his place victor returned why before he could go on one of the few french horsemen galloped back toward the head of the marquis de la fayettes column soldiers english soldiers he shouted english soldiers at the bridge over the brede what the devil are they doing there victor wondered but the question answered itself if the redcoats knew the french army was on its way of course they would do what they could to slow it down shall we dislodge them de la fayette asked gaily wed better if we aim to get up toward hanover victor answered then let us be about it the marquis started shouting orders like the english like the atlanteans the french used bugles and fifes and drums to maneuver their soldiers their calls were different though and more musical at least to victors ears the troopers in their bluejackets moved into line of battle as smoothly as redcoats might have done no more than a platoon of english soldiers guarded the bridge they had one field gun a little threepounder surrender victor shouted to them you havent a prayer of holding us off be damned to you sir the youngster in charge of them shouted backhe had to be around de la fayettes age come and get us be careful what you ask for son victor said not unkindly someone may give it to you i am no son of a rebel dog nor son of a foul frenchman neither the redcoat shook his fist at victor at the marquis de la fayette and at the soldiers deploying behind the marquis come on then if youve got the stomach for it what does he say de la fayette asked as victor rode back to the french army he defies us victor whistled sourly that didnt seem strong enough he casts his defiance in our teeth he is brave the marquis paused for a moment it could be that he is also a fool he seems quite young of his own age de la fayette said not a word methodically the french troops advanced to the attack the englishmens fieldpiece boomed its balla plaything to look at knocked over four frenchmen one got up again one never would the cries from the other two filled the air just before the french opened up on them the redcoats fired a volley more men in blue fell the french returned fire several englishmen went down the others retreated to the north bank of the brede hauling their popgun after them rush the bridge victor urged theyre going to burn it or blow it up de la fayette shouted the order the frenchmen broke ranks and surged forward at a run a couple of them were on the bridge when the powder charge under it went off timbers flew every which way one of them speared the leading french soldier he screamed like a damned soul as he toppled the blast flung the other frenchman on the bridge into the brede he half swam half splashed back to the south bank of the river the charge blew a fifteenfoot hole in the bridge too far for any soldier to hope to jump with a mocking salute the junior english officer led his surviving men off to the east damn him blaise said quietly victor radcliff nodded he did everything a man in his place could hope to doand rather more besides i should say he shall not delay us long despite his arrogance de la fayette said sure enough french military engineerspioneers they called themwere making for the nearest trees they would have the bridge repaired soon enough a few hours a day at the most all the same the redcoats were costing them that time a platoon facing an army couldnt do much better hello general the atlantean courier touched a finger to his hat in a not very military salute good to see you again damned if it aint how did you find me thereve been times lately when i wasnt sure old scratch knew where i was let alone anybody else victor said you ask me it aint so bad if the devil dont know where youre at the courier replied and victor could hardly disagree the leathery horseman went on devil or not general theres ways he laid a finger by the side of his nose and didnt elaborate not quite idle curiosity prompted victor to ask have any of those ways got to do with a foulmouthed little head louse of an english lieutenant the couriers mouth fell open displaying discolored teeth and a cud of pipeweed the man spat brown before asking how in blazes did you know that blazes or not theres ways victor answered blandly well hes been bragging to all and sundry in bredestown how he slaughtered ten thousand frenchies singlehanded out in the wildernesssomething like that anyways the courier said figures thered be some frenchies left over dont it figures youd be with em if there was dont it tracked them down tracked you down he let fly with another brown stream had he seemed even a little more impressed with himself victor radcliff would have felt the urge to take him down a peg as things were victor only said tell me at oncedo we yet hold hanover that we do ive got letters telling you this and that but theres the nub that we do the courier shifted his quid from one cheek to the other as if reminded of something he added oh and ive got letters for you from honkers mill too do you now victor could hear how toneless his voice went and whats the latest from the atlantean assembly he wondered whether he really wanted to know some old jew gave em a nice stack of coin so they arent quite so flat as they have been lately the man said would that be master benveniste he has always been generous in supporting the cause of freedom victor said some old jew the courier repeated his voice reflected absolute indifference to the jews identity theyre all a stack of christkillers anyways ought to chase em out of atlantis for good once we win but take their money in the meantime victor enquired dryly well sure got to squeeze some use out of em your charity does you credit radcliff hadnt thought he could get drier yet but he managed much obliged general the courier recognized no irony he handed victor the letters gave him a smarter salute than he had on first coming up and then rode away what is one to do with such a fellow victor cried throwing his hands in the air the united states of atlantis shall have freedom for those who confess any religioneven for those who confess none by god so long as their skins be not too dark blaise remarked it is not the same thing victor said i am not surprised a white man would say it was not the negro answered if copperskins ruled the seas and held your folk in bondage to grow their sugar and dyestuffs you would sing a different tune and if black men did well you would not fancy that very much either i think settlements make those arrangements for themselvesstates i should say victor replied if you tell me you are one whit less free than i i shall call you a liar to your face but you did not have to run away to make yourself free whilst i did you did not have to abscond with yourself so to speak blaise said down in the french settlements i am still a wanted manfor stealing me we are both wanted men all over atlantis and for a crime worse than theft victor knew he was deliberately trying to turn the subject hed gone round the barn with blaise a great many times on this but hed seldom felt the negro chasing him quite so closely blaise unfortunately also knew he was turning the subject so the united states of atlantis can decide that anyone gets to pray to god any which way but each settlement gets to pick who is free and who gets sold well well slaveowners from the settlements in southern atlantis might be persuaded to put up with papists for those who were protestant or protestants for those who followed rome or possibly even jews and some jews owned slaves too they might even tolerate freethinkers so long as the men who thought freely didnt publish in the same way and maybe sending thomas paine to terranova would end up helping him stay safe that slaveowners who made money from their twolegged chattels would ever tolerate equality with negroes or copperskins struck victor as most unlikely blaise tried a different gibe you dont hate negroes enough to keep from lying down with a slave wench suppose you got her with child would you sell your son for profit some men who own slaves do that you know it isnt likely victor said uneasily but the issue of my issue does not arise louise is not my slave i have no slaves you know that too he thought blaise would yield that point but his factotum did not is it not so that every white atlantean has slaves if any white atlantean has slaves you go along with it he shook his head there is a better word after a moments thought victor suggested condone yes thank you that is what i wanted you condone it why do you say every white atlantean i did not see you too proud to lie down with a slave either maybe you made her belly bulge i hope not i shot my seed on it whenever i could but blaise looked embarrassed not every white atlantean then every free atlantean every free atlantean condones having slaves if any free atlantean has slaves and this for the proclamation of liberty he snapped his fingers we do what we can we are not perfect i did not say we were nor would i ever victor said but we are or we try to be on the side of the angels we have a ways to go we are men i dont shit ambrosia as i have reason to know victor wrinkled his nose let us first get free of england and we can start to see how to get free of one another blaise finished for him that is not what i was going to say well it had better be true anyhow if we do not get free of one another what point to it that we got free of england king george should not be my master maybe but i do not see that any other man should be either victor radcliff laughed blaise glared at him till he explained tan my hide for shoe leather if you do not sound like every other free atlantean ever born be he white or black or copperyor green come to that mm it could be but after a moment blaise shook his head nosay i sound like every other man ever born do you think ever a man came into the world looking for a master i do not know the answer to that nor do you victor said had you no slaves in your african jungles across the sea we had them blaise admitted but what we call slavery and what you call slavery are not the same thing even if they carry the same name in our land all the slaves are like what you call house slaves here no field handsno work out there under the lash if you slack off and the other difference is here you can mostly tell a slave by looking at him not so in my land victor thought about that he found himself nodding south of the stour a black man or a copperskin was far more likely than not to belong to a white man in a country where all the faces were black that must make runaways harder to catch he remarked not so many of them there blaise said maybe it is harder for a man who is a master to be rough on a slave who looks like him even your jesus looks like you he does not look like me when you got right down to it jesus probably looked like some modem mahometan he came from palestine after all and he was a jew but european painters portrayed him as looking like themselves they passed that image on to the negro slaves they converted to christianity victor hadnt thought about what a potent spiritual weapon a white christ might be but that wasnt the point so you have masters there too he asked that was reluctantly blaise nodded we have them you never thought it was wrong and unnatural i never was a slave before you seeif someone buys and sells you wont you think it wrong and unnatural i daresay i should but suppose you never got caught and sold suppose you grew to be a rich man in your own country would you not have slaves of your own now would you not be as contented a slaveowner as any white man in the old french setdements or down in spanish atlantis this time blaise did not answer for some little while at last his face troubled he nodded again maybe i would you ask nasty questionsdo you know that no doubt people had said the same thing about socrates in athens long ago hed ended up drinking hemlock because of it toosomething modern gadflies sometimes tried to forget i will tell you something blaise victor said so do you the french regulars showed no more love for the interior of atlantis than the redcoats ever had it is unfairly difficult to subsist an army here in such an empty land the marquis de la fayettecomplained not always easy true victor radcliff answered a honkersized understatement if ever there was one as he had a while before he thanked heaven the french soldiers ate anything that didnt eat them first that helped keep them fed but you could gather up only so many frogs and turtles and snails and wingless katydids the french regulars found them better than tolerable especially with a dash of garlic and there wasnt any bread to gather up away from farms nor even fruits and nuts some atlantean ferns had parts you could eat fiddleheads country folk called them even so we need to get into more settled country victor added i should say we do the marquis crooked grin seemed all the more surprising on the face of a man so young otherwise we shall be no more than wraiths by the time we have to fight the english in one way that might aid us eh it could be that bullets pass through wraiths without doing harm but i do not believe our soldiers would appreciate the diminution of their corporeal frames even so eryes victor didnt know how to take that he realized it was a joke and chuckled to show he did he didnt want de la fayette to think him nothing but an ignorant backwoodsman but it was perhaps the most elaborately phrased joke hed ever heard it might have seemed much funnier in a paris drawing room than it did in this sparsely settled stretch of atlantis that very afternoon one of the handful of french mounted scouts rode back to the main body of de la fayettes troops in high excitement beeves he cried wonderful beeves they werent wonderful beeves or they wouldnt have been to men not staring hunger in the face they were ordinary cattle distinctly on the scrawny side in fact and of no particular breeding the same description applied to the two men who kept an eye on them as they grazed in the meadow no wolves in atlantis no bears no lions but french regulars could be even more ravenous the herdsmen stared at them in bleak dismay is it that they hope to be paid de la fayette asked victor i dont know how happy even that will make them radcliff replied atlantean papers gone up some since france came in on our side but wed have to give them a bushel basket full of it before they got their moneys worth paper the marquis sniffed then he shouted for the army paymaster that worthy repaired to one of his wagons de la fayette waved to the herdsmen summoning them into his presence they came apprehensively the paymaster a sour look on his face gave them three small gold coins each the herdsmen stared as if they could hardly believe their eyes victor knew he could hardly believe his it is good de la fayette asked in accented but understandable english its mighty goddamn good your honor one of the herdsmen blurted the other man startled past speech nodded dumbly havent seen so much specie in a devil of a long time blaise said in a low voice nor have i victor whispered back he had to gather himself before he could speak to de la fayette your king provided for you lavishly i will have need to pay the soldiers i will have need to purchase victuals as now the french commander said shrugging and so his majesty has made it possible for me to do these things so he has victor radcliff agreed tonelessly the atlantean assembly had made it possible for him to do those things too the only trouble was the assembly hadnt made it possible for him to do those things very well france was rich populous and efficientlymany would say tyrannicallytaxed the united states of atlantis were none of those things here in this meadow victor got his nose rubbed in the difference french army cooks proved to roast beef in much the same fashion as their atlantean counterparts it was charred black on the outside as near raw as made no difference on the inside along with garlicwhich victor didnt much fancythe french cooks had salt to add to the meats savor which atlanteans might well not have is this from the salt pans of brittany victor asked de la fayette looked at him as if hed started using blaises language i have no idea he asked some of the cooks when they told him it was he sent victor a curious look now haw would you have guessed that well my ancestor edward radcliffe was in brittany buying salt when francois kersauzon sold him the secret of the way to atlantis for a third of his catch victor said kersauzon found it first but radcliffe settled first atlantis sold for salt fish the marquis de la fayette sighed gustily france has had many long years to repent of that bargain if youd asked kersauzon he would have told you he was a breton not a frenchman victor said still a tewnot many any more but a fewin french atlantis who remember the difference even now i saw as much in cosquer they are fools but england has those too nestce pas welshmen who cling to wales and the like de la fayette said have they no settlements of their own in atlantis a few small ones no big ones i know of victor said the marquis raised an eyebrow at the qualification victor explained west of the mountains plenty goes on that people on our side on the longsettled side dont find out about till later if we ever find out at all how charming de la fayette exclaimed which was hardly the word victor would have used something in his expression must have given him away for the young frenchman quickly went on in my country there is no room for villages full of mystery villages of which the king and his servants know nothing i see victor said and he supposed he did in atlantis there is still room for people who want to be left alone yes he wasnt so sure that was charming some of the people who wanted to be left alone werent far removed from maniacs others were just robbers and runaways who had excellent reasons to want to remain undiscovered but de la fayette said this is the liberty i am proud to assist the liberty to be oneself that night blaise softly asked well who else can you be but yourself i dont know victor replied you have to admit though it sounds a lot better in french as they came up from the southwest victor realized they werent more than a couple of days travel from hooville he shook his head in bemused wonder hed stopped in the little town on his way to hanover when the fight against england was just on the point of breaking loose and if they were only a couple of days away from hooville they were only three days from his own farm he said not a word about that he didnt ride away to visit meg blaise didnt go off to see stella either the french might have followed them a visit from the allies officers would have been tolerable a visit from the whole french army no victor knew too well what happened to countryside with soldiers on it hed ordered his men to subsist themselves on the countryside often enough he didnt want to watch his own land stripped bare by locusts in blue jackets instead the french troops foraged south of hooville that was unfortunate victor had spent a lot of years building up his own land having it plundered even by friends would have felt catastrophic somewhere east of hooville victor told the marquis de la fayette the english will wait for us in force so i should think yes the nobleman said that is also the direction in which hanover lies is it not so hanover and the main atlantean army it is victor said we ought to join forces with them if we can and even if we cant i ought to go back and take charge of them again ive been away longer than i thought i would de la fayette thought for a moment and you would perhaps wish my force to make a demonstration to allow you to slip past the english lines that would be excellent merci beauamp victor said the frenchman might or might not be able to lead men in the field on that victor as yet held no strong opinion either way but de la fayette was not without strategic insight maybe he really would make an officer english cavalrymenactually riders from a loyalist troop perhaps even habakkuk biddiscombes horsed legioncollided with the french scouts about halfway between hooville and hanover between noplace and someplace as blaise elegantly put it they pushed the outnumbered french horsemen back on de la fayettes main body french field guns boomed a roundshot felled an enemy riders mount as if it were a redwood from several hundred yards away victor couldnt make out what happened to the man whose nag so abruptly departed this world french foot soldiers in loose orderskirmishersadvanced on the enemy cavalry the loyalists with carbines banged away at the frenchmen they had their own field gun it unlimbered and fired a couple of shots then sedately as if to say they had a luncheon appointment somewhere else and werent withdrawing in the face of superior forces the loyalists wheeled their horses and rode away they performed tolerably well no great discipline perhaps but they are well mounted and brave de la fayette spoke in the clinical tones of a doctor assessing a case of smallpox oh no denying theyre brave victor said i only wish they werent or that they were brave in a better cause no doubt they feel the same about your men de la fayette observed no doubt victor said or they had better at any rate if the english werent worried about us they wouldnt have to recruit these salauds that wasnt fair and he knew it the loyalists werentor most of them werentmen who deserved to be sworn at they were only men who had different notions of how atlantis should be ruled not men who deserved to be sworn at no just men who needed to be killed well one or two of them had died here along with one or two frenchmen the foot soldiers came up to the horse the cannon ball had killed they butchered it with as much enthusiasm as if it had been a cow victor had eaten all sorts of strange meats but he didnt remember ever eating horse before it wasnt bad a little chewya little gluey as a matter of fact and a little gamy but not bad the frenchmen seemed to find it delicious victor wouldnt have gone that far neither would blaise but he said a bellyful of horse is a lot better than a bellyful of nothing isnt it just victor replied the french went on skirmishing with loyalists after the cavalrymen reported their position loyalist foot soldiers harried them from behind trees and rocks as victors men had harried the redcoats but the french were less rigid than the english and quick to fight back the same way the loyalists melted away before them victor waited for general cornwallis to commit his own troops against the french when the english commander did victor took his leave of de la fayette saying i hope we shall meet again i expect we shall and with luck the meeting will not be long delayed may it be so de la fayette said we will keep them busy here they will never think to look for you as you fare east good fortune go with you to help good fortune along victor and blaise split up as theyd done more than once before they were known to travel together so each of them headed toward hanover alone chapter halt the sentry shouted who comes victor radcliff reined in answering that question was always interestingand sometimes much too interesting he thought the man had an atlantean accent even if he turned out to be right it might not do him any good loyalist positions werent likely so close to hanover but they werent impossible either i am a friend he answered carefully no doubt but whose the sentry said advancing with purposeful strides are you the atlantean assemblys friend or king georges in times like these you cannot be friend to both how right he was and damn him he gave no clue as to whose friend he was an answer he misliked and he would shoot and he was too close to be likely to miss even with a smoothbore musket i am the atlantean assemblys friend victors hand moved stealthily toward his pistol if he had to fight for his life he would but the sentrywhose clothes rough homespun of linen and wool also refused to declare his allegiancedidnt fire right away and which friend of the atlantean assembly are you he demanded had the english or the loyalists captured blaise had fire and sharp metal torn from him word that victor was also bound for hanover if they had the sentry was just waiting to be sure before he killed sometimes a man had to roll the dice i am victor radcliff victor said he couldhe hoped he couldmake sure the enemy didnt take him alive you are the sentry said well how do i know youre him and not some braggart with more mouth than brains take me into hanover victor replied if they decide i am an impostor there they will assuredly hang me for my presumption and you may have the pleasure of watching me dance on air after thinking that through the sentry nodded id have to be dumb as a honker to tell you no he said that would not stop nor even slow a great many men i have met victor said i do believe it the sentry raised his voice abraham calvin one of you come down i got to go into town i do a man did appear from an ambush position victor decided he was lucky they were on his side he would not have had much luck assailing the one fellow who showed himself not when the sentry had friends the soldierhe called himself jeremiahdid not have a horse he walked toward hanover beside victor and didnt complain about it got to make these boots fit my feet a little better anyways he said very fine boots victor saidand so they were but they werent perfecdy new so he added how did you come by them bushwhacked a redcoat jeremiah said matteroffactly he was a bigger fellow than i am i reckoned i could stuff the boots with rags if i had to but it turned out our feet were just about the same size good for you victor said a couple of miles farther east another sentry challenged victor and jeremiah this one stood by an earthwork not far from the unionjackandredcrestedeagle flag the united states of atlantis were using victor proclaimed himself with more confidence this time the new sentry said well hatch me from a honkers egg if you aint welcome back general that satisfied jeremiahs curiosity once and for all since you are who you say you are im back to my friends away he went never once thinking he ought to wait for a generals permission he was an atlantean all right hanover looked much the same as it had when victor left it more shops stood empty than he would have liked forts made the royal navy think twice about drawing near enough to bombard the city but the english warships stifled seagoing commerce even salt cod was in short supply and expensive in speciefar worse in atlantean paper and when the coast of english atlantis ran low on salt cod the end of the world or something even worse lay around the next corner victor found that blaise had got into town a day ahead of him that usually happened when they didnt travel together victor had to be circumspect and careful blaise didnt as long as he wasnt in a land where he had to worry about being reenslaved not many people paid much attention to a shabby negro riding along by himself oh yes the redcoats stopped me once he said i played dumb they let me go after a while some of them tried scrubbing my arm to see if the color came off he laughed at their ignorance now we have to see how we go about smashing cornwallis between our men and de la fayettes victor said that will be goodif we can do it blaise said yes that will be very fineif we can bring it off his mixture of hope and doubt seemed almost biblical in its cadences victor was glad hed found a certain scrap of paper in his pocket what we ought to do next he said is to get some pigeons into de la fayettes hands he has plenty of food for now blaise caught himself and also caught victors drift ohyou mean the messenger birds thats just what i mean victor agreed then we can speak back and forth with him without risking human messengers the english are also less likely to learn what we say to each other if we use pigeons in place of men i do like the idea blaise said to set words on the wings of the wind we use drums in africa to pass news from one village to another but anyone can hear a drum and know what it means the birds are a better answer then admiration seemed to curdle into anger for he added one more thing you white men thought of that we did not well were going to use it against other white men victor said blaise might not even have heard him when i saw the ship that would bring me here it was so big and had all the sails and all the ropesthe riggingand it was like nothing my folk could have built and then they chained me in the hold and now i know what hell and damnation are like victor had never gone aboard a blackbirderan innocentsounding name for a slave ship if ever there was one but he had been in cosquer harbor when one tied up there the stink coming from the slaver was enough to knock a man off his feet even a furlong or two downwind to cross the ocean in the middle of that stench in chains on short rations victor was glad hed been born a white man and an atlantean but blaise hadnt finished when i came on shore at last all wobbly and thin and sick almost the first thing i saw was a horse pulling a man in a twowheeled carriage and the first thing that went through my head was what a good idea why didnt we think of mat have you horses victor asked no they sicken and die the negro answered white men try to use them in my country now and then but they never last long have you wheeled carriages for childrens toys not for carts and carriages and wagons and guns without horses without oxen we have no beasts to pull them blaise grinned crookedly and i know your next question we also have not the proper roads only tracks for people on foot so what good would the fine carriage be in africa but it was so clever one of these days i hope the world will say the same about the united states of atlantis victor said and i hope that what we do in atlantis will speak even in africa maybe soif it speaks of freeing slaves instead of buying and selling them blaise said and the old argument began again in days gone by avalons pirates had pioneered the practice of posting by pigeon red rodney radcliffe and the other freebooters lost regardless but the lesson of what theyd done unlike so many did not go to waste atlantis had been a pigeon fanciers paradise ever since finding out where de la fayette and the french were came first the atlanteans needed pigeons that homed for some nearby village they also needed to provide the marquis with birds that would return to hanover once those things were done the two separated forces could easily and quickly talk back and forth all that proved harder than victor radcliff had dreamt it would the english unfortunately had understood atlantean predilections while they held hanover theyd harassed and hunted anyone who raised homing pigeons theyd taken birds and theyd killed birds too several breeders passed more time than theyd wanted in close confinement didnt anyone keep a flock intact victor cried in dismay no in something not far from despair one of the pigeon fanciers said wasnt easy general by my hope of heaven it wasnt possiblenever mind easy too many folk loyal to king george in town someone who knew you had birds would run to the redcoats and then itd be all up with you out in the countryside there are still birds that will home for hanover hardly any left here to the little towns to a hanover man any town but his own was a little town some hanover men would likely call london a little town but that was the least of victors worries he let out a heartfelt sigh well not every plan works the way you wish it would when you put it together runners then blaise asked runners victor agreed and wished he didnt have to he also wished he would have arranged a code with the marquis de la fayette before separating from him then they would have had a chance to communicate without letting the english understand what they intended even if cornwallis soldiers captured a messenger it would have been a good idea had he thought of it sooner of course many things would have been good ideas had one thought of them sooner he had to explain the idea of codes to blaise then he had to explain the explanation blaise could read and write but hed come late to both arts the vagaries of english spelling still bemused himwhen they didnt enrage him you scramble up the words even worse than they are already nobody never read them after that he said in dismay grammar deserted him but not sincerity we scramble them in a fashion upon which we have agreed in advance victor said that way they easily may be unscrambled once more easily i think not blaise said and maybe he wasnt so far wrong victors men did everything they could to strengthen the works protecting hanovers harbors he didnt know where the royal navy had goneinto terranovan waters to fight the new uprising there or off into the eastern atlantic to find and fight the french fleetbut he didnt want ships of the line unexpectedly returning and cannonading the city he had to be able to give them the warmest reception he could in due course one of his messengers returned with a letter from the marquis de la fayette the fellow also displayed a tricorn with a bullet hole clean through the crown good thing its a trifle small and sits high on my head he told victor otherwise youd be a long time waiting for that there paper well micah i am glad you came back imperforate victor replied easier to get a new hat than a new messenger any day of the week and that is a fact prices what they are nowadays though i reckon you can get yourself a messenger cheaper micah said unless youve got specie in your pocket anyway a man with speciehe sighed wistfullyhe can do anything near enough sure aint got my hands on any for a long time victor maintained what he hoped was a prudent silence the merchants and shopkeepers and taverners of hanover discounted the atlantean assemblys paper no less steeply than anyone else if anything the assemblys paper was worth less here than elsewhere in atlantis having lain under english occupation for so long hanover was used to the sweet clink of silver and gold men with nothing but paper to spend had to spend a lot of it maybe you could do something about it micah said hopefully shoot people who wont take paper at facesomething like that anyhow youre the general after all maybe victor knew the messenger sadly overestimated his power the first merchant he shot for not overvaluing the atlantean assemblys paper would hurl all the others headlong into the loyalist camp if that didnt lose the assembly the war nothing would you simply could not ask a man to cheat himself not even in the cause of liberty what does the frenchie say micah asked seeing he wouldnt get victor to start executing tradesmen with a practiced thumb victor popped the wax seal off the letter with his other thumb just as practiced he ordered micah from the room the messenger muttered as he left but leave he did he must have had a pretty good notion that victor wouldnt tell him what de la fayette had written still even if the general commanding hadnt he might have how were you worse off for trying the marquis spoke in a straightforward fashion he wrote a much more flowery french one that showed off his learning victor could make sense of it which was all that mattered and hav ing read through the letter he found that de la fayette made good sense even if the nobleman used twice as many words to make it as he might have de la fayette proposed a joint attack against cornwallis men two weeks hence the aim being to push the redcoats away from hanover and up toward croydon if the foe can be trapped in croydon and defeated there the whole of the coastal region from hanover normwards shall be cleansed he wrote should this be accomplished how shall england continue to maintain that she governs atlantis surely it would be the veriest impossibility surely victor said aloud did that mean england wouldnt keep trying to maintain it could the enemy be pinned in croydon and cleansed to use the young frenchmans word another good question victor read the letter again slowly he nodded to himself worth a try he spent a pile of paper and even some precious specie readying the army to move as hed thought the sight of silver spurred hanovers merchants and artisans to far greater exertions than did the atlantean assemblys notes pretty soon youll need to bring me a wheelbarrowful of paper to get yourself a wheelbarrowful of hardtack a prominent baker told victor things arent so bad as that protested victor who knew exactly how bad things werehe watched the exchange rate like a redcrested eagle didnt saw now said pretty soon the baker replied nowadays your barrow of paperll buy you three barrows of hiscuit easy he still stretched things but by less than victor wished he would have atlantean cavalry patrols ranged north and south of hanover they brought back several menand one womanwhod tried to abscond with word for general cornwallis one of the men had a better written summary of the atlantean armys plans than victor had prepared for himself where did you come by this victor demanded wondering if his officers included another budding biddiscombe made it up myself the captured spy said not without pride asked around a little here a little there put the pieces together and that there was what i got you do know what youll get now victor asked reckon i do the man shrugged he was giving a good game show of not showing fear chance you take isnt it it is victor agreed you took it and you lost he watched the spy hanged the next day the fellow went up the stairs to the top of the gallows under his own power more than a few men about to die needed help on their last journey jeering patriots cursed him as he climbed his face was pale but he had the spirit to nod back to them the hangman tied his legs together hooded him and put the rope around his neck the trap dropped a snap said the noose broke the spys neck he got a quick death then and an easy one as such things went victor wondered how much that meant and whether it meant anything had the riders caught all the loyalists slipping out of hanover was some other man even now giving an english officer word as detailed as this dead spy would have brought or were several others passing on smaller pieces of the puzzle pieces an intelligent enemy could fit together into a pattern that showed the truth it struck the commanding general as only too likely hed done what he could do though he had to hope it would prove enough one way to make it enough would have been to move out sooner than hed planned and catch the english by surprise had he been operating alone he would have done just that but he had to take his allies into account moving out before the date agreed to with de la fayette would also have caught the french by surprise since the whole point of this scheme was to catch the redcoats between the two armies he couldnt afford to strike precipitately a fishing smack coming up the coast from cosquer brought him a letter as far as he knew hed never heard of monsieur marcel freycinet who inscribed his name on the outside of the letter puzzled victor broke the seal and unfolded the sheet of paper monsieur freycinet it turned out was grateful to him as victor read on he decided he would much rather not have had the other mans gratitude if he did have to have it he would much rather not have known he had it freycinet turned out to be the planter who owned louise whose embraces victor had so enjoyed when he was first making the marquis de la fayettes acquaintance and not only had he enjoyed them it seemed louise was with child and confidently asserted that victor was the father victor could hardly call her a liar if he hadnt fathered a child on her it wasnt for lack of effort here was blaises query come back to haunt him the situation was impossible it was impossible in fact in several different ways one reason freycinet was grateful was that the baby which would of course be a slave like its mother would provide pure profit for him imagining a son of his on the auction block made victor feel he was bathing in hellfire he couldnt very well claim the baby for his own though the mere thought of the scandal made him flinch and the scandal wasnt the worstfar from it how would meg feel if he did such a thing he thought of the three young children theyd buried together if he produced an heir of his flesh but produced that heir from a comely negress the humiliation wouldnt kill his wife but it would kill everything the two of them had together when louise opened her legs for him hed never dreamt there might be issue from their joining he wondered why not he didnt wonder long hed cared about his own pleasure his own satiation and very little else but a woman who lay down with a man could get up with child it happened all the time if it didnt there would be no more men and women it happened all the time yes why did it have to happen this time in particular in spite of everything victor laughed at himself how many men had said that before him any man whod ever had it happen when he lay down with a woman not his wife and that was just for starters what was he going to do what am i going to do he asked out loud no answer came to him from the empty air the only folk who found answers there were prophets and madmen if he was going to come up with any answers hed have to find theminside himself he couldnt even go talk with monsieur freycinet and see if they could hash out something no hed have to do it by letter travel back and forth would make the conversation long and slow and if freycinet proved no gentleman he could publish victors letters to the world that would embarrass not only victor personally but also the atlantean cause well no help for it even more reluctandy than if he were visiting a dentist victor inked a pen he did the best he could offering to buy louise and set her free in whichever northern state she preferred after a little more thought he added in the price the childhis childwould likely bring he could afford it he thought he could anyhow meg would surely notice the hole this price made in their accounts but what could you do hed worry about that when it happened this had already happened hed never sealed a letter with such care the last thing he wanted was for anyone even blaise to find out about this the sealed sheet headed south aboard the first ship bound from hanover to cosquer long before victor could hope for a responselong before that ship could possibly have got to cosquerhe had to lead the atlantean army out against the redcoats the chance of dying in battle had never looked so attractive before redwood hill remained in atlantean hands victor took the atlanteans out into open country just south of it then swung northwest toward the closest english positions after he first couple of days in the field thoughts of louiseand of marcel freycinet didnt fill his every waking moment he had other things to worry about messengers from the marquis de la fayette told him the french regulars were moving too maybe cornwallis captured some of the marquis messengers maybe his loyalist auxiliaries kept him well informed about what his opponents were up to or maybe he simply had a good sense of what he would have done were he commanding them he maneuvered skillfully doing everything he could to keep them from joining forces de la fayette pressed hard from the west victor pressed not quite so hard from the east victor still worried about protecting hanover in case things went wrong de la fayette didnt care about such things so much even more than cornwallis he enjoyed the advantage of fighting on territory not his own he could afford to be more aggressive than either his foe or his ally and of course he was so very youngheadlong attack came naturally to him it worked too as the french and atlanteans pushed towards each other cornwallis finally had to draw back toward the north to keep from getting pounded between them victors soldiers finally got to meet the men whod crossed the atlantic to aid them against king george and de la fayettes soldiers got their first look at the army of the atlantean assembly after hard marching and fighting the french werent so elegant as they had been when they first landed in atlantis their uniforms were patched and torn and faded but they still marched like men who owned the worldand even if they hadnt like men whod invented closeorder drill thesethese iss soldiers baron von steuben cried as de la fayettes men approached he might not be grammatical but he meant every bit of it looking at the ranks of his own army victor knew them for soldiers too they werent so perfect on the parade ground as the french regulars but they marched well their accouterments were far more uniform than they had been when the fight against england commenced bayonets tipped most atlantean muskets and the men had the look of veterans they were veterans they eyed their french allies with undoubted respect but with nothing resembling awe by now they had the redcoats measure and if they could stand against english regulars why shouldnt they be able to stand alongside the men from france the marquis de la fayette rode forward to greet victor as he drew near the atlanteans smartly presented arms he did the best thing he might have done he saluted them three cheers for the frenchie a delighted sergeant cried and the cheers rang out one after another de la fayette doffed his hat he saluted victor radcliff who gravely returned the courtesy these men are more ah presentable than i was led to expect the nobleman said this is not terranova we are not savages in breechclouts and feathers we do not carry bows and arrows or hatchets with stone heads victor replied with as much dignity as he could muster our troops can give a good account of themselves against a like number of european soldiers we have given a good account of ourselves against like numbers of english redcoats i beg you to accept my apology monsieur le general if i offended i assure you it was unintentional de la fayette said i knew your men could fight before i sailed from france he and victor had been speaking french victor was far more fluent in it than de la fayette was in english now victor loudly translated the french noblemans comment for the benefit of the atlantean soldiers they cheered de la fayette again grinning in pleasure unashamed the marquis said i had not finished i knew they could fight yes but i had not expected them to present so pleasing an aspect to the eye more than one european monarch would be delighted to have troops of such an excellent appearance under his command victor translated for his men once more the marquis de la fayette won yet another cheer victor radcliff wagged a finger at him i think youre trying to seduce these good fellows away from the proclamation of liberty and make them love kings and nobles again he was joking de la fayette had to know it all the same the young frenchman made as if to push away his words never would i do such a thing never he exclaimed i told you my view of this soon after we met the proclamation of liberty is a shining beacon in the history of the world and i think its flame willand shouldspread far and wide from atlantis its already spread across the hesperian gulf to the english settlements in terranova victor said truly thomas paine was worth his weight in goldno small praise in the speciestarved united states of atlantis i understand that yes but these settlements are only a small thing de la fayette said theyand their importance to atlantis didnt seem small to victor before he could say so the marquis went on i expect the ideals of the proclamation of liberty to kindle the kingdoms of europe before many years go by monsieur le general and not europe alone it could be like our lord the proclamation of liberty speaks to all mankind in a voice that cannot be ignored one day its words will be heard by the ottoman turks by the persians by the chinese and even by the hermit kingdom of japan well victor said in astonishment not even paine had ever made such claims victor bowed in the saddle to de la fayette you are the most republican noble i ever imagined you do me great honor by saying so the marquis answered that is perhaps one reason his majesty chose me to command this army he knew me to be more than sympathetic to your cause and he may have judged it safer for the monarchy in france to send me across the ocean i see victor said slowly so king louis was trying to solve his own problems as well as atlantis was he from things victor had heard he wouldnt have judged the king of france to be so clever maybe louis wasnt so long as one of his ministers was what difference did it make de la fayette perfectly understood his hesitation have no fear my friend the frenchman said my country will not stint nor scant my soldiers because i am not in the best of odors at versailles remembering how lavishly the french had already provided for their overseas army victor radcliff decided he believed de la fayette good he said now that weve joined forces lets work together until we root out the english from atlantis once for all until victory you mean de la fayette said victor nodded he meant that very thing the marquis cupped his hands in front of his mouth and shouted it in english until victory this time the cheers from the atlantean army seemed loud enough to scare cornwallis and the redcoats all the way to croydon de la fayette made a good friend he might also make a bad enemyvictor judged it very likely whoever had decided to let the marquis exercise his considerable talents far away from france must have known what he was doing however loud the atlanteans cheers they didnt scare the redcoats away victor judged that a great pity cornwallis hung on north and a little east of hanover if anyone was going to drive him out of atlantis or even back to croydon it would have to be done with bayonet and musket and cannon and no doubt with a formidable butchers bill mere noise would not suffice frenchmen and atlanteans exercised together they tried to anyhow the atlanteans could have fit in fine with the redcoats atlantean drum and horn and fife calls were the same as the ones the english used how could it be otherwise when the atlanteans had borrowed theirs from the mother country but confusion ran rampant because the french used different calls and cues much polylingual profanity followed victor wanted to place the steady french professionals in the center of the combined armys line of battle his own men more mobile and more woodswise seemed likely to do better on the wings or they would have fared well with that arrangement if only wings and center could each have been sure what the other would do if we do not learn enough to fight together we will fight our first engagement separately the marquis de la fayette said we shall defeat the perfidious englishmen even so we have a better chance together victor said fretfully your men didnt cross the ocean to stand apart from ours we came here to win the marquis said as for how he snapped his fingers all right victor smiled in spite of himself ive been in a few fights like that sometimes you cant figure out afterwards how you won de la fayette snapped his fingers again i tell you again this for how so long as you take the slave wench to bed and swive her good and hard what difference does it make who climbs on top are you well monsieur le general did i say something wrong i have heard that english folk sometimes dont care to speak of matters that have to do with the boudoir i never heard though that english folk dont care to do them im all right victor mumbled had he turned red or white or green he would have bet on green he and blaise had joked about green men but whenever he thought about louise and about the child she carriedabout his own childgreen seemed the only color he could go but in law the child hed fathered on louise wasnt his in law that child belonged to marcel freycinet throughout his arguments with blaise victor hadnt felt slaverys injustice how should he when that injustice hadnt bitten him well the trap had closed on his leg now or perhaps on an even more sensitive appendage by this time his letter should have reached monsieur freycinet shouldnt it no sure accounting for wind and wave but victor thought so and the french atlantean planters reply ought to be on its way north oughtnt it again no way to be certain but you seem perhaps un petit peu distracted monsieur if it does not offend you that i should speak so de la fayette observed if whatever troubles you can be washed away with brandy or rum i should be honored to lend whatever assistance in the cleansing i may victor radcliff had never heardhad never dreamt ofa fancier way to propose that the two of them get drunk together most of the time he would have liked nothing better but if he started pouring it down now his sad story might pour out of him he was readier to trust de la fayette with his life than with his reputation he was in short a man once weve beaten the english well have something worth celebrating he said till then id rather not a renunciation crusading zeal almost a lenten vow the marquis exclaimed meaning no disrespect but i did not look for such a spirit from an english protestant we dont always find what we look for or look for what we find victor said and wasnt that the sad and sorry truth his force and de la fayettes kept working together what choice had they but victor feared they would have to fight as separate contingents not as parts of a single army he wished he had the french noblemans confidence he wished for all kinds of things a few days later a courier thrust a sheet of paper into his hand saying this here just got to hanover general thank you victor replied breaking the seal on marcel freycinets letter one of his wishes and not the smallest had just come true now he had to discover how big a fool hed been in wishing for it my dear general freycinet wrote i am in receipt of your letter of the nineteenth ultimo i regret that i cannot see my way clear to agree to your undoubtedly generous proposal while i was pleasedindeed privilegedto have louise serve you for a time i do not wish to be permanently deprived of her nor of the child she is to bear she is being treated with all consideration i assure you and is in excellent health she sends you her regards as i send mine i have the honor to remain your most obedient servant he signed his name although victor hadnt cared to get drunk with the marquis de la fayette he hadnt said a word about crawling into a bottle alone and he proceeded to do exactly that chapter listening to gunfire while hungover wasnt something victor would have recommended however much he wished it would his head didnt fall off he disguised what the spaniards called a pain in the hair with a stoic expression and a few surreptitious nips from a flask of barreltree rum maybe those nips werent surreptitious enough both blaise and the marquis de la fayette sent him thoughtful glances neither presumed to ask him anything about his sore head though that was the only thing that really mattered nothat and the advance of the atlantean and french armies if not for their advance musketry and cannon fire wouldnt have lacerated his tender ears the things i endure for my country he thought but the rum even if it did make his factotum and the french commander wonder also took the edge off his headache by evening he was more or less himself again anything i can do for whatevers troubling you general blaise asked adding i know something is but damned if i know what its my own worry blaise victor said and not another word he couldnt very well claim it had nothing to do with the negro knowing what it was blaise would have called him a liarand he would have had a point too he didnt know though victor hadnt been too drunk to burn marcel freycinets latest letter the night before he supposed things would come out sooner or later things had an unfortunate way of doing that as far as he was concerned later was ever so much better than sooner by blaises expression he had a different opinion if i knew what it was maybe i could give you a hand with it he said i dont think so victor heard the slammed door in his own voice blaise must have too well i bet youll change your mind one of these days he said wont be this one though and he stopped probing at victor even meg might have kept at it so might the marquis de la fayette but another brisk skirmish with the redcoats the next morning gave him something else to think about he sent some of the french regulars on a looping march to the north to try to drive in the enemys right wing cornwallis soldiers or the loyalists serving beside them must have sniffed out the maneuver the enemy fell back half a mile or so rather than waiting to withstand an attack in a disadvantageous position half a mile closer to croydon then if the atlanteans and the french kept moving forward at that rate theyd get to the northeastern city some time toward the end of next winter victor repented of making such calculations then he repented of repenting for he knew he couldnt help making them i wish the english would stay to be netted de la fayette said it would make the whole undertaking so much easier well yes victor agreed deadpan and if a beefsteak cut itself up and hopped into your mouth bite by bite after you cooked it that would make eating easier too the french noble raised an eyebrow it could be that you take me less seriously than you might from a man of a certain temper such a statement could be the first step on the path that led to a duel did de la fayette have that kind of temper victor radcliff didnt care to find out hed never fought a duel nor did he want to fight his first one now iwas trying to make a joke he said if i offended you i did not mean to and i am sorry for it then i shall say no more about it de la fayette replied and to his credit he didnt north of hanover more fields were planted in rye and oats and barley than in wheat that was partly because the folk of croydon brewed a lot of beer oh some germans brewed beer from wheat but most folk preferred barley victor knew he did but the main reason the other grains gradually supplanted wheat was that the growing season got short up here when the weather stayed good or even reasonable wheat ripened well enough but if you were going to lose your crop about one year in four you had to own a certain boldness of character to put it in the ground in the first place farmers of the more stolid sort chose grains that grew faster barley and rye in france are for peasants the marquis de la fayette said and oats oats are for horses englishmen say the same thing about scots and their oatmeal victor answered but more than one scot has seen that english farmers eat oats too do you the nobleman asked if i eat katydids im not likely to stick at oats monsieur and i donti like oatmeal myself nor should you ive already seen that your french soldiers dont turn up their noses at horsemeat if you eat the beasts that eat the oats you may as well eat the oats too it could be but then again it could also be otherwise de la fayette replied the delicate woodcock feasts on earthworms while i should be less eager to do the same a point as victor radcliff thought about it a slow smile spread across his face as a matter of fact the same thing occurred to me not so very long ago although in aid of our native oil thrushes rather than woodcocks there you are then the marquis looked around and here we are if we keep pressing forward very soon we shall force general cornwallis and his englishmen back into croydon lets hope we do victor said if de la fayette had made the same calculation he had himself the frenchman would have realized they wouldnt make the redcoats hole up in croydon all that soon plainly de la fayette hadnt which meant what most likely that de la fayette was of a more optimistic less calculating temperament victor laughed at himself as if i didnt already know that most of the people who lived north of hanover sprang from one or another of the sterner protestant sects that had sprung up in england and scotland in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries their descendants still looked as if they disapproved of everything under the sun if soldiers in the atlantean army argued about gods nature or will chances were at least one of them came from the state of croydon fortunately the locals grim disapproval extended to cornwallis and his followers that man is assuredly hellhound one farmer told victor sounding as certain as if hed checked st peters registry and discovered the english generals name wasnt there a joke victor refrained from making the croydonite would have discovered papist pretensions in him if he had regardless of whether they were really there instead of joking victor asked how do you know that ah my name is eubanks generalbarnabas eubanks the local said as for how i know did i not see him with my own eyes take a drink of spirituous liquor wine is a mocker strong drink is raging the good book says which makes it true and did i not hear him most profanely take the name of the lord in vain that also being prohibited by holy scripture he could as easily have seen victor drink rum or heard him blaspheme the profession of arms lent itself to such pastimes perhaps more than any other if this barnabas eubanks didnt understand that but a glance at eubanks stern pinched features told victor he did understand he simply wasnt prepared to make any allowances yes he was a croydon man all right while i should be glad to see general cornwallis in the infernal regions i find myself more immediately concerned with his earthly whereabouts victor said what did you hear from him besides his blasphemy he and one of his lackeys were speaking of how they purposed making a stand in pomphret landing eubanks mouth tightened further victor hadnt believed it could the place suits them being a den of iniquity eubanks added all victor knew about pomphret landing was that it lay between hanover and croydon until this moment hed never heard that it was as one with sodom and gomorrah how is it so wicked he inquired i am surprised you do not know i am surprised its vileness is not a stench in the nostrils of all atlantis barnabas eubanks replied learn then that pomphret landing supports no fewer than three horrid taverns that it has a theater presenting socalled dramas andhe lowered his voice in pious horrorthere is within its bounds a house of assignation in which women sell their bodies for silver you silly twit what do you expect sailors coming off the sea to do but drink and screw no victor didnt shout it which only proved he was learning restraint as he grew older he also wondered where the wanton womens partners came by silver in these hard times he didnt ask that either all he said was the theater doesnt sound so bad oh but it is eubanks said earnestly the plays presented encourage adultery freethinking and all manner of other such sinful pastimes i see victor murmured if we can drive the redcoats out of pomphret landing without smashing the theater or burning it down i may watch a play there myself one more thing he didnt tell his narrowminded if patriotic informant forcing cornwallis to pull back from pomphret landing wouldnt be so simple the town sat on the east bank of the pomphret cornwallis engineers had burnt or blown up the bridges over the river locals told victor there was no ford for some mile inland english artillerists fired their field guns across the pomphret at his mounted scouts most of those shots missed as such harassing fire commonly did but de la fayettes frenchmen butchered two horses that met cannon balls and the atlanteans buried a man who also made ones sudden and intimate acquaintance french engineers assured victor they could bridge the pomphret fast enough to keep the redcoats from gathering while you do it he asked them they didnt answer right away the way they eyed him said hed passed a test one he hadnt even known he was taking at last cautiously the most senior man replied that could be monsieur it is one of the hazards of the trade you might say no doubt victor said that doesnt mean we should invite it if we dont have to nestce pas the engineers put their heads together when they broke apart their grizzled spokesman said perhaps if we began at night you would be working by torchlight then is it not so we are not owls we cannot see in pitch blackness you know the senior engineer said regretfully do you not believe the englishmen might notice what you are about victor asked this too is a hazard of the trade i fear the engineer answered having commanded for some little while monsieur le general i daresay you will have observed it yourself by now shut up and quit bothering us he meant an atlantean would have come right out and said so the frenchman knew how to get his meaning across without being ostentatiously rude either way the result was frustrating victor looked up into the heavens the moon rode low in the east it would be full soon against the daylight sky it looked like a silver shilling with one edge chewed away the palefaced man in the moon didnt wink at himthat had to be his imagination and if his imagination was working hard enough to see such things if it was maybe he could make it work hard other ways as well do you think you could bridge the pomphret by the light of the full moon he made the engineers huddle again anyhow that was as much as hed hoped forhed feared they would kill his scheme with genteel scorn the graying senior man replied that is possible monsieur possible i repeat it is by no means assured i understand victor said here is what i have in mind he spoke for some little while this time the french engineers didnt need to confer almost identical slightly bemused smiles spread across all their faces as near simultaneously as made no difference you have come up with something out of the ordinary monsieur le general no one could deny it for a moment their grizzled spokesman said truly i admire your original tenor of thought and here i believed myself a baritone victor said the engineers flinched as if at musket fire ignoring that victor went on do you think the plan is worth trying then why not the engineer said gaily after all what is the worst that can happen he answered his own question we can get shot fall into the river and feed the fish and turtles and crayfish not so very much eh one hopes not victor said dryly one always hopes the engineer agreed the fish the turtles the crayfishthey get fat regardless against the dark blue velvet of the night the moon glowed like a newminted sovereign torches and bonfires blazed turning night into day on this stretch of the pomphret engineers shouted orders atlantean and french soldiers most of them stripped to the waist fetched and carried at the direction of the technically trained officers bridging a river was not quiet work bridging a river by firelight at night was not inconspicuous work it drew english scouts the way those soldiers bare torsos drew mosquitoes some of the scouts fired horse pistols and carbines at the frenchmen and atlanteans out of the night others galloped away to bring back reinforcements victor heard their horses hoofbeats fade in the distance despite the din of axes and saws and hammers and despite the pomphrets gentler murmuring he thought he heard those hoofbeats anyhow maybe that was only his imagination again he could hope so hope or not though he placed some field guns near the pomphrets west bank if those reinforcements got here no dammit when they didthey would have cannon with them he wanted to be able to respond in kind but cornwallis artillerists would have every advantage in the world his own guns had to try to wreck the carriages and limbers of enemy cannon hiding in the dark the english gunners wouldnt even care about his not unless his men got very lucky a growing bridge all lit up by flames and by the brilliant moon made the easiest target any fool could think of sometimes there was just no help for a situation worse luck crash a cannon ball tumbled six feet of bridge into the pomphret good thing nobody was standing on that stretch blaise said so it was victor agreed but im afraid we cant play these games without losses hardly had he spoken before another cannon ball jellied a french engineers leg the man was carried off shrieking and bleeding to the surgeons one quick dismayed glance at the woundeven that was too much because it made anyone who saw it want to look awaytold victor they would have to amputate to have any chance of saving the fellows life a couple of minutes later the engineer screamed again even louder poor devil blaise muttered victor nodded he was thinking the same thing himself then he rode out into the firelight to let the redcoats know he was there it was important that they should understand he was personally supervising this operation they didnt need long to realize as much bullets cracked past his head his horse sidestepped nervously he didnt draw back into the darkness till after a roundshot skipped past much too harry turtledove close for comfort and thanks to the full moon the darkness was less dark than it might have been enemy fire pursued him far longer than he would have wanted that was foolish blaise told him after the english finally stopped trying to ventilate his spleen it could be victor said but it was also necessary now they are certain this bridge has the utmost importance to our cause they will be so very proud of themselves for thwarting its construction the negro clucked reproachfully they would have been mighty damn proud of themselves for killing you oh yes that they would true enough but they didnt victor radcliff made himself shrug you have to take chances sometimes thats all we could have dragged you off to the surgeons too blaise said they would have shot the horse and then carved it into steaks and ribs and whatnot they would not do the same for you even if it would have been a mercy it happens victor said horribly wounded men sometimes begged to die if their wounds were dreadful enough kind friends or appalled strangers would put them out of their torment as blaise said what was mercy for a horse could also be a mercy for a man he eyed the moon it was starting the long slow slide down toward the green ridge mountains after midnight then an english sniper shot an atlantean running out to lay more wood on a bonfire the wounded greencoat hopped away from the blaze by the way he swore he wasnt too badly hurt if blood poisoning or lockjaw didnt carry him off hed probably be back in the fight in two or three weeks time dragged on try as the french engineers would they seemed unable to push a bridge very far across the pomphret the redcoats mocked them from the far side of the river most of the mockery was in english which few of the frenchmen understood they were the lucky ones any man called me even a quarter of that id kill him blaise said well have our chance before long victor answered so i hope at any rate at last dawn began painting the eastern horizon gray and then pink the engineers gave up the redcoats jeered louder and more foully than ever but now they were more visible to the french and atlantean artillerists the gunners answered with balls of iron having made sure their foes wouldnt span the pomphret here cornwallis men drew back out of range they left a few soldiers near the river where the men could keep an eye on their opponents and make sure the french and atlanteans wouldnt keep trying to bridge this stretch of the river which didnt mean the french and atlanteans wouldnt try to bridge the pomphret somewhere else it only meant the redcoats wouldnt expect them to bridge it anywhere else cornwallis troops made that unpleasant discovery a couple of hours after sunup pistol shots and carbines announced cavalry coming down from the north the bigger booms from field guns announced that artillery accompanied the horsemen before long crashing volleys announced that solid blocks of infantry accompanied the cavalry and field guns general cornwallis hadnt sent his whole army north from pomphret landing nowhere near hed sent enough men to keep the engineers from bridging the pomphret where his scouts discovered them making the effort hed succeeded in that meanwhile a few miles farther north more french engineers quietly did bridge the river and the english had no idea they were doing it till after it was done taken in the flank by the troops whod unexpectedly crossed to the east side of the pomphret the redcoats fled south victor radcliff crossed the river in a rowboat he shook the hand of the marquis de la fayette whod led the larger detachment of frenchmen and atlanteans over the pomphret to the north my compliments to your engineers victor said they performed bravely here and splendidly in your position my chief engineer major flamel extends his compliments to you monsieur le general de la fayette replied he assures me it was by your clever ruse alone that we gained passage over the river having an idea is easy turning it into something useful is anything but victor said major flamel gets the credit for doing that as i have seen before you are a generous man the french noble said i presume you now intend to drive the englishmen out of pomphret landing thats what i have in mind yes i dont know what kind of works theyve built north of townit doesnt do to underestimate cornwallis engineers either victor said sadly i have also seen this for myself de la fayette agreed but even if their fieldworks prove strong what prevents us from marching past them to the sea and trapping the redcoats between our lines to the east and the pomphret to the west id like nothing better than to trap them inside pomphret landing victor said if we do that we win the war so it seems to me anyhow and if it seems the same to general cornwallis he wont let us do it hell fall back on croydon before we can cut him off croydon has the best harbor north of hanover and it sits on a peninsula easy to fortify i would much rather stand siege there than in pomphret landing especially with the royal navy easily able to supply the garrison by sea with cornwallis having so much of his force here the enemy will not easily be able to bring in foodstuffs from elsewhere in atlantis de la fayette said most of the land is under the control of the united states of atlantis in your person he bowed there is some truth in that victor said some but less than i would wish true most of the redcoats are here but england could still land more terranovan savages near avalon or a force of german mercenaries down by new hastings and forces loyal to king georgenative atlantean forces i meanstill hold too much of the countryside custis cawthorne and your other representatives in paris spoke little of that de la fayette observed they talked always of the war against oppressive england not of the civil war against your own folk should that surprise you victor said dont french diplomatists also paint the best picture they can of your kingdoms situation and needs de la fayette bowed again this time in amusement mingled with rue no doubt they do but one does not expect the vices of civilization from the folk of a land so new and vital eh bien perhaps one should you arent stun bumpkins as we thought the marquis couldnt very well mean anything else now victor bowed to him serving ones country to the best of ones ability is surety no vice your grace well no de la fayette seemed faintly embarrassed but so many of us were charmed by your seeming rusticity monsieur cawthorne gives a masterly portrayal victor had all he could do not to laugh himself silly over that could any man be compelled to enjoy himself more than custis cawthorne enjoyed playing such a role while that might be possible victor found it most unlikely and how many pretty little french girls has monsieur cawthorne sweettalked into his bed by playing the poor chap who needs to be instructed in such arts and how many of them ended up astonished that he turned out to know so much already the marquis de la fayette looked astonished himself how could you know that this time victor did laugh if he hadnt he would have exploded ive known monsieur cawthorne many years i have some notion of how his beady little mind works does he ask people to teach him card games too and take away their money with what he calls beginners luck mm dun nom de la fayette said and not another word on that score from which victor concluded that custis had some of the noblemans money in his pocket well good for custis victor thought it was high time the united states of atlantis turned a profit on something the field fortifications north of pomphret landing were as strong as the talented english engineers could make them all the same cornwallis used them to shield his withdrawal to the east not to try to hold the town it turned out as you foretold de la fayette said it could be that i should ask you to read my palm im sure we both have better things to do with our time victor said after the atlanteans and french rode into pomphret landing he found one of those things he sent a letter to general cornwallis urging him to surrender surely you can see your force is reduced to no more than a redcoated carbuncle on the fair face of atlantis he wrote before sending the letter to croydon under a flag of truce he showed it to de la fayette a carbuncle on the face of atlantis the frenchman said after working his way through the english you prove yourself to be possessed of a noble heart monsieur le general me i would call him a boil on atlantis arse victor smiled that is what i was thinking as a matter of fact whether i have a noble heart or not i would not presume to say but i am sure general cornwallis has one this being so i am confident he will divine my meaning even if i state it obliquely obliquely the marquis savored that not a word i would have used which does not keep me from understanding you as you speak english with me more often i discover in it subtleties of which i would not previously have suspected it was capable you are generous your grace victor radcliff said more sincerely than not for anyone from france to allow that english might be subtle was no small concession having received de la fayettes approbation the letter did go off to croydon victor didnt think he would have to wait long for cornwallis reply and he didnt the courier whod taken victors missive also brought back the english commanders response i didnt get to read it general on account of it was upsydown to me while he was awriting it and he sealed it up as soon as it was done but i dont reckon hes ready to chuck in the sponge the courier said the worst he can tell me is no victor said breaking the seal even if he should how am i worse off than i would have been without making the attempt he unfolded the letter sure enough the missive was in cornwalks own hand with which victor had been familiar since the last war when they fought on the same side always a pleasure to receive even the smallest communication from you my dear general radcliff cornwallis wrote if he was not a man with a noble heart he certainly was one who flaunted his urbanity because this pleasure is so great it pains me doubly to find myself compelled by circumstance to refuse you in anything the english general continued none the less i am so compelled on this occasion i do not believe our situation hopeless very much the reverse in fact whilst we do at present find ourselves occupying only croydon this may change at any moment as you must be aware the royal navy may come with orders for our embarkation in which case we should land at some spot not well prepared to resist us or contrariwise ships may bring us reinforcements from across the sea should mat come to pass you and your foreign allies would soon have reason to look to your laurels these things being so continued struggle seems far preferable to craven surrender i have the honor to remain your most obedient servant cornwallis appended his signature complete with a fancy flourish below his name the courier had been watching victors face he says no eh he does indeed he has reasons he finds good for going on with the fight are they good reasons the courier asked they may be victor didnt like to admit even so much he imagined the royal navy taking cornwallis redcoats down to freetown or cosquer their arrival would indeed come as a complete and most unwelcome surprise in those parts and if transports brought five or ten thousand more english soldiersor even mercenaries from brunswick or hesseto croydon cornwallis could sally forth against the atlanteans and french with every hope of success what do we do then the courier inquired im still ciphering that out victor said slowly it seemed a better answer than damned if i know even if they meant about the same thing what really bothered him was that he would have trouble laying proper siege to croydon the royal navy didnt have to take the redcoats down the coast or reinforce them to aid them against his army and the frenchmen as long as food and powder and shot came into croydon cornwallis army was and would remain a going concern and the atlanteans could do very little to stop the royal navy from supplying the enemy victor radcliff took cornwallis reply to de la fayette the marquis read it with grave attention what he says is very much what i should say if i found myself in his position and i victor agreed is there any chance the french navy might interpose itself between croydon and the ships of the royal navy prevent cornwallis from revictualing himself and he becomes vulnerable to all the usual hazards of a siege that failing he is in almost as enviable a position as the defenders of nouveau redon before the spring was put out of commission i could wish you had chosen a different comparison de la fayette said my apologies victor said but you will i trust understand why it sprang to mind not only was i there but so was general cornwallislieutenantcolonel cornwallis as he was then indeed de la fayettes tone showed him to be imperfectly appeased with an effort he brought his wits back to the matter at hand as for our navy i must confess i know not whether that may be within its capacity we should find out victors enthusiasm spurred him on we truly should your grace if we can cork up the englishmen in croydon the war is ours and the united states of atlantis indisputably free for what other purpose did you and your brave men leave france for no other purpose the marquis admitted reluctantly he also found a notable difficulty with victors scheme and proceeded to note it how do you propose to inform the french navy that its services in these parts are desired i have not the faintest idea where in the broad atlanticor even the not so broad mediterraneanits ships of the line and frigates may be enthusiasm or no victor radcliff found himself compelled to contemplate the cogent question having contemplated he delivered his verdict damnation just so de la fayette agreed but where he seemed to think the heartfelt curse settled things victor was less inclined to give in or give up we have as yet no atlantean navy to speak of he began indeed not or you would give your own vessels the task of interdicting croydon de la fayette said and then interdicting it is the right word nestcepas yes it is but i hadnt finished yet victor said we have no navy to speak of but we have a good many merchantmen and a great plenty of fishing boats if we send them forth in search of your warships they should be able to find them before long and to lead them back here to render our cause such aid as may prove within their power the marquis de la fayette blinked god has blessed you with an adventurous spiritthis is not to be denied have you any notion how very wide the ocean is however i do sir victor replied i have crossed it myself and my ancestors made their living from it for centuries he didnt mention that he was no sailor himself de la fayette might already know that but what point to reminding him if he did victor went on with enough boats searching the enterprise is bound to succeed in timeand chances are in not such a long time too well it could be de la fayette didnt seem altogether convinced victor wasnt altogether convinced either but he was convinced it was worth a try and the french nobleman seemed to admit that much for he asked and what will our land forces be doing whilst awaiting the navys arrivalwhich may not prove altogether timely i expect we will be doing what we would be doing if there were no such thing as the french navy victor replied that is to say we will be doing everything in our power to defeat cornwallis army in and around croydon had you anything else in mind for us by no means monsieur le general i merely wished to make certain you did not intend to rest on our laurels so to speak the war still wants aggressive prosecution and will fail without it daccord victor said de la fayette smiled at the very french agreement victor continued my first target for prosecuting the war would be the english works defending the hamlet of wilton wells if we drive them away from the village we dent their lines in a way cornwallis wont care for splendid the marquis said gaily let us proceed then proceed they did but cornwallis fieldworks bristled with cannon ditches and abatis kept the atlanteans from getting close the forlorn hopes that broke through the interlaced tree trunks and branches proved exactly that the english guns sprayed them with canister the men who could staggered back through the gaps theyd made in the abatis the rest lay where theyd fallen some writhing and moaning others ominously still some of the forlorn hopes were french others atlantean neither commander had any excuse to blame the others soldiers for theyd failed together all de la fayette said was it could be that we will find an easier way toward croydon than the one that goes through wilton wells it could be yes victor said admiring de la fayettes sangfroid i had not thought this one would prove so well defended not everything works de la fayette said one of the tricks of the game is to keep trying even after a failure true enough victor had been a good deal older than the frenchman was now when hed learned thatwhich made it no less true chapter the atlanteans planned to feint at wilton wells again and strike a little farther east just past garnet pond woods let them closely approach the redcoats line there and it didnt seem strongly held if they could break through cornwallis men would have to fall back toward croydon in a hurry victor and de la fayette could concentrate their force and attack where they pleased the redcoats trying to hold a line well outside of croydon had to try to stay reasonably strong all along it reasonably strong with luck would prove not to be strong enough with luck victor radcliff had much too much reason to remember those two little seemingly innocent words after the thrust past garnet pond came to grief the worst of it was he couldnt think of anything he should have done differently it was sunny when the attacking column set out for garnet pond early in the morning sunnyhe remembered that very well oh the wind came down from the northwest but what of it summer was over and chilly winds were nothing out of the ordinary especially in a northern settiementa northern statelike croydon de la fayette seemed as happy with the arrangement as victor was himself this is a wellconceived plan he declared even if he was very young his praise warmed victor the false attack at the place we struck before will hold the english in place or even it could be draw men from garnet pond to the position that seems more threatened i hope so yes victor did his best to keep his smile sheepish and modest rather than say full of gloating and anticipation and we have deployed a full complement of sharpshooters and skirmishers to ensure that the true attack is not detected prematurely de la fayette went on nom dun nom monsieur le general i cannot imagine what could possibly go wrong maybe that was what did it had victor been more pious he might also have been more nearly certain it was the frenchman didnt precisely take the lords name in vain he didnt use the lords name at allnot directly anyhow but wasnt trotting out a euphemism just as bad really assuming the lord was listening wouldnt he know what was on your mind what was in your heart regardless of whether his name actually passed your lips victor wondered about it afterwards but afterwards was too late as afterwards commonly is clouding up blaise remarked not ten minutes after the attacking column set out well so it is victor agreed what of it he tried to look on the bright side even if that bright side was rapidly vanishing from the sky the clouds were thick and roiling and dark it hadnt been warm before they swept across the sky it got noticeably colder as soon as they did the air seemed damper too although victor tried his best to tell himself that was only his imagination he might have managed to persuade himself but blaises broad nostrils flared smells like rain he said i hope not victor exclaimed but he knew that wetdust odor as soon as blaise pointed it out as a matter of fact hed known it before even if he hadnt wanted to admit it was there no matter what hed managed to talk himself into he wouldnt have stayed deluded much longer when rain started coming down it was impossible to believe the weather remained fine and this wasnt a light shower of the kind some of the people farther south called liquid sunshine this was a downpour a gully washer a cloudburst the ground under his feet turned to mud and then to something a good deal more liquid than the stuff commonly known by that name what does the bible talk about blaise saidshouted really to make himself heard over or through that roaring rain forty days and forty nights it hadnt even been raining forty minutes then all the same victor understood why the negro asked the question it had gone from cloudburst to deluge had noahs ark floated by victor wouldnt have been amazed but why didnt the ark seem to contain any atlantean productions maybe i should recall them victor said the atlanteans would have a devil of a time shooting once they got past garnet pondwet weather turned flintlocks into nothing more than clumsy spears and clubs redcoats wont be able to shoot at them either blaise replied understanding what he was worried about well no victor said but not all our men have bayonets at the beginning of the war very few atlanteans had them giving the redcoats a great advantage when the fighting came to close quarters these days thanks to captured weapons and hard work at smithies all over atlantis most greencoats were as well armed as their english counterparts or maybe i worry overmuch a few gunshots marked the moment when the feint went in victor admired the men on either side whod managed to keep their powder dry the shots rang out distinctly even through the rain but there were only a few and no one had the slightest hope of reloading after the scattered opening volley both atlanteans and englishmen might have fallen back through time a thousand years back to days long before the first clever artificer made a batch of gunpowder without blowing himself up in the doing instead of musketry a few shouts and screams pierced the curtain of sound the downpour spread over the scene they were enough to let victor picture it in his mind he imagined dripping muddy men stabbing with bayonets and swinging clubbed muskets as if they were cricket bats he imagined rain and blood rolling down their faces and rain trying to wash away spreading patches of red on their tunics and knowing soldiers as he did he imagined them all swearing at the weather at least as much as they swore at one another off to the east the main attacking party should have been able to gauge when to hit the english lines by the noise the men in the feint made they probably couldnt hear the men in the feint at all though the major commanding them had to use his best judgment about when to go onor whether to go in at all victor radcliff wouldnt have blamed him for aborting the attack but he didnt his menand the redcoats facing themalso managed to get off a few shots one cannon boomed hearing it go off truly amazed victor he had to hope it didnt harm his men too much and then he had to wait and wait and wait no messenger came back from the main attack to tell him how it was going maybe the officer in charge forgot to send anyone maybe the messenger got killed or wounded before he went very far or maybe he just sank into the ooze and drowned if the attackers werent going to tell victor what had happened he had to find out for himselfif he could he rode toward the woods through which the atlanteans should have gone he rode ever more slowly too for the rain rapidly turned the road to a river of mud the horse looked back at him reproachfully as if wondering whether it would sink out of sight not much farther on victor began to wonder the same thing where he had trouble going forward he soon found out the atlantean soldiers were managing to go back its no use general one of them bawled through the rain what happened victor asked we damn near drowned thats what the soldier answered that cannon ball blew major halls head off another man added which went a long way towards explaining why the poor major hadnt sent back any messengers losing your head metaphorically could distract you losing it literally got everything over with in a hurry at any rate and whoeverd taken over for hall must not have thought to send word back either we got in amongst the redcoats a sergeant said but we couldnt get through em nobody could do anything much not in this slop his wave took in rain and mud and bedraggled men damnation victor radcliff shook his fist at the black clouds overhead they took not the slightest notice of him the storm lasted almost a week by the time it finally blew out to sea half the english earthworks had collapsed entrenchments on both sides were more than half full of water since the redcoats had so much trouble using their field fortifications the atlanteans might have walked into croydon they might have that is had walking anywhere not involved sinking thighdeep in clinging muck victor thanked heaven his own quartermasters had managed to keep most of the armys grain dry that meant the troops could go on eating till the roads dried enough to bring in more wheat and barley and rye even oats victor thought no one in these parts would have any trouble finding plenty of water for stewing up oatmeal if cornwallis chose this moment to try to drive the atlanteans away from croydon victor didnt know how he would be able to hold back the redcoats but the englishmen while working feverishly to repair their lines didnt try to come out of them before long victor realized hed worried over nothing had the redcoats attacked they would have bogged down the same way his own men did are such storms common in these parts de la fayette inquired his manner plainly saying atlantis wasnt worth living in if they were but victor shook his head down in the south hurricanes are known he answered rainstorms like this up here he shook his head again bad lucki know not what else to call this one bad indeed the french noble said and are we to expect blizzards next god forbid victor exclaimed knowing too well that god was liable to do no such thing but then trying his best to look on the bright side of things he added if we should have a hard freeze the ground wont try to swallow us up anyhow well no if that prospect pleased de la fayette he hid it very well but i find the climate in this country imperfectly equable the southern regions suffer from excessive heat while these parts seem to have a superabundance of both rain and snow a more moderate regimen would be preferablea regimen more like that of exempli gratia la belle france his reaching that particular conclusion amused victor without much surprising him the atlantean general spread his hands i fear i cannot help it your grace as i said a moment before the weather is under the good lords command not mine de la fayette crossed himself you have reason certainly i shall pray that he might extend to your country the blessings he has generously granted mine if god hadnt changed atlantis climate at least since the days when edward radcliffe founded new hastingsand probably not for centuries before thathe was unlikely to alter it at the marquis request de la fayette had to know that as well as victor did all he meant was that he didnt care for the way things were victor didnt either not the way they were up here he liked the weather around his farm much better which only proved he like de la fayette liked what he was used to and disliked any departure from it blaise felt the same way though his african norm was far different from either white mans leaving the power of prayer out of the question we should discuss what we might best attempt now victor said so we should the marquis sighed such a pretty plan we had before we would assuredly have surprised the redcoats with it he paused considering i dont suppose we could simply try it again that made victor pause to consider too his first response was to call the suggestion ridiculous the redcoats would be waiting for it or would they the more he thought the less sure he grew he started to laugh our stupidity in repeating ourselves would surprise them at the least just so just so de la fayette seemed to catch fire at the idea however insolent they are themselves they would never believe we have the insolence to make the second stroke the same as the first victor thought out loud perhaps we should make the previous stroke the feint and the previous feint the stroke no but no certainly not de la fayette shook his head so vigorously he had to grab his tricorn to keep from losing it that they would anticipate it is precisely the ploy an ordinary man a man without imagination might try thinking himself clever beyond compare i see victor muttered his ears burning well hed never thought himself anything but an ordinary man de la fayette seemed to agree with him unaware that he might have given offense the frenchman went on if we try something altogether different from our previous ploy we may find success if contrariwise we surprise them by our stupidity we may also hope to triumph the flaw lies in the middle way as it commonly does and so it was decided even after it was decided blaise had his doubts about it if the redcoats look for this they will slaughter us that they will victor agreed which made the negro blink victor went on but if we essay anything that they anticipate they are likely to slaughter us hmm hed made blaise stop and think anyhow then the black man delivered his verdict if we are going to do this we had better do it quickly lest a deserter betray the plan to the english that made excellent sense victor ordered the feint to go in at dawn the next morning and the true attack to follow as soon as the redcoats seemed to have taken the bait he also strengthened the picket line between his army and cornwallis he didnt know whether he could keep deserters from slipping away but he intended to try both columns formed up in the chilly predawn darkness baron von steuben volunteered to lead the attackers replacing the late major hall any cannon ball that hits this hard head will bounce off he declared in gutturally accented english try not to make the experiment victor said the german soldier of fortune nodded victor added one more piece of advice strike hard and strike fast i do it the soldaten do it also they fear me more than any piffling redcoats von steuben said chances were he knew what he was talking about too a good drillmaster was supposed to inspire that kind of respectful fear in his men to victors ears the feinting and attacking columns both made too much noise as they moved out but he didnt hear any shouts of alarm from the english lines very often what seemed obvious to a worried man was anything but to the people around him even more often his failure to realize that alerted those other people to the idea that something funny was going on dont give the game away ahead of time victor told himself he waited to hear what would happen next the feint went in when he expected it to hed urged the men to fight especially hard so theyd make the redcoats believe they truly meant to bull their way through he was sure they understood the reason behind the order he wasnt sure they would follow it if anything he feared them less likely to do so precisely because they understood why he asked it of them most of his men were veterans by now they knew that the more fiercely and ferociously they attacked earthworks the better their chances of stepping in front of a cannon ball or a bullet or of meeting one of those fearsome english bayonets if they were veterans wouldnt they take such mischances in stride redcoats would have so would troops from the continentbaron von steuben had taken such soldiering for granted till he got here the marquis de la fayette still did and got it from his frenchmen but atlanteans were a different breed they expectedno they demandeda solid return on their investment regardless of whether they risked their time or their money or their lives english cannon thundered blaise coughed to draw victors notice when victor glanced his way the negro said the redcoats are going here come those atlantean madmen again dont they ever learn their lessons heh victor radcliff said uncomfortably just wait a bit pretty soon theyll find out how mad we are in truth no blaise pointed at him pretty soon you find out how mad we are in truth since that was what victor was afraid of he grimaced and shook his head and kept his mouth shut he wanted to go up and fight alongside the men in the striking force only one thing held him back if cornwallis troops recognized him there they would be sure that second column was the one they needed to concern themselves with the general commanding started to swear what now blaise asked bugger me blind but i should have gone in at the head of the feint victor said if anything would have made the englishmen sure that was our principal column my presence at its head was the very thing and also the very thing to get you killed blaise observed atlanteans were more pragmatic than europeans about such things less likely to get themselves killed over pointless points of honor blaise was far more pragmatic than most white atlanteans he added besides the fellow leading it dont want you up there if you are up there the men pay attention to you not to him once more victor would have liked to find some way to tell him he was talking nonsense once more he found himself unable major porter was as much in charge of the feint as baron von steuben was in charge of the striking column both officers would do everything they could with what they had and wouldnt want anyone else in position to joggle their elbow the feint went in the racket of gunfireand of shouts of rage and agonygrew and grew so did the shouts of englishmen rushing to their comrades aid by the noise they were making they thought the atlanteans were hitting the place where theyd bluffed before after all no one could be stupid enough to try the same thing twice in a row so de la fayette had assured victor anyhow it all sounded so lucid so reasonable so rational when the noble spelled it out then again frenchmen had a knack for sounding lucid reasonable rational if they were as sensible as they seemed why wasnt france in better shape victor found himself cocking his head toward the left hed committed the feint the redcoats were already responding to it baron von steuben could get close to their line without their knowing it as the luckless major hall had been doing when the heavens opened up when blaise asked if i were up there with them wed go in victor had wondered if he was nervous and fidgety and inclined to jump the gun but he couldnt even get now out of his mouth before von steuben put in the attack this cacophony made the other one small by comparison victor clenched his fists till his nailswhich werent longbit into his callused palms if they broke through if they broke through de la fayettes frenchmen would go in behind the striking column theyd tear a hole in cornwallis line that you could throw a honker through and then what croydon victory true victory at last cornwallis handing over his sword in token of surrender cornwallis admitting that the united states of atlantis were here to stay till this moment the fight for atlantean freedom had so consumed victor hed had scant opportunity to wonder what would come afterwards if cornwallis and the redcoats had to sail away from atlantis forever where would they go back to england or west across the broad hesperian gulf to fight the rebels on the terranovan mainland suppose they won there how would the united states of atlantis cope with being all but surrounded by the unloved and unloving former mother country victor had no idea there were worse problems to have losing the war against england instead of winning it for instance not so long before that had looked much too likely then still unloved and unloving the mother country would have set its boot on atlantis neck and stomped hard which she might do yet victor knew hed been building castles in the air any number of things could all too easily go wrong he called to one of his young messengersone who spoke fluent french my compliments to the marquis de la fayette and please remind him to be ready to lead his men forward the instant the situation warrants right you are general the messenger agreed one of the usual slipshod atlantean salutes and away he went at a good clip victor smiled at his back that kind of response would have earned the puppy stripes from cornwallisand very possibly from de la fayette as well atlanteans did things their own way it might not be pretty but it worked or it had so far victor had talked himself hoarse making sure baron von steuben understood he was to send word back as soon as he thought it likely he would penetrate the redcoats defenses and the german officer did but not quite the way the atlantean commandant had expected instead of telling victor what was going on in the middle of that cloudbank of blackpowder smoke von steuben sent a runner straight back to de la fayette that runner and victor radcliffs messenger must have reached the french noble at almost the same time the first victor knew about it was when de la fayettes soldiers surged forward musicians blaring out their foreign horn and drum calls for a heartbeat victor was mortally offended then he realized what must have happened he also realized von steuben had been absolutely right if de la fayettes troops were the ones who were going to move de la fayette was the man who most needed to know when they were to move if victors laugh was rueful it was a laugh even so why doesnt anyone ever tell me anything he said whats that blaise asked my own foolishness talking victor said which probably made less of an answer than blaise would have wanted victor climbed up onto his horse his factotum also mounted urging his gelding forward victor went on if we are driving them i will see it with my own eyes by god and if by some mischance we are not driving them you will ride straight into something you could have stayed away from blaise was always ready to see the cloud to a silver lining the firing ahead hadnt died out the redcoats were still plainly doing all they could to hold back the atlanteansand now de la fayettes frenchmen as well but as victor rode past the woods that had sheltered his striking column till the moment it struck he realized their best wouldnt be enough by god he said again and this time he sounded like a man who really meant it baron von steubens men had punched a hole through the english line better than a furlong wide victor had hoped they might be able to break through so splendidly but hadnt dared count on it counting on something ahead of time in war too often led but to disappointment and the atlanteans had done what they were supposed to do after breaking through too theyd swung out to left and right and poured a fierce enfilading fire into the redcoats in the trenches to either side arrows on a map couldnt have more precisely obeyed the man who drew them and if that wasnt von steubens doing whose was it the german deserved to be a colonel if not a brigadier general de la fayettes french professionals poured through the gap atlantean ardor had torn they too methodically volleyed at the englishmen who tried to plug that gap victor was just riding into what had been the english position when the redcoats every bit as competent as their french foes realized they were playing a losing game and started falling back toward croydon on victor shouted to his own men and then in french avant he fell back into english to continue if we take the town from them theyve nowhere to go after that if de la fayette or some of his officers wanted to translate his remarks for the benefit of the french soldiery they were welcome to croydons outskirts lay only a couple of miles away whenever victor rode to the crest of some little swell of ground he could see the church steeples reaching toward the heavens one of them was supposed to be the tallest steeple in all atlantis a claim furiously rejected in hanover and new hastings i think we can do it was that blaises voice damned if it wasnt if blaise believed croydon would fall how could it do anything else victor also began to believe his men would storm croydon and if they did when they did no one yet had thought to write a tune for the united states of atlantis to use in place of god save the king maybe some minstrel needed to get busy in a hurry because what stood between those united states and liberty damn all victor could see his men were making for croydon faster than the redcoats pulling out of their entrenchments and earthworks if nothing slowed the atlanteans and frenchmen they were less than half an hour from guaranteeing that the union jack would never fly over atlantis again if nothing slowed them one more thought victor radcliff remembered a long long time no sooner had it crossed his mind than a band of cavalrysomething more than a troop but less than a regimentthundered out of croydon and straight toward the advancing atlantean and french foot soldiers the riders wore buff and blue not the red of english regulars loyalists then victor thought with distaste like any cavalrymen they carried sabers and carbines and long horse pistols most would have a second pistol stashed in a boot some might carry one or two more on their belts form line victor shouted we can take them blaise pointed isnt that god damn him to hell victor burst out sure as the devil that was habakkuk biddiscombeand the riders had to be biddiscombes horsed legion which had been much spoken of but till now little seen victor wished he werent seeing it at this moment which did him no good whatever he wasnt the only one to recognize the defector the traitor commanding the royalist atlanteans the cry of no quarter went up from a dozen throats at once anyone who fought for and alongside habakkuk biddiscombe knew the chance he took muskets boomed here and there legionaries slid from the saddle and horses went down but the horsemen who didnt fall came on they knew exactly what they were doing and why they despised the soldiers who fought for the united states of atlantis at least as much as those men loathed them and now at last they had the chance to show their hated kinsmen and former friends what they could do death to radcliff biddiscombe roared in an instant every man he led took up the cry death to radcliff they slammed into the front of the advancing atlantean column into a line that hadnt finished forming they slammed into it and through it shooting some soldiers and slashing at others with their swords and by their courage and ferocity they stopped victor radcliffs army in its tracks kill them drive them out of the way victor shouted furiously drawing the goldhilted sword the atlantean assembly had given him and urging his horse forward toward the fight on to croydon against a force of infantry that size brushing them aside would have been a matter of momentsnothing that could have seriously delayed the assault on the redcoats last sheltering place but the horses of biddiscombes horsed legion gave the men on them a striking power out of all proportion to their numbers and so did the way they hated the men they faced victor mightdidreckon their cause and the way they upheld it altogether wrong that didnt mean their contempt for death and retreat was any less than his might have been under like circumstances biddiscombe he called brandishing his blade as he rode past his own men toward the fight im coming for you biddiscombe oh just shoot the son of a whore blaise said which was bound to be good advice what were the redcoats doing behind biddiscombes horsed legion victor knew too well what he would be doing while such an outsized forlorn hope bought him time without a doubt cornwallis men were doing the same thing everything they could to hold their foes as far away from croydon as possible after what seemed a very long time the survivors from the legion galloped back toward the town theyd bought the redcoatsking georges fellow subjects they would have saidenough of that precious impalpable substance to form a line across the neck of the peninsula on which croydon sat and whether from out of the town or from their abandoned field works the englishmen had half a dozen cannon in the line dont like the looks of those blaise said nor do i victor agreed no atlantean artillery was anywhere close by he didnt think the french had brought guns forward either which meant were going to catch it he thought sorrowfully the field guns spoke cannon balls and canister tore through the atlanteans and frenchmen two quick volleys from the dreadfully proficient foot soldiers followed men and pieces of men lay where they had fallen the wounded staggered back when they could when they couldnt they thrashed and wailed and clutched at hale men hoping to be helped away from the killing fire they got less help than they would have wanted the atlanteans were proficient in the craft of slaughter themselves by now and gave back the redcoats musketry as best they could and more frenchmen hurried forward to stiffen them should they require stiffeningand to shoot at the english any which way when the redcoats cannon spoke again one of their balls knocked a musketeer near victor right out of his shoes the musketeer howledmercifully not for long at the start of the war the atlanteans never could have endured such carnage now they took it in stride as sailors took the chance of being drowned it was a hazard of the trade no less and no more regardless of how calm and brave they were one thing seemed only too clear to victor we shant break into croydon after all he said bitterly god fling habakkuk biddiscombe into hell for ever and ever may satan fry him on a redhot griddle for all eternity and stab him with a fork every so often to see if hes done maybe it is happening even now blaise said maybe he was killed in the fight at the front maybe he was if god is merciful he was victor said but then if god were merciful biddiscombe would have died of the pox long ago with no hope of seizing croydon victor reluctantly pulled his men out of musket range the english guns kept banging away at them but by the same token atlantean riflemen picked off artillerists one after another victor looked back over his shoulder theyd forced the redcoats out of their lines forced them to give up the field fortifications on which theyd expended so much time and labor it was a victory no doubt of that if it wasnt quite the overwhelming victory hed wanted when he set things in motion well what man this side of alexander or hannibal or julius caesar won such an overwhelming victory for an amateur general with a formerly amateur army hed done pretty well looking back over his shoulder also reminded him how close to sunset it was his longstretching shadow and his horses should have told him as much already but hed had other things on his mind he wondered if he had the nerve to fight a large night action and regretfully decided he didnt well camp here he ordered and then to sweeten it as best he could he added here on the ground weve won de la fayette favored him with a salute you accomplished almost everything you intended monsieur le general the french nobleman said it is given to few to do so much for their country i thank you victor replied returning the salute if only i could have done a little more that made the marquis smile a man who has much but wants more is likely to acquire it i wanted it today victor said and cursed habakkuk biddiscombe again night brought only a nervous halfhearted break in the hostilities the redcoats also encamped on the held not far out of gunshot range men from both sides went out to rescue the moaning wounded and plunder the silent deadand if a few wounded were suddenly silenced in the process so what englishmen and atlanteans sometimes stumbled over one another in the darkness they would grapple or open fireexcept when both sides ran away at once the redcoats seemed busier than the exhausted atlanteans victor didnt need long to realize why they were digging in in front of croydon rising earthworks partly hid their fires they would have a much shorter line to hold now even if they would also have far fewer men with whom to hold it when the sun rose again royal navy ships were tied up at croydons piers they were only frigates but their guns outweighed and outranged anything the atlanteans could bring against them if croydon fell it would have to fall by siege chapter damn the englishmen victor said when hed ridden around the redcoats new lines in front of croydon god butter them and satan futter them they dig like skinks comment inquired the marquis de la fayette whod ridden the circuit with him like what do they dig like skinks victor repeated de la fayettes question puzzled him the simile was common enough in atlantis then he decided it might be common only in atlantis he cast about for a european equivalent which he found after a moment like moles you might say ah i see the french nobleman did indeed look enlightened but then he asked what are these skinks why lizards of course peculiar lizards thoughi will say that victor radcliff answered theyre short and stout as lizards go they have no eyes but their front feet are broad and strong and their tongues uncommonly long and clever they dig through dirt after worms and bugsonly in summer in these northern lands but yeararound farther south where the weather stays milder they can be pests in gardens or on wellmown lawns on account of the furrows they leave they do sound like moles de la fayette said save that they are of the reptile kind rather than being furry but has atlantis no true moles no more than we have any other viviparous quadrupeds except bats victor replied we have now the usual domestic beasts and rats and mice plague our towns and houses deer and foxes course the woods along with wild dogs and cats settlers brought all those beasts though this was a land of birds and scaly things before they came and yet terranova beyond atlantis has an abundance of productions much like europes de la fayette said how could this be so the first man who learns the truth there will write his name in large letters amongst those of the leading savants of his day victor said but what that truth may be i have not the faintest idea i am more interested in learning how to winkle general cornwallis out of croydon you do not believe we can storm this line do you victor didnt like answering a question with a question but he wanted to find out what the frenchman thought de la fayettes shrug held a certain eloquence it would be difficult victor sighed steam puffed from his mouth and nostrils the day was chilly they do have good engineers the new english line before croydon took advantage of every little swell of ground it was also far enough outside the town to keep atlantean and french field guns from bearing on the harbor that meant the attackers couldnt keep the royal navy from resupplying cornwallis heaven only knows what kind of butchers bill well pay to break in one larger than we should desire without doubt de la fayette said and victor could only nod glumly the marquis added our best course then appears to be to proceed by saps and parallels formal european siege warfare had had little place in atlantis victor and cornwallis had invested nouveau redon but they hadnt advanced towards it a line at a time cornwallis clever engineers had stopped the spring instead which made the defenders abandon the town for a sally with scant hope of success that will take some time victor said are you urgently required elsewhere de la fayette inquired well no victor admitted but if the english choose to reinforce their garrison while we dig we shall have wasted considerable effort so we shall what of it de la fayette said we shall also have wasted considerable effortand just as much timeif we merely encircle the english position better to do our utmost to force a surrender nestcepas mm victor radcliff said when you put it that way how else would you have me put it the marquis asked and once we have demonstrated to the english commander that we are capable of making the approaches effecting a breach how can he do anything but surrender is that the custom in europe victor said most assuredly de la fayette replied continuing the battle after a breach is made would be merely a pointless effusion of blood dont you think if you say so victor replied if de la fayette thought that way cornwallis likely would too they fought in the same style victor thought there were times when he would keep fighting as long as he had one man left who could aim a musket but he was only an atlantean bumpkinin the eyes of europeans just a short step better than a copperskinso what did he know i do say so de la fayette insisted saps and parallels then victor said and the frenchman nodded saps and parallels were part of a soldiers jargon even victor radcliff whod never used them or even seen them used knew of them and they were always mentioned that way always saps and parallels never parallels and saps in the field though the parallel always came first people could argue about the chicken and the egg but not about the sap and the parallel one evening under the profane direction of their engineers french soldiers began digging a trench aligned with the stretch of enemy works the army would eventually assail that was how the parallel got its name the frenchmen threw up the dirt they excavated on the side where it would protect them from english fire at that range four or five hundred yardsonly a lucky shot could hit anyone but the game had its rules and when the redcoats realized what was going on so many shots would fly through the air that some were bound to be lucky realization came at sunrise the next morning cornwallis knew the same tricks as de la fayette they might have sprung from different kingdoms but it was as if theyd attended the same college as soon as cornwallis saw that growing parapet protecting the first parallel he did what any other commanding officer in his unpleasant position would have done he started shooting at it with everything he could bring to bear musketeers banged away by the lead they expended they might have been mining the stuff under croydon most of the bullets either fell short or thumped into the dirt of the parapet a few more likely by luck than by design just got over the top of the parapet and into the trench it warded wounded men went howling back toward the surgeons one unfortunate fellow caught a musket ball in the side of the head and simply fell over dead before he hit the ground english field guns also opened up on the parallel the parapet swallowed some cannon balls but others got through some skipped harmlessly between soldiers that was uncommon luck a cannon ball could knock down three or four men and too often did cornwallis stayed busy back in croydon too his men soon found or made mortars as the atlanteans had outside of hanover mortars had no trouble at all throwing their shells over the parapet and down into the parallel at least as often as not that didnt matter english fuses were as unreliable as the ones victor radcliffs artillerists used sometimes the mortar bombs burst in the air very often they failed to burst at all every once in a while though everything would go as the artillerists wished it would all the time then the shell would go off just when the gunners had in mind and the exploding powder would work a fearful slaughter but it didnt happen often enough to keep men out of the trench when the first parallel got long enough to satisfy de la fayettes engineers theyor rather french soldiers and now atlanteans with thembegan digging a zigzag trench toward the english outworks a sap because of the way the sap ran it was harder to protect than the parallel had been more mangled men went off to the surgeons some would get better after their ministrationsalthough a good many of those no doubt would have got better without those ministrations others would get wounds that festered and would slowly and painfully waste away so war was so war had always been so as far as victor radcliff could tell war would ever be are the redcoats likely to sally victor asked as the sap snaked closer to the enemy line i dont think so not yet de la fayette answered look how much open ground they would have to cross before they could interrupt us our musketeers and your fine riflemen and the cannon would slaughter too many of them to make it worthwhile when we draw closer that may prove a different story victor grunted like so many things de la fayette said the frenchmans explanation made such good sense victor wondered why he hadnt thought of it himself of course cornwallis would wait till theyd dug another parallel or two before trying to disrupt the excavations with his foot soldiers victor would have done the same thing himself he rode back to a high point so he could survey croydon and his harbor with his spyglass the royal navy frigates were gone but several tubby merchantmen had taken their place tiny in the distance even through his lenses stevedores carried sacks of grain off the ships and into the town victor swore under his breath atlanteans and frenchmen would have to break through the defenses in front of croydon for they would never starve the redcoats out no big guns there then no nasty warships neither blaise said when victor gave him that bit of intelligence he added where did the royal navy go when will it come back if i knew i would tell you victor replied and if you are about to ask me why the frigates set sail i also know that not blaise chuckled i could have done that well myself so could any man here victor said perchance those frigates may return or firstrate ships of the line may take their place or then again the english may prove content with wallowing scows like the ones now tied up in croydon they give cornwallis and his redcoats their necessary victuals and no doubt a copious supply of powder and lead they have been shooting enough of it blaise agreed too much victor said damn me if they have not well we did not think this war would be easy when we began it most atlanteans i daresay failed to believe we could win it you did not always believe that yourself blaise reminded him you went around preaching that we must not lose that so long as we stayed in the fight england would tire of it sooner or later i did victor radcliff had to think back to what now seemed very distant days indeed after a sheepish chuckle he found himself nodding i did sure enough it may yet come to that you know even if we beat them here the english can mount another invasionif they have the will to attempt it what if they do the negro asked victor shrugged we fight on we stay in the field we refuse to own ourselves beaten come what may you see the same song i sang before we radcliffs are a stubborn clan say whatever else you will of us then you need someone stubborn enough to stay beside you blaise said and tapped the chevrons on his arm smiling victor slapped him on the back the second parallel as before the soil went up on the side facing croydons defenses this trench being closer to the redcoats works the frenchmen and atlanteans who manned it took more casualties the english artillerists got as good with their mortars as anyone could with those balky weapons the besiegers dug shelters into the sides of the trench and dove into them when the shells came hissing down then it rainednot so hard as it had on the day when victors attack went awry but hard enough the rain softened the dirt which should have made digging easier but who wanted to dig when he sank ankledeep in mud if he tried the parapet in front of the trench displayed an alarming tendency to sag too firing from the english trenches slackened but it didnt stop the redcoats had had plenty of time to strengthen their works while their foes dug some of their men fired from shelters adequate to keep their powder dry some of their mortars still tossed hate into the air one shell splashed down into a puddle that doused its fuse drown you son of a bitch shouted the closest atlantean infantryman within a day half the atlanteans were telling the story so were a quarter of de la fayettes french soldiersit was easy enough to translate the rain changed to sleet and the sleet changed to snow the ground went from too soft to work with conveniently to too hard to work with conveniently all in the space of a couple of days atlanteans and frenchmen shivered in huts and tents no doubt the redcoats were chilly too but they had croydons snug houses in which to lodge watching smoke rise from chimneys in town victor said sooner or later theyll run short of firewood soon enough to do us any good blaise asked i dont know victor admitted how much wood did they have before the siege began how cold will the winter be how many of the croydonites chattels will the redcoats bum to keep from corning down with chilblains as many as they need to blaise said without hesitation i shouldnt wonder victor said shivering atlanteans would do the samehe was sure of that instead they had plenty of timber close by but wood freshly cut would smoke horribly when it went onto the fire that wouldnt stop his men from using it but the soot would make them look like negroes if they kept on for very long we need more picks fewer shovels de la fayette said a couple of days later we are chipping at the ground more than digging through it well so we are victor said unless your blacksmiths feel like beating spades into picksan eventuality of which the good book says nothingi know not where we shall come by them off the countryside de la fayette said hopefully good luck victor replied maybe we can get a few but unless we pay well for them our own farmers will start shooting at us from ambush they would not do that the marquis exclaimed ha victor said and then again louder ha that done he proceeded to embellish on the theme your grace chances are you know more about how they fight in europe than i do youd better but i promise you thisi know more about atlantean fanners and what theyre likely to do than youve ever imagined it could be very probably it is french peasants however would not behave so de la fayette said next time i campaign in france ill remember that victor said for now you need to remember youre campaigning in atlantis i am not likely to forget it the french nobleman replied tartly enough to suggest that while he conceded he wasnt lost on the trackless prairies of northern terranova beyond the great river he also didnt see himself as being so tar away from those buffalothundering grasslands after pausing just long enough to let that sink in he continued one reminder is the weather how soon can we resume our excavations even if we obtain picks will we be able to do so at all before spring well i dont exactly know victor held up a hand before de la fayette could speak nobody exactly knows the weatheri understand that but i dont even approximately know i do not spring from this part of atlantis and i have not spent sufficient time up here to have a good feel for whats likely to come some of your men will though de la fayette suggested cant hurt to ask victor said and instructed one of his messengers grinning the youngster said id make my own guesses sir but im from down in freetown myself so they wouldnt be worth an at he broke off flushing to the roots of his hair they wouldnt be worth much i mean ill go fetch somebody who was born around here he dashed away as if his breeches were on fire victor radcliff stared sourly after him wouldnt be worth an atlantean the messenger hadnt quite swallowed when the atlantean assemblys own followers scorned the paper the assembly issued when such a thing happened you knew that paper had lost more value than you wished it would have the messenger quickly returned with a sergeant who gave his name as saul andrews and who said i come from a farm about twenty miles from here never strayed far from it neither general not till i picked up a musket and went to war with you sure enough he used the flat vowels and muffled final fs of a croydon man good enough victor replied how long do you expect this harsh cold spell to last andrews glanced up at the sky whatever he saw there only made him shrug well now sir thats a mite hard to calculate he said if its a hard winter it could stay this way till spring ive seen it do that very thing but if its not so hard well get some warm spells betwixt and between the freezes which ive also seen if you had to guess victor prompted sergeant andrews shrugged the good lord knows but he aint told me only thing i can say is we got to wait and see all right sergeant you may go victor said stifling a sigh andrews departed with almost as many signs of relief as the messenger had shown a few minutes earlier try as victor would he couldnt get angry at the man custis cawthorne had tried using barometer and thermometerboth of which hed had to make himselfto foretell the weather and sometimes hed been right and sometimes hed been wrong anyone whod lived out in the open long enough to grow up could have done as well without fancy devices so people delighted in telling cawthorne too till he finally gave up and sold the meteorological instruments for what the glass and quicksilver would bring he does not know de la fayettes english was imperfect but hed got the gist no he doesnt this time victor did sigh i dont suppose anyone else will either as he said we just have to wait and see very well by the way de la fayette said it it wasnt but even a young headstrong nobleman understood that a power higher than he controlled the weather we shall just have to be ready to take advantage of the good and do our best to ride out the bad victor radcliff set a hand on his shoulder welcome to life your grace in due course the parallel advanced again then a blizzard froze the ground hard as iron and digging perforce stopped the wind howled down from the northwest snow swirled and danced the redcoats defensive works and their foes saps and parallels vanished under a blanket of white almost everything vanished in fact while the storm raged victor had trouble seeing out to the end of his arm he wondered if he could turn that to his and atlantis advantage cornwallis men would have trouble seeing too attackers might be able to get very close to their works before getting spotted if anything went wrong as they approached though since he had trouble making up his mind he held a council of war to see what his officersand the french most of whom needed translationthought of the idea as he might have guessed they split pretty evenly if anything goes wrongeven the least little thingyouve spilled the thundermug into the stewpot one major said if things go the way we want them to we walk into croydon a captain countered both those notions had been in victors mind his officers had as much trouble weighing them one against the other as he did the glory of victory complete and absolute de la fayette said enthusiastically whether his officers were or not he was ready to attack he seemed so very ready in fact that he made baron von steuben stir we have in hand the game the german veteran said with saps and parallels sooner or later we are sure to win or almost an attack even an attack in schneeah snowand we all this risk why take the chance only a snake could look at things in a more coldblooded way de la fayette saidnot quite the insult direct but close a touchy officer might have called him out for it von steuben only smiled and bowed do not down your nose at snakes look your grace he said there are in this world of them a great many and most of them seem uncommonly well fed i should rather fight like a man de la fayette said no one says to on your belly crawl to the redcoats lines and bite in the leg an english sergeant this is more likely you than him to poison von steuben replied the atlantean officers laughed right away after the joke was translated so did most of the frenchmen even de la fayette smiled von steuben went on yes you should like a man fight but you should also like a smart man not like some dumbhead fight is it not so plainly de la fayette wanted nothing more than to tell him it was not so just as plainly the frenchman couldnt not unless he wanted to make a liar of himself all but choking on the words de la fayette said it is so good very good von steuben might have been patting a puppy on the head not talking to his nominal superior you can things learn give yourself a chance longer to live and you will more things learn de la fayette looked more affronted than von steuben had when the french noblethe genuine french noble victor reminded himselfcalled him coldblooded but all von steuben had accused him of was being young time would cure that unless he did something foolish enough to get himself killed before it could the council of war went on a while longer after the exchange between von steuben and de la fayette as victor soon saw though men on both sides of the question were only kicking it back and forth in the same track that left it up to him well it had always been up to him but now he had to look the fact square in the face well wait he said well go on digging as best we can if matters develop differently from the way we now expect well in that case chances are croydon will see another blizzard before winters out you took that german cochons word over mine de la fayette said hotly as the council broke up i will take good advice wherever i can find it victor replied he was right failure would cost more than we can afford whilst success is apt to come down without the attack if rather more slowly are you a general or a bookkeeper ive been both victor said one is not the opposite of the other de la fayettes response was funny sad and pungently obscene all at once very french in other words then he added i wish i could change your mind a lot of people have said that down through the years victor answered with a shrug far more resigned than the ones hed got from saul andrews not many of them have done it though radcliffs are good at going straight ahead or stopping short not so good at turning good at stopping short when you should go straight ahead de la fayette observed and walked off with the last word if not with what he wanted bright sunshine greeted victor when he got up the next morning squinting against its glare off snow he knew his men would have got slaughtered had they tried to storm the english works even had he agreed to the attack the night before he would have had to call it off now sometimes what a man wanted or didnt want had nothing to do with anything he simply had to make the best of the hand he got dealt victor set his men to shoveling snow out of the entrenchments that worked toward the redcoats lines once theyd thrown out enough so they could move around fairly freely they started hacking away at the frozen ground the parallel advanced again cornwallis soldiers shoveled snow out of their trenches too they made it as plain as they possibly could that they wouldnt give up without a fight they went right on shooting at the diggers in the parallel every so often they hit somebody being able to go back to croydon when they werent on duty they had better quarters than the atlanteans and frenchmen investing their lines english ships kept coming into port too which meant the redcoats were bound to be better supplied than their foes but the english soldiers remained shut up in one tiny corner of atlantis cornwallis didnt seem to think they had the strength to break out against victors army if they could be beaten here they would have to try some massive new invasion to make the war go on if in due course the french engineers pronounced themselves satisfied with the second parallel a new sap angled toward the english line with muskets and mortars the redcoats showed how little they appreciated the compliment then a fresh snowstorm shrieked down from the north the digging had to stop for several days victor radcliff swore and fumed but he could do no more about the weather than blaise or sergeant saul andrews or any other mortal all he could do was hope the storm blew itself out before longand hope his troops stayed healthy long enough to let them attack the englishmen he could do no more about that than he could about the weather at least the weather is cold victor said to blaise there seem to be fewer sicknesses at this season than in warmer times what about chest fever the negro retorted what about catarrh what about tirewhat do you call itthe grippe well those are troublesome victor admitted but i was thinking of fluxes of the bowels and of the plague and even of smallpox and measles they are seen more often in spring and summerespecially the first two they probably stay frozen in this snow and ice the way meat does blaise rolled his eyes who would have thought you could keep meat fresh as long as you froze it in the country i come from we have to smoke it or salt it or dry it or eat it right away i never saw icei never imagined icetill you white men dragged me here kind of you to admit ice is good for something victor said you are not always so generous if you could keep it in a box and use it for what it is good for that would be fine blaise said when it lies all over the countryside and tries to freeze off your fingers and your toes and your prong then that is too much his shiver was melodramatic and sincere at the same time we will be warmer once we break into croydon victor said i have said the same to the men advancing the sap i can think of nothing better calculated to inspire them to dig it would inspire me by the lord jehovah blaise exclaimed but some of you white men like this weather i have heard some of you say so if you tell me now that these men are not mad i will not believe you i also think they are victor could take it no further than that as he knew too well some atlanteansand some frenchmen toodid relish winter for its own sake he liked cold weather himself he liked coming in out of it warming himself in front of a roaring fire and sipping from a flagon of mulled wine or flip the tasty concoction of rum and beer spending much time in it was a different story as far as he was concerned time dragged on the sap moved closer to the redcoats line which meant they sent all the more musket balls and mortar shells and roundshot at the men digging it the third parallel would be very close indeed the sap that led out from it would break into the english works after that and after a clash and a show of resistance general cornwallis could yield with honor he could yes but would he in a fight to the finish his men had at least some hope of beating the atlanteans and frenchmen opposing them since he led the last english force in atlantis mightnt he feel obligated to fight as hard as he could if he did win he kept the war alive every time victor tried to decide what cornwallis would do he came up with a different answer the english general certainly was conscious of his honor victor had seen that in the fight against the french settlers was he also conscious of the political demands his position imposed on him how could he fail to be and yet people werent always sensible or cleverfar from it there was no sure way to judge till attackers swarmed into the breach then the atlantean commander found something new to worry about for a courier from hanover brought him a letter in a hand he found far too familiar hed never dreamt he would recognize marcel freycinets script so readily no matter what hed dreamt he did the letter was cheerful enough freycinet assured him that louise was doing well and that the slave and her owner both anticipated her safe passage through birthing time take heart monsieur le general and be of good cheer freycinet wrote such things have happened since the days of adam and eve you have nothing to be ashamed of rather pride yourself on your virility victor would have been happier to do that had any of the children meg gave him lived to grow up he could not wish for louises baby to die untimely but neither could he wish his sole descendant to be sold on the auction block like a cow or a sheep nor could he buy the child himself not when doing so would show his wife hed been unfaithful that left victor burned monsieur freycinets letter on the brazier in his tent it left nothing he could see nothing at all hed been scrabbling for a way out since he first learned his bedwarmer was with child he had yet to find one scrabble as he would since he couldnt do anything about what was going on far to the south he threw his energy into the siege of croydon even in the snow he kept digging parties hacking away at the hard ground a thaw came just after new years day as the last one had it turned saps and parallels into morasses and made parapets slump no doubt the redcoats were similarly discommoded but their works were already in place they werent trying to extend them and trying not to drown at the same time confound it there has to be something between ground thats rock and ground thats soup victor complained what you want for it to be is summer again baron von steuben said and soon enough it will be it will be yes but not soon enough victor said for fighting maybe not for anything else summer comes sooner every year the german said so does winter he wasnt much older than victor was himself which didnt mean he didnt have a point victor had noticed the same thing himself years used to stretch out deliciously ahead of him now each one seemed shorter than its predecessor before he had time to get to know it it disappeared and once time was gone could even god call it back again before long louises light brown baby would be born before long the boyor would it be a girlwould be sold marcel freycinet would pocket considerably more than thirty pieces of silver everyone would be happy except victor and probably the little child who was flesh of his flesh baron von steuben said something whatever it was victor missed it crave pardon he murmured the german pointed out to sea here come more english ships he repeated may the woodworms eat them all below the waterline that would be splendid victor agreed devil take me if those be not firstrate ships of the line too from close in to shore their guns may even reach the spot where we hope to breach cornwallis lines a ball from a long twentyfourpounder can do horrid things to a man so can a ball from a musket von steuben said which was true but had scant flavor to it his hard weathered features folded into a frown it does not seem as if they hope to tie up so it doesnt victor replied i wonder why not they have to be more stupid than you would expect even from an englishman von steuben said victor radcliff wondered what kind of opinion general cornwallis held about the german soldiers of fortune from hesse and brunswick and other petty states who took king georges silver and fought for england similarly low he wouldnt have been surprised he watched the menofwar working their way toward croydon against mostly contrary breezes when all of them presented their broadsides to the town at the same time a sudden mad hope caromed through him he ducked back into his tent for the spyglass aiming the long brass tube out into the atlantic he drew out the slimmer part to bring the warships into focus and when he saw them clear when he saw them clear he began to caper like a fool or like a man possessed theyre french ships he shouted french i tell you french wassagen sie von steuben demanded though victor didnt know how he could have made himself any clearer a moment later all the ships fired together tons of hot flying iron crashed down on croydon chapter it had snowed again blanketing the ground with white while the flakes flew the french ships refrained from bombarding croydon maybe they didnt want to shoot at what they couldnt see victor radcliff didnt know how much difference it made theyd already gone a long way toward smashing the town and started several fires and theyd captured three english merchantmen that tried to sneak into croydon under cover of the snowfall it hadnt screened them well enough the french ships of the line might not have wanted to fire at croydon through the swirling snow but they werent shy about shooting at the blockaderunners all the merchantmen struck their colors in short order somehow the french warships must have won a battle against the royal navy out on the open sea victor could imagine nothing else that accounted for their presence here that wasnt quite a miracle from on high but it came closer than anything else hed seen lately general general several excited men shouted outside his tent one outdid the rest an englishmans coming out with a white flag god bless my soul victor murmured he hurried out to see for himself blaise at his heels the atlanteans out there all pointed at once victor needed none of those outthrust index fingers the enemy soldiers flag of truce might be scarcely visible against the snow on the ground but his scarlet uniform tunic stood out like spilled blood too much blood spilled already victor thought bring him to me at once he ordered aloud show him every courtesy unless i should be very much mistaken this war is about to end here that was plenty to send his own soldiers dashing off toward the parallel closest to the enemys works by the time they got there men already in the parallel had taken charge of the redcoat they offered him no abuse they too could see he had but one likely reason for coming forth by the time hed made his way back through the trenches to victors tent he had close to a companys worth of atlanteans and frenchmen escorting him you are general radcliff sir he asked formally after lowering the flag of truce and delivering a precise salute none other victor said and you would be captain horace grimsley sir the english officer replied general cornwallis compliments and he has sent me to ask of you the terms you require for the cessation of hostilities between our two armies under the present unfortunate circumstances he couldnt help looking out to sea where the french warships bobbed in the waves with their recent prizeshe feels we have no reasonable expectation of successfully resisting the forces in arms against us my compliments back to the general captain and to yourself as well victor said by all means tell him that i am pleased to treat with you and that the forces under his command have fought bravely and well thank you he told me you would show yourself to be a gentleman by the way grimsley spoke he hadnt believed a word of it and your terms would be victor had been thinking about them since the moment the french menofwar appeared off croydon your men will stack their arms and surrender officers may keep their swords in token of your brave resistance a gentleman indeed captain grimsley said under his breath no surrendered soldier or officer will take up arms against the united states of atlantis until he shall have been properly exchanged victor continued agreed grimsley said weapons excepted men may keep one knapsacks worth of personal effects apiece victor said property above that amount shall be reckoned spoils of war and will be divided amongst atlanteans and frenchmen in a manner we shall determine we shall undertake to preserve your mens lives and the aforesaid personal effects unharmed so long as you continue to comply with the terms of the surrender agreed grimsley repeated but then he asked by weapons sir do you mean to include common eating knives dirks daggers and bayonets upon surrender your men will no longer need their bayonets which will prove a useful accession to our own stocks victor paused a moment to think they may retain knives with blades shorter than hmm twelve inches is that satisfactory to you after his own brief consideration captain grimsley nodded it will do very well victor radcliffs tone hardened one thing more our promise of safety and property does not apply to the individuals enrolled in what is commonly termed biddiscombes horsed legion those men are traitors against the united states of atlantis and shall be used accordingly oh dear general cornwallis feared you would say something to that effect sir grimsley replied he instructed me to tell you that singling them out for oppressive treatment is in no way acceptable to him no eh victor growled why the devil not because they are king georges subjects in the same way as his majestys other soldiers in and around croydon theyre atlanteans theyre traitors victor said were general cornwallis now besieging rather than conversely you would all be reckoned traitors against the king captain grimsley reminded him maybe so and do you think he wouldnt single out redcoats whod chosen to fight for the atlantean assembly victor said we have a good many of them in our ranks including some of our best drillmasters i shouldnt wonder at that grimsley said to the english eye atlantean soldiers still fell woefully short on spit and polish nothing victor didnt already know cornwallis plenipotentiary went on my principal will not permit any english subjects to be unjustly mistreated they are atlanteans victor said again they have given aid and comfort to the enemies of the united states of atlantis they have tried to kill us by god sir they have killed us most recently at the start of this siege how can youhow can your commanderreckon them anything but traitors they are not traitors to the king until this war began all atlanteans were and saw themselves as his majestys subjects how can you condemn these men for holding to their prior allegiance aha victor radcliff aimed a finger at him as if it were a sharpshooters rifle i have you now i might be prepared to accept your claim for men who fought against us from the beginning but you will know as well as i sir that habakkuk biddiscombe served in the army of the united states of atlantis until dissatisfied with his prospects amongst us he suddenly discovered an undying loyalty to king george he turned his coat in other words if that does not make him a traitor i am hard pressed to imagine what would the same holds true for most of his followers general cornwallis sees the matter differently grimsley said in his view these men were but rediscovering their original allegiance thats pretty victor said it means nothing but its pretty you go tell him i want those men if he should choose not to yield them the siege will continue until we storm the breach the cannonading from the ships offshore will also continue how long before famine does our work for us grimsley bit his lip he had no answer for that neither did cornwallis or he would not have asked for terms at last the english captain said may i beg a truce of twentyfour hours to take your words back to my superiors for their consideration certainly victor said but unless their answer suits me i fear the conflict must continue i understand sir please accept my assurances that i wish with all my heart circumstances were otherwise with that captain grimsley took his leave naturally the line the atlanteans and frenchmen held around croydon ran from sea to sea as naturally some parts of it were held with greater force than others the redcoats manned their line the same way they concentrated most of their strength against the saps and parallels that brought their foes up close to their works and victor radcliff likewise kept most of his troops in and near those precious trenches anything else would have invited disaster later he realized he should have wondered when the redcoat asked for a truce stretching through the night but that was later at the time the request seemed reasonable enough grimsley had refused a condition victor saw as essential cornwallis and his leading officers might well need some time to decide whether to yield up the men whod fought so ferociously on their side for that matter victor felt he needed his own council of war if they insist on our keeping biddiscombe and his men prisoners of war like any other how shall we respond he asked his officers shall we allow it for the sake of the victory or shall we say we must have the villains heads let the pigdogs go baron von steuben said at once the surrender wins the war that is the point of the business we can win the war even if the redcoats dont surrender an atlantean retorted the redcoats wouldnt ask for terms if they werent at the end of their rope thats where biddiscombe and his buggers ought to beat the end of a rope another atlantean officer twisted his head to one side stuck out his tongue and did his best to make his eyes bulge a gruesomely excellent imitation of a hanged man the laugh that rose in the tent held a fierce baying undertone victor wasnt the only one there who wanted habakkuk biddiscombe dead but did he want biddiscombe dead badly enough to make it an issue that might disrupt cornwallis surrender most of his officers certainly seemed to as councils of war had a way of doing this one produced more heat than light several men had to get between a captain who favored flaying biddiscombe and sprinkling salt on his bleeding flesh before hanging him and a major who thought letting him be treated as an englishman was a reasonable price to pay for a surrender wearily victor dismissed his subordinates what will you do general one of them asked make up my mind come morning he answered then why did you call the council the man said to learn whether i might be able to make up my mind tonight victor told him but as both sides have strong arguments in their favor i need more time to decide what best serves us at this crucial hour his officers had to be content with that muttering they went off to their own tents victor turned to blaise the man in me wants to see biddiscombe at the end of a rope he said the general says i should do as von steuben suggests and let him go for the sake of victory chances are you get the victory anyway blaise answered i know victor said but theres also the chance that something may go wrong if i delay i know not how badly those french ships worsted the royal navy if an english fleet should suddenly appear off croydon all our work would of necessity commence again not all of it the negro said we have got close to the redcoats line now when we break in what can they do victor radcliff smiled yes there is that you know as much of siege warfare these days as any atlantean officer more than a stupid nigger would eh blaise said not without an edge to his voice do i maltreat you or reckon you less than a man because your skin is black victor asked he waited at last blaise shook his head all right then victor said where before you came to atlantis would you have learned of saps and parallels it is not a matter of stupidity my friendonly inexperience set me amongst your folk and i should make the most useless of spearmen ah blaise considered that yes it could be but you would be able to learn i hope so you have certainly learned a good deal here victor said not always things i want to learn blaise said i shouldnt wonder victor followed the words with a yawn he stepped out of the tent and looked over toward croydon most windows in the town were dark or showed only the dim sunset glow of banked embers firelight did pour from two or three buildings in one of those cornwallis and his officers were probably still hashing out what to do victor wished he could have been a fly on the wall at that conclave his breath smoked his ears started to tingle he would have been a chilly fly on the wallhe was glad to duck back under canvas it wasnt warm inside the tent but it was warmer youll sleep on it then blaise said yes ill sleep on it victor nodded maybe ill be wiser come morning or maybe ill seem wiser at any rate he pulled off his boots and shed his hat other than that he lay down on the cot fully dressed even with two thick woolen blankets he was glad for every extra bit of cloth between him and winter would he really be or at least seem wiser after the sun came up he could hope so anyhow he closed his eyes before long he slept general general shouts pierced dreams of an earthquake no the world wasnt falling down around him someone was shakinghad shakenhim awake it was still dark whats gone wrong victor asked blurrily something must have or they would have left him alone till dawn theres fighting general over in the northeast on the far side of the line answered the man whod been doing the shaking a pox victor groped for his boots found them and tugged them on the far side of croydon from the encampment was also the weakestheld part of his lines are the redcoats breaking out if they were going to do it anywhere they were most likely to try there somebody sure as hell is the atlantean soldier said victor hurried outside he could hear muskets boom from that direction and could see muzzle flashes piercing the night like fierce fireflies not all the booms came from muskets even at this distance a trained ear like his could tell pistol shots from musketry there were quite a few of them he suddenly thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand biddiscombe he exclaimed and it was as much a howl of selfreproach as a naming of the man likely leading that attack the horsed legion what had been going on all night in croydon why general cornwallis and his officers were trying to decide whether to throw habakkuk biddiscombe and his troop of horsemen over the side to keep the french ships and the atlantean and french armies from pounding them to jelly captain grimsley had insisted that cornwallis would never abandon biddiscombes horsed legion but if the redcoats would never abandon their local allies why were they talking deep into the night about doing exactly that why indeed now too late victor could read habakkuk biddiscombes thoughts if the english army changed its mind and decided to give him and his men to the rebel atlanteans they were all as good as dead and if the redcoats refused to cough up the horsed legion and the rebel atlanteans and the french broke into croydonwhich seemed all too likelyhe and his followers were also as good as dead breaking out offered more hope than either of those chances or maybe cornwallis had gone to biddiscombe and said something like i wish things were otherwise but they are as they are i have no way to protect you flight seems your best hope if you attempt it i shall look the other way whilst you ready yourselves cornwallis was bound to deny any bargain like that so was habakkuk biddiscombe victor doubted he would ever be able to prove a thing but he could see the scene in his minds eye all the same what do we do sir asked the soldier whod wakened him try to stop them of course victor snapped but some of them would break throughno some of them had already broken through victor could see that by the places from which the gunfire was coming theyd hit the weakest point in his line all right was that good generalship was it fool luck or had someone gone over and told them where to strike in a fight like this with so much betrayal on both sides could you be sure of anything victor was sure of one thing from this moment on those men are outlaws to be run down like wild dogs they will leave tracks in the snow as soon as we have light by which to follow them we shall hunt them to destruction what if the whole english army goes after em the soldier said look at croydon victor waved toward the town which was quiet and even darker now than it had been before he went to bed not the slightest sign of that no its biddiscombe trying to get away while the getting is good and cornwallis glad to rid himself of an embarrassment he added but only to himself he couldnt prove that now odds were he would never be able to which didnt mean he didnt believe it and didnt mean he didnt respect and even admire the english commander for so neatly disposing of his problem captain horace grimsley gave victor another of his precise salutes general cornwallis compliments as before sir and he bids me tell you no outstanding reason remains that he should not accept the terms of surrender you proposed yesterday my compliments to your commander in return victor said you may also tell him we have slain or captured a good many members of biddiscombes horsed legion and that we hope to be rid of every one of the villains before too long it was convenient for your principal that they chose to decamp under cover of darkness the english officer looked back at him with no expression whatever general cornwallis wishes me to assure you that he had no prior knowledge of colonel biddiscombes intentions and that neither he nor anyone else in our force assisted or abetted the horsed legion in any way i bet he wants you to assure me of that victor said do you presume to doubt his word sir grimsley asked coldly damned right i doubt it victor answered whether i doubt it enough to throw away the truce and tell those french ships to start firing again that is another story once weve disarmed your lot well be able to send more of our men after biddiscombe with the war as good as won not so many people will care to help or hide him it could be so captain grimsley admitted then he said if you have truly cast off his majesty king georges rule shall we now commence to style you king victor the first no victor said and then again louder no we shall endeavor to make do without kings from here on out foolishness grimsley said perhaps it is but it is our own foolishness which is the point of the matter victor said and we reckon it a worse one to owe attachment to a sovereign across the broad sea a sovereign who knows little of us and cares less a sovereign in whose parliament we are suffered to have no members better no sovereign at all we think than such a sovereign as that he wondered if he would get through to the redcoat but captain grimsley only shrugged sometimes its better to have a king who pays you no heed than one who pays too much look at frederick of prussiayou cant walk into a backhouse there without paying a turd tax to some collector victor smiled all the same he said better not to have to worry that the next king of england will take after frederick then and from this day forth captain no king of england good bad or indifferent shall tell us what to do i cannot speak to that sir grimsley said have you the terms of surrender properly written out for me to convey them to general cornwallis i do victor said you will note i have lined through the provision pertaining to biddiscombes horsed legion and initialed the deletion i should be grateful if general cornwallis did likewise along with signing the document as i have done your courtesy is appreciated grimsley said if all proves satisfactory to the general shall we set the formal ceremony of surrender for noon tomorrow should any questions arise before then you may be certain i shall come out to confer with you concerning them noon tomorrow that is agreeable to me victor held out his hand after momentary hesitation captain grimsley shook it the englishman also saluted after the handclasp when i came here i never dreamt it would end this way he remarked that is always true for one side in a war victor answered the united states of atlantis no more wish to be englands enemies than we wished to be her subjects as equals in the comity of nations one day we may become friends i suppose we may captain grimsley said i doubt however whether it will be any day soon having won the last word if not the last battle he took the surrender terms back into croydon victor radcliff wore the best of his three generals coats and the better of his two tricorns under the tricorn hed even donned a powdered pigtailed periwig for the occasion his generals sash stretched from one shoulder to the other hip on his belt swung the atlantean assemblys goldhilted sword his men were drawn up in neat ranks outside of croydon they looked as spruce and uniform as they could after long service in the field not all of them could boast clean breeches their green jackets were of many different shades most of them wore tricorns a few even in wintertime had only farmers straw hats more than a few went bareheaded but they all had muskets and most of them had bayonets the long steel blades glittered in the cold sunlight they might not be so elegant as their english counterparts but theyd proved they could fight across the way the marquis de la fayette had assembled the soldiers hed brought from france they looked more nearly uniform than the atlanteans did theyd proved themselves in battle too victor waved to de la fayette the frenchman returned the gesture inside croydon church bells began to ring the hour victor had a pocket watch which ran fairly well when he remembered to wind it at the moment it was five minutes slowor possibly croydons clocks were five minutes fast one way or the other it hardly mattered general cornwallis would have no doubt that noon had come and he didnt the redcoats formed on the frozen meadow in front of the town hall then flags flying and band playingat first faint in the distance but soon louder and louderthey marched toward the assembled atlanteans and frenchmen what tune are they playing blaise asked in a low voice after cocking his head to one side and listening for a moment victor answered i think its called the world turned upside down is it the negro grinned well good yes victor sometimes thought blaise found white mens music as curious as anything else in atlantis the songs blaise had brought from africa had different rhythmsnot less complex in fact perhaps more so but undoubtedly different then again that also mattered little here came the english army as the redcoats left their works and came out into the open between the ranks of the atlanteans and the french the band finished the world turned upside down and started a new tune not the most musical of men victor needed a moment to recognize god save the king some atlantean patriots had tried writing new words to the old music victor had heard several different versions none of which he liked maybe one day someone would come up with new words that really described what the united states of atlantis stood for what they meant and maybe that wouldnt happen for a while because who could really say right now what this untested country stood for or maybe a musician would find or make another tune better suited to this new free land in the middle of the sea one more thing victor could worry about later if he worried about it at all he caught the marquis de la fayettes eye again at his nod both commanders rode forward to meet general cornwallis who was also on horseback a bugle at the head of the english army blared out a call a leatherlunged sergeant echoed it in words allhalt the redcoats did then the sergeant bawled another command one that had no equivalent in horn calls stackarms half a dozen muskets went into each neat stack as the surrender terms had ordained a bayonet topped each brown bess a fair number of atlantean soldiers still carried hunting guns that couldnt even take a bayonet the longarms would definitely strengthen the new nations arsenal as victor and de la fayette drew near general cornwallis saluted each of them in turn the english commander was not far from victors age he looked older though or perhaps only wearier good to see you again victor said and you cornwallis replied you will i trust forgive me for saying i wish we were meeting once more under different circumstances of course victor nodded i do not believe youve made the acquaintance of the french commander he turned to de la fayette and switched languages monsieur le marquis i have the honor of presenting to you the english general charles cornwallis back to english general cornwallis here is the marquis de la fayette who leads our allys soldiers a privilege to meet you your grace cornwallis said in accented but fluent french your army played no small part in leading to to the result we see here today he didnt care to come right out and say something like in leading to our defeat well he could be forgiven that what man living didnt try to put the best face he could on misfortune i thank you for your kind words general de la fayette said in english sitting his horse along with the middleaged atlantean and english commanders he seemed even more outrageously young than he really was returning to french he went on i have never seen english soldiers fight less than bravely kind of you to say so sirvery kind indeed cornwallis murmured he turned back to victor when you winkled us out of hanover thats when things commenced to unravel dammit yes i think so too victor said hanover is our windpipe so to speak after we got your hands off it we could breathe freely once more just so cornwallis stared out to sea at the line of ships flying king louis fleursdelys and who could have dreamt the royal navy would let us down that i might lose on land is one thing but the navy has turned back all corners since the damned devil dutchmen back in the last century the pirates of avalon had also given the royal navy all it wanted and a little more besides victor remembered red rodney radcliffe far more fondly than his own clippede radcliff greatgrandfather had ever thought of the pirate chieftainhe was sure of that in days to come red rodney might yet be reckoned a symbol a harbinger of atlantean liberty at the time william radcliff had considered his own unloved and unloving cousin nothing but a goddamned bandit hed been right too symbols and harbingers were best viewed at a distance of a good many years cornwallis cough brought victor back to the hereandnow the english general reached for his sword if you want this no no victor held up a hand as i said in the terms of surrender you and your officers are welcome to your weapons you certainly did nothing to disgrace them but he couldnt help adding except perhaps by seeking to harbor habakkuk biddiscombe and his band of cutthroat traitors one sides villain is the others hero cornwallis answered we were comrades in arms once you and i against the marquis kingdom had things gone differently you would be the man blamed for turning his coat not biddiscombe had things gone differently atlantis might be joined to the terranovan mainland or even to the european victor said in either of those cases we would not be here discussing how things might have gone differently cornwallis smile was sad i find myself in a poor position to disagree with you as he spoke his men went on stacking their muskets after surrendering them the redcoats stepped back into line beneath their professional impassivity victor saw fear without weapons they were at their enemies mercy he would have cared for that no more than they did but that cup at least had passed from him far off in the distance gunshots rang out regardless of this surrender men from victors cavalry went on pursuing biddiscombes horsed legion if biddiscombes men rode far enough and fast enough some of them might get away odds were some of them would victor hoped his own followers would beat those odds and hunt down every last one how soon do you think we shall be sent back to england cornwallis asked word of your surrender will have to cross the atlantic victor said after that it depends on how soon his majestys government sends ships hither to transport you and on wind and wave on wind and wave your guess is as good as mine on his majestys government your guess should be better than mine i suspect you credit me with more than i deserve cornwallis said that his majestys government works is not to be denied how it works is not always given to mortal men to know when the ships come to repatriate you they will be most welcome that i promise victor said and i hope they will also bring representatives of king georges mysterious government so we can come to terms with it once for all and take our recognized place amongst the nations of the earth and also so that peace may be restored between the kingdoms of england and france de la fayette added in french hed followed the interchange in english between victor and cornwallis but preferred to comment in his own language yes that will also be necessary victor agreed switching to french himself frances aid to our cause both on land and at sea was most significant you would never have won without it cornwallis said there again we stray into mighthavebeens victor said do you believe his majestys government would have been prepared to put up with twenty years of raids and ambushes would it not eventually have decided atlantis was a running sore more costly of men and sterling than it was worth and gone off and left us to our own devices after twenty years of such annoyances it might well have done so cornwallis answered but your own followers also might well have given up the war as a bad job long before that had they seen no more immediate prospect of victory since that had always been victors greatest fear about having to resort to guerrilla warfare he couldnt very well call his beaten foe a liar instead he gruffly repeated mighthavebeens and let it go at that one thing more cornwallis said some anxiety in his voice now that we pass into your hands i trust you will be able to victual us until such time as we return to the mother country well manage victor knew he still sounded gruff he halfexplained why i fear it wont be boiled beef one day and roast capon the next our commissary cannot come close to that even for our own men but your troops will go no hungrier than we do ourselveson that you have my solemn word cornwallis glanced over toward the atlantean ranks your soldiers are leaner than mine as a general rule but i own that they are not famished very well sir if we must tighten our belts so be it i know that when you give your promise he to whom you give it may rely on it they are good men the atlanteans better even than i expected before i came here de la fayette said again in french meaning no disrespect to you general cornwallis but your country was foolish in the extreme in not doing everything it could to retain their affection and loyalty it could be that you have reason cornwallis replied in the same tongue or it could be that nothing we might have done would have retained them if a folk is determined to rise up rise up it will regardless of whether it has good cause victor hadnt wanted to lead atlantis into rebellion against england but plenty of prominent atlanteans had among them men as eminent as isaac fenner and custis cawthorne and england hadnt done everything it could to conciliate themnot even close all of which was water over the dam now no matter what we might have been we are the united states of atlantis he said and we shall seethe world will seewhat comes of that chapter spring in croydon some but not all of the robins had flown south for the winter all the birds that had were back now hopping and singing and digging worms from the thawed ground general cornwallis was amused when victor radcliff named them not my notion of robins the english general declared yes i know victor answered equably hed heard the like from englishmen before soon enough youll have your own little redbreasts back again even as he spoke redcoats filed aboard the ships the royal navy had sent to bring them home from atlantis many of them were thinner than they had been when they stacked their muskets but none had starved they might have been hungry but he knew the difference between hunger and hunger so did cornwallis you have met the obligation you set yourself he said no one could have treated captured foes more fairly for which i thank you victor said we have no wish to be your enemies as i tell englishmen whenever i find the chance so long as your country no longer seeks to impose its will on ours i hope and trust we can become friends may it be so cornwallis answered but you must work that out with the learned commissioners dispatched from london not with me i have no authority to frame a peace mine liesor i should say laysolely in the military sphere victor wasnt sure how much authority in the political sphere he had himself hed begun talks with king georges peace commissioners but hed had to warn them that the atlantean assembly might supersede him at any moment so far the assembly hadnt seen fit to do so back in honkers mill everyone still seemed amazed the united states of atlantis had emerged victorious victor cast no aspersions on the conscript fathers for that he was more than a little amazed himself have i your leave to take ship cornwallis asked formally you know you do victor said this is not your first visit to atlantis i hope one day you may come back here in peacetime the better to see how this new experiment in liberty progresses i should like that though i can make no promises cornwallis said as a soldier i remain at his majestys beck and callprovided he cares to call on a soldier proved unlucky in war well i am similarly at the service of the atlantean assembly victor said true cornwallis nod was glum but you are not similarly defeated he sketched a salute victor held out his hand cornwallis clasped it then slinging a duffel bag over his shoulder the english general strode toward the pier and marched down it with his men boarding the closest english ship he made his way back to the poop he would have a cabin there probably next to the captains and aboard ship he would no longer get his nose rubbed in atlantean egalitarianism he was a good fellow but victor doubted he would miss it a horseman trotted up general radcliff sir yes victor nodded what is it letter for you sir the courier handed it to him and rode away victor eyed the letter as if it were a mortar shell with the fuse hissing and about to explode he kept waiting for orders from the atlantean assembly and kept dreading the kind of orders the assembly might give he would go on waiting a while longer the letter was not addressed in the preternaturally neat hand of the assemblys secretary nor was it bedizened with the redcrested eagle the assembly had taken to using on its seal that did not mean the missive bore good news it also did not mean he failed to recognize the script in which it was addressed he had his doubts about whether he wanted to hear from the atlantean assembly if only he could forget hed ever heard from marcel freycinet he would have been the happiest man in the newly freed ecstatically independent united states of atlantis so he told himself anyhow which didnt mean he hadnt heard from freycinet he flipped the seal off the letter with his thumb it lay not far from his feet as he unfolded the paper a little brown sparrow hopped over and pecked at the wax finding it indigestible the bird fluttered off victor feared he would find the letters contents just as indigestible freycinet wasted no time beating around the bush i congratulate you he wrote you are the father of a large squalling baby boy louise is also doing well she has asked that he be named nicholas to which i am pleased to assent i pray god will allow him to remain healthy and mat he will continue to be an adornment for my household i remain sir your most obedient servant in all regards his scribbled signature followed a son victor muttered refolding the sheet of paper a son somewhere between mulatto and quadroon born into slavery not the offspring hed had in mind which was putting it mildly and if marcel freycinet chose or needed to sell the boy to sell nicholas radcliff only surviving son of victor radcliffhailed as liberator of atlantis but unable to liberate his own offspring well he would be within his rights suddenly and agonizingly victor understood the seventh commandment in a way he never had before god knew what he was doing when he thundered against adultery all right and why not least surely because adultery complicated mens lives and womens in ways nothing else could a bird called it was only one of the robins whose atlantean name general cornwallis and other englishmen so disdained all the same to victors ear it might have been a cuckoo hed hatched an egg in a nest not his own and now he had to hope other birds would feed and care for the fledgling as it deserved someones soles scuffed on the dirt beside him he looked up there stood blaise the negro pointed at the letter is it from the assembly no victor quickly tucked the folded sheet of paper into a breeches pocket merely an admirer blaise raised an eyebrow an admirer you say have you met her is she pretty not that sort of admirer at the momentespecially at this momentthat was the last sort victor wanted what other kind is worth having blaise asked when away from stella he could still think like that since he hadnt got roxanne with childand since he didnt know victor had impregnated louise i said nothing of whether this one was worth having victor answered warming to his theme this is a fellow who having read the reports of our final campaign in the papers in hanover is now convinced he could have taken charge of our army and the french and won more easily and quickly and with fewer casualties than we did if only he wore gilded epaulets he says we should have gained our liberty year before last oh one of those blaise said the lie convinced him all the more readily because victor had had several real letters in that vein a startling number of men whod never commanded soldiersand who probably didnt know how to load a musket much less clean onewere convinced the art of generalship suffered greatly because circumstance forced them to remain netmakers or potters or solicitors victor and blaise were both convinced such men understood matters military in the same degree as a honker comprehended the calculus im afraid so victor said well if you waste the time and ink on an answer by all means tell him i think hes a damn fool too blaise said and took himself off if i do i shall victor answereda promise that meant nothing he reached into his pocket and touched the letter from freycinet however much grief he felt it remained a private grief and the last thing he wantedthe very last thingwas that it should ever become public dickering with the english commissioners helped keep victor from brooding too much over things in his own life he could not help richard oswald was a plainspoken scotsman who served as chief negotiator for the english secretary of state the earl of shelburne his colleague david hartley was a member of parliament he had a high forehead a dyspeptic expression and a shoulderlength periwig of the sort that had gone out of fashion when louis xtv died more than half a century before most of the negotiations were straightforward enough the english duo conceded that king george recognized the united states of atlantis separately and collectively as free sovereign and independent states he abandoned all claims to govern them and to own property in them settling the borders of the new land was similarly simple the only land frontier it had was the old one with spanish atlantis in the far south and that remained unchanged one of these days victor suspected his country would take spanish atlantis for its own either by conquest or by purchase but that time was not yet here and did not enter into the present discussions thered be more of a todo over who owned what and who claimed what were you part of the terranovan mainland oswald remarked in a burr just thick enough to make victor pay close attention to every word he said the comment reminded victor of his byplay with cornwallis at the surrender ceremony oswald went on as things are though ocean all around keeps us from fashin ourselves unduly so it does victor said hoping he grasped what fashin meant they disposed without much trouble of fishing rights and of the due rights of creditors on both sides to get the full amount they had been owed then they came to the sticky part the rights remaining to atlanteans who had stayed loyal to king george that particularly grated on victor because habakkuk biddiscombe and a handful of his men remained at large at last david hartley said let them be outlaws then but what of the plight of the thousands of atlanteans who never bore arms against your government but still groan under expulsions and confiscations i fear i see no parallel between the two cases that gave victor pause how could he say the englishmans complaint held no justice slowly he answered if these onetime loyalists are willing to live peacefully in the united states of atlantis and to accept the new nations independence something may perhaps be done for them why do you allow no more than that hartley pressed let your atlantean assembly pass the proper law and proclaim it throughout the land and all will be as it should if only it were so simple victor said not without regret wherefore is it not hartley asked the assembly chooses war and peace for all atlantis it treats with foreign powers it coins specie it arranges for the dealings of the atlantean settlementsah statesone with another victor said but each state within its own boundaries retains its sovereignty the assembly has not the authority to command the several states to treat the loyalists within em thus and so did it make the attempt the states assemblies and parliaments and legislatures would surely rise against it reckoning its impositions as tyrannous as all atlantis reckoned king georges this is not government richard oswald said this is lunacy let loose upon the world although inclined to agree with him victor knew better than to admit as much he spread his hands it is what we have sir i do not intend to touch off a civil war on the heels of the foreign war just past lunacy oswald repeated he seemed more inclined to wash his hands of the united states of atlantis than to spread them but his colleague said perhaps there is a middle ground oswald snorted between madness and sanity give me leave to doubt how would this be david hartley said let the atlantean assembly earnestly recommend to the governing bodies of the respective states that they provide for the restitution of estates rights and properties belonging to those who did not take up arms against the united states of atlantis this would be consistent not only with justice and equity but also with the spirit of conciliation which on the return of the blessings of peace should universally prevail victor radcliff suspected hotheads in the atlantean assembly would damn him for a softhearted backslider for making an arrangement like that he also suspected the states governing bodies might not care to heed the atlantean assemblys recommendations no matter how earnest they were but a mild occupation of french atlantis had gone well on the whole where a harsh one might have sparked festering rebellion he didnt nod with any great enthusiasm but nod he did let it be so capital hartley wrote swiftly i believe this conveys the gist of what i said is it acceptable to you victor read the proposed article he nodded again it is by the same token then there should be no further confiscationsnor prosecutions either for that matterbecause of past loyalties richard oswald said any such proceedings now in train should also be stopped i will agree to that provided it also applies reciprocally victor replied england should not prosecute any atlanteans in her territory for preferring the assembly to the king oswald looked as if hed bitten into an unripe persimmon but david hartley nodded judiciously that seems only fair he said with his own countryman willing to yield the point oswald grumbled but did not say no terms for the evacuation of english troops had already been worked out between victor and general cornwallis it remained but to incorporate them into the treaty the english also undertook not to destroy any archives or records quite a few documents had already gone up in flames the better to protect informers and quiet collaborators well the atlanteans had burned their share of papers too but enough was enough one other point remains victor said operations of which we here know nothing may yet continue against avalon new marseille or the smaller towns of the west coast in case it should happen that any place belonging to atlantis shall have been conquered by english arms before word of this treaty arrives in those parts let it be restored without difficulty and without compensation the english commissioners looked at each other they both shrugged at the same time agreed oswald said again david hartley wrote down the clause after he finished he asked is your west coast as savage as the savants say it is sparsely settled though avalon makes a fairsized town victor answered the truly empty region is the interior between the green ridge mountains and the hesperian gulf its day will come i doubt not but that day is not yet here will it come in our lifetime hartley asked i can hope so victor said i must admit i dont particularly expect to see it shall we proceed richard oswald said does anything more need to go into this treaty he waited when neither his countryman nor victor said anything he went on then let it go into effect when it is ratified by parliament and by the atlantean assembly said ratification to take place within sue months unless some matter of surpassing exigency should intervene agreed victor said he shook hands with both englishmen i shall give you a copy of the articles david hartley said for which i thank you kindly victor replied amazing how defeat in the field inclined england toward sweet reason he barely kept himself from clapping his hands in glee no one now not king george and not the emperor of china either could claim the united states of atlantis had no rightful place among the nations of the world victor was lodged above a public house called the pleasant cod the place had been open for business for upwards of a century by now very likely every possible jest about its name had been made that didnt keep new guests from making those same jokes over again only the glazed look in the taverners eye kept victor from exercising his wit at the cods expense heor rather the atlantean assemblywas paying for his lodging one of the principal grievances atlantis had against england was the uncouth english practice of quartering troops on the citizenry without so much as a byyourleaveand without so much as a farthings worth of payment and if the taverner gouged him for the room well atlantean paper still wasnt close to par with sterling someone pounded on the door in the middle of the night victor needed a moment to come back to himself then another to remember where he was and why he was there he groped for the fine sword from the atlantean assembly in these days of gunpowder generals rarely bloodied their blades on the battlefield but the sword would do fine for letting the air out of a robber or two bang bang bang whoever was out in the hall really wanted to come in people in other rooms swore at the racket victor had no trouble hearing every angry oath through the thin walls whos there dammit he called blade in his right hand the latch in his left he wasnt about to open it till he got an answer he liked he made the knocking stop anyway is that you victor a voice inquired a familiar voice no he said harshly i am the grand vizier of the shah of persia he would have assumed a persian accent had he had the faintest notion of what one sounded like someone else spouted gibberish in the hall for all victor knew it might have been persian it was beyond a doubt custis cawthorne victor threw the door open i thought you were still in france he exclaimed his ship put in at pomphret landing isaac fenner said weve ridden together from there to croydon to see you perhaps not quite so much of you as this cawthorne added victor looked down at himself in the dim light of the hallway lantern all he had on were a linen undershirt and cotton drawers i was asleep he said with as much dignity as he could muster you might have waited till morning to come to call thats right you bloody well might have you noisy buggers someone else yelled from behind a closed door victor ducked back into his room after some fumbling he found the candle stub that had lighted his way up the stairs he lit it again at the lantern then he made a gesture of invitation well my friends as long as you are here by all means come in yesgo in and shut up that unhappy man shouted we should have let it wait till morning cawthorne said as victor shut the door behind them his little bit of candle wouldnt last long then they could either talk in the dark or go to bed why didnt you he asked because what we came for is too important isaac fenner answered stubbornly the dim flickering light only made his ears seem to stick out even more than they would have anyway and that is victor prompted why to finish negotiating the treaty with the english commissioners confound it whats so funny only that i reached an accord with them this afternoon victor answered if the atlantean assembly should decide the said accord is not to its liking it is welcome to change matters to make them more satisfactory and should it choose to do so i shall retire once for all into private life with the greatest delight and relief imaginable custis cawthorne burst out laughing too all this rushing might have been avoided with a faster start he observed but then that proves true more often than any of us commonly cares to contemplate fenner implacable as one of the three fates held out his hand to victor kindly let me see this socalled agreement no victor said shadows swooped across fenners face as it sagged in surprise what he sputtered you dare refuse too right i do victor answered god may know what miserable hour of the night it is but not being inclined to fumble out my pocket watch i havent the faintest notion i am certain the treaty will keep till daylight for now isaac shut up and go to bed but fenner seemed about to explode isaac custis cawthorne spoke his friends name in a voice full of gentle amused melancholy what is it fenner by contrast snapped like the jaws of a steel trap shut up and go to bed i intend to as if to prove as much cawthorne shrugged out of his coat and began undoing the toggles on his tunic his colleagues face was a study in commingled amazement and fury fenners red hair warned of his temper as a light on a lee shore warned of dangerous rocks but then the bredestown assemblyman also started to laugh all right all rightjust as you please i see there are two beds in the room who shall have which this one is mine victor pointed to the unmade one in which hed been sleeping the two of you may share the other this being the price you pay for disturbing me in so untimely a fashion isaac fenner looked ready to argue about that too cawthorne by contrast took off his shoes grunting he bent to reach under the bed victor had designated he picked up the chamber pot that sat there i trust you gentlemen will excuse me he said politely turning his back when hed finished he presented the pot to fenner isaac oh very well fenner used the pot while cawthorne lay down and made himself comfortable victor stretched out on his own bed blaise was in the servants quarters downstairs chances were the negro was asleep right this minute too victor wished he could say the same youd better hurry up he told isaac fenner this candle wont last much longer sure enough it guttered and almost went out fenner got into bed the ropes supporting the mattress creaked under his weight good night sweetheart custis cawthorne told him as if men didnt sleep two or three or four to a bed all the time in taverns or inns good nightdarling fenner retorted victor blew out the candle blackness plunged down from the ceiling and swallowed the room whole victor didnt know about how his eminent atlantean comrades fared after that he went back to sleep himself too soon to have the chance to find out down in the common room the next morning blaise looked grouchy he usually drank tea but a steaming mug of coffee sat in front of him now he sipped from it as he attacked a ham steak and a plate of potatoes fried in lard when victor asked what the trouble was his factotum sent him a wounded look some damnfool commotion in the nighttime blaise answered swallowing more coffee didnt you hear it i thought it was plenty to wake the dead i know it woke me and i had a devil of a time getting back to sleep again afterwards oh victor said that yes that you know what it was after a glance at the stairway victor nodded here it comes now as a matter of fact blaise blinked as isaac fenner came down he frankly gaped when custis cawthorne followed but hes in france blaise blurted i thought so too victor said in point of fact though he was in my room last night wanting to see the treaty i hammered out with oswald and hartley yesterday well actually no isaac was the one who wanted to see it just then custis came with him though the atlantean dignitaries bore down on the table where victor and blaise sat without so much as a goodmorning fenner said you have the terms with you i crave your pardon victor said i must have left them up in the room after i break my fast you may rest assured i shall let you examine them at your leisure that produced the desired effect it incensed fenner devil fry you black as a griddle cake forgotten over the fire he shouted loud enough to make everyone in the common room stare at him why did you not have the consideration the common courtesy thethe plain wit to bring them down with you think on how much time you might have saved man just think easy isaac easy you might do some thinking yourself instead of bellowing like a branded calf custis cawthorne set a hand on fenners arm unless i find myself much mistaken general radcliff would end up holding your leg in his hand if he pulled it any harder what fenner gaped goggleeyed i do have the treaty here isaac victor said the serving girl chose that moment to come up and ask him what he wanted he got to prolong fenners agony by hashing over the virtues and vices of ham sausages and bacon having finally picked sausages and sent the girl back to the kitchen victor produced the draft here is what the englishmen and i have arrived at why dont you and custis sit down and look it over and order something to put ballast in your bellies a capital notion cawthorne said capital he proceeded to follow victors suggestion isaac fenner stood there till the older man tugged at his sleeve you wanted to see this now that you can arent you going to errr fenner had to take a deep breath to stop making the noise he sat down most abruptly almost as if against his will he started reading over cawthornes shoulder then he tugged the paper away from the other man so that it lay on the table between them the serving girl came back with victors breakfast she smiled at fenner and cawthorne what would you gents care for i dont care for this fifth articlenot even slightly fenner said she means for breakfast isaac custis cawthorne said as for me ill take the ham and potatoes and a mug of ale to washem down breakfast by the way fenner said it the possibility had slipped his mind hmm what custis chose will suit me well enough too victor wouldnt have given better than three to two that fenner had even heard what custis cawthorne chose for breakfast the answer was enough to make the serving girl go away though which was what the bredestown assemblyman had in mind fenners forefinger descended on the treaty this fifth article he began again england wanted us to compel the states to undo their measures against the loyalists victor said good luck cawthorne exclaimed wed be fighting half a dozen wars at once if we tried just what i told em victor said they do have something of a point after allloyalists who did not bear arms against the atlantean assembly may become good citizens in the circumstances now prevailing no certainty of it but they may and so whats the phrase hartley usedearnestly recommending that the states go easy struck me as a reasonable compromise why should we compromise fenner said we won patiently victor answered the firmer the peace we make with england now the smaller the chance well have to fight another war in ten years time or twenty god has not sent me word from on high that we are bound to win then has he been more generous with you when i was a boy croydon folk would have thrown you in the stocks for a jape like that cawthorne said they might do it yet were the fellow so exercising his wit some abandoned vagabond rather than the hero of atlantis liberation people here are touchy about god blaise agreed even touchier than they are most places i mean they are certain they are right being thus certain they are equally sure they have the rightnay more the dutyto impose their views on everyone they can cawthorne said a crack like that might have won him time in the stocks were he less prominent and less notorious his breakfast and isaac fenners interrupted perusal of the treaty after a while fenner said this is good again he sounded surprised a full belly strengthens the spirit custis cawthorne seemed to listen to himself not bad not bad at all i must remember that one fenner was still eyeing the draft of the treaty it will be some time before we can pay our debts at par with sterling he said sadly victor also knew the parlous state of the atlantean assemblys paperwho didnt but he answered would you rather i had told the english commissioners we intend to repudiate those debts they lodge down the street i will introduce them to you later this morning if you intend to convey that message you may do so yourself no no fenner said now that we are a nation we must be able to hold up our heads amongst our fellow nations even so putting our house in order will prove more difficult than many of us would wish never fear we can always find some cozening trick or another to befool our creditors cawthorne said france has proved that year after year how was france victor asked him most enjoyable at the level where i traveled cawthorne said if you have the means to live wellor have friends with the means to let you live wellyou can live better in and around paris than anywhere else on earth but the peasantry dear god in heaven upon my oath the grievances the french peasants have against their king and nobles make ours against england seem light as a feather drifting on the breeze by comparison then let them rise too fenner said freedom is no less contagious than smallpox and no inoculation wards against it would you say the same mr fenner to a negro slave picking indigo or growing rice in the south of atlantis blaise asked custis cawthorne chuckled softly to himself fenner sent him an irritated look speaking for myself i have no great use for slavery he replied i hope one day to see it vanish from the united states of atlantis as it has already vanished or grown weak in so much of the north here for the time being however it makes the slaveholders piles of filthy lucre cawthorne broke in not how i should have phrased it fenner said why not victor wondered his son could be sold at any time for no better reason than to line marcel freycinets pockets that made him look at holding negroes and copperskins in perpetual servitude in a whole new light but fenner hadnt finished one day before too many years have passed i expect property in slaves to grow hopelessly uneconomic when measured against property in say machinery and when that day comes slave holding in atlantis will be at an end how many years blaise pressed as if wondering how patient he shouldor couldbe i should be surprised if it came to pass in fewer than twenty years isaac fenner answered i should also be surprised if slavery still persisted a lifetime from now blaise made a noise down deep in his throat that did not please him noit did not satisfy him isaac minks my son nicholas will grow to manhood a slave victor thought he minks my son may live out his whole life as a chattel put in those terms fenners reasoned and reasonable estimate didnt satisfy him either but what could he do about it freeing slaves was far more explosive than compensating loyalists can i bring you anything else gents the serving girl asked custis cawthorne shoved his mug across the table toward her if you fill this up again i shall thank you sweetly for it and youll pay for it too she said and walked off swinging her hips one way or another we always end up paying for it cawthorne said with a sigh fenner wasnt watching the girl he was still methodically going through the treaty when at last he looked up victor asked does it suit you we might have squeezed better terms from them here and there fenner tapped the document with the nail on his right index finger but if you have already made the bargain i have victor said they may possibly reconsider i daresay there are certain small advantages they still hope to wring from us if you reckon the game worth the candle i do not objecttoo muchto your proposing further negotiation to them isaac fenner tapped the treaty again by his expression up till victors reply hed thought only of what the united states of atlantis might get from england not of what england might still want from the new nation if the agreement as it stands suits you and suits them we might be wiser to leave it unchanged he said so we might cawthorne said not that that necessarily stops anyone chapter victor hadnt thought it would stop fenner if it did he wasnt about to complain if he did complain after all wouldnt he fall into the common error himself victor had wondered whether the english commissioners would want anything to do with isaac fenner and custis cawthorne after all hed already reached agreement with king georges officials and had he brought fenner alone the englishmen might well not have cared to treat with him but cawthorne made all the difference richard oswald and david hartley were as delighted to meet him as if he were a young beautiful looseliving actress oswald used a pair of spectacles of cawthornes design so that he could read with the lower halves of the lenses while still seeing clearly at a distance through the uppers ingenious most extraordinarily ingenious the scot exclaimed how ever did you come to think of it what gave me the idea actually was a badly ground set of reading glasses in which part of the lenses were of improper curvature cawthorne answered i thought if what had chanced by accident were to be done better and on purpose once the notion was in place bringing it to fruition proved easy enough remarkable oswald said it takes an uncommon mind to recognize the importance of the commonplace and obvious curtis cawthorne preened the only thing he enjoyed more than hearing himself praised was hearing himself praised by someone with the discernment to understand and to state exactly why he deserved all those accolades because the commissioners so admired cawthorne they even put up with fenners urge to fiddle with the treaty as far as victor could see none of the changes from either side made a halfpennys worth of difference a few commas went in a few others disappeared several adjectives and a sprinkling of adverbs were exchanged for others of almost identical import fenner seemed happier the englishmen didnt seem dismayed or more important irate the one phrase david hartley declined to change was earnestly recommend in the fifth article fenner proposed several alternatives hartley rejected each in turn i do not believe that has quite the meaning his majestys government wishes to convey he would say and the atlantean would try again finally victor took fenner aside he likes the wording of that article as it is radcliff said he is particularly pleased with it because he created the formula himself ah fenner said as if a great light had dawned i had not fully grasped that he was suffering from pride of authorship although victor might not have phrased it just so he found himself nodding that is the conditionhe didnt want to say diseasecontrolling him very well then by fenners tone and expression it wasnt victor followed him into the meeting room with some apprehension but fenner was smiling by the time he sat down across the table from the english commissioners mr hartley general radcliff has persuaded me that your language will serve i shall earnestly recommendhis smile got widerto the atlantean assembly that it should abide by this article as it does by all the rest that is handsomely said mr fenner hartley replied i am pleased to accept it in the spirit in which it is offered and i also thank you for your good offices general radcliff my pleasure sir victor replied he still wasnt sure he liked the way isaac fenner was smiling the atlantean assembly could earnestly recommend as much as it pleased that didnt necessarily mean the atlantean states would pay any attention to it fenner had to know as much too but he said nothing of it to david hartley maybe he had the makings of a diplomat after all with that matter settled have we any more outstanding richard oswald asked as he had with the draft he and hartley arranged with victor nobody said anything oswald nodded decisively like an auctioneer bringing down the hammer on on a slave victor thought and wished he hadnt before he could dive deeper into his own worries oswald went on then let us affix our signatures and seals to the document mr hartley and i will deliver our copy to london whilst you take yours to honkers mill his manner was altogether matteroffact which only made the comparison more odious london was the greatest city in the world perhaps the greatest in the history of the world honkers mill wasnt a touch of asperity in his voice isaac fenner said now that peace has been restored new hastings will become the capital of the united states of atlantis how nice oswald murmured new hastings wasnt the greatest city in the history of the world either maybe one day it would be or hanover if it wasnt so lucky but neither came anywhere close yet not even the most ardentthe most rabid atlantean patriot could claim otherwise signatures seals custis cawthorne saidand not one word about new hastings honor men from both sides solemnly initialed the changed adjectives and adverbs on the treaty they let the altered commas go maybe one day some historians would note the ones that had been deleted and learnedly guess which ones had been added after the first draft was done for the time being nobody thought they were worth getting excited about richard oswald and david hartley signed for england they splashed hot wax down on both copies and pressed their signet rings into it then the atlanteans followed suit first victor then isaac fenner and finally custis cawthorne one by one the atlanteans also used their seals it is accomplished hartley said as the wax hardened your land is separated from ours jeremiah could have sounded no gloomier even job would have been hardpressed now it is truly our own to do with as we will isaac fenner by contrast exulted victor wondered how that balance between gloom and exultation would tip in years to come only the coming of those years would tell company by company regiment by regiment the atlantean soldiers whod taken service for the duration of the war against england went home the united states of atlantis would retain a small professional armyone modeled on that of the mother countrybut most of the greencoats wanted nothing more than to go back to their farms and shops and to their families and french ships put in at croydon to return de la fayette and the survivors from his army to their native land french sergeants cursed more musically than their english or atlantean counterparts but they were no less sincere ordinary french soldiers seemed as ready to go anywhere they were told and do anything they were told as a like number of redcoats would have de la fayette clasped victors hand you may be sure monsieure general it was a great honor to serve beside you and to help bring freedom to your land the french noble grinned impishly and i also very much enjoyed giving england one in the eye the fight would have been much harder and much longer without you your grace victor answered truthfully your armys courage and its skill taught us a great deal and your fleet slammed the cork into cornwallis bottle he paused a moment then added and had you not come here i should not have made a friend i value i feel the same way de la fayette squeezed his hand again he too hesitated before continuing in a low voice now that atlantis has shown the world what freedom means perhaps my country will also discover it before long victor remembered custis cawthornes comments on the current state of france what cawthorne could say among his fellow atlanteans victor didnt feel comfortable repeating to a french nobleman even one of liberal ideas like de la fayette he contented himself with replying come what may in your land and in mine i hope we meet again as do iand may it be so the marquis smile was sweet and sad and knowing beyond his years if this is to come to pass i think i shall have to come back here atlantean affairs will likely leave you far too busy to cross the sea and visit me in france maybe sobut then again maybe not victor said i am going back to my farm i never wanted to be anything more than a private citizen now that the war is over i intend to seize the chance and go back to what i was well man ami i wish you good fortune in your endeavor yes de la fayettes smile looked knowing indeed but fame once it takes up a man often is not so eager to let him go again that had also worried victor he gave the best answer he could if i am willingno eager by godto let tame go i hope the beast will prove willing to take its claws out of me a man should always hope de la fayette agreed victor radcliff was old enough to be his father the marquis had no business sounding like the more experienced of the two of them but he brought it off with grace and without much effort as he brought off so many things you dont believe i can do it victor turned that into an accusation de la fayettes shrug was a small masterpiece of its kind what a man can do what fate will do who but k ban dim can say how they fit together as for example the matter of your paternity what about it how did you know about it that was the last thing victor wanted anyone to know about and it was the last thing he wanted to talk about even if they were unlikely to be overheard this time de la fayettes shrug just looked french monsieur freycinet communicated the news to me rest assured he understands the need for discretion and he relies on mine as you may mmm victor said freycinet could afford to rely on that victor couldnt might the man from the south have told anyone else radcliff didnt want to contemplate that with a sigh de la fayette said it is a great pity when what should be a time of joy brings you no happiness calling it a pity to victors way of thinking made a formidable understatement he forced a shrug of his own a poor thing next to those of de la fayette but it would have to serve nothing to be done about it he said i know the marquis agreed sympathetically not even amending your laws would change the predicament i fear if you led a single life but you do not and no woman can look kindly upon her man after he sires a child on another no victor said wishing the marquis would shut up nothing de la fayette said hadnt crossed his own mind he and meg had got on well for many years but she wouldnt be one to take something like this in stride how many women would precious few victor didnt need the frenchman to point that out for him someone aboard the nearest french ship called de la fayette the marquis grabbed victors hand one more time i must go he said and kissed radcliff on both cheeks he hurried down the pier over the gangplank and onto the ship he waved from the deck before heading back toward the poop victor also waved little by little atlantis was being left to her own devices the prospect excited isaac fenner despite all the fighting victor had done to produce exactly this result he still wasnt sure whether it excited him or frightened him more writing to meg which once was always a pleasure had become a trial since victor learned louise would bear his child he wasnt used to concealing himself from his wife hed always been able to speak his mind to her no more or not fully if she ever found out about his dark descendant she would speak her mind to him he had no doubts on that score worrying about what would happen when he got home kept him in croydon longer than he would have lingered with a clear conscience his aides could have handled the release of what was left of the army that had bested the redcoats they knew it too he caught the quizzical looks they gave him when he rode out to the shrinking encampments outside of town he hoped none of them knew about his predicament hed done his best to keep it secret but custis cawthorne had plenty of pungent things to say about secrets and all the things that could go wrong with them his lingering meant he was in croydon when a courier rode into town at a full gallop his horse kicking up great clouds of dust till he reined in what is it victor asked anxiouslygood news seldom needed to travel so fast he hoped there hadnt been a bad fire somewhere or a smallpox outbreak this time the courier surprised him the man threw back his head and howled like a wolf then he said weve caught habakkuk biddiscombe general everybody who heard that clapped and cheered have we victor breathed sure have the courier said i havent seen him myself but word is hes a sorry starveling thing and hell get sorrier pretty goddamn quick wont he more cheers declared that the people of croydon liked the idea victor wondered how much he liked it himself after biddiscombe went over to england victor had wanted nothing more than to see him dead he wondered why killing the traitor in cold blood seemed so much less appealing appealing or not it would have to be done if hed wanted to avoid it he would have let general cornwallis take biddiscombe and the men of the horsed legion away with him when he went back to england at the time hed made a point of allowing no such thing where is he victor asked up in kirkwall about fifty miles north of here the courier said do you want them to string him up there theyll do it in a heartbeatyou can count on that no victor said not without a certain amount of reluctance even a traitor deserves a trial the courier shrugged seems a waste of time if you want to know what i think like most atlanteans he assumed people did want to know what he thought after another shrug he went on ill need me a fresh horse to head north almost ran the legs off of this here poor beast youll have one victor assured him are all the cutthroats captured with biddiscombe or do some remain at large most of emre caught or killed the man answered a few got away odds are theyll chase em down pretty soon i hope so victor said the sooner they do the sooner atlantis will know perfect peace at last perfect peace the courier echoed thatd be something wouldnt it so it would victor said solemnly sure enough with habakkuk biddiscombe gone from the stage the united states of atlantis might come to know perfect peace at least for a little while he wondered whenor ifhis family ever would but biddiscombes capture did let him write to his wife my dear meg i am sorry past words to have to tell you my departure from croydon is once more delayed i am not sorry however to tell you why habakkuk biddiscombe is run to earth at last until such time as he should receive the justice he deserves i find myself compelled to stay here and until such time as i can get away i remain fondly your victor his goose quill fairly raced across the page the letter held a good deal of truth he would have written one much like it had he never bedded louise he might even have set down the very same words unfortunately he knew the difference between what might have been and what was had he never bedded louise he would have meant all the words he wrote now he was at least partly relieved to stay in croydon if meg had heard the truth sooner or later he would have to go home and find out for now later would do atlantean horsemen brought habakkuk biddiscombe and half a dozen men from the horsed legion into croydon three days later the leading traitor and his followers were all skinny and dirty and dressed in clothes that had seen hard wear their hands were bound to the reins their feet had been tied together under their horses barrels some of them biddiscombe included had already taken a beating or two the people of croydon crowded the streets to stare at the traitors to jeer at them and to pelt them with clods of dirt and rotten vegetables only when stones began to fly did the prisoners guards raise weapons in warning to leave off even that was more to protect themselves than to save biddiscombe and his friends croydons jail was a solid brick building with iron bars across the narrow windows victor radcliff wondered if it was strong enough to hold out the crowd he stood on the front steps and held up his hands have no fear he shouted they will get what they have earned let them get it through lawful means tear them to pieces someone squalled paint them with pitch and set them afire that was a woman more than a few people of both sexes cheered the suggestion victor shook his head if they are to die let them die quickly are we not better served to leave harsh wicked punishments to england no the cry came from a dismaying number of throats one man added cut the ballocks off em before you kill em he won himself another cheer you will have to kill me before you murder them victor declared for a bad moment he thought the mob would try just that he set his hand on the hilt of the atlantean assemblys sword if he went down hed go down fighting to either side of him atlantean horsemen raised pistols while croydon constables pointed ancient blunderbusses at the angry crowd the blunderbusses with their flaring muzzles had barrels packed end to end with musket balls and scrap metal at close range they could be murderous if they didnt blow up and kill the men who wielded them the sight of weapons aimed their way killed the crowds ardor people at the front edged back people at the back slipped away victor had hoped that would happen but he hadnt been sure it would you see general one of the horsemen said as he slowly lowered his pistol you should have let us settle the bastards up in kirkwall then we wouldnt have had all this foofaraw no not without some regret victor shook his head laws have to rule more laws have to be seen to rule let biddiscombe and the men who rode with him have their trial you know what the likely result will be once the matter is settled with all the propriety we can give it that will be time enough for their just deserts past time long past time the atlantean cavalryman said stubbornly we can afford what we spend here out of the corner of his eye victor glanced at the crowd which continued to thin can we go inside now without seeming cowards reckon so but why would you want to to speak to biddiscombe victor answered he was one of us not so long ago remember so much the worse for him the horseman said if hed stayed on the side where he belonged we wouldntve had near so much trouble throwing out the goddamned redcoats that is true victor said biddiscombe of course purposed our having more trouble still devil take him and old scratch willsoon i shouldnt wonder victor did go inside then the jail smelled of sour food unwashed bodies and chamber pots full to overflowing much of croydon smelled that way but the odors seemed concentrated in here hello general the jailer a man with a face like a boot and a man who hadnt missed many meals knuckled his forelock as if he were a servant instead of the master of this little domain which of the scoundrels dyou care to see biddiscombe himself victor answered thought you might heh heh that chuckle would have sent ice snaking up any prisoners spine come along with me weve got him in the snug cell by his lonesome so he cant go trying any mischief the snug cell had a redwood door as thick as the side timbers on a firstrate ship of the line the pair of locks that held it closed were both bigger than victors clenched fist the jailer opened a tiny door set into the enormous one an iron grating let people peer into the cell the jailer gestured invitingly victor looked through the window that gave the cell its only light was more than a mans height above the ground even if it hadnt been barred it was much too small for even the most emaciated prisoner to squeeze through habakkuk biddiscombe had got thin but not that thin he lay on a miserable straw pallet along with a water pitcher a cup with the handle broken off and a thundermug that pallet comprised the furnishings in the dark gloomy cell biddiscombes head swung toward the opening in the door whos there he asked victor radcliff i might have known biddiscombe stiffly got to his feet yes hed taken a thumping when the atlantean cavalry caught him and maybe afterwards as well come to gloat have you i hope not victor said you would have done better to stay with your own side thats how it worked out all right but who could have guessed ahead of time the traitor peered through the grating and you would have done better to listen to me more it could be so victor said you arent the only man i didnt always heed though the others didnt turn their coats to pay me back well the more fools they habakkuk biddiscombe kept the courage of his convictions even if he had nothing else how well did cornwallis listen to you victor inquired he would have done better if hed listened more biddiscombe hadnt lost his selfregard either in that case maybe youd be stuck in this stinking cell instead of me he wasnt going to hand you over you might have done better staying where you were habakkuk biddiscombe laughed raucously likely tell if hed made up his mind to protect us come what might he wouldntve needed to call a council of war and the damned englishmen wouldntve taken so long making up their miserable minds either no they were going to hand us over to you all right sure as jesus walked on water they wouldntve lost any sleep over it after all we were nothing but atlanteansone step up from niggers and a short step too and what would blaise have said about that something interesting and memorable victor was sure if the redcoats felt that way about the loyalists who fought beside them why did you stay on because i wanted your guts for garters general victor high and mighty grand panjandrum radcliff and that looked like my best chance to get em biddiscombe didnt bother hiding his venom and why should he things could get no worse for him than they were already if it makes you any happier i felt the same way about you after you raised biddiscombes horsed legion victor said it doesnt not so much as a farts worth biddiscombe replied only one of us was going to get what he wanted and i wish to heaven it were me he scowled through the grating if you were any kind of gentleman youd pass me a pistol so i could end this on my own victor shook his head the trial will go forward the hounds baying outside wanted to end it on their own too ah but my way would finish it fast and with luck it wouldnt hurt so bloody much biddiscombe said when properly done hanging slays quickly and cleanly victor said why bother with a trial when you already know the verdict jeered the man on the other side of the grate so all the evidence comes forth so the future can know you for the traitor you are victor answered biddiscombes mouth twisted a traitor is a man unlucky enough to end on the losing side past that the word has no meaning not quite victor said no how not his onetime cavalry officer returned a traitor is a man unlucky enough to choose the losing side in the middle of the war victor said you might have chosen otherwise you would have done better if you had and you will pay for what you chose habakkuk biddiscombes sweeping gesture took in the whole of his sorry cell am i not already paying you are victor said and walked away victor declined to serve on the threeofficer panel that decided biddiscombes fate i doubt my ability to be just he said he doubted any atlanteans ability to be just to biddiscombe but that was the turncoats hard luck at least biddiscombes blood would not directly soil his hands he was summoned to testify against biddiscombe the accused did have counsel a croydon barrister named josias rich outside the small meeting room in the town hall that served as a courtroom rich told victor i do this not in the belief in the mans innocence nor for the sake of my own advancement god knowspeople i thought my friends commence to cut me in the streets i do it for the sake of atlantis honor even a dog should have someone to speak for it before it is put down your views do you credit and i agree victor said josias richwhose worn linen and downattheheels shoes belied his namelooked surprised and pleased in due course a sergeant serving as bailiff called victor into the room he took his oath on a stout bible the judges elicited from him that habakkuk biddiscombe had commanded cavalry in the atlantean army had gone over to the english and formed biddiscombes horsed legion and had led the horsed legion in combat against the forces of the united states of atlantis biddiscombe who was burdened by manacles and by a ball and chain attached to his ankle had muttered to josias rich all through victors testimony the barrister rose did biddiscombe fight well and bravely while serving under your overall command general he asked he did victor said might he have continued to serve atlantis well and bravely had you been more inclined to recognize and applaud his military merits rich asked i have no way to know that victor replied what is your opinion my opinion is that had i judged him worthy of more recognition and applause i would have given them to him rich tried again do you now regret not having given them to him i regret that any man who once fought for us should have decided to cast his fate with king george whatever his reasons may have been victor said carefully in retrospect do you wish now that you had been more inclined to heed his suggestions as to the atlantean armys conduct of its campaign against the redcoats do i think he might have been right do you mean sir wellyes josias rich said here and there he might have been victor said but that is hard to say with any certainty now looking back on it and it would have been all the harder to say trying to look forward into an unsure future thank you general rich sat down one of the captains who would decide biddiscombes fate asked did other officers who sometimes disagreed with your orders remain loyal to the cause of the united states of atlantis they did victor said and there in two words was the essence of biddiscombes treason the panel excused victor after that he left the little room with nothing but relief baron von steuben waited outside bad the german asked sympathetically well victor didnt need to think long before nodding yes plenty bad treason is a filthy business von steuben said common where i come fromso many little kingdoms and duchies and principalities so many divided loyaltiesbut filthy all the same here you have but one country if god loves atlantis no reason for treason again may he grant it be so victor agreed the sergeant stepped out into the hallway your turn sir he said to von steuben who sighed and shrugged and followed him in the trial was more than a drumhead but less than something a civilian would have wanted to face the panel of judges called several more witnesses even so theyd heard enough to satisfy themselves by the middle of the afternoon and they delivered their verdict only an hour or so later habakkuk biddiscombe was guilty of treason against the united states of atlantis and should suffer the penalty of death by hanging naturally the news didnt need long to reach victor who sat in a tavern across the croydon meadow on which a few sheep grazed from the town hall drinking porter and eating a sausage and pickled cabbage stuffed into a long roll he sighed and nodded to the man whod brought word to him well no one expected anything else he said no indeed the man said you ask me hangings too good for him he should take a while to go so he has time to think about what he did to deserve it victor shook his head hell have plenty of time to think on that before the trap falls if we once start putting men to death cruelly how do we stop you must be a better christian than i am general the man said victor was far from sure he meant it as praise blaise had his own mug of beer and cabbageshrouded sausage what will you do if biddiscombe begs you for mercy he asked after the newsbringer had gone on his way as commanding general victor had the authority to set aside any courtmartials verdict he had it but he didnt think he wanted to use it not much room for doubt about what he did or about what treason deserves he said and let it go at that trials for the men captured with biddiscombe went even faster than the leaders all of them were convicted and sentenced to death by hanging except one no witnesses came forward to show he had actually fought against the atlantean army the officers who made up his court convicted him of aiding fugitives from justice but nothing more they sentenced him to thirty lashes well laid on the punishment to be carried out immediately a whipping post stood in the middle of the croydon meadow excited townsfolk chased away the sheep the better to enjoy the spectacle the guilty man got a strip of leather to bite down on as if hed gone to the surgeons after a battle wound the man with the whip had a french accent maybe hed had practice whipping slaves south of the stour victor wished he hadnt thought of that it made him imagine his own son under the lash crack crack the strokes sounded like gunshots despite the thick strap the guilty man soon screamed after each one the crowd cheered almost loud enough to drown him out after the last stroke they loosed his shackles he slumped to the ground at the base of the post like a dead man then a doctor came forward to smear ointment on his raw bloodied back and he started screaming all over again croydon didnt have a permanent gallows carpenters who would have been building furniture or houses or ships gleefully took time off to knock one together not far from the whipping post the sheep were probably offended but no one cared long enough to hang all the convicted traitors at once the gallows dominated croydon meadow ravens tumbled in the air overhead as guards with bayoneted muskets brought biddiscombe and his confederates from the jail to the execution site victor radcliff wondered how the birds knew biddiscombe had not appealed his sentence he must have known it was hopeless two of the men from the horsed legion had victor turned them down men who took up arms against the united states of atlantis had to understand what they could look forward to habakkuk biddiscombe climbed the thirteen steps to the platform as if his beloved awaited him at the top he took his place on the trap and looked out at the crowd howling for his death deviltake you all he shouted the croydonites howled louder the hangman put a hood over biddiscombes head there was a brief delay while a parson and a catholic priest consoled some of the condemned men the parson approached biddiscombe he shook his head even though he was hooded the motion was unmistakable to victorand to the parson clicking his tongue between his teeth the man withdrew the hangmen positioned the victims then looked at one another some signal must have passed between them for all the traps dropped at the same time most of the hanged men biddiscombe among them died quickly one jerked for a few minutes before stilling forever the crowd applauded the hangmen bowed people left the meadow in a happy mood some stayed to bid for pieces of the rope a raven perched on the gallows waiting nothing held victor in croydon any longer he could go home he could and he would hed never dreaded going into battle more chapter meg hugged and kissed victor stella hugged and kissed blaise so did their children it was the happiest homecoming anyoneany twocoming back from the wars could have wanted victor and meg blaise and stella drank rum the negroes children drank sugared and spiced beer joy reigned unconstrained blaise told stories in which victor was a hero not to be outdone victor told stories in which blaise saved the day they both stretched the stories a little victor knew he didnt stretch his too much he didnt think blaise stretched his too much but nobody could properly judge stories about himself they ate ham and fried chicken and potatoes and pickled cabbage and cinnamonspicy baked apples till they could hardly walk after supper blaise and stella and their children went off to their smaller cottage next to the radcliffs farmhouse and meg radcliff looked victor in the eye and said you son of a bitch he opened his mouth then he closed it again after that opening how was he supposed to answer helplessly he spread his hands you know hed thought those were the two worst words that could possibly come out of his mouth and hed been right too dont i just his wife answered bitterly you were supposed to ride a horse while you were on campaign victor not some damned colored wench and how many other trollops were there that i dont know anything about none not a one victor lied without hesitation or compunction meg laughed at himnot the sort of laugh shed given him before they were alone do you suppose i hatched out of a honkers egg you just happened to lie down with this one bitch and she just happened to get up with child that is what happened having begun to lie victor had to go on except for what had happened with louise meg couldnt prove anything anyhow what she suspected she had a right to suspect but she couldnt prove it ha it wasnt a laughit was a sound she threw in his face meg she wasnt going to listen to him yet maybe eventually maybe not too certainly not yet so tell me she said have you got yourself a nigger son now or a daughter she wouldnt have used that word if blaise or stella might have heard it but she seized any weapon she could get her hands on to hurl at her husband a son victor answered dully how is it you dont know that because i had only one letter from dear monsieur freycinet she snapped it was addressed to you of course but i opened it because i thought it might be important and so it was but not the way i looked for he had to inform you that sweet louise was having your baby damn monsieur freycinet victor thought the planter had been much too thorough hed sent one letter to where he guessed victor was and another to the place where victor was bound to get it sooner or later and victor was indeed getting it though not in the way marcel freycinet would have had in mind a son meg breathed out hard through her nose yes a son a son who is dear monsieur freycinefs property a son who is a slave and likely will be all his days victor said if you think i havent flayed myself about this you are much mistaken you fool youre flaying yourself because you made her belly swell meg snarled i want to flay you because you bedded her in the first place the hero of the atlantean war for liberty huzzah victor hung his head i deserve all your reproaches and more besides meg agreed why victor why but before he could answer she held up a hand spare me any more falsehoods i know why i know too wellbecause you are a man and she was there and i was not heaven help me though i did not think you were that kind of man which only goes to show how little i knew eh what can i say victor asked miserably i know not what can you say what would you have done if you could not just leave louise in her present situation i gather no victor said i offered to buy her and set her free here north of the stour where slavery is as near dead as makes no difference i offered a price for for the boy as well freycinet declined to sell her or the boy god is merciful his wife exclaimed that would have blown a hole in our accounts not so did you think i would not notice no i thought you would victor said and the word hung in the air what difference does it make now i might have been able to explain it or if not that would have been no worse than this there his wife said in something like triumph thats the first truth youve told since you came home unless im much mistaken she wasnt and victor didnt have the nerve to claim she was im sorry he muttered under his breath youre sorry you got caught youre sorry your hussy caught are you sorry you went in unto her as the good book says not likely what would you have me do victor asked he thought she would say something like cut it off and throw it in the fire by the look in her eye she wasnt far from that but what she did answer was i never dreamt in all my born days that i would say such a thing as this but right now i wish with all my heart you were more like blaise he would never mistreat stella sonever victor didnt remember blaise declining to swive roxane the slave girl who was so nearly white the only difference between general and factotumbetween one man and anotherwas that the factotums companion hadnt conceived the general had no intention of betraying the factotum one man one friend did not do that to another but megs words caught him by surprise some of what went through his mind must have shown on his face blood drained from megs cheeks no she whispered he didnt he couldnt he wouldnt have victor didnt claim that blaise did or could or would have he also didnt leap to his factotums defensenot that meg would have believed him if he had he just stood there that was bad enough or worse than bad enough all by itself if cornwallis had been able to blast holes in his defenses so easily the atlantean cause would have foundered in short order meg shook her head in what had to be horror god save me you truly are all alike dont tell stella victor said i have not the heart to do any such cruel thing meg said the truth will come out though sooner or later it will she paused did he get a byblow on his harlot not so far as i know victor answered and so far as i know he has no notion that i did i wish i had no notion that you did meg exclaimed then she hesitated or do i is it not better that the truth has come forth i know not victor said but i do know how much i wish monsieur freycinet had never told me i have a colored son and surely you wish even more that he had never told me you were to have a colored child meg said the one thing you have not said is that you wish you had never used this louise for your bedstraw am i to gather that the reason you have not said it is because it is not true victor had no idea how to answer that what man ever regretted doing that which made him a man he mighthe would regret discovery he mighthe wouldregret unexpected offspring but regret lying down with a pretty woman and getting up afterwards with a smile no not likely and yet i wish i had not hurt you by doing what i did he saidand he meant it all the way down to his toes not that it helped you would do better to wish me made of stone then his wife said i trusted you victor fool that i was i did now i see i must have been a fool indeed if you took this louise on that journey then you must have taken a nell or a joanna or a sue or an anne or a bess or a kate on all your others and then you would come home and say how much you missed me hed feared he was wasting his breath when he insisted hed fallen from virtue fallen from fidelity with louise alone how hideously right hed been i always did miss you he said and he meant that too not enough meg retorted besides why would you what did you have from me you could not get for a few shillings from any tavern wench with a hot cleft that shot like so many of hers came too close to the center of the target unlike some of the others it wasnt quite a bullseye what did i have from you yourself with louisevictor still wouldnt admit to any others no matter how right about them meg wasit was a matter of a moment forgotten as soon as it was over with you i always knew we were in harness together so long as we both should live and i never wanted it any other way i love you meg forgotten as soon as it was over she left you something to remember her by though didnt she and nothing but luck she didnt give you the pox to remember her by too and for you to bring home to me meg said you love me you say you love me till you ride off far enough so you can see me no more and then you go your merry way that is not so victor said painfully aware how likely it was to seem so to a woman who discovered herself scorned but meg was shooting bigger guns what is not so that you love me whilst i am within sight for beyond doubt you cease to do so once i sink below the horizon then the whores rise i have been away since the beginning of the war victor said so you have and how would you have liked it had i entertained gentlemen callers the way that black bitch entertained you do you suppose i have not been lonely of nights he winced i should have liked that not one bit as you must know but it is different for a man as you also must know much too well meg said which makes me believe god is truly a man for were he she we should operate under some other more equitable dispensation whatever you would have me do to show my contrition ride south and shoot them both and that brothel keeper freycinet with them and sink all the bodies in the swamp his wife suggested i doubt i could escape uncaught victor said which was putting it mildly and it is not the babys fault no it isnt meg started to cry then not his fault he lives and cries and makes messes in his drawers while all of mine lie in the cold ground not his fault at all the tears ran down her cheeks damn you victor had wondered if she might let him buy nicholas and bring the colored boy north for some free colored couple in these parts to raise he didnt bring it up nowthe answer seemed much too obvious maybe she would change her mind once her temper like any tempest at last receded on the other hand maybe she wouldnt when they went upstairs to bed she said if you lay so much as a finger on me i will scream the house down meg i will she insisted better than you deserve too she started crying again and if i dont yield myself to you what will you do go out and scatter your seed among more strange women she eyed him on the stairs i could win a bill of divorcement against you not much plainer proof of adultery than a child is there no he said the cold wind of fear blowing in his ears she could win a divorce and if she did he would never be able to hold up his head in polite society again wherever he went he would always be the man who and behind his back he would always be the man with the nigger bastard conversation would stop whenever he walked into a room then pick up again on a different note how could you go on like that i hope you dont he forced the words out through stiff lips i dont want to she answered not only for the scandals sake either i want to love you victor i want you to love me i want to be able to believe you love me whatever i can do to bring that about i will after a moment victor added it will be harder if i may not touch you one day maybe one night maybe not today not tonight meg said as things are right now i could not stand it all right victor saidhe could hardly say anything else they went up the rest of the stairs together and a million miles apart victor stood by the edge of the pond eyeing the ducks and geese they swam toward him gabbling eagerlythey hoped he would throw them grain and he did and smiled to see how eagerly they fed there were more of them than hed thought there might be the farm as a whole was in better shape than hed expected meg had done a splendid job and hed repaid her with a bastard boy worsemuch worseshe knew it too blaise ambled up alongside of him the negro looked less happy with the world than he had when he was riding up to the farmhouse with victor a few days before victor understood that down to the ground he was none too happy himself blaise eyed a goose as if he wanted to wring its neck women he saida oneword sentence as old as men whats wrong victor asked maybe someone elses troubles would help take his mind off his own some kind of way stella done found out about that girl i had that roxane when i went down with you to meet de la fayette blaise answered my lifes been a misery ever since oh dear victor said even if blaise didnt he had a good idea about how that might have happened his wife might have told him she wouldnt say anything to stella but had meg got wind of you and louise blaise asked is that why you were biting peoples heads off while we besieged croydon was i victor said i tried not to you did pretty well most of the time blaise said by which he had to mean victor hadnt done well enough often enough he went on no wonder you didnt care to talk about it though a woman who finds out her mans put it where it dont belong he shook his head shes trouble i found that out victor said the part of the truth his factotum had grasped was the part that wouldnt get in the way between the two of them it was also the part that victor didnt much mind getting out meg might say what she would but only the most censorious condemned a man who slept with other women when he was away from home for years at a stretch a white man who sired a little black bastard on one of them though was much easier to scorn expect meg was the one who tattled to stella then blaise said resignedly women are like that dammit i suppose i should be grateful she waited till after we got backstella wasnt waiting for me with a hatchet anyhow thats something victor agreed how do you go and sweeten up your wife after she finds out about something like this blaise asked back in africa i never had to worry about it did he mean hed never strayed or hed never got caught if he wanted to explain further he would if he didnt care to it didnt much matter the question did if you find a way i hope youll be kind enough to pass it on to me victor answered so far i am still seeking one myself seek and ye shall find the bible says but it tells me nothing of where or when worse luck i try to make her happy as i can every way i know how blaise said but its harder when she wont let me lie down with her if she did maybe i could horn it out of her now he shook his head and spread his hands lighter palms uppermost if misery truly loves company you should know you arent the only one in the same predicament victor told him damned if i know whether misery loves company or not its still misery isnt it without waiting for an answer blaise pulled a metal flask out of his back pocket heres to misery he said and swigged then he handed victor the flask takes the edge off your troubles you might say to misery victor echoed barreltree rum ran fiery down his throat if you drank enough the potent stuff would do more than take the edge off your troubles of course it would give you new troubles and worse ones in short order but plenty of people didnt worry about that their calculation was that if they drank enough they could forget the new troubles too if you didnt care that you lay stuporous in a muddy filthfilled gutter it wasnt a trouble for you was it my children are angry at me too blaise went on in sorrowful tones as victor gave back the flask they dont hardly know why but they are long as their mama is thats good enough for them he took another nip a smaller one this time victor didnt answer blaise wasnt tactless enough to say he was lucky because he had no children of his own the negro knew how victor and meg had kept trying and failing to start a family he didnt know and with luck would never find out how victor had succeeded at last if not in a way he either expected or wanted something else occurred to victor something he hadnt thought of before he wondered if the rum had knocked it loose if tiny nicholaswould he be styled nicholas radcliff entitled to a family namegrew to be a man what would he think of his father i hope he doesnt hate me victor thought a moment later he added too much to himself he didnt see how a slave could help hating his father some if the man whod begotten him was free himself sooner or later things will work out blaise said an assertion that to victors mind would have been all the better for proof his factotum went on well have to watch ourselves from here on out though you get caught once thats bad you get caught twice he slashed the edge of his palm across his throat i fear you have the right of it victor said with a sigh a goose waddled up to him stretched itself up to its full height and honked imperiously it was a barnyard bird of stock brought over from europe but the call still reminded him of the deeper ones that came from honkers plainly the enormous flightless birds had some kinship with geese why geese lived all over the world why the rapidly fading honkers dwelt only on this land in the midst of the sea victor had no more idea than did the most learned european natural philosopher but then honkers were far from gods sole strange creations here he fed the goose grain before lowering its head to peck up the barley it sent back a black beadyeyed stare as if to say well you took long enough a mallard came over to try to filch some of the treat the goose honked again furiously and flapped its wings the mallard scuttled away any rum left in that flask victor said suddenly blaise shook it it sloshed blaise handed it to him he drank after he swallowed he coughed you all right blaise asked on account of the rum yes victor said everything else everything elseis pretty rum he wondered if the negro knew that turn of phrase by the look on blaises facehalf grin half grimacehe did and wished he didnt but he nodded cant live without women he said and cant live with em neither to celebrate the propounding of that great and profound truth he and victor made sure the flask didnt slosh any more a month went by and then another week victor did not lay a hand on meg in all that time he did lay a hand on himself several times doctors and preachers unanimously inveighed against the practice preachers called it the sin of onan doctors said it sapped the bodys vital energies victor didnt care it kept him from wanting to haul off and clout meg it also might have kept him from jumping out a topfloor window and hoping he landed on his head he and his wife stayed polite to each other where anyone else could see or hear them so did blaise and stella if blaise hadnt told him victor wouldnt have known anything was wrong between them he hoped he and meg showed an equally good facade the two of them had an extra mug of flip apiece with supper before they went upstairs on a hot muggy summer evening meg lit the candle on her nightstand i hope you sleep well victor said as he put on his thinnest coolest nightshirt he waited for her to scorch him these past five weeks shed done it more often when they were alone than he could count she started to say something whatever it was she swallowed it before it got out after a moment she brought out something that had to be different victor only his name nothing more no something morea tone of voice he hadnt heard from her in private since hed come back from croydon what is it he asked cautiously she looked at the candle flame not at him would you care to try she asked in return her voice very low would i care to try what for a moment victor honestly didnt know what she was talking about then realization smote and he felt like a fool try that he was very glad his own voice didntquitebreak in surprise are you sure as sure as i need to be meg answered which was less sure than victor wanted her to be she went on if we are going to braze this back together we should begin again not so she made it sound about as romantic as using a prescription from an apothecary victor didnt care how it sounded yes he said eagerly and then pray blow out the candle meg surprised him by shaking her head if you see me if you cannot help but see me you will have a harder time imagining i am someone else than you would in the dark her chin came up defiantly victor started to tell her he wouldnt do anything like that this time he was the one who reconsidered she wouldnt believe him and why should she so all he said was however you please they lay down together meg didnt flinch when he began to caress her but she didnt move toward him or embrace him either the way she would have before she learned about louise shed enjoyed his lovemaking up until then hed always enjoyed hers too he hadnt strayed when she was close by how astonishing was it that that turned out not to be good enough he went slowly and carefully literally feeling his way along after a while she did begin to kiss and caress him in return he didnt pride himself on warming her up and not just because they both would have been sweating even if theyd lain apart she did it with the attitude of someone remembering she was supposed to not with a kindled womans wanton enthusiasm afterwards victor asked was it all right it was meg seemed surprised to admit even so much you took considerable pains and i noticed and i thank you for it it seemed the least i could do victor said yes it did meg agreed which made him gnaw at the inside of his lower lip as she continued but how was i to know ahead of time whether you would do even so little i love you victor said i believe itas long as im in sight when im not you think that what i dont know wont hurt me and so you please yourself his wife said weve been over that ground before we have indeed said victor who didnt want to go over it again meg overrode him but what you forget is sometimes i find out what i didnt know and then it does hurt it hurts all the worse in fact shed been having her say much more often than usual since learning of louiseand nicholas she talked of going over the same ground as things were she held the moral high ground and used it as adroitly as a professional soldier would have used the literal kind i am sorry for the pain i caused you victor said i know not what more i can do to show you that she didnt answer for a little while then thoughtfully she said after what just passed between us i also know not what more you might do you loved me as if you love me if you take my meaning i think so victor said nodding dare i ask if i be forgiven then in part surelyelse you should not have touched me so meg said altogether not yet not for some time i fear i shall find myself wondering about you worrying about you whenever you go more than an hours ride from here more than an hours ride from me i should say then i had better not go any farther than that eh victor said an excellent notion his wife blew out the candle at last the messenger wore the green coat of an atlantean cavalryman with a flourish suggesting hed played in an amateur theatrical or two in his time he handed victor radcliff a letter sealed with the atlantean assemblys redcrested eagle congratulations general he said in a loud ringing voice that also made victor guess hed been on the stage erthank you victor answered but for what still in those ringing tones the man said why for being chosen one of the first two consuls who will lead the united states of atlantis now that no one can doubt our freedom from king georges wicked rule ever since departing from honkers mill and returning to the much larger and more euphonious new hastings the atlantean assembly had argued about how the new nation should be run victor had followed the oftenacrimonious wrangling from what hed thought was a safe distance taking as their model the roman republic the assemblymen had decided to let executive authority rest in the hands of two consuls each with the power to veto the others actions roman consuls served only one year at a time though their atlantean counterparts would have twoyear terms the assembly had also rechristened itself the senate even if hardly anyone used the new name yet it would select the consuls under the rules it had agreed upon one man could serve up to three consecutive terms and a total of five in his lifetime who shall my colleague be victor asked the letter was bound to tell him but the messenger seemed well informed and if he didnt care for the answer he got he had every intention of declining the assemblys invitation no the senates he reminded himself why isaac fenner of course the messenger said as if no one else was even imaginable but victor had imagined plenty of other possible candidates anyone from custis cawthorne to michel du guesclin still he could easily see how fenner would have got the nod and he found himself nodding too isaac should be a good man to work with he said hoping he would still feel that way two years hence he broke the seal the letter was addressed in the fantastically neat script belonging to the atlantean assemblys secretarythe senates secretary now that same worthy had indited the contents in much more formal language the letter told victor what hed already heard from the messenger he was still reading through it when blaise walked over and meg came out of the house to see what was going on victor told them blaise shook his hand meg hugged him and kissed him on the cheek she went back inside returning a moment later with a mug of rum punch which she handed to the messenger the horseman doffed his tricorn much obliged maam he gulped the punch and smacked his lips ahhh much obliged indeedthats tasty stuff you shall be one of the first consuls meg said to victor schoolboys yet unborn will have to learn your name and deeds or get a whipping as if you were william the conqueror or queen elizabeth you make me think i should say no he exclaimed blaise and the messenger laughed meg didnt blaise went back to his cottage to tell stella and the children they came out to congratulate victor in public all seemed well between stella and blaise but blaise hadnt said anything about her letting him make love to her again even though blaise hadnt got roxane with child stella seemed less forgiving than meg victors wife ducked into the house once more when she came out again she gave the messenger another mug of rum punch and a sandwich of roast duck between two thick slices of brown bread the duck was from night before last and wouldnt stay good much longer even so the messenger wasnt inclined to complain just the oppositehe dipped his head and said by all thats holy maam i wish id had call to come here sooner you rode a long way and you brought good news meg said her gaze swung toward victor i suppose it is good news anyhow the messenger only grinnedhe didnt follow that victor smiled uncomfortablyhe did blaise and stella and perhaps even their children understood some of it at any rate but none of them let on well general radcliffuh consul radcliff i guess i should saywill you write me an answer i can take back toward new hastings the messenger asked i shall do that very thing victor said come inside with me why dont you everyone come insidewell get out of the sun after finding a sheet of paper and inking a quill victor wrote quickly to the conscript fathers of the senate of the united stales of atlantis greetings gentlemen i am honored beyond my deserts to be selected consul and gratefully accept the office which i shall fulfill to the best of my abilities poor though they may be i am also proud to share the consulship with the most distinguished isaac fenner and look forward to working with him closely and cordially i remain your most obedient servant and the servant of our common country he signed his name and added his seal he sanded the letter dry shook away the sand folded the paper and used a ribbon and his seal again to make sure it stayed secure on the outside he wrote to the senate of the united states of atlantis convened at new hastings his hand was no match for that of the senates secretary but was tolerably legible you did tell em yes i take it the messenger said as victor gave him the reply i need to know that much in case something happens to the paper yes i told them yes victor answered after two mugs of rum punch the messenger thought that made a fine joke yes yes he said yes yes yes yes yes yes he kept trying to find the funniest way to stress it and laughed harder after each new try he rode off down the dirt track that would take him east and south back toward new hastings victor wouldnt have been amazed had he trotted west instead and ended up in the foothills of the green ridge mountains but no well i wont have to chase after him and put him on the right road blaise said so victor wasnt the only one whod had his doubts after congratulating victor again the negro and his family went back to their own cottage that left the new consul alone with his wife when meg said new hastings she might have been talking about the tallest dunghill for miles around new hastings victor agreed in a very different tone of voice i had not planned on leaving the farm for so long but i had better come along with you she said in a voice that warned she would tolerate no dissent you go there to keep an eye on the country and i shall go there to keep an eye on you sed quis custodiet ipsos custodes for once victor had an answer to juvenals ancient and cynical question he knew exactly who would watch at least one of atlantis watchmen he let out a soft chuckle and what do you find funny now meg asked ominously victor explained to his relief meg at least smiled she was an educated woman even if she hadnt used her latin much since her school days for that matter neither had victor after a moment though she said but juvenal wasnt talking about the roman senate and consuls when he wrote that was he no i dont believe he was victor said and not another word juvenal had been talking about brothel guards if meg didnt recall that victor wasnt about to remind her between you and isaac the country will be in good hands she said mercifully letting the quotation drop between my right and my left so will you fair enough victor agreed and at least for the time being it was
