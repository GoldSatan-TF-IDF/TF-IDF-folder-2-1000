man of means a contents the episode of the landladys daughter the episode of the financial napoleon the episode of the theatrical venture the episode of the live weekly the diverting episode of the exiled monarch the episode of the hired past the episode of the landladys daughter first of a series of six stories first published in pictorial review may when a seedmerchant of cautious disposition and an eye to the main chance receives from an eminent firm of jammanufacturers an extremely large order for cloverseed his emotions are mixed joy may be said to predominate but with the joy comes also uncertainty are these people he asks himself proposing to set up as farmers of a large scale or do they merely want the seed to give verisimilitude to their otherwise bald and unconvincing raspberry jam on the solution of this problem depends the important matter of price for obviously you can charge a fraudulent jam disseminator in a manner which an honest farmer would resent this was the problem which was furrowing the brow of mr julian fineberg of bury st edwards one sunny morning when roland bleke knocked at his door and such was its difficulty that only at the nineteenth knock did mr fineberg raise his head come in that dashed woodpecker out there he shouted for it was his habit to express himself with a generous strength towards the junior members of his staff the young man who entered looked exactly like a second clerk in a provincial seedmerchants office which strangely enough he chanced to be his chief characteristic was an intense ordinariness he was a young man and when you had said that of him you had said everything there was nothing which you would have noticed about him except the fact that there was nothing to notice his age was twentytwo and his name was roland bleke please sir its about my salary mr fineberg at the word drew himself together much as a british square at waterloo must have drawn itself together at the sight of a squadron of cuirassiers salary he cried what about it whats the matter with it you get it dont you yes sir but well dont stand there like an idiot what is it its too much mr finebergs brain reeled it was improbable that the millennium could have arrived with a jerk on the other hand he had distinctly heard one of his clerks complain that his salary was too large he pinched himself say that again he said if you could see your way to reduce it sir it occurred to mr fineberg for one instant that his subordinate was endeavoring to be humorous but a glance at rolands face dispelled that idea why do you want it reduced please sir im going to be married what the deuce do you mean when my salary reaches a hundred and fifty sir and its a hundred and forty now so if you could see your way to knocking off ten pounds mr fineberg saw light he was a married man himself my boy he said genially i quite understand but i can do you better than that its no use doing this sort of thing in a small way from now on your salary is a hundred and ten no no dont thank me youre an excellent clerk and its a pleasure to me to reward merit when i find it close the door after you and mr fineberg returned with a lighter heart to the great cloverseed problem the circumstances which had led roland to approach his employer may be briefly recounted since joining the staff of mr fineberg he had lodged at the house of a mr coppin in honorable employment as porter at the local railwaystation the coppin family excluding domestic pets consisted of mr coppin a kindly and garrulous gentleman of sixty mrs coppin a somewhat negative personality most of whose life was devoted to cooking and washing up in her underground lair brothers frank and percy gentleman of leisure popularly supposed to be engaged in the mysterious occupation known as lookin about for somethin and lastly muriel for some months after his arrival muriel had been to roland bleke a mere automaton a something outside himself that was made only for neatlylaid breakfast tables and silent removal of plates at dinner gradually however when his natural shyness was soothed by use sufficiently to enable him to look at her when she came into the room he discovered that she was a strikingly pretty girl bounded to the north by a mass of auburn hair and to the south by small and shapely feet she also possessed what we are informed we are children in these matters ourselves is known as the r s v p eye this eye had met rolands one evening as he chumped his chop and before he knew what he was doing he had remarked that it had been a fine day from that wonderful moment matters had developed at an incredible speed roland had a nice sense of the social proprieties and he could not bring himself to ignore a girl with whom he had once exchanged easy conversation about the weather whenever she came to lay his table he felt bound to say something not being an experienced gagger he found it more and more difficult each evening to hit on something bright until finally from sheer lack of inspiration he kissed her if matters had progressed rapidly before they went like lightning then it was as if he had touched a spring or pressed a button setting vast machinery in motion even as he reeled back stunned at his audacity the room became suddenly full of coppins of every variety known to science through a mist he was aware of mrs coppin crying in a corner of mr coppin drinking his health in the remains of sparkling limado of brothers frank and percy one on each side trying to borrow simultaneously halfcrowns and of muriel flushed but demure making breadpellets and throwing them in an abstracted way one by one at the coppin cat which had wandered in on the chance of fish out of the chaos as he stood looking at them with his mouth open came the word bans and smote him like a blast of east wind it is not necessary to trace in detail rolands mental processes from that moment till the day when he applied to mr fineberg for a reduction of salary it is enough to say that for quite a month he was extraordinarily happy to a man who has had nothing to do with women to be engaged is an intoxicating experience and at first life was one long golden glow to roland secretly like all mild men he had always nourished a desire to be esteemed a nut by his fellow men and his engagement satisfied that desire it was pleasant to hear brothers frank and percy cough knowingly when he came in it was pleasant to walk abroad with a girl like muriel in the capacity of the accepted wooer above all it was pleasant to sit holding muriels hand and watching the illconcealed efforts of mr albert potter to hide his mortification albert was a mechanic in the motorworks round the corner and hitherto roland had always felt something of a worm in his presence albert was so infernally strong and silent and efficient he could dissect a car and put it together again he could drive through the thickest traffic he could sit silent in company without having his silence attributed to shyness or imbecility but he could not get engaged to muriel coppin that was reserved for roland bleke the nut the dasher the young man of affairs it was all very well being able to tell a sparkplug from a commutator at sight but when it came to a contest in an affair of the heart with a man like roland albert was in his proper place third at the pole probably if he could have gone on merely being engaged roland would never have wearied of the experience but the word marriage began to creep more and more into the family conversation and suddenly panic descended upon roland bleke all his life he had had a horror of definite appointments an invitation to tea a week ahead had been enough to poison life for him he was one of those young men whose souls revolt at the thought of planning out any definite step he could do things on the spur of the moment but plans made him lose his nerve by the end of the month his whole being was crying out to him in agonized tones get me out of this do anything you like but get me out of this frightful marriage business if anything had been needed to emphasize his desire for freedom the attitude of frank and percy would have supplied it every day they made it clearer that the man who married muriel would be no stranger to them it would be his pleasing task to support them too in the style to which they had become accustomed they conveyed the idea that they went with muriel as a sort of bonus the coppin family were at high tea when roland reached home there was a general stir of interest as he entered the room for it was known that he had left that morning with the intention of approaching mr fineberg on the important matter of a rise in salary mr coppin removed his saucer of tea from his lips frank brushed the tail of a sardine from the corner of his mouth percy ate his haddock in an undertone albert potter who was present glowered silently roland shook his head with the nearest approach to gloom which his rejoicing heart would permit im afraid ive bad news mrs coppin burst into tears her invariable practise in any crisis albert potters face relaxed into something resembling a smile he wont give you your raise roland sighed hes reduced me reduced you yes times are bad just at present so he has had to lower me to a hundred and ten the collected jaws of the family fell as one jaw muriel herself seemed to be bearing the blow with fortitude but the rest were stunned frank and percy might have been posing for a picture of men who had lost their fountain pens beneath the table the hand of albert potter found the hand of muriel coppin and held it and muriel we regret to add turned and bestowed upon albert a halfsmile of tender understanding i suppose said roland we couldnt get married on a hundred and ten no said percy no said frank no said albert potter they all spoke decidedly but albert the most decidedly of the three then said roland regretfully im afraid we must wait it seemed to be the general verdict that they must wait muriel said she thought they must wait albert potter whose opinion no one had asked was quite certain that they must wait mrs coppin between sobs moaned that it would be best to wait frank and percy morosely devouring bread and jam said they supposed they would have to wait and to end a painful scene roland drifted silently from the room and went upstairs to his own quarters there was a telegram on the mantel some fellows he soliloquized happily as he opened it wouldnt have been able to manage a little thing like that they would have given themselves away they would the contents of the telegram demanded his attention for some time they conveyed nothing to him the thing might have been written in hindustani it would have been quite appropriate if it had been for it was from the promoters of the calcutta sweep and it informed him that as the holder of ticket number he had drawn gelatine and in recognition of this fact a check for five hundred pounds would be forwarded to him in due course rolands first feeling was one of pure bewilderment as far as he could recollect he had never had any dealings whatsoever with these openhanded gentlemen then memory opened her floodgates and swept him back to a morning ages ago so it seemed to him when mr finebergs eldest son ralph passing through the office on his way to borrow money from his father had offered him for ten shillings down a piece of cardboard at the same time saying something about a sweep partly from a vague desire to keep in with the fineberg clan but principally because it struck him as rather a doggish thing to do roland had passed over the ten shillings and there as far as he had known the matter had ended and now after all this time that simple action had borne fruit in the shape of gelatine and a check for five hundred pounds rolands next emotion was triumph the sudden entry of checks for five hundred pounds into a mans life is apt to produce this result for the space of some minutes he gloated and then reaction set in five hundred pounds meant marriage with muriel his brain worked quickly he must conceal this thing with trembling fingers he felt for his matchbox struck a match and burnt the telegram to ashes then feeling a little better he sat down to think the whole matter over his meditations brought a certain amount of balm after all he felt the thing could quite easily be kept a secret he would receive the check in due course as stated and he would bicycle over to the neighboring town of lexingham and start a bankaccount with it nobody would know and life would go on as before he went to bed and slept peacefully it was about a week after this that he was roused out of a deep sleep at eight oclock in the morning to find his room full of coppins mr coppin was there in a nightshirt and his official trousers mrs coppin was there weeping softly in a brown dressinggown modesty had apparently kept muriel from the gathering but brothers frank and percy stood at his bedside shaking him by the shoulders and shouting mr coppin thrust a newspaper at him as he sat up blinking these epic moments are best related swiftly roland took the paper and the first thing that met his sleepy eye and effectually drove the sleep from it was this headline romance of the calcutta sweepstakes and beneath it another in type almost as large as the first poor clerk wins his own name leaped at him from the printed page and with it that of the faithful gelatine flight that was the masterword which rang in rolands brain as day followed day the wild desire of the trapped animal to be anywhere except just where he was had come upon him he was past the stage when conscience could have kept him to his obligations he had ceased to think of anything or any one but himself all he asked of fate was to remove him from bury st edwards on any terms it may be that some inkling of his state of mind was wafted telepathically to frank and percy for it can not be denied that their behavior at this juncture was more than a little reminiscent of the police force perhaps it was simply their natural anxiety to keep an eye on what they already considered their own private goldmine that made them so adhesive certainly there was no hour of the day when one or the other was not in rolands immediate neighborhood their vigilance even extended to the night hours and once when roland having tossed sleeplessly on his bed got up at two in the morning with the wild idea of stealing out of the house and walking to london a door opened as he reached the top of the stairs and a voice asked him what he thought he was doing the statement that he was walking in his sleep was accepted but coldly it was shortly after this that having by dint of extraordinary strategy eluded the brothers and reached the railwaystation roland with his ticket to london in his pocket and the express already entering the station was engaged in conversation by old mr coppin who appeared from nowhere to denounce the high cost of living in a speech that lasted until the taillights of the train had vanished and brothers frank and percy arrived panting a man has only a certain capacity for battling with fate after this last episode roland gave in not even the exquisite agony of hearing himself described in church as a bachelor of this parish with the grim addition that this was for the second time of asking could stir him to a fresh dash for liberty altho the shadow of the future occupied rolands mind almost to the exclusion of everything else he was still capable of suffering a certain amount of additional torment from the present and one of the things which made the present a source of misery to him was the fact that he was expected to behave more like a mad millionaire than a sober young man with a knowledge of the value of money his mind trained from infancy to a decent respect for the pence had not yet adjusted itself to the possession of large means and the openhanded role forced upon him by the family appalled him when the coppins wanted anything they asked for it and it seemed to roland that they wanted pretty nearly everything if mr coppin had reached his present age without the assistance of a gold watch he might surely have struggled along to the end on gunmetal in any case a man of his years should have been thinking of higher things than mere gauds and trinkets a like criticism applied to mrs coppins demand for a silk petticoat which struck roland as simply indecent frank and percy took theirs mostly in specie it was muriel who struck the worst blow by insisting on a hired motorcar roland hated motorcars especially when they were driven by albert potter as this one was albert that strong silent man had but one way of expressing his emotions namely to open the throttle and shave the paint off trolleycars disappointed love was giving albert a good deal of discomfort at this time and he found it made him feel better to go round corners on two wheels as muriel sat next to him on these expeditions roland squashing into the tonneau with frank and percy his torments were subtle he was not given a chance to forget and the only way in which he could obtain a momentary diminution of the agony was to increase the speed to sixty miles an hour it was in this fashion that they journeyed to the neighboring town of lexingham to see m etienne feriaud perform his feat of looping the loop in his aeroplane it was brother franks idea that they should make up a party to go and see m feriaud franks was one of those generous unspoiled natures which never grow blas at the sight of a fellow human taking a sporting chance at harakiri he was a wellknown figure at every wild animal exhibition within a radius of fifty miles and m feriaud drew him like a magnet the blighter goes up he explained as he conducted the party into the arena and then he stands on his head and goes round in circles ive seen pictures of it it appeared that m feriaud did even more than this posters round the ground advertised the fact that on receipt of five pounds he would take up a passenger with him to date however there appeared to have been no rush on the part of the canny inhabitants of lexingham to avail themselves of this chance of a breath of fresh air m feriaud a small man with a chubby and amiable face wandered about signing picture cards and smoking a lighted cigaret looking a little disappointed albert potter was scornful lot of rabbits he said wheres their pluck and i suppose they call themselves englishmen id go up precious quick if i had a fivepound note disgrace i call it letting a frenchman have the laugh of us it was a long speech for mr potter and it drew a look of respectful tenderness from muriel youre so brave mr potter she said whether it was the slight emphasis which she put on the first word or whether it was sheer generosity that impelled him one can not say but roland produced the required sum even while she spoke he offered it to his rival mr potter started turned a little pale then drew himself up and waved the note aside i take no favors he said with dignity there was a pause why dont you do it said albert nastily five pounds is nothing to you why should i ah why should you it would be useless to assert that mr potters tone was friendly it stung roland it seemed to him that muriel was looking at him in an unpleasantly contemptuous manner in some curious fashion without doing anything to merit it he had apparently become an object of scorn and derision to the party all right then i will he said suddenly easy enough to talk said albert roland strode with a pale but determined face to the spot where m feriaud beaming politely was signing a picture postcard some feeling of compunction appeared to come to muriel at the eleventh hour dont let him she cried but brother frank was made of sterner stuff this was precisely the sort of thing which in his opinion made for a jolly afternoon for years he had been waiting for something of this kind he was experiencing that pleasant thrill which comes to a certain type of person when the victim of a murder in the morning paper is an acquaintance of theirs what are you talking about he said theres no danger at least not much he might easily come down all right besides he wants to what do you want to go interfering for roland returned the negotiations with the birdman had lasted a little longer than one would have expected but then of course m feriaud was a foreigner and rolands french was not fluent he took muriels hand goodby he said he shook hands with the rest of the party even with albert potter it struck frank that he was making too much fuss over a trifle and worse delaying the start of the proceedings whats it all about he demanded you go on as if we were never going to see you again you never know its as safe as being in bed but still in case we never meet again oh well said brother frank and took the outstretched hand the little party stood and watched as the aeroplane moved swiftly along the ground rose and soared into the air higher and higher it rose till the features of the two occupants were almost invisible now said brother frank now watch now hes going to loop the loop but the wheels of the aeroplane still pointed to the ground it grew smaller and smaller it was a mere speck what the dickens far away to the west something showed up against the blue of the sky something that might have been a bird a toy kite or an aeroplane traveling rapidly into the sunset four pairs of eyes followed it in rapt silence the episode of the financial napoleon second of a series of six stories first published in pictorial review june seated with his wife at breakfast on the veranda which overlooked the rolling lawns and leafy woods of his charming sussex home geoffrey windlebird the great financier was enjoying the morning sun to the full his chubby features were relaxed in a smile of lazy contentment and his wife who liked to act sometimes as his secretary found it difficult to get him to pay any attention to his mornings mail theres a column in todays financial argus she said of which you really must take notice its most abusive its about the wildcat reef they assert that there never was any gold in the mine and that you knew it when you floated the company they will have their little joke but you had the usual miningexperts report of course we had and a capital report it was i remember thinking at the time what a neat turn of phrase the fellow had i admit he depended rather on his fine optimism than on any examination of the mine as a matter of fact he never went near it and why should he its down in south america somewhere awful climate snakes mosquitoes revolutions fever mr windlebird spoke drowsily his eyes closed well the argus people say that they have sent a man of their own out there to make inquiries a wellknown expert and the report will be in within the next fortnight they say they will publish it in their next number but one what are you going to do about it mr windlebird yawned not to put too fine a point on it dearest the game is up the napoleon of finance is about to meet his waterloo and all for twenty thousand pounds that is the really bitter part of it tomorrow we sail for the argentine ive got the tickets youre joking geoffrey you must be able to raise twenty thousand its a fleabite on paper in the form of shares script bonds promissory notes it is a fleabite but when it has to be produced in the raw in flat hard lumps of gold or in crackling banknotes its more like a bite from a hippopotamus i cant raise it and thats all about it so st helena for napoleon altho geoffrey windlebird described himself as a napoleon of finance a cinquevalli or chung ling soo of finance would have been a more accurate title as a juggler with other peoples money he was at the head of his class and yet when one came to examine it his method was delightfully simple say for instance that the homegrown tobacco trust founded by geoffrey in a moment of ennui failed to yield those profits which the glowing prospectus had led the public to expect geoffrey would appease the excited shareholders by giving them preference shares interest guaranteed in the seagold extraction company hastily floated to meet the emergency when the interest became due it would as likely as not be paid out of the capital just subscribed for the king solomons mines exploitation association the little deficiency in the latter being replaced in its turn when absolutely necessary and not a moment before by the transfer of some portion of the capital just raised for yet another company and so on ad infinitum there were moments when it seemed to mr windlebird that he had solved the problem of perpetual promotion the only thing that can stop a triumphal progress like mr windlebirds is when some coarse person refuses to play to the rules and demands ready money instead of shares in the next venture this had happened now and it had flattened mr windlebird like an avalanche he was a philosopher but he could not help feeling a little galled that the demand which had destroyed him had been so trivial he had handled millions on paper it was true but still millions and here he was knocked out of time by a paltry twenty thousand pounds are you absolutely sure that nothing can be done persisted mrs windlebird have you tried every one every one dear moonofmydelight the probables the possibles the highly unlikelies and the impossibles never an echo to the minstrels wooing song no my dear we have got to take to the boats this time unless of course some one possessed at one and the same time of twenty thousand pounds and a very confiding nature happens to drop from the clouds as he spoke an aeroplane came sailing over the tops of the trees beyond the tennislawn gracefully as a bird it settled on the smooth turf not twenty yards from where he was seated roland bleke stepped stiffly out onto the tennislawn his progress rather resembled that of a landsman getting out of an open boat in which he has spent a long and perilous night at sea he was feeling more wretched than he had ever felt in his life he had a severe cold he had a splitting headache his hands and feet were frozen his eyes smarted he was hungry he was thirsty he hated cheerful m feriaud who had hopped out and was now busy tinkering the engine a gay provencal air upon his lips as he had rarely hated any one even muriel coppins brother frank so absorbed was he in his troubles that he was not aware of mr windlebirds approach until that pleasant portly mans shadow fell on the turf before him not had an accident i hope mr bleke roland was too far gone in misery to speculate as to how this genial stranger came to know his name as a matter of fact mrs windlebird keen student of the illustrated press had recognized roland by his photograph in the daily mirror in the course of the twenty yards walk from house to tennislawn she had put her husband into possession of the more salient points in rolands history it was when mr windlebird heard that roland had forty thousand pounds in the bank that he sat up and took notice lead me to him he said simply roland sneezed doe accident thag you he replied miserably somethigs gone wrong with the worgs but its nothing serious worse luck m feriaud having by this time adjusted the defect in his engine rose to his feet and bowed excuse if we come down on your lawn but not long do we trespass see mon ami he said radiantly to roland all now o k we go on no said roland decidedly no what you mean no a shade of alarm fell on m feriauds weatherbeaten features the eminent birdman did not wish to part from roland toward roland he felt like a brother for roland had notions about payment for little aeroplane rides which bordered upon the princely but you say take me to france with you i know but its all off im not feeling well but its all wrong m feriaud gesticulated to drive home his point you give me one hundred pounds to take you away from lexingham good it is here he slapped his breast pocket but the other two hundred pounds which also you promise me to pay me when i place you safe in france where is that my friend i will give you two hundred and fifty said roland earnestly to leave me here and go right away and never let me see your beastly machine again a smile of brotherly forgiveness lit up m feriauds face the generous gallic nature asserted itself he held out his arms affectionately to roland ah now you talk now you say something he cried in his impetuous way embrace me you are all right roland heaved a sigh of relief when five minutes later the aeroplane disappeared over the brow of the hill then he began to sneeze again youre not well you know said mr windlebird ive caught cold weve been flying about all night that french ass lost his bearings and my suit is thin can you direct me to a hotel hotel nonsense mr windlebird spoke in the bluff breezy voice which at many a stricken boardmeeting had calmed frantic shareholders as if by magic youre coming right into my house and up to bed this instant it was not till he was between the sheets with a hotwater bottle at his toes and a huge breakfast inside him that roland learned the name of his good samaritan when he did his first impulse was to struggle out of bed and make his escape geoffrey windlebirds was a name which he had learned in the course of his mercantile career to hold in something approaching reverence as that of one of the mightiest business brains of the age to have to meet so eminent a man in the capacity of invalid a nuisance about the house was almost too much for rolands shrinking nature the kindness of the windlebirds and there seemed to be nothing that they were not ready to do for him distressed him beyond measure to have a really great man like geoffrey windlebird sprawling genially over his bed chatting away as if he were an ordinary friend was almost horrible such condescension was too much gradually as he became convalescent roland found this feeling replaced by something more comfortable they were such a genuine simple kindly couple these windlebirds that he lost awe and retained only gratitude he loved them both he opened his heart to them it was not long before he had told them the history of his career skipping the earlier years and beginning with the entry of wealth into his life it makes you feel funny he confided to mr windlebirds sympathetic ear suddenly coming into a pot of money like that you dont seem hardly able to realize it i dont know what to do with it mr windlebird smiled paternally the advice of an older man who has had if i may say so some little experience of finance might be useful to you there perhaps if you would allow me to recommend some sound investment roland glowed with gratitude theres just one thing id like to do before i start putting my money into anything its like this he briefly related the story of his unfortunate affair with muriel coppin within an hour of his departure in the aeroplane his conscience had begun to trouble him on this point he felt that he had not acted well toward muriel true he was practically certain that she didnt care a bit about him and was in love with albert the silent mechanic but there was just the chance that she was mourning over his loss and anyhow his conscience was sore id like to give her something he said how much do you think mr windlebird perpended ill tell you what ill do ill send my own lawyer to her with say a thousand pounds not a check you understand but one thousand golden sovereigns that he can show her roll about on the table in front of her eyes thatll console her its wonderful the effect money in the raw has on people id rather make it two thousand said roland he had never really loved muriel and the idea of marrying her had been a nightmare to him but he wanted to retreat with honor very well make it two thousand if you like tho i dont quite know how old harrison is going to carry all that money as a matter of fact old harrison never had to try on thinking it over after he had cashed rolands check mr windlebird came to the conclusion that seven hundred pounds would be quite as much money as it would be good for miss coppin to have all at once mr windlebirds knowledge of human nature was not at fault muriel jumped at the money and a letter in her handwriting informed roland next morning that his slate was clean his gratitude to mr windlebird redoubled and now said mr windlebird genially we can talk about that money of yours and the best way of investing it what you want is something which without being in any way what is called speculative nevertheless returns a fair and reasonable amount of interest what you want is something sound something solid yet something with a bit of a kick to it something which cant go down and may go soaring like a rocket roland quietly announced that was just what he did want and lit another cigar now look here bleke my boy as a general rule i dont give tips but ive taken a great fancy to you bleke and im going to break my rule put your money he sank his voice to a compelling whisper put every penny you can afford into wildcat reefs he leaned back with the benign air of the alchemist who has just imparted to a favorite disciple the recently discovered secret of the philosophers stone thank you very much mr windlebird said roland gratefully i will the napoleonic features were lightened by that rare indulgent smile not so fast young man laughed mr windlebird getting into wildcat reefs isnt quite so easy as you seem to think shall we say that you propose to invest thirty thousand pounds yes very well then thirty thousand pounds why if it got about that you were going to buy wildcat reefs on that scale the market would be convulsed which was perfectly true if it had got about that any one was going to invest thirty thousand pounds or pence in wildcat reefs the market would certainly have been convulsed the house would have rocked with laughter wildcat reefs were a standing joke except to the unfortunate few who still held any of the shares the thing will have to be done very cautiously no one must know but i think i say i think i can manage it for you youre awfully kind mr windlebird not at all my dear boy not at all as a matter of fact i shall be doing a very good turn to another pal of mine at the same time he filled his glass this he paused to sip this pal of mine has a large holding of wildcats he wants to realize in order to put the money into something else in which he is more personally interested mr windlebird paused his mind dwelt for a moment on his overdrawn current account at the bank in which he is more personally interested he repeated dreamily but of course you couldnt unload thirty pounds worth of wildcats in the public market i quite see that assented roland it might however be done by private negotiation he said i must act very cautiously give me your check for the thirty thousand tonight and i will run up to town tomorrow morning and see what i can do he did it what hidden strings he pulled what levers he used roland did not know all roland knew was that somehow by some subtle means mr windlebird brought it off two days later his host handed him twenty thousand onepound shares in the wildcat reef goldmine there my boy he said its awfully kind of you mr windlebird my dear boy dont mention it if youre satisfied im sure i am mr windlebird always spoke the truth when he could he spoke it now it seemed to roland as the days went by that nothing could mar the pleasant easy course of life at the windlebirds the fine weather the beautiful garden the pleasant company all these things combined to make this sojourn an epoch in his life he discovered his mistake one lovely afternoon as he sat smoking idly on the terrace mrs windlebird came to him and a glance was enough to show roland that something was seriously wrong her face was drawn and tired a moment before roland had been thinking life perfect the only crumpled roseleaf had been the absence of an evening paper mr windlebird would bring one back with him when he returned from the city but roland wanted one now he was a great follower of county cricket and he wanted to know how surrey was faring against yorkshire but even this crumpled roseleaf had been smoothed out for johnson the groom who happened to be riding into the nearest town on an errand had promised to bring one back with him he might appear at any moment now the sight of his hostess drove all thoughts of sport out of his mind she was looking terribly troubled it flashed across roland that both his host and hostess had been unusually silent at dinner the night before and later passing mr windlebirds room on his way to bed he had heard their voices low and agitated could they have had some bad news mr bleke i want to speak to you roland moved like a sympathetic cow and waited to hear more you were not up when my husband left for the city this morning or he would have told you himself mr bleke i hardly know how to break it to you break it to me my husband advised you to put a very large sum of money in a mine called wildcat reefs yes thirty thousand pounds as much as that oh mr bleke she began to cry softly she pressed his hand roland gaped at her mr bleke there has been a terrible slump in wildcat reefs today they may be absolutely worthless roland felt as if a cold hand had been laid on his spine worworthless he stammered mrs windlebird looked at him with moist eyes you can imagine how my husband feels about this it was on his advice that you invested your money he holds himself directly responsible he is in a terrible state of mind he is frantic he has grown so fond of you mr bleke that he can hardly face the thought that he has been the innocent instrument of your trouble roland felt that it was an admirable comparison his sensations were precisely those of a leading actor in an earthquake the solid earth seemed to melt under him we talked it over last night after you had gone to bed and we came to the conclusion that there was only one honorable step to take we must make good your losses we must buy back those shares a ray of hope began to steal over rolands horizon but he began there are no buts really mr bleke we should neither of us know a minutes peace if we didnt do it now you paid thirty thousand pounds for the shares you said well she held out a pink slip of paper to him this will make everything all right roland looked at the check but but this is signed by you he said yes you see if geoffrey had to sign a check for that amount it would mean selling out some of his stock and in his position with every movement watched by enemies he can not afford to do it it might ruin the plans of years but i have some money of my own my selling out stock doesnt matter you see i have postdated the check a week to give me time to realize on the securities in which my money is invested rolands whole nature rose in revolt at this sacrifice if it had been his host who had made this offer he would have accepted it but chivalry forbade his taking this money from a woman a glow of selfsacrifice warmed him after all what was this money of his he had never had any fun out of it he had had so little acquaintance with it that for all practical purposes it might never have been his with a gesture which had once impressed him very favorably when exhibited on the stage by the hero of the number two company of the price of honor which had paid a six days visit to bury st edwards a few months before he tore the check into little pieces i couldnt accept it mrs windlebird he said i cant tell you how deeply i appreciate your wonderful kindness but i really couldnt i bought the shares with my eyes open the whole thing is nobodys fault and i cant let you suffer for it after the way you have treated me here it would be impossible i cant take your money its noble and generous of you in the extreme but i cant accept it ive still got a little money left and ive always been used to working for my living anyway so so its all right mr bleke i implore you roland was hideously embarrassed he looked right and left for a way of escape he could hardly take to his heels and yet there seemed no other way of ending the interview then with a start of relief he perceived johnson the groom coming toward him with the evening paper johnson said he was going into the town said roland apologetically so i asked him to get me an evening paper i wanted to see the lunch scores if he had been looking at his hostess then an action which he was strenuously avoiding he might have seen a curious spasm pass over her face mrs windlebird turned very pale and sat down suddenly in the chair which roland had vacated at the beginning of their conversation she lay back in it with her eyes closed she looked tired and defeated roland took the paper mechanically he wanted it as a diversion to the conversation merely for his interest in the doings of surrey and yorkshire had waned to the point of complete indifference in competition with mrs windlebirds news equally mechanically he unfolded it and glanced at front page and as he did do a flaring explosion of headlines smote his eye out of the explosion emerged the word wildcats why he exclaimed theres columns about wildcats on the front page here yes mrs windlebirds voice sounded strangely dull and toneless her eyes were still closed roland took in the headlines with starting eyes the wildcat reef goldmine another klondike frenzied scenes on the stock exchange brokers fight for shares record boom unprecedented rise in prices shorn of all superfluous adjectives and general journalistic exuberance what the paper had to announce to its readers was this the special commissioner sent out by the financial argus to make an exhaustive examination of the wildcat reef mine with the amiable view no doubt of exploding mr geoffrey windlebird once and for all with the confiding british public has found to his unbounded astonishment that there are vast quantities of gold in the mine the discovery of the new reef the largest and richest it is stated since the famous mount morgan occurred with dramatic appropriateness on the very day of his arrival we need scarcely remind our readers that until that moment wildcat reef shares had reached a very low figure and only a few optimists retained their faith in the mine as the largest holder mr windlebird is to be heartily congratulated on this new addition to his fortune the publication of the experts report in the financial argus has resulted in a boom in wildcats the like of which can seldom have been seen on the stock exchange from something like one shilling and sixpence per bundle the one pound shares have gone up to nearly ten pounds a share and even at this latter figure people were literally fighting to secure them the world swam about roland he was stupefied and even terrified the very atmosphere seemed foggy so far as his reeling brain was capable of thought he figured that he was now worth about two hundred thousand pounds oh mrs windlebird he cried its all right after all mrs windlebird sat back in her chair without answering its all right for every one screamed roland joyfully why if ive made a couple of hundred thousand what must mr windlebird have netted it says here that he is the largest holder he must have pulled off the biggest thing of his life he thought for a moment the chap im sorry for he said meditatively is mr windlebirds pal you know the fellow whom mr windlebird persuaded to sell all his shares to me a faint moan escaped from his hostesss pale lips roland did not hear it he was reading the cricket news the episode of the theatrical venture third of a series of six stories first published in pictorial review july it was one of those hard nubbly rolls the best restaurants charge you sixpence for having the good sense not to eat them it hit roland bleke with considerable vehemence on the bridge of the nose for the moment roland fancied that the roof of the regent grillroom must have fallen in and as this would automatically put an end to the party he was not altogether sorry he had never been to a theatrical supperparty before and within five minutes of his arrival at the present one he had become afflicted with an intense desire never to go to a theatrical supperparty again to be a success at these gay gatherings one must possess dash and roland whatever his other sterling qualities was a little short of dash the young man on the other side of the table was quite nice about it while not actually apologizing he went so far as to explain that it was old gerry whom he had had in his mind when he started the roll on its course after a glance at old gerry a chinless child of about nineteen roland felt that it would be churlish to be angry with a young man whose intentions had been so wholly admirable old gerry had one of those faces in which any alteration even the comparatively limited one which a roll would be capable of producing was bound to be for the better he smiled a sickly smile and said that it didnt matter the charming creature who sat on his assailants left however took a more serious view of the situation sidney you make me tired she said severely if i had thought you didnt know how to act like a gentleman i wouldnt have come here with you go away somewhere and throw bread at yourself and ask mr bleke to come and sit by me i want to talk to him that was rolands first introduction to miss billy verepoint ive been wanting to have a chat with you all the evening mr bleke she said as roland blushingly sank into the empty chair ive heard such a lot about you what miss verepoint had heard about roland was that he had two hundred thousand pounds and apparently did not know what to do with it in fact if i hadnt been told that you would be here i shouldnt have come to this party cant stand these gatherings of nuts in may as a general rule they bore me stiff roland hastily revised his first estimate of the theatrical profession shallow emptyheaded creatures some of them might be no doubt but there were exceptions here was a girl of real discernment a thoughtful student of character a girl who understood that a man might sit at a supperparty without uttering a word and might still be a man of parts im afraid youll think me very outspoken but thats me all over all my friends say billy verepoints a funny girl if she likes any one she just tells them so straight out and if she doesnt like any one she tells them straight out too and a very admirable trait said roland enthusiastically miss verepoint sighed praps it is she said pensively but im afraid its what has kept me back in my profession managers dont like it they think girls should be seen and not heard rolands blood boiled managers were plainly a dastardly crew but whats the good of worrying went on miss verepoint with a brave but hollow laugh of course its wearing having to wait when one has got as much ambition as i have but they all tell me that my chance is bound to come some day the intense mournfulness of miss verepoints expression seemed to indicate that she anticipated the arrival of the desired day not less than sixty years hence roland was profoundly moved his chivalrous nature was up in arms he fell to wondering if he could do anything to help this victim of managerial unfairness you dont mind my going on about my troubles do you asked miss verepoint solicitously one so seldom meets anybody really sympathetic roland babbled fervent assurances and she pressed his hand gratefully i wonder if you would care to come to tea one afternoon she said oh rather said roland he would have liked to put it in a more polished way but he was almost beyond speech of course i know what a busy man you are no no well i should be in tomorrow afternoon if you cared to look in roland bleated gratefully ill write down the address for you said miss verepoint suddenly businesslike exactly when he committed himself to the purchase of the windsor theater roland could never say the idea seemed to come into existence fullygrown without preliminary discussion one moment it was not the next it was his recollections of the afternoon which he spent drinking lukewarm tea and punctuating miss verepoints flow of speech with yess and nos were always so thoroughly confused that he never knew even whose suggestion it was the purchase of a westend theater when one has the necessary cash is not nearly such a complicated business as the layman might imagine roland was staggered by the rapidity with which the transaction was carried through the theater was his before he had time to realize that he had never meant to buy the thing at all he had gone into the offices of mr montague with the intention of making an offer for the lease for say six months and that wizard in the space of less than an hour had not only induced him to sign mysterious documents which made him sole proprietor of the house but had left him with the feeling that he had done an extremely acute stroke of business mr montague had dabbled in many professions in his time from street peddling upward but what he was really best at was hypnotism altho he felt after the spell of mr montagues magnetism was withdrawn rather like a nervous man who has been given a large baby to hold by a strange woman who has promptly vanished round the corner roland was to some extent consoled by the praise bestowed upon him by miss verepoint she said it was much better to buy a theater than to rent it because then you escaped the heavy rent it was specious but roland had a dim feeling that there was a flaw somewhere in the reasoning and it was from this point that a shadow may be said to have fallen upon the brightness of the venture he would have been even less selfcongratulatory if he had known the windsor theaters reputation being a comparative stranger in the metropolis he was unaware that its nickname in theatrical circles was the mugs graveyard a title which had been bestowed upon it not without reason built originally by a slightly insane old gentleman whose principal delusion was that the public was pining for a constant supply of the higher drama and more especially those specimens of the higher drama which flowed practically without cessation from the restless pen of the insane old gentleman himself the windsor theater had passed from hand to hand with the agility of a gold watch in a gathering of racecourse thieves the one anxiety of the unhappy man who found himself by some accident in possession of the windsor theater was to pass it on to somebody else the only really permanent tenant it ever had was the representative of the official receiver various causes were assigned for the phenomenal illluck of the theater but undoubtedly the vital objection to it as a temple of drama lay in the fact that nobody could ever find the place where it was hidden cabmen shook their heads on the rare occasions when they were asked to take a fare there explorers to whom a stroll through the australian bush was childsplay had been known to spend an hour on its trail and finish up at the point where they had started it was precisely this quality of elusiveness which had first attracted mr montague he was a farseeing man and to him the topographical advantages of the theater were enormous it was further from a firestation than any other building of the same insurance value in london even without having regard to the mystery which enveloped its whereabouts often after a good dinner he would lean comfortably back in his chair and see in the smoke of his cigar a vision of the windsor theater blazing merrily while distracted firemen galloped madly all over london vainly endeavoring to get some one to direct them to the scene of the conflagration so mr montague bought the theater for a mere song and prepared to get busy unluckily for him the representatives of the various fire offices with which he had effected his policies got busy first the generous fellows insisted upon taking off his shoulders the burden of maintaining the fireman whose permanent presence in a theater is required by law nothing would satisfy them but to install firemen of their own and pay their salaries this to a man in whom the instincts of the phoenix were so strongly developed as they were in mr montague was distinctly disconcerting he saw himself making no profit on the deal a thing which had never happened to him before and then roland bleke occurred and mr montagues belief that his race was really chosen was restored he sold the windsor theater to roland for twentyfive thousand pounds it was fifteen thousand pounds more than he himself had given for it and this very satisfactory profit mitigated the slight regret which he felt when it came to transferring to roland the insurance policies to have effected policies amounting to rather more than seventy thousand pounds on a building so notoriously valueless as the windsor theater had been an achievement of which mr montague was justly proud and it seemed sad to him that so much earnest endeavor should be thrown away over the little lunch with which she kindly allowed roland to entertain her to celebrate the purchase of the theater miss verepoint outlined her policy what we must put up at that theater she announced is a revue a revue repeated miss verepoint making as she spoke little calculations on the back of the menu we could run for about fifteen hundred a week or say two thousand saying two thousand thought roland to himself is not quite the same as paying two thousand so why should she stint herself i know two boys who could write us a topping revue said miss verepoint theyd spread themselves too if it was for me theyre in love with me both of them wed better get in touch with them at once to roland there seemed to be something just the least bit sinister about the sound of that word touch but he said nothing why there they are lunching over there cried miss verepoint pointing to a neighboring table now isnt that lucky to roland the luck was not quite so apparent but he made no demur to miss verepoints suggestion that they should be brought over to their table the two boys as to whose capabilities to write a topping revue miss verepoint had formed so optimistic an estimate proved to be wellgrown lads of about fortyfive and forty respectively of the two roland thought that perhaps r p de parys was a shade the more obnoxious but a closer inspection left him with the feeling that these fine distinctions were a little unfair with men of such equal talents bromham rhodes ran his friend so close that it was practically a dead heat they were both fat and somewhat bulgyeyed this was due to the fact that what revuewriting exacts from its exponents is the constant assimilation of food and drink bromham rhodes had the largest appetite in london but on the other hand r p de parys was a better drinker well dear old thing said bromham rhodes well old child said r p de parys both these remarks were addressed to miss verepoint the talented pair appeared to be unaware of rolands existence miss verepoint struck the business note now you stop boys she said tie weights to yourselves and sink down into those chairs i want you two lads to write a revue for me delighted said bromham rhodes but there is the trifling point to be raised first said r p de parys where is the money coming from said bromham rhodes my friend mr bleke is putting up the money said miss verepoint with dignity he has taken the windsor theater the interest of the two authors in their host till then languid increased with a jerk has he by jove they cried we must get together and talk this over it was rolands first experience of a theatrical talkingover and he never forgot it two such talkersover as bromham rhodes and r p de parys were scarcely to be found in the length and breadth of theatrical london nothing it seemed could the gifted pair even begin to think of doing without first discussing the proposition in all its aspects the amount of food which roland found himself compelled to absorb during the course of these debates was appalling discussions which began at lunch would be continued until it was time to order dinner and then as likely as not they would have to sit there till suppertime in order to thrash the question thoroughly out the collection of a cast was a matter even more complicated than the actual composition of the revue there was the almost insuperable difficulty that miss verepoint firmly vetoed every name suggested it seemed practically impossible to find any man or woman in all england or america whose peculiar gifts or lack of them would not interfere with miss verepoints giving a satisfactory performance of the principal role it was all very perplexing to roland but as miss verepoint was an expert in theatrical matters he scarcely felt entitled to question her views it was about this time that roland proposed to miss verepoint the passage of time and the strain of talking over the revue had to a certain extent moderated his original fervor he had shaded off from a passionate devotion through various diminishing tints of regard for her into a sort of pale sunset glow of affection his principal reason for proposing was that it seemed to him to be in the natural order of events her air towards him had become distinctly proprietorial she now called him rolypoly in public a proceeding which left him with mixed feelings also she had taken to ordering him about which as everybody knows is an unmistakable sign of affection among ladies of the theatrical profession finally in his chivalrous way roland had begun to feel a little apprehensive lest he might be compromising miss verepoint everybody knew that he was putting up the money for the revue in which she was to appear they were constantly seen together at restaurants people looked arch when they spoke to him about her he had to ask himself was he behaving like a perfect gentleman the answer was in the negative he took a cab to her flat and proposed before he could repent of his decision she accepted him he was not certain for a moment whether he was glad or sorry but i dont want to get married she went on until i have justified my choice of a profession you will have to wait until i have made a success in this revue roland was shocked to find himself hugely relieved at this concession the revue took shape there did apparently exist a handful of artistes to whom miss verepoint had no objection and these a scrubby but confident lot were promptly engaged sallow americans sprang from nowhere with songs dances and ideas for effects tousledhaired scenic artists wandered in with model scenes under their arms a great cloud of chorusladies settled upon the theater like flies even bromham rhodes and r p de parys those human pythons showed signs of activity they cornered roland one day near swan and edgars steered him into the piccadilly grillroom and over a hearty lunch read him extracts from a brownpapercovered manuscript which they informed him was the first act it looked a battered sort of manuscript and indeed it had every right to be under various titles and at various times bromham rhodes and r p de parys first act had been refused by practically every responsible manager in london as oh what a life it had failed to satisfy the directors of the empire rechristened wowwow it had been rejected by the alhambra the hippodrome had refused to consider it even under the name of hullo cellarflap it was now called pass along please and according to its authors was a real revue roland was to learn as the days went on that in the world in which he was moving everything was real revue that was not a stunt or a corking effect he floundered in a sea of real revue stunts and corking effects as far as he could gather the main difference between these things was that real revue was something which had been stolen from some previous english production whereas a stunt or a corking effect was something which had been looted from new york a judicious blend of these he was given to understand constituted the sort of thing the public wanted rehearsals began before in rolands opinion his little army was properly supplied with ammunition true they had the first act but even the authors agreed that it wanted bringing uptodate in parts they explained that it was in a manner of speaking their lifework that they had actually started it about ten years ago when they were careless lads inevitably it was spotted here and there with smart topical hits of the early years of the century but that they said would be all right they could freshen it up in a couple of evenings it was simply a matter of deleting allusions to proboers and substituting lines about marconi shares and mangelwurzels itll be all right they assured roland this is real revue in times of trouble there is always a point at which one may say here is the beginning of the end this point came with roland at the commencement of the rehearsals till then he had not fully realized the terrible nature of the production for which he had made himself responsible moreover it was rehearsals which gave him his first clear insight into the character of miss verepoint miss verepoint was not at her best at rehearsals for the first time as he watched her roland found himself feeling that there was a case to be made out for the managers who had so consistently kept her in the background miss verepoint to use the technical term threw her weight about there were not many good lines in the script of act one of pass along please but such as there were she reached out for and grabbed away from their owners who retired into corners scowling and muttering like dogs robbed of bones she snubbed everybody roland included roland sat in the cold darkness of the stalls and watched her panicstricken like an icy wave it had swept over him what marriage with this girl would mean he suddenly realised how essentially domestic his instincts really were life with miss verepoint would mean perpetual dinners at restaurants breadthrowing suppers motorrides everything that he hated most yet as a man of honor he was tied to her if the revue was a success she would marry him and revues he knew were always successes at that very moment there were six best revues in london running at various theaters he shuddered at the thought that in a few weeks there would be seven he felt a longing for rural solitude he wanted to be alone by himself for a day or two in a place where there were no papers with advertisements of revues no grillrooms and above all no miss billy verepoint that night he stole away to a norfolk village where in happier days he had once spent a summer holiday a peaceful primitive place where the inhabitants could not have told real revue from a corking effect here for the space of a week roland lay in hiding while his quivering nerves gradually recovered tone he returned to london happier but a little apprehensive beyond a brief telegram of farewell he had not communicated with miss verepoint for seven days and experience had made him aware that she was a lady who demanded an adequate amount of attention that his nervous system was not wholly restored to health was borne in upon him as he walked along piccadilly on his way to his flat for when somebody suddenly slapped him hard between the shoulderblades he uttered a stifled yell and leaped in the air turning to face his assailant he found himself meeting the genial gaze of mr montague his predecessor in the ownership of the windsor theater mr montague was effusively friendly and for some mysterious reason congratulatory youve done it have you you pulled it off did you and in the first month by george and i took you for the plain ordinary mug of commerce my boy youre as deep as they make em whod have thought it to look at you it was the greatest idea any one ever had and staring me in the face all the time and i never saw it but i dont grudge it to you you deserve it my boy youre a nut i really dont know what you mean quite right my boy chuckled mr montague youre quite right to keep it up even among friends it dont do to risk anything and the least said soonest mended he went on his way leaving roland completely mystified voices from his sittingroom among which he recognized the high note of miss verepoint reminded him of the ordeal before him he entered with what he hoped was a careless ease of manner but his heart was beating fast since the opening of rehearsals he had acquired a wholesome respect for miss verepoints tongue she was sitting in his favorite chair there were also present bromham rhodes and r p de parys who had made themselves completely at home with a couple of his cigars and whisky from the oldest bin so here you are at last said miss verepoint querulously the valet told us you were expected back this morning so we waited where on earth have you been to running away like this without a word i only went well it doesnt matter where you went the main point is what are you going to do about it we thought wed better come along and talk it over said r p de parys talk what over said roland the revue oh dont try and be funny for goodness sake snapped miss verepoint it doesnt suit you you havent the right shape of head what do you suppose we want to talk over the theater of course what about the theater miss verepoint looked searchingly at him dont you ever read the papers i havent seen a paper since i went away well better have it quick and not waste time breaking it gently said miss verepoint the theaters been burned down thats whats happened burned down burned down repeated roland thats what i said didnt i the suffragettes did it they left copies of votes for women about the place the silly asses set fire to two other theaters as well but they happened to be in main thoroughfares and the firebrigade got them under at once i suppose they couldnt find the windsor anyhow its burned to the ground and what we want to know is what are you going to do about it roland was much too busy blessing the good angels of kingsway to reply at once r p de parys sympathetic soul placed a wrong construction on his silence poor old roly he said its quite broken him up the best thing we can do is all to go off and talk it over at the savoy over a bit of lunch well said miss verepoint what are you going to do rebuild the windsor or try and get another theater the authors were all for rebuilding the windsor true it would take time but it would be more satisfactory in every way besides at this time of the year it would be no easy matter to secure another theater at a moments notice to r p de parys and bromham rhodes the destruction of the windsor theater had appeared less in the light of a disaster than as a direct intervention on the part of providence the completion of that tiresome second act which had brooded over their lives like an ugly cloud could now be postponed indefinitely of course said r p de parys thoughtfully our contract with you makes it obligatory on you to produce our revue by a certain date but i dare say bromham we could meet roly there couldnt we sure said rhodes something nominal say a further five hundred on account of fees would satisfy us i certainly think it would be better to rebuild the windsor dont you r p i do agreed r p de parys cordially you see roly our revue has been written to fit the windsor it would be very difficult to alter it for production at another theater yes i feel sure that rebuilding the windsor would be your best course there was a pause what do you think rolypoly asked miss verepoint as roland made no sign nothing would delight me more than to rebuild the windsor or to take another theater or do anything else to oblige he said cheerfully unfortunately i have no more money to burn it was as if a bomb had suddenly exploded in the room a dreadful silence fell upon his hearers for the moment no one spoke r p de parys woke with a start out of a beautiful dream of prawn curry and bromham rhodes forgot that he had not tasted food for nearly two hours miss verepoint was the first to break the silence do you mean to say she gasped that you didnt insure the place roland shook his head the particular form in which miss verepoint had put the question entitled him he felt to make this answer why didnt you miss verepoints tone was almost menacing because it did not appear to me to be necessary nor was it necessary said roland to his conscience mr montague had done all the insuring that was necessary and a bit over miss verepoint fought with her growing indignation and lost what about the salaries of the people who have been rehearsing all this time she demanded im sorry that they should be out of an engagement but it is scarcely my fault however i propose to give each of them a months salary i can manage that i think miss verepoint rose and what about me what about me thats what i want to know where do i get off if you think im going to marry you without your getting a theater and putting up this revue youre jolly well mistaken roland made a gesture which was intended to convey regret and resignation he even contrived to sigh very well then said miss verepoint rightly interpreting this behavior as his final pronouncement on the situation then everythings jolly well off she swept out of the room the two authors following in her wake like porpoises behind a liner roland went to his bureau unlocked it and took out a bundle of documents he let his fingers stray lovingly among the fire insurance policies which energetic mr montague had been at such pains to secure from so many companies and so he said softly to himself am i the episode of the live weekly fourth of a series of six stories first published in pictorial review august it was with a start that roland bleke realized that the girl at the other end of the bench was crying for the last few minutes as far as his preoccupation allowed him to notice them at all he had been attributing the subdued sniffs to a summer cold having just recovered from one himself he was embarrassed he blamed the fate that had led him to this particular bench but he wished to give himself up to quiet deliberation on the question of what on earth he was to do with two hundred and fifty thousand pounds to which figure his fortune had now risen the sniffs continued rolands discomfort increased chivalry had always been his weakness in the old days on a hundred and forty pounds a year he had had few opportunities of indulging himself in this direction but now it seemed to him sometimes that the whole world was crying out for assistance should he speak to her he wanted to but only a few days ago his eyes had been caught by the placard of a weekly paper bearing the title of squibs on which in large letters was the legend men who speak to girls and he had gathered that the accompanying article was a denunciation rather than a eulogy of these individuals on the other hand she was obviously in distress another sniff decided him i say you know he said the girl looked at him she was small and at the present moment had that air of the floweret surprized while shrinking which adds a good thirtythree per cent to a girls attractions her nose he noted was delicately tiptilted a certain pallor added to her beauty rolands heart executed the opening steps of a buckandwing dance pardon me he went on but you appear to be in trouble is there anything i can do for you she looked at him again a keen look which seemed to get into rolands soul and walk about it with a searchlight then as if satisfied by the inspection she spoke no i dont think there is she said unless you happen to be the proprietor of a weekly paper with a womans page and need an editress for it i dont understand well thats all any one could do for me give me back my work or give me something else of the same sort oh have you lost your job i have so would you mind going away because i want to go on crying and i do it better alone you wont mind my turning you out i hope but i was here first and there are heaps of other benches no but wait a minute i want to hear about this i might be able what i mean is think of something tell me all about it there is no doubt that the possession of two hundred and fifty thousand pounds tones down a diffident mans diffidence roland began to feel almost masterful why should i why shouldnt you theres something in that said the girl reflectively after all you might know somebody well as you want to know i have just been discharged from a paper called squibs i used to edit the womans page by jove did you write that article on men who speak the hard manner in which she had wrapped herself as in a garment vanished instantly her eyes softened she even blushed just a becoming pink you know you dont mean to say you read it i didnt think that any one ever really read squibs read it cried roland recklessly abandoning truth i should jolly well think so i know it by heart do you mean to say that after an article like that they actually sacked you threw you out as a failure oh they didnt send me away for incompetence it was simply because they couldnt afford to keep me on mr petheram was very nice about it whos mr petheram mr petherams everything he calls himself the editor but hes really everything except officeboy and i expect hell be that next week when i started with the paper there was quite a large staff but it got whittled down by degrees till there was only mr petheram and myself it was like the crew of the nancy bell they got eaten one by one till i was the only one left and now ive gone mr petheram is doing the whole paper now how is it that he cant get anything better to do roland said he has done lots of better things he used to be at carmelite house but they thought he was too old roland felt relieved he conjured up a picture of a whitehaired elder with a fatherly manner oh hes old is he twentyfour there was a brief silence something in the girls expression stung roland she wore a rapt look as if she were dreaming of the absent petheram confound him he would show her that petheram was not the only man worth looking rapt about he rose would you mind giving me your address he said why in order said roland carefully that i may offer you your former employment on squibs i am going to buy it after all your man of dash and enterprise your napoleon does have his moments without looking at her he perceived that he had bowled her over completely something told him that she was staring at him openmouthed meanwhile a voice within him was muttering anxiously i wonder how much this is going to cost youre going to buy squibs her voice had fallen away to an awestruck whisper i am she gulped well i think youre wonderful so did roland where will a letter find you he asked my name is march bessie march im living at twentyseven guildford street twentyseven thank you good morning i will communicate with you in due course he raised his hat and walked away he had only gone a few steps when there was a patter of feet behind him he turned i i just wanted to thank you she said not at all said roland not at all he went on his way tingling with just triumph petheram who was petheram who in the name of goodness was petheram he had put petheram in his proper place he rather fancied petheram forsooth laughable a copy of the current number of squibs purchased at a bookstall informed him after a minute search to find the editorial page that the offices of the paper were in fetter lane it was evidence of his exalted state of mind that he proceeded thither in a cab fetter lane is one of those streets in which rooms that have only just escaped being cupboards by a few feet achieve the dignity of offices there might have been space to swing a cat in the editorial sanctum of squibs but it would have been a near thing as for the outer office in which a vacantfaced lad of fifteen received roland and instructed him to wait while he took his card in to mr petheram it was a mere box roland was afraid to expand his chest for fear of bruising it the boy returned to say that mr petheram would see him mr petheram was a young man with a mop of hair and an air of almost painful restraint he was in his shirtsleeves and the table before him was heaped high with papers opposite him evidently in the act of taking his leave was a comfortablelooking man of middle age with a red face and a short beard he left as roland entered and roland was surprized to see mr petheram spring to his feet shake his fist at the closing door and kick the wall with a vehemence which brought down several inches of discolored plaster take a seat he said when he had finished this performance what can i do for you roland had always imagined that editors in their private offices were less easily approached and when approached more brusk the fact was that mr petheram whose optimism nothing could quench had mistaken him for a prospective advertiser i want to buy the paper said roland he was aware that this was an abrupt way of approaching the subject but after all he did want to buy the paper so why not say so mr petheram fizzed in his chair he glowed with excitement do you mean to tell me theres a single bookstall in london which has sold out great scott perhaps theyve all sold out how many did you try i mean buy the whole paper become proprietor you know roland felt that he was blushing and hated himself for it he ought to be carrying this thing through with an air mr petheram looked at him blankly why he asked oh i dont know said roland he felt the interview was going all wrong it lacked a stateliness which this kind of interview should have had honestly said mr petheram you arent pulling my leg roland nodded mr petheram appeared to struggle with his conscience and finally to be worsted by it for his next remarks were limpidly honest dont you be an ass he said you dont know what youre letting yourself in for did you see that blighter who went out just now do you know who he is thats the fellow weve got to pay five pounds a week to for life why we cant get rid of him when the paper started the proprietors not the present ones thought it would give the thing a boom if they had a football competition with a first prize of a fiver a week for life well thats the man who won it hes been handed down as a legacy from proprietor to proprietor till now weve got him ages ago they tried to get him to compromise for a lump sum down but he wouldnt said he would only spend it and preferred to get it by the week well by the time weve paid that vampire there isnt much left out of our profits thats why we are at the present moment a little understaffed a frown clouded mr petherams brow roland wondered if he was thinking of bessie march i know all about that he said and you still want to buy the thing yes but what on earth for mind you i ought not to be crabbing my own paper like this but you seem a good chap and i dont want to see you landed why are you doing it oh just for fun ah now youre talking if you can afford expensive amusements go ahead he put his feet on the table and lit a short pipe his gloomy views on the subject of squibs gave way to a wave of optimism you know he said theres really a lot of life in the old rag yet if it were properly run what has hampered us has been lack of capital we havent been able to advertise im bursting with ideas for booming the paper only naturally you cant do it for nothing as for editing what i dont know about editing but perhaps you had got somebody else in your mind no no said roland who would not have known an editor from an officeboy the thought of interviewing prospective editors appalled him very well then resumed mr petheram reassured kicking over a heap of papers to give more room for his feet take it that i continue as editor we can discuss terms later under the present regime i have been doing all the work in exchange for a happy home i suppose you wont want to spoil the ship for a haporth of tar in other words you would sooner have a happy wellfed editor running about the place than a brokendown wreck who might swoon from starvation but one moment said roland are you sure that the present proprietors will want to sell want to sell cried mr petheram enthusiastically why if they know you want to buy youve as much chance of getting away from them without the paper as as well i cant think of anything that has such a poor chance of anything if you arent quick on your feet theyll cry on your shoulder come along and well round them up now he struggled into his coat and gave his hair an impatient brush with a notebook theres just one other thing said roland i have been a regular reader of squibs for some time and i particularly admire the way in which the womans page you mean you want to reengage the editress rather you couldnt do better i was going to suggest it myself now come along quick before you change your mind or wake up within a very few days of becoming sole proprietor of squibs roland began to feel much as a man might who a novice at the art of steering cars should find himself at the wheel of a runaway motor young mr petheram had spoken nothing less than the truth when he had said that he was full of ideas for booming the paper the infusion of capital into the business acted on him like a powerful stimulant he exuded ideas at every pore rolands first notion had been to engage a staff of contributors he was under the impression that contributors were the lifeblood of a weekly journal mr petheram corrected this view he consented to the purchase of a lurid serial story but that was the last concession he made nobody could accuse mr petheram of lack of energy he was willing even anxious to write the whole paper himself with the exception of the womans page now brightly conducted once more by miss march what he wanted roland to concentrate himself upon was the supplying of capital for ingenious advertising schemes how would it be he asked one morning he always began his remarks with how would it be if we paid a man to walk down piccadilly in white skintights with the word squibs painted in red letters across his chest roland thought it would certainly not be good sound advertising stunt urged mr petheram you dont like it all right youre the boss well how would it be to have a squad of men dressed as zulus with white shields bearing the legend squibs see what i mean have them sprinting along the strand shouting wah wah wah buy it buy it it would make people talk roland emerged from these interviews with his skin crawling with modest apprehension his was a retiring nature and the thought of zulus sprinting down the strand shouting wah wah wah buy it buy it with reference to his personal property appalled him he was beginning now heartily to regret having bought the paper as he generally regretted every definite step which he took the glow of romance which had sustained him during the preliminary negotiations had faded entirely a girl has to be possessed of unusual charm to continue to captivate b when she makes it plain daily that her heart is the exclusive property of a and roland had long since ceased to cherish any delusion that bessie march was ever likely to feel anything but a mild liking for him young mr petheram had obviously staked out an indisputable claim her attitude toward him was that of an affectionate devotee toward a high priest one morning entering the office unexpectedly roland found her kissing the top of mr petherams head and from that moment his interest in the fortunes of squibs sank to zero it amazed him that he could ever have been idiot enough to have allowed himself to be entangled in this insane venture for the sake of an insignificantlooking bit of a girl with a snubnose and a poor complexion what particularly galled him was the fact that he was throwing away good cash for nothing it was true that his capital was more than equal to the on the whole modest demands of the paper but that did not alter the fact that he was wasting money mr petheram always talked buoyantly about turning the corner but the corner always seemed just as far off the old idea of flight to which he invariably had recourse in any crisis came upon roland with irresistible force he packed a bag and went to paris there in the discomforts of life in a foreign country he contrived for a month to forget his white elephant he returned by the evening train which deposits the traveler in london in time for dinner strangely enough nothing was farther from rolands mind than his bright weekly paper as he sat down to dine in a crowded grillroom near piccadilly circus four weeks of acute torment in a city where nobody seemed to understand the simplest english sentence had driven squibs completely from his mind for the time being the fact that such a paper existed was brought home to him with the coffee a note was placed upon his table by the attentive waiter whats this he asked the lady sare said the waiter vaguely roland looked round the room excitedly the spirit of romance gripped him there were many ladies present for this particular restaurant was a favorite with artistes who were permitted to look in at their theaters as late as eightthirty none of them looked particularly selfconscious yet one of them had sent him this quite unsolicited tribute he tore open the envelope the message written in a flowing feminine hand was brief and mrs grundy herself could have taken no exception to it squibs one penny weekly buy it it ran all the mellowing effects of a good dinner passed away from roland he was feverishly irritated he paid his bill and left the place a visit to a neighboring musichall occurred to him as a suitable sedative hardly had his nerves ceased to quiver sufficiently to allow him to begin to enjoy the performance when in the interval between two of the turns a man rose in one of the side boxes is there a doctor in the house there was a hush in the audience all eyes were directed toward the box a man in the stalls rose blushing and cleared his throat my wife has fainted continued the speaker she has just discovered that she has lost her copy of squibs the audience received the statement with the bovine stolidity of an english audience in the presence of the unusual not so roland even as the purposefullooking chuckersout wended their leopardlike steps toward the box he was rushing out into the street as he stood cooling his indignation in the pleasant breeze which had sprung up he was aware of a dense crowd proceeding toward him it was headed by an individual who shone out against the drab background like a good deed in a naughty world nature hath framed strange fellows in her time and this was one of the strangest that rolands bulging eyes had ever rested upon he was a large stout man comfortably clad in a suit of white linen relieved by a scarlet squibs across the bosom his tophat at least four sizes larger than any tophat worn out of a pantomime flaunted the same word in letters of flame his umbrella which tho the weather was fine he carried open above his head bore the device one penny weekly the arrest of this person by a vigilant policeman and rolands dive into a taxicab occurred simultaneously roland was blushing all over his head was in a whirl he took the evening paper handed in through the window of the cab quite mechanically and it was only the strong exhortations of the vendor which eventually induced him to pay for it this he did with a sovereign and the cab drove off he was just thinking of going to bed several hours later when it occurred to him that he had not read his paper he glanced at the first page the middle column was devoted to a really capitally written account of the proceedings at bow street consequent upon the arrest of six men who it was alleged had caused a crowd to collect to the disturbance of the peace by parading the strand in the undress of zulu warriors shouting in unison the words wah wah wah buy squibs young mr petheram greeted roland with a joyous enthusiasm which the hound argus on the return of ulysses might have equalled but could scarcely have surpassed it seemed to be mr petherams considered opinion that god was in his heaven and all was right with the world rolands attempts to correct this belief fell on deaf ears have i seen the advertisements he cried echoing his editors first question ive seen nothing else there said mr petheram proudly it cant go on yes it can dont you worry i know theyre arrested as fast as we send them out but bless you the supplys endless ever since the revue boom started and actors were expected to do six different parts in seven minutes there are platoons of musichall pros hanging about the strand ready to take on any sort of job you offer them i have a special staff flushing the bodegas these fellows love it its meat and drink to them to be right in the public eye like that makes them feel ten years younger its wonderful the talent knocking about those zulus used to have a steady job as the six brothers biff society contortionists the revue craze killed them professionally they cried like children when we took them on by the way could you put through an expenses cheque before you go the fines mount up a bit but dont you worry about that either were coining money ill show you the returns in a minute i told you we should turn the corner turned it blame me weve whizzed round it on two wheels have you had time to see the paper since you got back no then you havent seen our new scandal page we just want to know you know its a corker and its sent the circulation up like a rocket everybody reads squibs now i was hoping you would come back soon i wanted to ask you about taking new offices were a bit above this sort of thing now roland meanwhile was reading with horrified eyes the alleged corking scandal page it seemed to him without exception the most frightful production he had ever seen it appalled him this is awful he moaned we shall have a hundred libel actions oh no thats all right its all fake stuff tho the public doesnt know it if you stuck to real scandals you wouldnt get a par a week a more moral set of blameless wasters than the blighters who constitute modern society you never struck but it reads all right doesnt it of course every now and then one does hear something genuine and then it goes in for instance have you ever heard of percy pook the bookie i have got a real ripe thing in about percy this week the absolute limpid truth it will make him sit up a bit there just under your thumb roland removed his thumb and having read the paragraph in question started as if he had removed it from a snake but this is bound to mean a libel action he cried not a bit of it said mr petheram comfortably you dont know percy i wont bore you with his lifehistory but take it from me he doesnt rush into a court of law from sheer love of it youre safe enough but it appeared that mr pook tho coy in the matter of cleansing his scutcheon before a judge and jury was not wholly without weapons of defense and offense arriving at the office next day roland found a scene of desolation in the middle of which like marius among the ruins of carthage sat jimmy the vacantfaced office boy jimmy was reading an illustrated comic paper and appeared undisturbed by his surroundings hes gorn he observed looking up as roland entered what do you mean roland snapped at him whos gone and where did he go and besides that when you speak to your superiors you will rise and stop chewing that infernal gum it gets on my nerves jimmy neither rose nor relinquished his gum he took his time and answered mr petheram a couple of fellers come in and went through and there was a uproar inside there and presently out they come running and i went in and there was mr petheram on the floor knocked silly and the furniture all broke and now es gorn to orspital those fellers ad been putting im froo it proper concluded jimmy with moody relish roland sat down weakly jimmy his tale told resumed the study of his illustrated paper silence reigned in the offices of squibs it was broken by the arrival of miss march her exclamation of astonishment at the sight of the wrecked room led to a repetition of jimmys story she vanished on hearing the name of the hospital to which the stricken editor had been removed and returned an hour later with flashing eyes and a set jaw aubrey she said it was news to roland that mr petherams name was aubrey is very much knocked about but he is conscious and sitting up and taking nourishment thats good in a spoon only ah said roland the doctor says he will not be out for a week aubrey is certain it was that horrible bookmakers men who did it but of course he can prove nothing but his last words to me were slip it into percy again this week he has given me one or two things to mention i dont understand them but aubrey says they will make him wild rolands flesh crept the idea of making mr pook any wilder than he appeared to be at present horrified him panic gave him strength and he addressed miss march who was looking more like a modern joan of arc than anything else on earth firmly miss march he said i realize that this is a crisis and that we must all do all that we can for the paper and i am ready to do anything in reason but i will not slip it into percy you have seen the effects of slipping it into percy what he or his minions will do if we repeat the process i do not care to think you are afraid yes said roland simply miss march turned on her heel it was plain that she regarded him as a worm roland did not like being thought a worm but it was infinitely better than being regarded as an interesting case by the housesurgeon of a hospital he belonged to the school of thought which holds that it is better that people should say of you there he goes than that they should say how peaceful he looks stress of work prevented further conversation it was a revelation to roland the vigor and energy with which miss march threw herself into the breach as a matter of fact so tremendous had been the labors of the departed mr petheram that her work was more apparent than real thanks to mr petheram there was a sufficient supply of material in hand to enable squibs to run a fortnight on its own momentum roland however did not know this and with a view to doing what little he could to help he informed miss march that he would write the scandal page it must be added that the offer was due quite as much to prudence as to chivalry roland simply did not dare to trust her with the scandal page in her present mood it was not safe to slip it into percy would he felt be with her the work of a moment literary composition had never been rolands forte he sat and stared at the white paper and chewed the pencil which should have been marring its whiteness with stinging paragraphs no sort of idea came to him his brow grew damp what sort of people except bookmakers did things you could write scandal about as far as he could ascertain nobody he picked up the morning paper the name windlebird caught his eye a kind of pleasant melancholy came over him as he read the paragraph how long ago it seemed since he had met that genial financier the paragraph was not particularly interesting it gave a brief account of some large deal which mr windlebird was negotiating roland did not understand a word of it but it gave him an idea he is a character in the second episode a fraudulent financier mr windlebirds financial standing he knew was above suspicion mr windlebird had made that clear to him during his visit there could be no possibility of offending mr windlebird by a paragraph or two about the manners and customs of financiers phrases which his kindly host had used during his visit came back to him and with them inspiration within five minutes he had compiled the following we just want to know you know who is the eminent financier at present engaged upon one of his biggest deals whether the public would not be welladvised to look a little closer into it before investing their money if it is not a fact that this gentleman has bought a firstclass ticket to the argentine in case of accidents whether he may not have to use it at any moment after that it was easy ideas came with a rush by the end of an hour he had completed a scandal page of which mr petheram himself might have been proud without a suggestion of slipping it into percy he felt that he could go to mr pook and say percy on your honor as a british bookmaker have i slipped it into you in any way whatsoever and mr pook would be compelled to reply you have not miss march read the proofs of the page and sniffed but miss marchs blood was up and she would have sniffed at anything not directly hostile to mr pook a week later roland sat in the office of squibs reading a letter it had been sent from no a breams buildings ec but from rolands point of view it might have come direct from heaven for its contents signed by harrison harrison harrison harrison solicitors were to the effect that a client of theirs had instructed them to approach him with a view to purchasing the paper he would not find their client disposed to haggle over terms so hoped messrs harrison harrison harrison harrison in the event of roland being willing to sell they could speedily bring matters to a satisfactory conclusion any conclusion which had left him free of squibs without actual pecuniary loss would have been satisfactory to roland he had conceived a loathing for his property which not even its steadily increasing sales could mitigate he was around at messrs harrisons office as soon as a swift taxi could take him there the lawyers were for spinning the thing out with guarded remarks and cautious preambles but rolands methods of doing business were always rapid this chap he said this fellow who wants to buy squibs whatll he give that began one of the harrisons ponderously would of course largely depend ill take five thousand lock stock and barrel including the present staff an even five thousand hows that five thousand is a large take it or leave it my dear sir you hold a pistol to our heads however i think that our client might consent to the sum you mention good well directly i get his check the things his by the way who is your client mr harrison coughed his name he said will be familiar to you he is the eminent financier mr geoffrey windlebird the diverting episode of the exiled monarch fifth of a series of six stories first published in pictorial review september the caoutchouc was drawing all london slightly more indecent than the salome dance a shade less reticent than ragtime it had driven the tango out of existence nor indeed did anybody actually caoutchouc for the national dance of paranoya contained three hundred and fifteen recognized steps but everybody tried to a new revue hullo caoutchouc had been produced with success and the pioneer of the dance the peerless maraquita a native paranoyan still performed it nightly at the musichall where she had first broken loose the caoutchouc fascinated roland bleke maraquita fascinated him more of all the women to whom he had lost his heart at first sight maraquita had made the firmest impression upon him she was what is sometimes called a fine woman she had large flashing eyes the physique of a rugby international forward and the agility of a cat on hot bricks there is a period of about fifty steps somewhere in the middle of the three hundred and fifteen where the patient abandoning the comparative decorum of the earlier movements whizzes about till she looks like a salmoncolored whirlwind that was the bit that hit roland night after night he sat in his stagebox goggling at maraquita and applauding wildly one night an attendant came to his box excuse me sir but are you mr roland bleke the senorita maraquita wishes to speak to you he held open the door of the box the possibility of refusal did not appear to occur to him behind the scenes at that theater it was generally recognized that when the peerless one wanted a thing she got it quick they were alone with no protective footlights between himself and her roland came to the conclusion that he had made a mistake it was not that she was any less beautiful at the very close quarters imposed by the limits of the dressingroom but he felt that in falling in love with her he had undertaken a contract a little too large for one of his quiet diffident nature it crossed his mind that the sort of woman he really liked was the rather small drooping type dynamite would not have made maraquita droop for perhaps a minute and a half maraquita fixed her compelling eyes on his without uttering a word then she broke a painful silence with this leading question you love me hein roland nodded feebly when men make love to me i send them away so she waved her hand toward the door and roland began to feel almost cheerful again he was to be dismissed with a caution after all the woman had a fine forgiving nature but not you not me no not you you are the man i have been waiting for i read about you in the paper senor bleke i see your picture in the daily mirror i say to myself what a man those picturepaper photographs always make one look rather weird mumbled roland i see you night after night in your box poof i love you thanks awfully bleated roland you would do anything for my sake hein i knew you were that kind of man directly i see you no she added as roland writhed uneasily in his chair do not embrace me later yes but now no not till the great day what the great day might be roland could not even faintly conjecture he could only hope that it would also be a remote one and now said the senorita throwing a cloak about her shoulders you come away with me to my house my friends are there awaiting us they will be glad and proud to meet you after his first inspection of the house and the friends roland came to the conclusion that he preferred maraquitas room to her company the former was large and airy the latter with one exception small and hairy the exception maraquita addressed as bombito he was a conspicuous figure he was one of those outsize hastylooking men one suspected him of carrying lethal weapons maraquita presented roland to the company the native speech of paranoya sounded like shorthand with a blend of spanish an expert could evidently squeeze a good deal of it into a minute its effect on the company was good they were manifestly soothed even bombito introductions in detail then took place this time for rolands benefit maraquita spoke in english and he learned that most of those present were marquises before him so he gathered from maraquita stood the very flower of paranoyas aristocracy driven from their native land by the infamy of roland was too polite to inquire what on earth the infamy of might be but its mention had a marked effect on the company some scowled others uttered deepthroated oaths bombito did both before supper to which they presently sat down was over however roland knew a good deal about paranoya and its history the conversation conducted by maraquita to a ceaseless bouche pleine accompaniment from her friends bore exclusively upon the subject paranoya had it appeared existed fairly peacefully for centuries under the rule of the alejandro dynasty then in the reign of alejandro the thirteenth disaffection had begun to spread culminating in the infamy of which roland had at last discovered was nothing less than the abolition of the monarchy and the installation of a republic since the one thing for which they had lived besides the caoutchouc was to see the monarchy restored and their beloved alejandro the thirteenth back on his throne their efforts toward this end had been untiring and were at last showing signs of bearing fruit paranoya maraquita assured roland was honeycombed with intrigue the army was disaffected the people anxious for a return to the old order of things a more propitious moment for striking the decisive blow was never likely to arrive the question was purely one of funds at the mention of the word funds roland who had become thoroughly bored with the lecture on paranoyan history sat up and took notice he had an instinctive feeling that he was about to be called upon for a subscription to the cause of the distressful countrys freedom especially by bombito he was right a moment later maraquita began to make a speech she spoke in paranoyan and roland could not follow her but he gathered that it somehow had reference to himself as at the end of it the entire company rose to their feet and extended their glasses toward him with a mighty shout he assumed that maraquita had been proposing his health they say to the liberator of paranoya kindly translated the peerless one you must excuse said maraquita tolerantly as a bevy of patriots surrounded roland and kissed him on the cheek they are so grateful to the savior of our country i myself would kiss you were it not that i have sworn that no mans lips shall touch mine till the royal standard floats once more above the palace of paranoya but that will be soon very soon she went on with you on our side we can not fail what did the woman mean roland asked himself wildly did she labor under the distressing delusion that he proposed to shed his blood on behalf of a deposed monarch to whom he had never been introduced maraquitas next remarks made the matter clear i have told them she said that you love me that you are willing to risk everything for my sake i have promised them that you the rich senor bleke will supply the funds for the revolution once more comrades to the savior of paranoya roland tried his hardest to catch the infection of this patriotic enthusiasm but somehow he could not do it base sordid mercenary speculations would intrude themselves about how much was a good wellfurnished revolution likely to cost as delicately as he could he put the question to maraquita she said poof the cost la la which was all very well but hardly satisfactory as a business chat however that was all roland could get out of her the next few days passed for roland in a sort of dream it was the kind of dream which it is not easy to distinguish from a nightmare maraquitas reticence at the supperparty on the subject of details connected with the financial side of revolutions entirely disappeared she now talked nothing but figures and from the confused mass which she presented to him roland was able to gather that in financing the restoration of royalty in paranoya he would indeed be risking everything for her sake in the matter of revolutions maraquita was no niggard she knew how the thing should be done well or not at all there would be so much for rifles machineguns and what not and there would be so much for the expense of smuggling them into the country then there would be so much to be laid out in corrupting the republican army roland brightened a little when they came to this item as the standing army of paranoya amounted to twenty thousand men and as it seemed possible to corrupt it thoroughly at a cost of about thirty shillings a head the obvious course to rolands way of thinking was to concentrate on this side of the question and avoid unnecessary bloodshed it appeared however that maraquita did not want to avoid bloodshed that she rather liked bloodshed that the leaders of the revolution would be disappointed if there were no bloodshed especially bombito unless she pointed out there was a certain amount of carnage looting and so on the revolution would not achieve a popular success true the beloved alejandro might be restored but he would sit upon a throne that was insecure unless the coronation festivities took a bloodthirsty turn by all means said maraquita corrupt the army but not at the risk of making the affair tame and unpopular paranoya was an emotional country and liked its revolutions with a bit of zip to them it was about ten days after he had definitely cast in his lot with the revolutionary party that roland was made aware that these things were a little more complex than he had imagined he had reconciled himself to the financial outlay it had been difficult but he had done it that his person as well as his purse would be placed in peril he had not foreseen the fact was borne in upon him at the end of the second week by the arrival of the deputation it blew in from the street just as he was enjoying his afterdinner cigar it consisted of three men one long and suave the other two short stout and silent they all had the sallow complexion and undue hairiness which he had come by this time to associate with the native of paranoya for a moment he mistook them for a drove of exiled noblemen whom he had not had the pleasure of meeting at the supperparty and he waited resignedly for them to make night hideous with the royal anthem he poised himself on his toes the more readily to spring aside if they should try to kiss him on the cheek mr bleke said the long man his companions drifted toward the cigarbox which stood open on the table and looked at it wistfully long live the monarchy said roland wearily he had gathered in the course of his dealings with the exiled ones that this remark generally went well on the present occasion it elicited no outburst of cheering on the contrary the long man frowned and his two companions helped themselves to a handful of cigars apiece with a marked moodiness death to the monarchy corrected the long man coldly and he added with a wealth of meaning in his voice to all who meddle in the affairs of our beloved country and seek to do it harm i dont know what you mean said roland yes senor bleke you do know what i mean i mean that you will be well advised to abandon the schemes which you are hatching with the malcontents who would do my beloved land an injury the conversation was growing awkward roland had got so into the habit of taking it for granted that every paranoyan he met must of necessity be a devotee of the beloved alejandro that it came as a shock to him to realize that there were those who objected to his restoration to the throne till now he had looked on the enemy as something in the abstract it had not struck him that the people for whose correction he was buying all these rifles and machineguns were individuals with a lively distaste for having their blood shed senor bleke resumed the speaker frowning at one of his companions whose hand was hovering above the bottle of liqueur brandy you are a man of sense you know what is safe and what is not safe believe me this scheme of yours is not safe you have been led away but there is still time to withdraw do so and all is well do not so and your blood be upon your own head my blood gasped roland the speaker bowed that is all he said we merely came to give the warning ah senor bleke do not be rash you think that here in this great london of yours you are safe you look at the policeman upon the corner of the road and you say to yourself i am safe believe me not at all so is it but much the opposite we have ways by which it is of no account the policeman on the corner of the road that is all senor bleke we wish you a good night the deputation withdrew maraquita informed of the incident snapped her fingers and said poof it sometimes struck roland that she would be more real help in a difficult situation if she could get out of the habit of saying poof it is nothing she said no said roland we easily outtrick them isnt it you make a will leaving your money to the cause and then where are they hein it was one way of looking at it but it brought little balm to roland he said so maraquita scanned his face keenly you are not weakening rolan she said you would not betray us now well of course i dont know about betraying you know but still what i mean is maraquitas eyes seemed to shoot forth two flames take care she cried with me it is nothing for i know that your heart is with paranoya but if the others once had cause to suspect that your resolve was failing ah if bombito roland took her point he had forgotten bombito for the moment for goodness sake he said hastily dont go saying anything to bombito to give him the idea that im trying to back out of course you can rely on me and all that thats all right maraquitas gaze softened she raised her glass they were lunching at the time and put it to her lips to the savior of paranoya she said beware whispered a voice in rolands ear he turned with a start a waiter was standing behind him a small dark hairy man he was looking into the middle distance with the abstracted air which waiters cultivate roland stared at him but he did not move that evening returning to his flat roland was paralyzed by the sight of the word beware scrawled across the mirror in his bedroom it had apparently been done with a diamond he rang the bell sir said the competent valet competent valets are in attendance at each of these flats advt has any one been here since i left yes sir a foreignlooking gentleman called he said he knew you sir i showed him into your room the same night well on in the small hours the telephone rang roland dragged himself out of bed hullo is that senor bleke yes what is it beware things were becoming intolerable roland had a certain amount of nerve but not enough to enable him to bear up against this sinister persecution yet what could he do suppose he did beware to the extent of withdrawing his support from the royalist movement what then bombito if ever there was a toad under the harrow he was that toad and all because a perfectly respectful admiration for the caoutchouc had led him to occupy a stagebox several nights in succession at the theater where the peerless maraquita tied herself into knots there was an air of unusual excitement in maraquitas manner at their next meeting we have been in communication with him she whispered he will receive you he will give an audience to the savior of paranoya eh who will our beloved alejandro he wishes to see his faithful servant we are to go to him at once where at his own house he will receive you in person such was the quality of the emotions through which he had been passing of late that roland felt but a faint interest at the prospect of meeting face to face a genuine if exiled monarch the thought did flit through his mind that they would sit up a bit in old finebergs office if they could hear of it but it brought him little consolation the cab drew up at a gloomylooking house in a fashionable square roland rang the doorbell there seemed a certain element of the prosaic in the action he wondered what he should say to the butler there was however no need for words the door opened and they were ushered in without parley a butler and two footmen showed them into a luxuriously furnished anteroom roland entered with two thoughts running in his mind the first was that the beloved alejandro had got an uncommonly snug crib the second that this was exactly like going to see the dentist presently the squad of retainers returned the butler leading his majesty will receive mr bleke roland followed him with tottering knees his majesty king alejandro the thirteenth on the retired list was a geniallooking man of middle age comfortably stout about the middle and a little bald as to the forehead he might have been a prosperous stockbroker roland felt more at his ease at the very sight of him sit down mr bleke said his majesty as the door closed i have been wanting to see you for some time roland had nothing to say he was regaining his composure but he had a long way to go yet before he could feel thoroughly at home king alejandro produced a cigaretcase and offered it to roland who shook his head speechlessly the king lit a cigaret and smoked thoughtfully for a while you know mr bleke he said at last this must stop it really must i mean your devoted efforts on my behalf roland gaped at him you are a very young man i had expected to see some one much older your youth gives me the impression that you have gone into this affair from a spirit of adventure i can assure you that you have nothing to gain commercially by interfering with my late kingdom i hope before we part that i can persuade you to abandon your idea of financing this movement to restore me to the throne i dont understand er your majesty i will explain please treat what i shall say as strictly confidential you must know mr bleke that these attempts to reestablish me as a reigning monarch in paranoya are frankly the curse of an otherwise very pleasant existence you look surprized my dear sir do you know paranoya have you ever been there have you the remotest idea what sort of life a king of paranoya leads i have tried it and i can assure you that a coalheaver is happy by comparison in the first place the climate of the country is abominable i always had a cold in the head secondly there is a small but energetic section of the populace whose sole recreation it seems to be to use their monarch as a target for bombs they are not very good bombs it is true but one in say ten explodes and even an occasional bomb is unpleasant if you are the target finally i am much too fond of your delightful country to wish to leave it i was educated in england i am a magdalene college man and i have the greatest horror of ever being compelled to leave it my present life suits me exactly that is all i wished to say mr bleke for both our sakes for the sake of my comfort and your purse abandon this scheme of yours roland walked home thoughtfully maraquita had left the royal residence long before he had finished the whiskyandsoda which the genial monarch had pressed upon him as he walked the futility of his situation came home to him more and more whatever he did he was bound to displease somebody and these paranoyans were so confoundedly impulsive when they were vexed for two days he avoided maraquita on the third with something of the instinct which draws the murderer to the spot where he has buried the body he called at her house she was not present but otherwise there was a full gathering there were the marquises there were the counts there was bombito he looked unhappily round the crowd somebody gave him a glass of champagne he raised it to the revolution he said mechanically there was a silence it seemed to roland an awkward silence as if he had said something improper the marquises and counts began to drift from the room till only bombito was left roland regarded him with some apprehension he was looking larger and more unusual than ever but tonight apparently bombito was in genial mood he came forward and slapped roland on the shoulder and then the remarkable fact came to light that bombito spoke english or a sort of english my old chap he said i would have a speech with you he slapped roland again on the shoulder the others they say break it with senor bleke gently maraquita say break it with senor bleke gently so i break it with you gently he dealt roland a third stupendous punch whatever was to be broken gently it was plain to roland that it was not himself and suddenly there came to him a sort of intuition that told him that bombito was nervous after all you have done for us senor bleke we shall seem to you ungrateful bounders but what is it yes no i shouldnt wonder perhaps the whole fact is that there has been political crisis in paranoya upset applecart yes you follow no the ministry have been what do you say put through it expelled broken up no more ministry new ministry wanted to conciliate royalist party that is the cry so deputation of leading persons mighty good chaps prominent merchants and that sort of bounder call upon us they offer me to be president see no yes thats right i am ambitious blighter senor bleke what about it no i accept i am new president of paranoya so no need for your kind assistance royalist revolution up the spout no more royalist revolution the wave of relief which swept over roland ebbed sufficiently after an interval to enable him to think of some one but himself he was not fond of maraquita but he had a tender heart and this he felt would kill the poor girl but maraquita thats all right splendid old chap no need to worry about maraquita stout old boy where the husband goes so does the wife go as you say whither thou goes will i follow no but i dont understand maraquita is not your wife why certainly good old heart what else have you been married to her all the time why certainly good dear boy the room swam before rolands eyes there was no room in his mind for meditations on the perfidy of woman he groped forward and found bombitos hand by jove he said thickly as he wrung it again and again i knew you were a good sort the first time i saw you have a drink or something have a cigar or something have something anyway and sit down and tell me all about it the episode of the hired past final story of the series first published in pictorial review october what do you mean you cant marry him after all after all what why cant you marry him you are perfectly childish lord evenwoods gentle voice which had in its time lulled the house of peers to slumber more often than any voice ever heard in the gilded chamber had in it a note of unwonted but quite justifiable irritation if there was one thing more than another that lord evenwood disliked it was any interference with arrangements already made the man he continued is not unsightly the man is not conspicuously vulgar the man does not eat peas with his knife the man pronounces his aitches with meticulous care and accuracy the man moreover is worth rather more than a quarter of a million pounds i repeat you are childish yes i know hes a very decent little chap father said lady eva its not that at all i should be gratified then to hear what in your opinion it is well do you think i could be happy with him lady kimbuck gave tongue she was lord evenwoods sister she spent a very happy widowhood interfering in the affairs of the various branches of her family were not asking you to be happy you have such odd ideas of happiness your idea of happiness is to be married to your cousin gerry whose only visible means of support so far as i can gather is the four hundred a year which he draws as a member for a constituency which has every intention of throwing him out at the next election lady eva blushed lady kimbucks faculty for nosing out the secrets of her family had made her justly disliked from the hebrides to southern cornwall young orion is not to be thought of said lord evenwood firmly not for an instant apart from anything else his politics are all wrong moreover you are engaged to this mr bleke it is a sacred responsibility not lightly to be evaded you can not pledge your word one day to enter upon the most solemn contract known to ah the civilized world and break it the next it is not fair to the man it is not fair to me you know that all i live for is to see you comfortably settled if i could myself do anything for you the matter would be different but these abominable landtaxes and blowick especially blowick no no its out of the question you will be very sorry if you do anything foolish i can assure you that roland blekes are not to be found ah on every bush men are extremely shy of marrying nowadays especially said lady kimbuck into a family like ours what with blowicks scandal and that shocking business of your grandfather and the circuswoman to say nothing of your poor fathers trouble in thank you sophia interrupted lord evenwood hurriedly it is unnecessary to go into all that now suffice it that there are adequate reasons apart from all moral obligations why eva should not break her word to mr bleke lady kimbucks encyclopedic grip of the family annals was a source of the utmost discomfort to her relatives it was known that more than one firm of publishers had made her tempting offers for her reminiscences and the family looked on like nervous spectators at a battle while cupidity fought its ceaseless fight with laziness for the evenwood family had at various times and in various ways stimulated the circulation of the evening papers most of them were living down something and it was lady kimbucks habit when thwarted in her lightest whim to retire to her boudoir and announce that she was not to be disturbed as she was at last making a start on her book abject surrender followed on the instant at this point in the discussion she folded up her crochetwork and rose it is absolutely necessary for you my dear to make a good match or you will all be ruined i of course can always support my declining years with literary work but lady eva groaned against this last argument there was no appeal lady kimbuck patted her affectionately on the shoulder there run along now she said i daresay youve got a headache or something that made you say a lot of foolish things you didnt mean go down to the drawingroom i expect mr bleke is waiting there to say goodnight to you i am sure he must be getting quite impatient down in the drawingroom roland bleke was hoping against hope that lady evas prolonged absence might be due to the fact that she had gone to bed with a headache and that he might escape the nightly interview which he so dreaded reviewing his career as he sat there roland came to the conclusion that women had the knack of affecting him with a form of temporary insanity they temporarily changed his whole nature they made him feel for a brief while that he was a dashing young man capable of the highest flights of love it was only later that the reaction came and he realized that he was nothing of the sort at heart he was afraid of women and in the entire list of the women of whom he had been afraid he could not find one who had terrified him so much as lady eva blyton other women notably maraquita now happily helping to direct the destinies of paranoya had frightened him by their individuality lady eva frightened him both by her individuality and the atmosphere of aristocratic exclusiveness which she conveyed he had no idea whatever of what was the proper procedure for a man engaged to the daughter of an earl daughters of earls had been to him till now mere names in the society columns of the morning paper the very rules of the game were beyond him he felt like a confirmed association footballer suddenly called upon to play in an international rugby match all along from the very moment when to his unbounded astonishment she had accepted him he had known that he was making a mistake but he never realized it with such painful clearness as he did this evening he was filled with a sort of blind terror he cursed the fate which had taken him to the charitybazaar at which he had first come under the notice of lady kimbuck the fatuous snobbishness which had made him leap at her invitation to spend a few days at evenwood towers he regretted but for that he blamed himself less further acquaintance with lady kimbuck had convinced him that if she had wanted him she would have got him somehow whether he had accepted or refused what he really blamed himself for was his mad proposal there had been no need for it true lady eva had created a riot of burning emotions in his breast from the moment they met but he should have had the sense to realize that she was not the right mate for him even tho he might have a quarter of a million tucked away in giltedged securities their lives could not possibly mix he was a commonplace young man with a fondness for the pleasures of the people he liked cheap papers picturepalaces and association football merely to think of association football in connection with her was enough to make the folly of his conduct clear he ought to have been content to worship her from afar as some inaccessible goddess a light step outside the door made his heart stop beating ive just looked in to say good night mr er roland she said holding out her hand do excuse me ive got such a headache oh yes rather im awfully sorry if there was one person in the world roland despised and hated at that moment it was himself are you going out with the guns tomorrow asked lady eva languidly oh yes rather i mean no im afraid i dont shoot the back of his neck began to glow he had no illusions about himself he was the biggest ass in christendom perhaps youd like to play a round of golf then oh yes rather i mean no there it was again that awful phrase he was certain he had not intended to utter it she must be thinking him a perfect lunatic i dont play golf they stood looking at each other for a moment it seemed to roland that her gaze was partly contemptuous partly pitying he longed to tell her that tho she had happened to pick on his weak points in the realm of sport there were things he could do an insane desire came upon him to babble about his school football team should he ask her to feel his quite respectable biceps no never mind she said kindly i daresay we shall think of something to amuse you she held out her hand again he took it in his for the briefest possible instant painfully conscious the while that his own hand was clammy from the emotion through which he had been passing good night good night thank heaven she was gone that let him out for another twelve hours at least a quarter of an hour later found roland still sitting where she had left him his head in his hands the groan of an overwrought soul escaped him i cant do it he sprang to his feet i wont do it a smooth voice from behind him spoke i think you are quite right sir if i may make the remark roland had hardly ever been so startled in his life in the first place he was not aware of having uttered his thoughts aloud in the second he had imagined that he was alone in the room and so a moment before he had been but the owner of the voice possessed among other qualities the catlike faculty of entering a room perfectly noiselessly a fact which had won for him in the course of a long career in the service of the best families the flattering position of star witness in a number of englands raciest divorcecases mr teal the butler for it was no less a celebrity who had broken in on rolands reverie was a long thin man of a somewhat priestly cast of countenance he lacked that air of reproving hauteur which many butlers possess and it was for this reason that roland had felt drawn to him during the black days of his stay at evenwood towers teal had been uncommonly nice to him on the whole he had seemed to roland stricken by interviews with his host and lady kimbuck the only human thing in the place he liked teal on the other hand teal was certainly taking a liberty he could if he so pleased tell teal to go to the deuce technically he had the right to freeze teal with a look he did neither of these things he was feeling very lonely and very forlorn in a strange and depressing world and teals voice and manner were soothing hearing you speak and seeing nobody else in the room went on the butler i thought for a moment that you were addressing me this was not true and roland knew it was not true instinct told him that teal knew that he knew it was not true but he did not press the point what do you mean you think i am quite right he said you dont know what i was thinking about teal smiled indulgently on the contrary sir a child could have guessed it you have just come to the decision in my opinion a thoroughly sensible one that your engagement to her ladyship can not be allowed to go on you are quite right sir it wont do personal magnetism covers a multitude of sins roland was perfectly well aware that he ought not to be standing here chatting over his and lady evas intimate affairs with a butler but such was teals magnetism that he was quite unable to do the right thing and tell him to mind his own business teal you forget yourself would have covered the situation roland however was physically incapable of saying teal you forget yourself the bird knows all the time that he ought not to stand talking to the snake but he is incapable of ending the conversation roland was conscious of a momentary wish that he was the sort of man who could tell butlers that they forgot themselves but then that sort of man would never be in this sort of trouble the teal you forget yourself type of man would be a firstclass shot a plus golfer and would certainly consider himself extremely lucky to be engaged to lady eva the question is went on mr teal how are we to break it off roland felt that as he had sinned against all the decencies in allowing the butler to discuss his affairs with him he might just as well go the whole hog and allow the discussion to run its course and it was an undeniable relief to talk about the infernal thing to some one he nodded gloomily and committed himself teal resumed his remarks with the gusto of a fellowconspirator its not an easy thing to do gracefully sir believe me it isnt and its got to be done gracefully or not at all you cant go to her ladyship and say its all off and so am i and catch the next train for london the rupture must be of her ladyships making if some fact some disgraceful information concerning you were to come to her ladyships ears that would be a simple way out of the difficulty he eyed roland meditatively if for instance you had ever been in jail sir well i havent no offense intended sir im sure i merely remembered that you had made a great deal of money very quickly my experience of gentlemen who have made a great deal of money very quickly is that they have generally done their bit of time but of course if you let me think do you drink sir no mr teal sighed roland could not help feeling that he was disappointing the old man a good deal you do not i suppose chance to have a past asked mr teal not very hopefully i use the word in its technical sense a deserted wife some poor creature you have treated shamefully at the risk of sinking still further in the butlers esteem roland was compelled to answer in the negative i was afraid not said mr teal shaking his head thinking it all over yesterday i said to myself im afraid he wouldnt have one you dont look like the sort of gentleman who had done much with his time thinking it over not on your account sir explained mr teal on the familys i disapproved of this match from the first a man who has served a family as long as i have had the honor of serving his lordships comes to entertain a high regard for the family prestige and with no offense to yourself sir this would not have done well it looks as if it would have to do said roland gloomily i cant see any way out of it i can sir my niece at aldershot mr teal wagged his head at him with a kind of priestly archness you can not have forgotten my niece at aldershot roland stared at him dumbly it was like a line out of a melodrama he feared first for his own then for the butlers sanity the latter was smiling gently as one who sees light in a difficult situation ive never been at aldershot in my life for our purposes you have sir but im afraid i am puzzling you let me explain ive got a niece over at aldershot who isnt much good shes not very particular i am sure she would do it for a consideration do what be your past sir i dont mind telling you that as a past shes had some experience looks the part too shes a barmaid and you would guess it the first time you saw her dyed yellow hair sir he went on with enthusiasm done all frizzy just the sort of young person that a young gentleman like yourself would have had a past with you couldnt find a better if you tried for a twelvemonth but i say i suppose a hundred wouldnt hurt you well no i suppose not but then put the whole thing in my hands sir ill ask leave off tomorrow and pop over and see her ill arrange for her to come here the day after to see you leave it all to me tonight you must write the letters letters naturally there would be letters sir it is an inseparable feature of these cases do you mean that i have got to write to her but i shouldnt know what to say ive never seen her that will be quite all right sir if you place yourself in my hands i will come to your room after everybodys gone to bed and help you write those letters you have some notepaper with your own address on it then it will all be perfectly simple when some hours later he read over the ten or twelve exceedingly passionate epistles which with the butlers assistance he had succeeded in writing to miss maud chilvers roland came to the conclusion that there must have been a time when mr teal was a good deal less respectable than he appeared to be at present byronic was the only adjective applicable to his collaborators style of amatory composition in every letter there were passages against which roland had felt compelled to make a modest protest a thousand kisses on your lovely rosebud of a mouth dont you think that is a little too warmly colored and i am languishing for the pressure of your ivory arms about my neck and the sweep of your silken hair against my cheek what i mean is well what about it you know the phrases said mr teal not without a touch of displeasure to which you take exception are taken bodily from correspondence which i happened to have the advantage of perusing addressed by the late lord evenwood to animalcula queen of the high wire at astleys circus his lordship i may add was considered an authority in these matters roland criticized no more he handed over the letters which at mr teals direction he had headed with various dates covering roughly a period of about two months antecedent to his arrival at the towers that mr teal explained will make your conduct definitely unpardonable with this womans kisses hot upon your lips mr teal was still slightly aglow with the fire of inspiration you have the effrontery to come here and offer yourself to her ladyship with rolands timid suggestion that it was perhaps a mistake to overdo the atmosphere the butler found himself unable to agree you cant make yourself out too bad if you dont pitch it hot and strong her ladyship might quite likely forgive you then where would you be miss maud chilvers of aldershot burst into rolands life like one of the shells of her native heath two days later at about five in the afternoon it was an entrance of which any stagemanager might have been proud of having arranged the lighting the grouping the leadup all were perfect the family had just finished tea in the long drawingroom lady kimbuck was crocheting lord evenwood dozing lady eva reading and roland thinking a peaceful scene a soft rippling murmur scarcely to be reckoned a snore had just proceeded from lord evenwoods parted lips when the door opened and teal announced miss chilvers roland stiffened in his chair now that the ghastly moment had come he felt too petrified with fear even to act the little part in which he had been diligently rehearsed by the obliging mr teal he simply sat and did nothing it was speedily made clear to him that miss chilvers would do all the actual doing that was necessary the butler had drawn no false picture of her personal appearance dyed yellow hair done all frizzy was but one fact of her manysided impossibilities in the serene surroundings of the long drawingroom she looked more unspeakably not much good than roland had ever imagined her with such a leading lady his drama could not fail of success he should have been pleased he was merely appalled the thing might have a happy ending but while it lasted it was going to be terrible she had a flatteringly attentive reception nobody failed to notice her lord evenwood woke with a start and stared at her as if she had been some ghost from his trouble of lady evas face expressed sheer amazement lady kimbuck laying down her crochetwork took one look at the apparition and instantly decided that one of her numerous erring relatives had been at it again of all the persons in the room she was possibly the only one completely cheerful she was used to these situations and enjoyed them her mind roaming into the past recalled the night when her cousin warminster had been pinked by a stiletto in his own drawingroom by a lady from south america happy days happy days lord evenwood had by this time come to the conclusion that the festive blowick must be responsible for this visitation he rose with dignity to what are we he began miss chilvers resolute young woman had no intention of standing there while other people talked she shook her gleaming head and burst into speech oh yes i know ive no right to be coming walking in here among a lot of perfect strangers at their teas but what i say is rights right and wrongs wrong all the world over and i may be poor but i have my feelings no thank you i wont sit down ive not come for the weekend ive come to say a few words and when ive said them ill go and not before a lady friend of mine happened to be reading her daily sketch the other day and she said hullo hullo and passed it on to me with her thumb on a picture which had under it that it was lady eva blyton who was engaged to be married to mr roland bleke and when i read that i said hullo hullo too i give you my word and not being able to travel at once owing to being prostrated with the shock i came along today just to have a look at mr roland blooming bleke and ask him if hes forgotten that he happens to be engaged to me thats all i know its the sort of thing that might slip any gentlemans mind but i thought it might be worth mentioning so now roland perspiring in the shadows at the far end of the room felt that miss chilvers was overdoing it there was no earthly need for all this sort of thing just a simple announcement of the engagement would have been quite sufficient it was too obvious to him that his ally was thoroughly enjoying herself she had the center of the stage and did not intend lightly to relinquish it my good girl said lady kimbuck talk less and prove more when did mr bleke promise to marry you oh its all right im not expecting you to believe my word ive got all the proofs youll want heres his letters lady kimbucks eyes gleamed she took the package eagerly she never lost an opportunity of reading compromising letters she enjoyed them as literature and there was never any knowing when they might come in useful roland said lady eva quietly havent you anything to contribute to this conversation miss chilvers clutched at her bodice cinema palaces were a passion with her and she was up in the correct business is he here in this room roland slunk from the shadows mr bleke said lord evenwood sternly who is this woman roland uttered a kind of strangled cough are these letters in your handwriting asked lady kimbuck almost cordially she had seldom read better compromising letters in her life and she was agreeably surprized that one whom she had always imagined a colorless stick should have been capable of them roland nodded well its lucky youre rich said lady kimbuck philosophically what are you asking for these she enquired of miss chilvers exactly said lord evenwood relieved precisely your sterling common sense is admirable sophia you place the whole matter at once on a businesslike footing do you imagine for a moment began miss chilvers slowly yes said lady kimbuck how much miss chilvers sobbed if i have lost him for ever lady eva rose but you havent she said pleasantly i wouldnt dream of standing in your way she drew a ring from her finger placed it on the table and walked to the door i am not engaged to mr bleke she said as she reached it roland never knew quite how he had got away from the towers he had confused memories in which the principals of the drawingroom scene figured in various ways all unpleasant it was a portion of his life on which he did not care to dwell safely back in his flat however he gradually recovered his normal spirits indeed now that the tumult and the shouting had so to speak died and he was free to take a broad view of his position he felt distinctly happier than usual that lady kimbuck had passed for ever from his life was enough in itself to make for gaiety he was humming blithely one morning as he opened his letters outside the sky was blue and the sun shining it was good to be alive he opened the first letter the sky was still blue the sun still shining dear sir it ran we have been instructed by our client miss maud chilvers of the goat and compasses aldershot to institute proceedings against you
