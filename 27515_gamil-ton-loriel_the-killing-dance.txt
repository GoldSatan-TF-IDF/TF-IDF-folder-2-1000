laurell k hamilton the killing dance book of the anita blake vampire hunter series the most beautiful corpse id ever seen was sitting behind my desk jeanclaudes white shirt gleamed in the light from the desk lamp a froth of lace spilled down the front peeking from inside his black velvet jacket i stood behind him my back to the wall arms crossed over my stomach which put my right hand comfortably close to the browning hipower in its shoulder holster i wasnt about to draw on jeanclaude it was the other vampire i was worried about the desk lamp was the only light in the room the vampire had requested the overheads be turned out his name was sabin and he stood against the far wall huddling in the dark he was covered head to foot in a black hooded cape he looked like something out of an old vincent price movie id never seen a real vampire dress like that the last member of our happy little group was dominic dumare he sat in one of the client chairs he was tall thin but not weak his hands were large and strong big enough to palm my face he was dressed in a threepiece black suit like a chauffeur except for the diamond stickpin in his tie a beard and thin mustache lined the strong bones of his face when hed entered my office id felt him like a psychic wind tripping down my spine id only encountered two other people who had that taste to them one had been the most powerful voodoo priestess id ever met the second had been the second most powerful voodoo priest id ever met the woman was dead the man worked for animators inc just like i did but dominic dumare wasnt here to apply for a job ms blake please be seated dumare said sabin finds it most offensive to sit when a lady is standing i glanced behind him at sabin ill sit down if he sits down i said dumare looked at jeanclaude he gave a gentle condescending smile do you have such poor control over your human servant i didnt have to see jeanclaudes smile to know it was there oh you are on your own with ma petite she is my human servant so declared before the council but she answers to no one you seem proud of that sabin said his voice was british and very upper crust she is the executioner and has more vampire kills than any other human she is a necromancer of such power that you have traveled halfway around the world to consult her she is my human servant without a mark to hold her to me she dates me without the aid of vampire glamor why should i not be pleased listening to him talk youd have thought it was all his own idea fact was hed tried his best to mark me and id managed to escape we were dating because hed blackmailed me date him or hed kill my other boyfriend jeanclaude had managed to make it all work to his advantage why was i not surprised until her death you cannot mark any other human sabin said you have cut yourself off from a great deal of power i am aware of what i have done jeanclaude said sabin laughed and it was chokingly bitter we all do strange things for love i would have given a lot to see jeanclaudes face at that moment all i could see was his long black hair spilling over his jacket black on black his shoulders stiffened hands sliding across the blotter on my desk then he went very still that awful waiting stillness that only the old vampires have as if if they held still long enough they would simply disappear is that what has brought you here sabin love jeanclaudes voice was neutral empty sabins laughter rode the air like broken glass it felt like the very sound of it hurt something deep inside me i didnt like it enough games i said lets get it done is she always this impatient dumare asked yes jeanclaude said dumare smiled bright and empty as a lightbulb did jeanclaude tell you why we wished to see you he said sabin caught some sort of disease from trying to go cold turkey the vampire across the room laughed again flinging it like a weapon across the room cold turkey very good ms blake very good the laughter ate over me like small cutting blades id never experienced anything like that from just a voice in a fight it would have been distracting heck it was distracting now i felt liquid slide down my forehead i raised my left hand to it my fingers came away smeared with blood i drew the browning and stepped away from the wall i aimed it at the black figure across the room he does that again and ill shoot him jeanclaude rose slowly from the chair his power flowed over me like a cool wind raising goose bumps on my arms he raised one pale hand gone nearly translucent with power blood flowed down that gleaming skin dumare stayed in his chair but he too was bleeding from a cut nearly identical to mine dumare wiped the blood away still smiling the gun will not be necessary he said you have abused my hospitality jeanclaude said his voice filled the room with hissing echoes there is nothing i can say to apologize sabin said but i did not mean to do it i am using so much of my power just to maintain myself that i do not have the control i once did i moved slowly away from the wall gun still pointed i wanted to see jeanclaudes face i needed to see how badly he was hurt i eased around the desk until i could see him from the corner of my eye his face was untouched flawless and gleaming like mother of pearl he raised his hand one thin line of blood still trailing down this is no accident come into the light my friend dumare said you must let them see or they will not understand i do not want to be seen you are very close to using up all my good will jeanclaude said mine too i added i was hoping i could either shoot sabin or put the gun down soon even a twohanded shooting stance is not meant to be maintained indefinitely your hands start to waver just a bit sabin glided towards the desk the black cloak spilled around his feet like a pool of darkness all vampires were graceful but this was ridiculous i realized he wasnt walking at all he was levitating inside that dark cloak his power flowed over my skin like icy water my hands were suddenly steady once more nothing like having several hundred years worth of vampire coming at you to sharpen your nerves sabin stopped on the far side of the desk he was expending power just to move just to be here as if like a shark if he stopped moving hed die jeanclaude glided around me his power danced over my body raising the hair at the back of my neck making my skin tight he stopped almost within reach of the other vampire what has happened to you sabin sabin stood on the edge of the light the lamp should have cast some light into the hood of his cloak but it didnt the inside of the hood was as smooth and black and empty as a cave his voice came out of that nothingness it made me jump love jeanclaude love happened to me my beloved grew a conscience she said it was wrong to feed upon people we were once people after all for love of her i tried to drink cold blood i tried animal blood but it was not enough to sustain me i stared into that darkness i kept pointing the gun but i was beginning to feel silly sabin didnt seem at all afraid of it which was unnerving maybe he didnt care that was also unnerving she talked you into going vegetarian great i said you seem powerful enough he laughed and with the laughter the shadows in his hood faded slowly like a curtain lifting he threw it back in one quick flourish i didnt scream but i gasped and took a step back i couldnt help myself when i realized id done it i stopped and made myself take back that step meet his eyes no flinching his hair was thick and straight and golden falling like a shining curtain to his shoulders but his skin his skin had rotted away on half his face it was like latestage leprosy but worse the flesh was pussfilled gangrenous and should have stunk to high heaven the other half of his face was still beautiful the kind of face that medieval painters had borrowed for cherubim a golden perfection one crystalline blue eye rolled in its rotting socket as if in danger of spilling out onto his cheek the other eye was secure and watched my face you can put up the gun ma petite it was an accident after all jeanclaude said i lowered the browning but didnt put it up it took more effort than was pretty to say calmly this happened because you stopped feeding off of humans we believe so dumare said i tore my gaze away from sabins ravaged face and looked back at dominic you think i can help cure him of this i couldnt keep the disbelief out of my voice i heard of your reputation in europe i raised my eyebrows no modesty ms blake among those of us who notice such things you are gaining a certain notoriety notoriety not fame hmmm put the gun away ma petite sabin has done all thewhat is your wordgrandstanding he will do tonight havent you sabin i fear so it all seems to go so badly now i holstered the gun and shook my head i honestly dont have the faintest idea how to help you if you knew how would you help me sabin asked i looked at him and nodded yes even though i am a vampire and you are a vampire executioner have you done anything in this country that you need killing for sabin laughed the rotting skin stretched and a ligament popped with a wet snap i had to look away not yet ms blake not yet his face sobered quickly the humor abruptly faded you school your face to show nothing jeanclaude but i read the horror in your eyes jeanclaudes skin had gone back to its usual milky perfection his face was still lovely perfect but at least hed stopped glowing his midnight blue eyes were just eyes now he was still beautiful but it was a nearly human beauty is it not worth a little horror he asked sabin smiled and i wished he hadnt the muscles on the rotted side didnt work and his mouth hung crooked i glanced away then made myself look back if he could be trapped inside that face i could look at it then you will help me i would aid you if i could but it is anita you have come to ask she must give her own answer well ms blake i dont know how to help you i repeated do you understand how dire my circumstances are ms blake the true horror of it do you grasp it the rot probably wont kill you but its progressive i take it oh yes its progressive virulently so i would help you if i could sabin but what can i do that dumare cant hes a necromancer maybe as powerful as i am maybe more why do you need me i realize ms blake that you dont have something specifically for sabins problem dumare said as far as i can discover he is the only vampire to ever suffer such a fate but i thought if we came to another necromancer as powerful as myself he smiled modestly or nearly as powerful as myself perhaps together we could work up a spell to help him a spell i glanced at jeanclaude he gave that wonderful gallic shrug that meant everything and nothing i know little of necromancy ma petite you would know if such a spell were possible more than i it is not only your ability as a necromancer that has brought us to you dumare said you have also acted as a focus for at least two different animators i believe that is the american word for what you do i nodded the words right but where did you hear i could act as a focus come ms blake the ability to combine another animators powers with your own and thus magnify both powers is a rare talent can you act as a focus i asked he tried to look humble but actually looked pleased with himself i must confess yes i can act as a focus think of what the two of us could accomplish together we could raise a hell of a lot of zombies but that wont cure sabin true enough dumare leaned forward in his chair his lean handsome face flushed eager a true convert looking for disciples i wasnt much of a follower i would offer to teach you true necromancy not this voodoo dabbling that youve been doing jeanclaude made a soft sound halfway between a laugh and a cough i glared at jeanclaudes amused face but said im doing just fine with this voodoo dabbling i meant no insult ms blake you will need a teacher of some sort soon if not me then you must find someone else i dont know what youre talking about control ms blake raw power no matter how impressive is not the same as power used with great care and great control i shook my head ill help you if i can mr dumare ill even participate in a spell if i check it out with a local witch i know first afraid that i will try and steal your power i smiled no short of killing me the best you or anyone else can do is borrow you are wise beyond your years ms blake you arent that much older than i am i said something crossed over his face the faintest flicker and i knew youre his human servant arent you dominic smiled spreading his hands oui i sighed i thought you said you werent trying to hide anything from me a human servants job is to be the daytime eyes and ears of his master i am of no use to my master if vampire hunters can spot me for what i am i spotted you but in another situation without sabin at my side would you have i thought about that for a moment maybe i shook my head i dont know thank you for your honesty ms blake sabin said i am sure our time is up jeanclaude said you had a pressing engagement ms blake much more important than my little problem there was a little bite to that last ma petitehas a date with her other beau sabin stared at jeanclaude so you are truly allowing her to date another i thought that at least must be rumor very little of what you hear about ma petiteis rumor believe all you hear sabin chuckled coughing as if struggling to keep the laughter from spilling out his ruined mouth if i believed everything i heard i would have come with an army you came with one servant because i allowed you only one servant jeanclaude said sabin smiled too true come dominic we must not take more of ms blakes so valuable time dominic stood obediently towering over us both sabin was around my height of course i wasnt sure if his legs were still there he might have been taller once i dont like you sabin but i would never willingly leave another being in the shape youre in my plans tonight are important but if i thought we could cure you immediately id change them the vampire looked at me his blue blue eyes were like staring down into clear ocean water there was no pull to them either he was behaving himself or like most vampires he couldnt roll me with his eyes anymore thank you ms blake i believe you are sincere he extended a gloved hand from the voluminous cloak i hesitated then took it his hand squished ever so slightly and it took a lot not to jerk back i forced myself to shake his hand to smile to let go and not to rub my hand on my skirt dominic shook my hand as well his was cool and dry thank you for your time ms blake i will contact you tomorrow and we will discuss things ill be expecting your call mr dumare call me dominic please i nodded dominic we can discuss it but i hate to take your money when im not sure that i can help you may i call you anita he asked i hesitated and shrugged why not dont worry about money sabin said i have plenty of that for all the good it has done me how is the woman you love taking the change in your appearance jeanclaude asked sabin looked at him it was not a friendly look she finds it repulsive as do i she feels immense guilt she has not left me nor is she with me youd lived for close to seven hundred years i said why screw things up for a woman sabin turned to me a line of ooze creeping down his face like a black tear are you asking me if it was worth it ms blake i swallowed and shook my head its none of my business im sorry i asked he drew the hood over his face he turned back to me black a cup of shadows where his face should have been she was going to leave me ms blake i thought that i would sacrifice anything to keep her by my side in my bed i was wrong he turned that blackness to jeanclaude we will see you tomorrow night jeanclaude i look forward to it neither vampire offered to shake hands sabin glided for the door the robe trailing behind him empty i wondered how much of his lower body was left and decided i didnt want to know dominic shook my hand again thank you anita you have given us hope he held my hand and stared into my face as if he could read something there and do think about my offer to teach you there are very few of us who are true necromancers i took back my hand ill think about it now i really do have to go he smiled held the door for sabin and out they went jeanclaude and i stood a moment in silence i broke it first can you trust them jeanclaude sat on the edge of my desk smiling of course not then why did you agree to let them come the council has declared that no master vampires in the united states may quarrel until that nasty law that is floating around washington is dead one undead war and the antivampire lobby would push through the law and make us illegal again i shook my head i dont think brewsters law has a snowballs chance vampires are legal in the united states whether i agree with it or not i dont think thats going to change how can you be so sure its sort of hard to say a group of beings is alive and has rights then change your mind and say killing them on sight is okay again the aclu would have a field day he smiled perhaps regardless the council has forced a truce on all of us until the law is decided one way or another so you can let sabin in your territory because if he misbehaves the council will hunt him down and kill him jeanclaude nodded but youd still be dead i said he spread his hands graceful empty nothings perfect i laughed i guess not now arent you going to be late for your date with monsieur zeeman youre being awfully civilized about this i said tomorrow night you will be with me ma petite i would be a poor sport to begrudge richard his night youre usually a poor sport now ma petite that is hardly fair richard is not dead is he only because you know that if you kill him ill kill you i held a hand up before he could say it id try to kill you and youd try to kill me etc this was an old argument so richard lives you date us both and i am being patient more patient than i have ever been with anyone i studied his face he was one of those men who was beautiful rather than handsome but the face was masculine you wouldnt mistake him for female even with the long hair in fact there was something terribly masculine about jeanclaude no matter how much lace he wore he could be mine lock stock and fangs i just wasnt sure i wanted him ive got to go i said he pushed away from my desk he was suddenly standing close enough to touch then go ma petite i could feel his body inches from mine like a shimmering energy i had to swallow before i could speak its my office you have to leave he touched my arms lightly a brush of fingertips enjoy your evening ma petite his fingers wrapped around my arms just below the shoulders he didnt lean over me or draw me that last inch closer he simply held my arms and stared down at me i met his dark dark blue eyes there had been a time not so long ago that i couldnt have met his gaze without falling into it and being lost now i could meet his eyes but in some ways i was just as lost i raised up on tiptoe putting my face close to his i should have killed you a long time ago you have had your chances ma petite you keep saving me my mistake i said he laughed and the sound slid down my body like fur against naked skin i shuddered in his arms stop that i said he kissed me lightly a brush of lips so i couldnt feel the fangs you would miss me if i were gone ma petite admit it i drew away from him his hands slid down my arms over my hands until i drew my fingertips across his hands ive got to go so you said just get out jeanclaude no more games his face sobered instantly as if a hand had wiped it clean no more games ma petite go to your other lover it was his turn to raise a hand and say i know you are not truly lovers i know you are resisting both of us brave ma petite a flash of something maybe anger crossed his face and was gone like a ripple lost in dark water tomorrow night you will be with me and it will be richards turn to sit at home and wonder he shook his head even for you i would not have done what sabin has done even for your love there are things i would not do he stared at me suddenly fierce anger flaring through his eyes his face but what i do is enough dont go all selfrighteous on me i said if you hadnt interfered richard and i would be engaged maybe more by now and what you would be living behind a white picket fence with two point whatever children i think you lie to yourself more than to me anita it was always a bad sign when he used my real name whats that supposed to mean it means ma petite that you are as likely to thrive in domestic bliss as i am with that he glided to the door and left he closed the door quietly but firmly behind him domestic bliss who me my life was a cross between a preternatural soap opera and an action adventure movie sort of as the casket turns meets rambo white picket fences didnt fit jeanclaude was right about that i had the entire weekend off it was the first time in months id been looking forward to this evening all week but truthfully it wasnt jeanclaudes nearly perfect face that was haunting me i kept flashing on sabins face eternal life eternal pain eternal ugliness nice afterlife there were three kinds of people at catherines dinner party the living the dead and the occasionally furry out of the eight of us six were human and i wasnt sure about two of those myself included i wore black pants a black velvet jacket with white satin lapels and an oversized white vest that doubled for a shirt the browning mm actually matched the outfit but i kept it hidden this was the first party catherine had thrown since her wedding flashing a gun might put a damper on things id had to take off the silver cross that i always wore and put it in my pocket because there was a vampire standing in front of me and the cross had started glowing when he entered the room if id known there were going to be vamps at the party id have worn a collar high enough to hide the cross they only glow when theyre out in the open generally speaking robert the vampire in question was tall muscular and handsome in a modelperfect sort of way he had been a stripper at guilty pleasures now he managed the club from worker to management the american dream his hair was blond curly and cut quite short he was wearing a brown silk shirt that fit him perfectly and matched the dress that his date was wearing monica vespuccis health club tan had faded around the edges but her makeup was still perfect her short auburn hair styled into place she was pregnant enough for me to have noticed and happy enough about it to be irritating she smiled brilliantly at me anita it has been too long what i wanted to say was not long enough the last time id seen her she had betrayed me to the local master vampire but catherine thought she was her friend and it was hard to disillusion her without telling the whole story the whole story included some unsanctioned killing some of it done by me catherines a lawyer and a stickler for law and order i didnt want to put her in a position where she had to compromise her morals to save my ass so monica was her friend which meant i had been polite all through dinner from appetizer all the way to dessert id been polite mainly because monica had been at the other end of the table now unfortunately we were mingling in the living room and i couldnt seem to shake her it doesnt seem that long i said its been almost a year she smiled up at robert they were holding hands we got married she touched her glass to the top of her belly we got knocked up she giggled i stared at them both you cant get knocked up by a hundredyearold corpse okay id been polite long enough monica grinned at me you can if the body temperature is raised for long enough and you have sex often enough my obstetrician thinks the hot tub did us in this was more than i wanted to know have you had the amnio yet the smile faded from her face leaving her eyes haunted i was sorry id asked weve got another week to wait im sorry monica robert i hope the test comes back clean i did not mention vlad syndrome but the words hung on the air it was rare but not as rare as it used to be three years of legalized vampirism and vlad syndrome was the highest rising birth defect in the country it could result in some really horrible disabilities not to mention death for the baby with that much at stake youd think people would be more cautious robert cradled her against him and all the light had faded from her face she looked pale i felt like a heel the latest news was that a vampire over a hundred was sterile i said they should update their information i guess i meant for it to be comforting like they hadnt been careless monica looked at me and there was no gentleness in her eyes when she said worried i stared at her all pale and pregnant and wanted to slap her anyway i was not sleeping with jeanclaude but i was not going to stand there and justify myself to monica vespuccior anyone else for that matter richard zeeman entered the room i didnt actually see him enter i felt it i turned and watched him walk towards us he was six foot one nearly a foot taller than me another inch and we couldnt have kissed without a chair but it would have been worth the effort he wove between the other guests saying a word here and there his smile flashed white and perfect in his permanently tanned skin as he talked to these new friends that hed managed to charm at dinner not with sex appeal or power but with sheer good will he was the worlds biggest boy scout the original hail fellow well met he liked people and was a wonderful listener two qualities that are highly underrated his suit was dark brown his shirt a deep orangey gold the tie was a brighter orange with a line of small figures down the middle of it you had to be standing right next to him to realize the figures were warner brothers cartoons hed tied his shoulderlength hair back from his face in a version of a french braid so the illusion was that his brown hair was very short it left his face clean and very visible his cheekbones were perfect sculpted high and graceful his face was masculine handsome with a dimple to soften it it was the kind of face that would have made me shy in high school he noticed me watching him and smiled his brown eyes sparkled with the smile filling with heat that had nothing to do with room temperature i watched him walk the last few feet and felt heat rise up my neck into my face i wanted to undress him to touch his bare skin to see what was under that suit i wanted that very badly i wouldnt because i wasnt sleeping with richard either i wasnt sleeping with the vampire or the werewolf richard was the werewolf it was his only fault okay maybe one other hed never killed anybody that last fault might get him killed someday i slid my left arm around his waist under the unbuttoned jacket the solid warmth of him beat like a pulse against my body if we didnt have sex soon i was simply going to explode what price morals monica stared at me very steadily studying my face thats a lovely necklace who got it for you i smiled and shook my head i was wearing a black velvet choker with a cameo edged by silver filigree hey it matched the outfit monica was pretty sure richard hadnt given it to me which meant to monica that jeanclaude had good old monica she never changed i bought it to match the outfit i said she widened her eyes in surprise oh really like she didnt believe me really im not much into gifts especially jewelry richard hugged me thats the truth shes a very hard woman to spoil catherine joined us her coppercolored hair flowed around her face in a wavy mass she was the only one i knew with curlier hair than mine but its color was more spectacular if asked most people described her from the hair outward delicate makeup hid the freckles and drew attention to her pale grey green eyes her dress was the color of new leaves id never seen her look better marriage seems to agree with you i said smiling she smiled back you should try it sometime i shook my head thanks a lot i have to steal anita away for just a moment at least she didnt say she needed help in the kitchen richard would have known that was a lie he was a much better cook than i was catherine led me back to the spare bedroom where the coats were piled in a heap there was one real fur coat draped over the pile i was betting i knew who owned it monica liked being close to dead things as soon as the door was shut catherine grabbed my hands and giggled i swear richard is wonderful my junior high science teachers never looked like that i smiled and it was one of those big dopey smiles the silly kind that say youre in horrible lust if not love maybe both and it feels good even if it is stupid we sat down on the bed pushing the coats to one side he is handsome i said my voice as neutral as i could make it anita dont give me that ive never seen you glow around anyone i dont glow she grinned at me and nodded yes you do do not i said but it was hard to be sullen when i wanted to smile all right i like him a lot happy youve been dating him for nearly seven months wheres the engagement ring i did frown at her then catherine just because youre deliriously happily married doesnt mean everyone else has to be married too she shrugged and laughed i stared into her shining face and shook my head there had to be more to bob than met the eye he was about thirty pounds heavier than he should have been balding with small round glasses on a rather nondescript face he did not have a sparkling personality either id been ready to give her the thumbs down until i saw the way he looked at catherine he looked at her like she was the whole world and it was a nice safe wonderful world a lot of people are pretty and clever repartee is on every television set but dependability thats rare i didnt bring richard here to get your stamp of approval i knew youd like him then why did you keep him such a secret ive tried to meet him a dozen times i shrugged the truth was because i knew shed get that light in her eyes that maniacal gleam that your married friends get when youre not married and youre dating anyone or worse yet not dating and theyre trying to fix you up catherine had the look now dont tell me you planned this entire party just so you could meet richard partly how else was i ever going to there was a knock on the door come in catherine said bob opened the door he still looked ordinary to me but from the light in catherines face she saw something else he smiled at her the smile made his whole face glow and i could see something shining and fine love makes us all beautiful sorry to interrupt the girl talk but theres a phone call for anita did they say who it is ted forrester says its business my eyes widened ted forrester was an alias for a man i knew as edward he was a hit man who specialized in vampires lycanthropes or anything else that wasnt quite human i was a licensed vampire hunter occasionally our paths crossed we might even on some level be friends maybe whos ted forrester catherine asked bounty hunter i said ted edwards alias was a bounty hunter with papers to prove it all nice and legal i stood and went for the door is something wrong catherine asked not much got past her which was one of the reasons i avoided her when i was ass deep in alligators she was smart enough to figure out when things were offcenter but she didnt carry a gun if you cant defend yourself you are cannon fodder the only thing that kept richard from being cannon fodder was that he was a werewolf although refusing to kill people made him almost cannon fodder shapeshifter or not i was just hoping not to have to do any work tonight i said i thought you had the entire weekend off she said so did i i took the phone in the home office theyd set up theyd divided the room down the middle one half was decorated in country with teddy bears and miniature gingham rockers the other half was masculine with hunting prints and a ship in a bottle on the desk compromise at its best i picked up the phone and said hello its edward how did you get this number he was quiet for a second childs play why did you hunt me down edward whats up interesting choice of words he said what are you talking about i was just offered a contract on your life for enough money to make it worth my while it was my turn to be quiet did you take it would i be calling you if i had maybe i said he laughed true but im not going to take it why not friendship try again i said i figure ill get to kill more people guarding you if i take the contract i only get to kill you comforting did you say guard ill be in town tomorrow youre that sure someone else will take the contract i dont even open my door for less than a hundred grand anita someone will take the hit and itll be someone good not as good as me but good any advice until you get into town i havent given them my answer yet thatll delay them once i say no itll take a little time to contact another hitter you should be safe tonight enjoy your weekend off how did you know i had the weekend off craig is a very talkative secretary very helpful ill have to speak to him about that i said you do that youre sure that there wont be a hitter in town tonight nothing in life is sure anita but i wouldnt like it if a client tried to hire me and then gave the job to someone else you lose many clients at your own hands i asked no comment he said so one last night of safety i said probably but be careful anyway who put the hit out on me i dont know edward said what do you mean you dont know you have to know so you can get paid i go through intermediaries most of the time keeps down the chance that the next client is a cop how do you find wayward clients if they piss you off i can find them but it takes time anita if youve got a really good hitter on your tail time is something you wont have oh that was comforting it wasnt supposed to be comforting he said can you think of anyone who hates you so badly and has this kind of money i thought about that for a minute no most of the people that would fit the bill are dead the only good enemy is a dead enemy edward said yeah i heard a rumor that youre dating the master of the city is that true i hesitated i realized i was embarrassed to admit the truth to edward yeah its true i had to hear you say it i could almost hear him shake his head over the phone damn anita you know better than that i know i said did you dump richard no which monster are you with tonight bloodsucker or flesheater none of your damn business i said fine pick the monster of your choice tonight anita have a good time tomorrow we start trying to keep you alive he hung up if it had been anybody else id have said he was angry about me dating a vampire or maybe disappointed would be a better word i hung up the phone and sat there for a few minutes letting it all sink in someone was trying to kill me nothing new there but this someone was hiring expert help that was new id never had an assassin after my butt before i waited to feel fear wash over me but it didnt oh in a vague sort of way i was afraid but not like i should have been it wasnt that i didnt believe it could happen i did believe it was more that so much else had happened in the last year that i couldnt get too excited yet if the assassin jumped out and started shooting id deal with it maybe later id even have an attack of nerves but i didnt get many attacks of nerves anymore part of me was numbing out like a combat veteran there was just too much to take in so you stop taking it in i almost wished i had been scared fear will keep you alive indifference wont somewhere out there by tomorrow someone would have my name on a todo list pick up dry cleaning buy groceries kill anita blake i stepped back into the living room and caught richards eye i was sort of ready to go home somehow knowing an assassin was out there or would be soon had put a damper on the evening whats wrong richard asked nothing i said i know i know i had to tell him but how do you tell your sweetie that people are trying to kill you not in a room full of people maybe in the car yes there is youve got that tension between your eyebrows that means youre trying not to frown no im not he smoothed his finger between my eyes yes you are i glared at him am not he smiled now you are frowning his face sobered whats wrong i sighed i stepped closer to him not for romance but for privacy vampires had incredibly good hearing and i didnt want robert to know hed tattle to jeanclaude if i wanted jeanclaude to know id tell him myself it was edward on the phone what does he want richard was frowning now too someone tried to hire him to kill me a look of total astonishment blossomed on his face and i was glad his back was to the room he closed his mouth opened it and finally said i would say youre kidding but i know youre not why would anyone want to kill you there are plenty of people who would like to see me dead richard but none of them have the kind of money thats being put out for the hit how can you be so calm about this would it solve anything if i had hysterics he shook his head its not that he seemed to think for a second its that youre not outraged that someones trying to kill you you just accept it almost like its normal it isnt normal assassins arent normal even for me richard i said just vampires zombies and werewolves he said i smiled yeah he hugged me tightly and whispered loving you can be very scary sometimes i wrapped my arms around his waist leaning my face against his chest i closed my eyes and for just a moment i breathed in the smell of him it was more than his aftershave it was the smell of his skin his warmth him for just a moment i sank against him and let it all go i let his arms be my shelter i knew that a wellplaced bullet would destroy it all but for a few seconds i felt safe illusion is sometimes all that keeps us sane i pushed away from him with a sigh lets give our regrets to catherine and get out of here he touched my cheek gently looking into my eyes we can stay if you want i nestled my cheek against his hand and shook my head if the shit hits the fan tomorrow i dont want to spend tonight at a party id rather go back to my apartment and cuddle he flashed me that smile that warmed me down to my toes sounds like a plan to me i smiled back because i couldnt not smile back ill go tell catherine ill get the coats he said we did our various tasks and left early catherine gave me a very knowing smile i wished she was right leaving early to jump richards bones beat the heck out of the truth monica watched us leave i knew that she and robert would report back to jeanclaude fine he knew i was dating richard i hadnt lied to anybody monica was a lawyer at catherines firmfrightening thought all on its ownso she had a legitimate reason to be invited jeanclaude hadnt arranged it but i didnt like being spied on no matter how it came about the walk to the car was nerveracking every shadow was suddenly a potential hiding place every noise a footstep i didnt draw my gun but my hand ached to do it dammit i said softly the numbness was wearing off i wasnt sure it was an improvement what is it richard asked he was suddenly scanning the darkness not looking at me while he talked his nostrils flared just a little and i realized he was scenting the wind just jumpy i dont see anyone out here but im suddenly looking too damn hard i dont smell anyone close to us but they could be downwind the only gun i smell is yours you can smell my gun he nodded youve cleaned it recently i can smell the oil i smiled and shook my head you are so blasted normal sometimes i forget you turn furry once a month knowing how good you are at spotting lycanthropes thats quite a compliment he smiled do you think assassins would fall from the trees if i held your hand right now i smiled i think were safe for the moment he curved his fingers around my hand and a tingle went up my arm like hed touched a nerve he rubbed his thumb in small circles on the back of my hand and took a deep breath its almost nice to know that this assassin business has unnerved you too i dont want you afraid but sometimes its hard to be your guy when i think you may be braver than i am that sounds like macho crap doesnt it i stared up at him theres a lot of macho crap out there richard at least you know its crap can this male chauvinist wolf kiss you always he leaned his face downward and i rose on tiptoe to meet his mouth with mine my free hand against his chest for balance we could kiss without me going on tiptoe but richard tended to get a crick in his neck it was a quicker kiss than normal because i had this itching in the middle of my back right between the shoulder blades i knew it was my imagination but i felt too exposed out in the open richard sensed it and pulled away he went around to the drivers side of his car and opened his door leaning across to unlock mine he didnt open the door for me he knew better than that i could open my own bloody door richards car was an old mustang sixty something a mach one i knew all this because he had told me it was orange with a black racing stripe the bucket seats were black leather but the front seat was small enough that we could hold hands when he wasnt using the gear shift richard pulled out onto south friday night traffic spilled around us in a bright sparkle of lights everybody out trying to enjoy the weekend i wondered how many of them had assassins after them i was betting i was one of the few youre quiet richard said yeah i wont ask what youre thinking about i can guess i looked at him the darkness of the car wrapped around us cars at night are like your own private world hushed and dark intimate the lights of oncoming traffic swept over his face highlighting it then leaving us in darkness how do you know im not thinking about what youd look like without your clothes on he flashed me a grin tease i smiled sorry no sexual innuendo unless im willing to jump your bones thats your rule not mine richard said im a big boy give me all the sexual innuendo you want i can take it if im not going to sleep with you it doesnt seem fair let me worry about that he said why mr zeeman are you inviting me to make sexual overtures to you his smile widened a whiteness in the dark oh please i leaned toward him as far as the seat belt would allow putting a hand on the back of his seat putting my face inches from the smooth expanse of his neck i took a deep breath in and let it out slowly so close to his skin that my own breath came back to me like a warm cloud i kissed the bend of his neck running my lips lightly up and down the skin richard made a small contented sound i curled my knees into my seat straining against the seat belt so i could kiss the big pulse in his neck the curve of his jaw he turned his face into me we kissed but my nerves werent that good i turned his face away you watch the road he shifted gears his upper arm brushing against my breasts i sighed against him putting my hand over his holding it on the gear shift keeping his arm pressed against me we stayed frozen for a second then he moved against me rubbing i scooted out from under his arm settling back into my seat i couldnt breathe past the pulse in my throat i shivered hugging myself the feel of his body against mine made places all over my body tighten whats wrong he said his voice low and soft i shook my head we cant keep doing this if you stopped because of me i was enjoying myself so was i thats the problem i said richard took in a deep breath and let it out sighing its only a problem because you make it one anita yeah right marry me anita and all this can be yours i dont want to marry you just so i can sleep with you if it was only sex i wouldnt want you to marry me richard said but its cuddling on the couch watching singing in the rain its eating chinese and knowing to get that extra order of crab rangoon i can order for both of us at most of the restaurants in town are you saying im predictable dont do that dont belittle it he said i sighed im sorry richard i didnt mean to i just i didnt know what to say because he was right my day was more complete for having been shared with richard i bought him a mug that i just happened to see in a store it had wolves on it and said in gods wildness lies the hope of the worldthe great fresh unblighted unredeemed wilderness it was a quote from john muir no special occasion just saw it knew richard would like it bought it a dozen times a day id hear something on the radio or in conversation and id think i must remember and tell richard it was richard who took me on my first birdwatching trip since college i had a degree in biology preternatural biology once id thought id spend my life as a field biologist like a preternatural version of jane goodall id enjoyed the birdwatching partly because he was with me partly because id enjoyed it years ago it was like id forgotten that there was life outside of a gun barrel or a grave side id been neck deep in blood and death so long then richard came along richard who was also neck deep in strange stuff but who managed to have a life i couldnt think of anything better than waking up beside him reaching for his body first thing in the morning knowing id be coming home to him listening to his collection of rodgers and hammerstein watching his face while he watched gene kelly musicals i almost opened my mouth and said lets do it lets get married but i didnt i loved richard i could admit that to myself but it wasnt enough there was an assassin after me how could i involve a mildmannered junior high teacher in that kind of life he was one of the monsters but he didnt accept it he was in a battle for leadership of the local werewolf pack hed beaten the current pack leader marcus twice and twice refused the kill if you didnt kill you didnt get to be leader richard clung to his morals clung to values that only worked when people werent trying to kill you if i married him his chance at any kind of normal life was gone i lived in a sort of freefire zone richard deserved better jeanclaude lived in the same world that i did he had no illusions about the kindness of strangers or anyone else for that matter the vampire wouldnt he shocked at the news of an assassin hed simply help me plan what to do about it it wouldnt throw him or not much there were nights when i thought that jeanclaude and i deserved each other richard turned off onto olive we were soon going to be at my apartment and the silence was getting a little thick silences dont usually bother me but this one did im sorry richard i am truly sorry if i didnt know you loved me this would be easier he said if it wasnt for that damned vampire youd marry me that damn vampire introduced us i said and hes regretting it dont think he isnt richard said i looked at him how do you know that he shook his head all you have to do is see his face when were together i may not like jeanclaude and i hate the thought of you with him but we arent the only two hurting here its a threesome dont think its not i huddled in my seat suddenly miserable id have almost welcomed a hit man appearing out of the darkness killing i understood relationships confused me admittedly this relationship was more confusing than most richard turned into the parking lot of my apartment building he parked the car and turned off the engine we sat there in the dark the only illumination the distant glow of a street light i dont know what to say richard i stared out through the windshield concentrating on the side of the building too cowardly to look at him while i talked i wouldnt blame you for just saying to hell with it i wouldnt put up with this kind of indecision from you and i wouldnt share you with another woman i finally looked at him he was staring straight ahead not looking at me my heart sped up if i was truly as brave as i thought i was id have let him go but i loved him and i wasnt that brave the best i could do was not sleep with him not take the relationship that next step forward that was hard enough even my selfcontrol wasnt limitless if wed been planning a wedding i could have waited with an end in sight my selfcontrol would have appeared endless but there was no end in sight chastity works better if you dont keep testing it quite so often i unbuckled the seat belt unlocked and opened the door richard touched my shoulder before i could get out arent you going to invite me up i let out a breath i hadnt realized i was holding and turned back to him do you want to be invited up he nodded i dont know why you put up with me i said he smiled he leaned into me a light brush of lips sometimes im not sure myself we got out richard held his hand out to me and i took it a car pulled in behind us beside my own jeep it was my neighbor mrs pringle she had a huge television box tied into her trunk we walked to the sidewalk and waited for her to get out she was a tall woman stretched almost painfully thin with age her snow white hair was done in a bun at the back of her head custard her pomeranian jumped out of the car and stood yapping at us he looked like a golden powder puff with little cat feet he bounced forward on stiff legs he sniffed richards foot and looked up at him with a small growl mrs pringle tugged on his leash custard behave yourself the dog quieted but i think it was more richards steady glare than mrs pringles admonishments she smiled at us she had the same light in her eyes that catherine had had she liked richard and made no bones about it well now this is advantageous i need some strong young arms to carry that monstrous television up the stairs for me richard smiled at her happy to oblige he walked around to the trunk and started trying to undo the knots whatd you do with custard while you shopped i asked i carried him with me ive spent a great deal of money at that store before the salesmen fairly salivate when i come through the doors so they indulge me i had to smile there was a sharp twang as the ropes broke ill help richard i walked back to the trunk the rope was an inch thick and flopped broken onto the pavement i raised eyebrows at him and whispered my my grandma what strong hands you have i could carry the television up alone but it might arouse suspicions it was a thirtyinch wide screen you could really carry it up the stairs by yourself easily he said i shook my head but youre not going to because you are a mildmannered science teacher not an alpha werewolf which is why you get to help me he said are you having trouble undoing the rope mrs pringle asked shed walked back to us with custard in tow no i said giving richard a look weve got the rope if people found out richard was a lycanthrope hed lose his job it was illegal to discriminate but it happened all the time richard taught children hed be branded a monster and most people didnt let monsters near their children mrs pringle and custard led the way i went up backwards sort of steadying the box but richard took all the weight he walked up the stairs like the box weighed nothing pushing with his legs waiting for me to go up another step he made a face at me soundlessly humming under his breath as if he was bored lycanthropes are stronger than your runofthemill human being i knew that but it was still a little unsettling to be reminded we made it to the hallway and he let me have some of the weight the thing was heavy but i held on and we kept moving towards mrs pringles apartment which was right across the hall from mine ive got the door opened she called we were at the door starting to maneuver through when custard darted between us underneath the box trailing his leash mrs pringle was trapped behind the television custard come back here richard lifted with his forearms taking the weight get him i can get inside i let him pretend to struggle inside the apartment and went for the dog i expected to have to chase him down the hall but he was sniffing at my door whining i knelt and grabbed the end of his leash pulling him back towards me mrs pringle was at her door smiling i see you caught the little rascal i handed her the leash ive got to get something out of my apartment im sure richard can help you set up the tv thanks a lot he called from inside the apartment mrs pringle laughed ill give you both some iced tea unless you have better things to do there was a knowing look in her blue eyes that made me blush she winked at me i kid you not when the door was safely closed with her and richard on the other side i walked toward my apartment three doors down i crossed the hallway i took the browning out and clicked the safety off i eased back towards my door maybe i was being paranoid maybe custard hadnt smelled anybody in my apartment but hed never whined at my door like that before maybe edwards phone call was making me jumpy but better jumpy than dead paranoid it was i knelt by the door and took a breath letting it out slowly i took my keys out of my jacket pocket lefthanded i scrunched down as low as i could get and still have a decent shooting stance if there was a bad guy in there hed probably shoot at chest level on my knees i was a lot shorter than chest level i pushed the key in the lock nothing happened the apartment was probably empty except for my fish wondering what the hell i was doing i turned the knob pushed the door inward and a hole exploded out through the door thundering over my head like a cannon shot there was no sound for a second the door swung closed with the force of the shot and through the hole in the door i saw a man with a shotgun raised to his shoulder i fired once through the hole the door bounced open still reverberating from the shotgun blast i threw myself onto one side gun pointed through the open door the shotgun fired again showering the hallway with bits of wood i fired twice more hitting the man in the chest both times he staggered blood blossoming on his coat and fell straight back the shotgun fell to the carpet near his feet i got to my knees back pressed to the wall near my kitchenette all i could hear was a roaring in my ears then dimly my own blood rushing through my head richard was suddenly there in the doorway like a target get down he may not be alone i wasnt sure how loud i was yelling my ears were still ringing richard crouched beside me i think he said my name but i didnt have time for it i pushed upward my back to the wall gun in a twohanded grip he started to stand i said stay down he did point for him i could see that there was no one in front of my apartment unless there was somebody hiding in the bedroom the hit man had been alone i approached him slowly gun pointed at him if hed twitched id have shot again but he didnt move the shotgun was by his feet id never seen anybody use a gun with their feet so i left it where it was he lay on his back one arm thrown up over his head one down at his side his face was slack with death his eyes wide and unseeing i didnt really need to check for a pulse but i did it anyway nothing there were three holes in his chest id hit him with the first shot but it hadnt been a killing blow that had nearly cost me my life richard came up behind me theres no one else in the apartment anita i didnt argue with him i didnt ask if he knew this by smell or by hearing i didnt bloody care i checked the bedroom and bathroom just to be thorough and came back out to find richard staring down at the dead man who is he richard asked it occurred to me that i could hear again bully for me i still had a faint ringing in my ears but it would pass i dont know richard looked at me was he the hitter i think so there was a hole in the door big enough to crawl through it was still open mrs pringles door was closed but the doorjamb was splintered like something had taken a big bite out of it if shed been standing there shed have been dead i heard the distant wail of police sirens couldnt blame the neighbors for calling them im going to make some phone calls before the cops get here then what he asked i looked at him he was pale the whites of his eyes showing just a little too much then we go with the nice police officers down to the station to answer questions it was selfdefense yeah but hes still dead on my carpet i walked into the bedroom searching for the phone i was having a little trouble remembering where id left it as if it ever moved from the nightstand shock is always fun richard leaned in the doorway who are you going to call dolph and maybe catherine a friendly policeman i understand but why catherine shes a lawyer oh he said he glanced back at the dead man who was bleeding all over my white carpet dating you is never boring ill give you that and its dangerous i said dont forget dangerous i dialed dolphs number from memory i never forget youre dangerous anita richard said he stared at me and his eyes were amber the color of a wolfs eyes his beast slid behind those eyes peering out probably the smell of fresh blood i stared into those alien eyes and knew i wasnt the only dangerous thing in the room of course i was armed the dead man could vouch for that laughter tickled the back of my throat i tried to swallow it but it spilled out and i was giggling when dolph answered the phone laughing was better than crying i guess though im not sure dolph thought so i sat in a straightbacked chair at a small scarred table in an interrogation room oh sorry interview room thats what they were calling it now call it what you will it still smelled like stale sweat and old cigarettes with an overlay of disinfectant i was sipping my third cup of coffee and my hands were still cold detective sergeant rudolph storr leaned against the far wall his arms were crossed over his chest and he was trying to be unobtrusive but when youre six foot eight and built like a pro wrestler thats hard he hadnt said a word during the interview just here to observe catherine sat beside me shed thrown a black blazer over the green dress brought her briefcase and sat wearing her lawyer face detective branswell sat across from us he was in his midthirties black hair dark complected with eyes as black as his hair his name was english but he looked mediterranean like hed just stepped off the olive boat his accent was pure middle missouri now ms blake go over it just one more time for me please he poised his pen over his notebook as if hed write it all down again wed helped my neighbor carry up her new television mrs edith pringle yeah she confirms all that but why did you go to your apartment i was going to get a screwdriver to help install the television you keep a lot of tools ms blake he wrote something on his notepad i was betting it was a doodle no detective but ive got a screwdriver did mrs pringle ask you to go get this screwdriver no but shed used it when she bought her stereo system which was true i was trying to keep the lies to an absolute minimum so you assumed shed need it yes then what he asked like hed never heard the answer before his black eyes were intense and empty unreadable and eager at the same time we were coming to the part that he didnt quite buy i unlocked my door and dropped my keys i squatted down to pick them up and the first shotgun blast roared over my head i returned fire how the door was closed i shot through the hole in the door that the shotgun had made you shot a man through a hole in your door and hit him it was a big hole detective and i wasnt sure i hit him why didnt the second shotgun blast take you out ms blake there wasnt enough left of the door to hide behind where were you ms blake i told you the blast rocked the door inward i hit the floor on my side the second blast went over me and you shot the man twice more in the chest detective branswell said yes he looked at me for a long moment studying my face i met his eyes without flinching it wasnt that hard i was numb empty and distant there was still a fine ringing in my ears from being so damn close to two shotgun blasts the ringing would fade it usually did you know the man you killed catherine touched my arm detective branswell my client has been more than helpful shes told you several times that she did not recognize the deceased he flipped back through his notebook youre right counselor ms blake has been helpful the dead man was james dugan jimmy the shotgun hes got a record longer than you are tall ms blake hes local muscle someone you call when you want it cheap and quick and dont care how messy it is he stared at me while he talked studying my eyes i blinked at him do you know anyone who would want you dead ms blake not right offhand i said he closed his notebook and stood im going to recommend justifiable homicide to the da i doubt youll see the inside of a courtroom when do i get my gun back i asked branswell stared at me when ballistics is done with it ms blake and id be damn grateful that youre getting it back at all he shook his head ive heard stories about you from some of the cops who answered the last call from your apartment the one with the two killer zombies he shook his head again dont take this wrong ms blake but have you considered moving to a new jurisdiction my landlord is probably going to suggest the same thing i said ill just bet he is branswell said counselor sergeant storr thanks for letting me sit in on this branswell dolph said you said she was one of yours besides i know gross and brady they were the first officers on scene for the zombies they say good things about her ive talked to half a dozen officers that say ms blake saved their butt or stood shoulder to shoulder with them under fire and didnt blink it cuts you a hell of a lot of slack blake but that slack isnt unlimited watch your back and try not to shoot up any innocent bystanders with that he left dolph stared down at me ill drive you back to your place richards waiting for me i said whats going on anita i told branswell everything i know catherine stood up anita has answered all the questions shes going to answer tonight hes a friend i said hes also a cop catherine said she smiled isnt that right sergeant storr dolph stared at her for a minute that is certainly true ms maisongillette he pushed away from the wall he looked at me ill talk to you later anita i know i said come on catherine said lets get out of here before they change their minds dont you believe me i asked im your lawyer of course i believe you i looked at her she looked at me i got up we left i wondered if richard would believe me probably not richard and i walked toward his car through the police station parking lot he hadnt said a word to me hed shaken hands with catherine and headed for the car he got into his side i slid into the passenger side richard started the engine and backed out of the parking slot youre mad about something i said he eased out onto the street he always drove carefully when he was angry what could i possibly be mad about the sarcasm was thick enough to eat with a spoon you think i knew there was a hit man in my apartment he flashed me a look that was pure rage you knew and you let me go inside and set that damned tv up you got me out of harms way i wasnt sure richard i bet you had your gun drawn before he fired i shrugged dammit anita you could have been killed but i wasnt thats your answer to everything if you survive its all right it beats the alternative i said dont make jokes richard said look richard i didnt go out hunting this guy he came to me why didnt you tell me and you would have done what go through the door first youd have taken a chest full of buckshot and survived how would you have explained that youd have been outed as a lycanthrope youd have lost your job at the very least we could have called the police and told them what that custard sniffed at the door if they had investigated theyd have gotten shot the guy was jumpy as hell he shot through the door remember he didnt know who he was firing at he turned onto olive shaking his head you should have told me what would it have changed richard except maybe youd have tried to play hero and if you survived youd have lost your career dammit dammit he smashed his hands into the steering wheel over and over when he looked at me his eyes had gone amber and alien i dont need you to protect me anita ditto i said silence filled the car like ice water nobody but the bad guy had died id done the right thing but it was hard to explain it wasnt that you risked your life richard said it was that you got rid of me before you did it you didnt even give me a chance i have never interfered with you doing your job would you have considered this part of my job closer to your job description than mine he said i thought about that for a minute youre right one of the reasons were still dating is you dont pull macho crap on me i apologize i should have warned you he glanced at me with eyes that were still pale and wolfish did i just win an argument i smiled i admitted i was wrong is that the same thing exactly the same thing then give yourself a point he grinned at me why cant i stay mad at you anita youre a very forgiving person richard one of us has to be he pulled into my parking lot for the third time that night you cant stay at your place tonight the door is in pieces i know if id been kicked out of my apartment because it was being painted i had friends i could stay with or a hotel but the bad guys had proven they didnt care who got hurt i couldnt risk anybody not even strangers in the next room at a hotel come home with me he said he parked in an empty space closest to the stairs i dont think thats a good idea richard the shotgun blast wouldnt have killed me id have healed because it wasnt silver shot how many of your other friends can say that not many i said quietly ive got a house set back in a yard you wont be risking innocent bystanders i know you have a yard richard ive spent enough sunday afternoons there then you know im right he leaned towards me and his eyes had bled back to their normal brown i have a guest room anita it doesnt have to be more than that i stared at him from inches away i could feel his body like a force just out of reach it wasnt his otherworldly wolf powers it was simply sheer physical attraction it was dangerous agreeing to go to richards house maybe not to my life but to other things if jimmy the shotgun had had a partner inside the apartment tonight id be dead now id been so busy concentrating on killing him that a second perp could have blown me away edward had told his contact no by now and it takes a little while to find another hitter of edwards caliber so instead of waiting they hired cheap and local taking the chance that cheap might take me out and theyd be saved several hundred grand or maybe they wanted me dead really quickly for some reason that i didnt understand either way they wanted me dead pretty damn badly usually when someone wants you dead that badly they succeed not tonight or tomorrow but unless edward and i could find out who had put the contract out on me the line of talent would just keep coming i stared into richards face almost close enough to kiss i thought about never seeing him again about never touching him again about never satisfying that growing hunger that perfumed the air whenever i was with him i touched his face lightly running my fingertips down his cheek okay you look so serious what are you thinking anita i leaned in and kissed him blood death and sex what else is there we got out of the car i filled my automatic fish feeder full of enough food for a week in a weeks time if the assassin was still after me and if i was still alive id have to come back all the bad guys had to do was stake out my fish tank and they had me if they were patient enough somehow i didnt think they would be i packed a few things including my stuffed toy penguin sigmund every weapon i owned a few clothes an outfit for tomorrows date with jeanclaude yeah probably i wouldnt be going but i didnt want to come back to the apartment not for anything i left a message on ronnies machine we usually worked out together on saturday morning but i didnt want ronnie in the line of fire she was a private detective but ronnie wasnt a shooter not like i was she had a certain respect for life that could get you killed richard waited while i changed black jeans a royal blue polo shirt white jogging socks with a blue stripe black nikes and i felt more myself i laid the brownings shoulder holster in my suitcase the browning was my main gun and i missed it id have missed it under normal circumstances but now my hand ached for the gun i guess thats what backup guns are for the firestar mm is a good gun and fits my hand well my hands are small enough that a lot of mms are just too big the browning was about the limit of a comfortable grip i wore the firestar in an interpants holster set for a forward cross draw which meant you could see the gun i wasnt sure i cared tonight i put on wrist sheaths and both knives these were the last two of a foursome that id had custom made for my hands with the highest silver content possible in the steel id had to have two of them replaced monsters ate them i put the two new knives in the suitcase still in their feltlined box they were pretty and sharp enough to cut your skin if you ran a thumb along the edge while i was having the lost knives replaced id ordered a new one it was nearly a foot long more a sword than a knife id had a leather harness made that let me carry it down my spine with the hilt under my hair i hadnt used it before but id seen it in a catalog and couldnt resist i had a derringer a sawedoff shotgun two fullsized pumpaction shotguns a twelve gauge and a miniuzi the derringer the uzi and the sawedoff shotgun were all gifts from edward not christmas or birthday gifts no wed be out hunting vampires together and hed give me a new toy id asked for the shotgun the fullsized shotguns wouldnt pack in either the suitcases or the gym bags i put them in their individual carrying cases with straps the gym bags held my vampire hunting kit and my zombie paraphernalia i put extra ammo in both bags for temporary keeping heck i shoved extra ammo in the suitcase too you could never have too much i caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror the gun was pretty obvious against the bright blue of the shirt i finally put a black jacket over it what they call a boyfriends jacket because its sort of big through the shoulders and body the sleeves rolled back to expose the silky lining i liked the jacket and with one button fastened it hid the firestar though not completely youd still catch glimpses of it when i moved but maybe people wouldnt run screaming i felt naked without the browning which was kind of funny considering i had an uzi in my suitcase but hey i slept with the browning richard never said a word about the two shotguns maybe he would have complained about the rest if hed seen them but he picked up one suitcase put one gym bag over his shoulder one shotgun carrying case on the same shoulder and let me pick up my share can you carry both suitcases i asked yeah but im shocked you asked the last time i tried to carry something unasked you nearly handed me my head in a basket i want one hand free for my gun ah he said of course he took the other suitcase without another word he really is a very wise man mrs pringle stepped out of her door as we were leaving she had custard in her arms he growled briefly at richard and she hushed him i thought i heard you out here are you all right anita i glanced at the hole by her door im fine how bout you she hugged custard raising his tiny furry body near her face ill be all right are you going to be charged it doesnt look like it good she glanced at the suitcases one for clothes one for weapons where are you going i think im a little too dangerous to be around right now she searched my face like she was trying to read my mind how bad is this mess anita bad enough i said she gently touched my hair you be very careful out there i smiled always you take care of yourself too custard and i will take care of each other i petted custard rubbing his little fox ears i owe you a box of doggie treats furball he licked my hand with a tiny pink tongue when you can give me your new phone number she said when i can ill come back she smiled but her pale eyes stayed worried we left because we had to my imagination has always been too good for my own peace of mind i had a very clear image of mrs pringle splattered against the wall that lovely aging face blown away if she had opened the door at the wrong moment i wouldnt be imagining it too close too damn close richards house was a onestory halfbrick ranch it looked like a house for children and mommy baking cookies in the kitchen it wasnt even set that far back off the road but it had plenty of yard on either side and the backyard was an acre of woods you could look out both the sides and the back and not see a neighbor except in winter when the bare trees revealed distant glimpses across the valley from the front picture window you could see the corner of the next house half obscured by overgrown shrubs no one had lived in it the entire time id been visiting the place was a little isolated richard liked that and whether i did or not i needed it now the place looked like an invitation for an ambush but neighbors would have been cannon fodder most bad guys try not to take out innocent bystanders its not moral outrage just bad for business the cops tend to put the heat on if you waste a lot of bystanders richard hit the garage door opener and eased the mustang into the garage his four by four was already inside i followed him in my jeep i idled out on the street waiting for him to move the four by four out so i could put the jeep in parking my jeep out in front of his house seemed like making the bad guys job a little too easy he pulled out i pulled in he parked behind me in the driveway and walked into the garage i unloaded the suitcases and he hit the button by the interior door the door opened into the kitchen the walls were lined with hogarth prints of dogs and more modern hunting scenes a warner brothers canister set bugs to tweety bird sat on the offwhite cabinets the countertops were off white the cabinets light honey colored oak there were dishes draining on a towel by the sink even though richard had a dishwasher a glass a bowl a spoon hed washed his breakfast dishes before he left for work this morning id have poured water in them and left them in the sink of course i never ate breakfast richard walked through into the living room carrying one suitcase i followed carrying the suitcase with the weapons in it i also had the two gym bags the living room had deep forest green carpet and pale yellow walls cartoon lithographs took up the far wall the near wall was taken up with a wooden entertainment center that richard had built himself there was a largescreen tv a miniature stereo system that made mine sound like humming through a comb shelves of books and closed doors that hid part of his extensive video collection and a portion of his cds the rest of his books were in the basement set in shelves along every wall there were still boxes he hadnt unpacked because he ran out of shelf space there was a large couch and a heavy wood coffee table the couch was green and brown patterned with a yellow afghan thrown across it that his grandmother had made a small antique armoire sat against the far wall there was no other furniture in the room hed set the suitcase in the smaller bedroom it had a twin bed a nightstand and a lamp the walls the drapes and the coverlet where all white like he hadnt really decided what to do with the room yet i laid the gym bags on the bed put the suitcase on the floor and stared at it all my life sitting in little bags on the carpet seemed like there should have been more richard came up and hugged me from behind arms wrapping around my shoulders i think this is where im supposed to ask whats wrong but i know the answer already im sorry the bad guys invaded your house that was it exactly the bad guys were not supposed to come home with you it should have been against the rules i knew it wasnt it had happened before but not like this not where i knew i couldnt go back even when this was over i couldnt risk mrs pringle and my other neighbors again i turned in his arms and he loosened them so i could do it i hugged him around the waist how did you know that was exactly what was bothering me he smiled i love you anita thats not an answer he kissed me on the forehead yes it is he kissed me gently on the lips and stepped back im going to get out of this tie change into your jammies if you want to he left closing the door behind him i opened the door and called after him can i use the phone he answered from his bedroom make yourself at home i took that for a yes and went into the kitchen the phone was on the wall i got a card out of my fanny pack which id been forced to carry like a purse you couldnt fasten the jacket over the fanny pack and the open jacket would have shown off the gun the card was white with a number printed in black script nothing but the number i dialed and got edwards twentyfourhour answering service i left a message saying to call me asap and richards number richards answering machine sat on the counter connected by wires to the wallmounted phone the message light was blinking but it wasnt my machine so i didnt check it richard came into the kitchen his hair fell around his shoulders in tight foaming waves curlier from the french braid his hair was brown but light of almost any kind brought out golden highlights hints of bronze he was wearing a flannel shirt forest green with the sleeves rolled above his elbows showing the fine muscles in his forearms id seen the shirt before it was highquality flannel soft as a blanket to touch he had on jeans and no socks he padded barefoot towards me the phone rang it was nearly one oclock in the morning who else could it be but edward i m expecting a call i said help yourself i picked it up and it was edward what happened he asked i told him somebody wants you dead quick yeah when you said no they went out and bought some cheap local talent you get what you pay for edward said if thered been two of them edward i wouldnt be here you arent going to like my news how much worse could it get i asked i answered a message just before yours they upped the offer to five hundred thousand dollars if you were dead within twentyfour hours sweet jesus edward im not worth that kind of money they knew you blew away their hitter anita they knew the hit had failed how i asked i dont know yet im trying to find out whos putting up the money but itll take a little time the safeguards that keep me out of it protect the client too i was shaking my head back and forth why twentyfour hours for the hit somethings happening that they want you out of the way for something big but what you know what it is anita you may not be aware that you know but you do something worth this kind of money that you could put a stop to there cant be that many choices i cant think of a single thing edward think harder he said ill be there as early as i can tomorrow watch your back dont drive your car why not bombs he said bombs i repeated for half a million dollars anita theyll get someone good a lot of professionals will do you from a nice safe distance a bomb a highpowered rifle youre scaring me i said good maybe youll be careful im always careful edward i apologize youre right but be more careful i didnt expect them to try a local hit youre worried i said he was quiet for a second we can keep taking out the hitters but eventually weve got to get to the man with the money as long as the contracts out there somebodyll keep taking it its just too much damn money to pass up i said a lot of professionals wont take a hit with a time limit on it he said some of the best are out of the running because of the deadline i wont take a hit with special circumstances i hear a but coming up i said he laughed quietly for half a million dollars people will break their rules not comforting i said not meant to be he said ill be at richards tomorrow early do you know where it is i could find it but lets not play games give me directions i did i would tell you to stay indoors but youve been dating richard for months a good hitter will be able to find you i dont know if youre safer inside or on the move ill pack extra firepower and be more paranoid than usual good see you tomorrow he hung up and i was left holding the buzzing phone richard was staring at me did i hear you say twentyfour hours for the hit i hung up the phone im afraid so i hit the message button on his machine out of habit it whirred as it rewound why for gods sake richard asked i wish i knew you mentioned money twice how much i told him he sat down in one of the kitchen chairs looking shocked couldnt blame him anita dont take this wrong to me youre worth any amount of money but why would somebody pay half a million dollars to kill you for someone who knew nothing about assassins hed grasped the big question quite nicely i walked over to him i ran my fingertips through his hair edward says i must already know what the big event is that i wouldnt be worth this kind of money with this kind of deadline unless i was already intimate with the situation he looked up at me but you dont know do you not a clue he laid his hands on either side of my waist pulling me against him wrapping his arms completely around my waist the message machine clicked to life and made us both jump we laughed nervously not just from fear there was a heat to his eyes as he stared up at me that made me want to blush or kiss him i hadnt decided which two hangups his younger brother daniel sorry richard had canceled their rock climbing tomorrow i leaned towards richard his lips were the softest id ever kissed the taste of him was intoxicating how could i be thinking of giving him up the last message began playing richard this is stephen oh god pick up please pick up please be there we froze listening theyre trying to get me to do one of those movies raina wont let me leave richard where are you theyre coming ive got to go oh god richard the phone clicked dead a mechanical voice said end of messages richard stood up and i let him i thought raina had stopped making pornographic movies i said she promised not to make snuff films that was all he replayed the message the time on it was thats less than an hour ago i said i cant leave you alone here tonight what if another killer comes he paced in a tight circle but i cant abandon stephen ill go with you i said he shook his head walking for the bedroom i can survive the games that the pack plays anita youre human theyll tear you up theyll tear you up too richard he just kept walking i can handle myself are you at least going to call some of the pack thats on your side get some backup he sat down on his bed pulling on socks he glanced up at me then shook his head if i take my army thisll turn into a war people will get killed but if you go in alone you only endanger yourself is that it he glanced up at me exactly i shook my head and what happens to stephen if you go out there and get killed who rescues him that stopped him for a second he frowned fishing his shoes out from under the bed they wont kill me why not i asked because if marcus kills me outside the challenge circle he doesnt retain leadership of the pack its like cheating the pack would turn on him what if you accidentally died in a fight with someone else he was suddenly very interested in tying his shoes i can handle myself meaning if someone else kills you in a legitimate fight marcus is off the hook right he stood up i guess raina is marcuss mate richard shes afraid youre going to kill him this is a trap he shook his head stubbornly if i call in the wolves on my side and we go over there in a mass theyll be slaughtered if i go over there alone i may be able to talk my way through it i leaned against the doorjamb and wanted to yell at him but bit it back im going with you richard you have enough problems of your own stephen risked his life to save mine once i owe him if you want to play politician fine but i want stephen safe going out where the assassin can find you isnt a smart idea anita weve been dating for months richard if a professional assassin hits town it wont take him long to find me here he glared at me jaw tight enough that i could see the small muscle on the side youll kill someone if i take you only if they need killing he shook his head no killing even to save my own life even to save stephens he looked away from me then back anger turning his dark eyes almost black of course you can defend yourself then im coming all right for stephens sake he didnt like saying it ill get my jacket i got the miniuzi out of the suitcase it was amazingly small i could have shot it with one hand but for accuracy i needed two though accuracy and machine guns were sort of mutually exclusive you pointed it a little lower than you meant to hit and held on silver ammo of course i slid the strap over my right shoulder it had a little clip that attached to my belt at the small of my back the clip kept the uzi from sliding all over the place but left enough play for me to slide the gun out and fire it the gun rode at the small of my back which was irritating but no matter what i told richard i was scared and i wanted at least two guns with me the police had the browning i didnt have a holster big enough for the sawedoff not to mention it was illegal come to think of it wasnt the machine gun i had a permit to own it but they didnt hand out carry permits for fully automatic weapons not to civilians anyway if i got caught with it i might be going to court after all i put the jacket on and whirled around the jacket was bulky enough that it didnt show amazing the firestar was more noticeable in its frontdraw holster my pulse was beating hard enough that i could feel it thrumming against my skin i was scared richard was going to play politics with a bunch of werewolves shapeshifters didnt play politics much they just killed you but i owed stephen and i didnt trust richard to save him id do whatever it took to see him safe richard wouldnt richard would hesitate it would almost surely get him killed one day tonight for the first time i realized it might get me killed no way should we walk into one of rainas little shows without more people no way jeanclaude would never have tolerated raina and marcuss games theyd be dead by now and wed all be safe i would have trusted jeanclaude at my back tonight he wouldnt flinch of course hed have brought his own little army of vampires and made it a true battle the shit could hit the fan tonight and be over before morning richards way wed rescue stephen survive escape and raina would still be alive nothing would be settled it may have been civilized but it was a bad way to stay alive richard was waiting by the front door keys in hand impatient couldnt blame him stephen didnt say where he was do you know where they make the films yeah i looked a question at him raina took me to watch the filming a few times she thought id overcome my shyness and join in you didnt it wasnt a question of course not lets go get stephen he held the door for me and just this once i didnt tell him not to i expected richard to drive into the city to some disreputable warehouse in a seedy section of town instead he drove further into jefferson county we drove down old highway between soft rolling hills silvered in the moonlight it was early may and the trees were already thick with leaves woods hugged the sides of the road an occasional house would break out of the trees but for the most part we were alone in the dark as if the road stretched out forever and no other human had ever set foot on it whats the plan i asked richard glanced at me then back to the road plan yeah a plan if rainas there she wont be alone and she wont like you taking stephen rainas the alpha female the lupa im not allowed to fight her why not an alpha male becomes ulfric wolf king by killing the old leader but the winner chooses the lupa so raina didnt have to fight for her place she didnt have to fight to be lupa but she did have to fight to be the most dominant female in the pack you once told me that the pack considers me a dominant whats the difference between being a dominant and being an alpha female i mean can i be an alpha alpha is the equivalent to being a master vampire sort of he said so what is a dominant anyone not pack not lukoi thats earned our respect jeanclaude is a dominant he cant be more unless he becomes pack so youre alpha but youre not pack leader we have about half a dozen alphas male and female i was marcuss second in command his freki freki is the name of one of odins wolves why would second wolf be named after something out of mythology the pack is very old anita among ourselves we are the lukoi there can be two seconds freki and geri why the history lesson and the new vocabulary to outsiders we keep it simple but i want you to know who and what we are lukoi is greek right he smiled but do you know where its from no king lykaon of arcadia was a werewolf he didnt try and hide it we call ourselves the lukoi in his memory if youre not freki anymore what are you fenrir challenger the giant wolf that kills odin at ragnarok im impressed not many people would know that two semesters of comparative religion i said can a woman be ulfric yes but its rare why theyd have to win a knockdown dragout physical battle all the power in the world wont stop someone from pounding your face into the ground i would have liked to argue but i didnt he was right not because i was female small men get their asses kicked too size matters if both people are equally well trained why dont the female alphas have to duke it out to win the top spot because the ulfric and his lupa are a mating pair anita he doesnt want to get stuck with a woman he cant stand i looked at him wait a minute youre next in line to lead the pack if you succeed marcus do you have to sleep with your lupa technically yes technically i said i wont choose one i wont sleep with someone just so the pack can feel secure glad to hear it i said but does that jeopardize your standing in the pack he took a deep breath and i heard it sigh outward i have a lot of support among the pack but some of them are bothered by my morals they think i should pick a mate and you wont because of me he glanced at me thats a big part of it it wouldnt be only one time anita an alpha couple binds for life its like a marriage they usually marry each other in real life not just in the pack i can see why the pack leader gets to pick his mate ive picked my mate richard said but im not a werewolf no but the pack considers you a dominant only because i killed a few of them i said well that does tend to impress them he slowed down there was a line of pine trees along the lefthand side of the road too regular and too thick to be natural he turned down a gravel driveway in the middle of them the driveway curved downhill and at the bottom of a shallow valley was a farmhouse hills thick with trees poured out around the house if there had ever been fields the forest had reclaimed them the driveway opened into a small gravel lot that was crowded with cars at least a dozen of them richard jerked the car into park and was out the door before i could unbuckle my seat belt i had to run to catch up and was at his back just as he flung open the barn door there was a thick wall of cloth hanging inside the door not a curtain but more a barrier richard pulled it aside and light flooded out around us he stalked into that light and i trailed after him there were lights everywhere hanging from the rafters like large ugly fruit about twenty people stood around the open interior of the barn two cameras were trained on a set made up of two walls and a kingsize bed two cameramen were sort of draped on the cameras waiting a long table thick with takeout bags and cold pizza was set near the entrance over a dozen people were clustered around the food they glanced at us as we entered a handful of humans looked hurriedly away and began inching back the lycanthropes stared their eyes almost motionless intent i suddenly knew what it must feel like to be a gazelle near a lion pack at least twothirds of the people in the barn were shapeshifters probably they werent all werewolves i couldnt tell what animal they might be by looking but i knew they were all shapeshifters their energy burned through the air like a hint of lightning even with the uzi if things went wrong i was in trouble i was suddenly angry with richard we shouldnt have come alone like this it was too careless for words a woman stepped out of the group she had what looked like an industrialstrength makeup kit on her shoulder her dark hair was shaved close to her head leaving a very pretty face open and clean without a drop of makeup on it she moved uncertainly towards us as if afraid shed get bitten the air vibrated around her a tiny shimmer as though reality was just a little less firm than it should be around her lycanthrope i wasnt sure what flavor but that really didnt matter whatever the flavor they were dangerous richard she said she stepped away from the watching crowd small hands running up and down the strap of her bag what are you doing here you know why im here heidi he said wheres stephen they arent going to hurt him she said i mean his brothers here his own brother wouldnt let him get hurt would he sounds like youre trying to convince yourself not us i said her eyes flicked to me you must be anita blake she glanced behind at the watchers at her back please richard just go the aura of energy around her was vibrating harder almost a visible shimmer in the air it prickled along my skin like ants richard reached out towards her heidi flinched but stood her ground richard smoothed his hand just above her face not quite touching her skin as he moved his hand the energy around her quieted like water calming its all right heidi i know the situation marcus has put you in you want to join another pack but he has to give permission to get his permission you do what he says or youre trapped whatever happens i wont hold it against you the anxiety seeped away her otherworldly energy quieted until it was barely there at all she might have passed for human very impressive a man stepped forward he was at least six foot four maybe an inch taller his head bald as an egg only his eyebrows showing dark above pale eyes his black tshirt strained over the muscles in his arms and chest as if the shirt was the skin of an insect about to split and let loose the monster energy boiled off him like summer heat he moved with the confident strut of a bully and the power crawling over my skin said he might be able to back it up hes new i said this is sebastian richard said he joined us after alfred died hes marcuss new enforcer heidi whispered she stepped back halfway between the two men her back to the curtain wed entered through i challenge you richard i want to be freki just like that the trap was sprung we are both alpha sebastian we dont have to do anything to prove that i want to be freki and i need to beat you to do it im fenrir now sebastian you can be marcuss freki without fighting me marcus says no says i have to go through you richard took a step forward dont fight him i said i have to answer challenge i stared at sebastian richard is not a small man but he looked small beside sebastian richard wouldnt back down to save himself but for someone else and if you get killed where does that leave me i asked he looked at me then really looked at me he turned back to sebastian i want safe passage for anita sebastian grinned and shook his head shes dominant no safe passage she takes her chances like the rest of us she cant accept challenge shes human when youre dead well make her one of us sebastian said raina has forbidden us to make anita lukoi heidi said the glare that sebastian gave her made her cringe against the curtain door her eyes were round with fear is that true richard asked its true sebastian growled we can kill her but we cant make her pack he grinned a brief flash of teeth so well just kill her i drew the firestar using richards body to shield the movement from the lycanthropes we were in trouble even with the uzi i couldnt kill them all if richard would kill sebastian we might salvage the situation but hed try not to kill him the other shapeshifters watched us with patient eager eyes this had been the plan all along there had to be a way out i had an idea are all marcuss enforcers assholes sebastian turned to me was that an insult if you have to ask then indeedydo it was anita richard said low and careful what are you doing defending myself i said his eyes widened but he didnt take his glance from the big werewolf richard understood there was no time to argue about it sebastian took a step forward big hands balled into fists he tried to step around richard to get to me richard moved in front of him he put out his hand palm outward like he had with heidi and that roiling energy damped down spilling out like water from a broken cup id never seen anything like it calming heidi was one thing forcing a lycanthrope to swallow such power was something else sebastian took a step back almost a stagger you bastard you are not strong enough to challenge me sebastian dont ever forget that richard said his voice was still calm with the barest hint of anger underneath it was a reasonable voice a voice for negotiating i stood behind richard with the firestar held at my side as unobtrusive as i could make it the fight was off and my little show of bravado hadnt been needed id underestimated richards power id apologize later now where is stephen richard asked a slender black man stalked towards us moving like a dancer in a shimmering wash of his own energy his hair was braided in shoulderlength cornrows with colored beads worked into them his features were small and neat his skin a rich solid brown you may be able to control us one at a time richard but not all at once you were kicked out of your last pack for being a troublemaker jamil richard said dont make the same mistake twice i wont marcus will win this fight because you are a fucking bleeding heart you still dont get it richard we arent the young republicans jamil stopped about eight feet back we are a pack of werewolves and we arent human unless you accept that you are going to die sebastian stepped back to stand beside jamil the rest of the lycanthropes moved up behind the two men their combined energy flowed outward filling the room like warm water with piranha in it the power bit along my skin like tiny electric shocks it rose in my throat until it was hard to breathe and the hair on my head stood at attention will you be pissed if i kill some of them i asked my voice sounded squeezed and harsh i moved closer to richard but had to step back his power poured over me like something alive it was impressive but there were twenty lycanthropes on the other side and it wasnt that impressive a scream shattered the silence and i jumped anita richard said yeah go get stephen that was him screaming i asked go get him i looked at the mass of lycanthropes and said you can handle this i can hold them you cant hold us all jamil said yes richard said i can the scream sounded again higher more urgent the sound came from deeper in the barn where it had been divided into rooms there was a makeshift hallway i started towards it then hesitated will you be pissed if i kill people do what you have to do he said his voice had grown low with an edge of growl to it if she kills raina with a gun she still wont be your lupa jamil said i glanced at richards back i hadnt known i was being considered for the job go anita now his voice was dying down to a growl he didnt have to add hurry i knew that part he might be able to stall but he couldnt fight them all heidi walked towards me behind richards back he didnt turn any attention to her as if he didnt consider her a danger at all she wasnt powerful but you didnt have to be powerful or even strong to stab someone in the back claw or knife what did it matter i pointed the gun at her she passed within inches of richard and he did nothing my gun was the only thing guarding his back even now he trusted heidi right this minute he shouldnt have trusted anyone but me gabriels with raina she said she said his name like she was afraid of him gabriel wasnt even a member of the pack he was a wereleopard he was one of rainas favorite actors though hed appeared in her porno flicks and even one snuff film i almost asked her who she feared most raina or gabriel but it didnt matter i was about to confront them both thanks i said to heidi she nodded i went for the hallway and the sound of screams i entered the hallway and followed the sounds of voices to the second door on the left i heard at least two different male voices soft murmuring i couldnt make out the words the screams changed to yelling stop please stop no it was a man too unless they were torturing more than one person tonight it had to be stephen i took a deep breath let it out and reached for the door with my left hand gun in my right i wished i knew the layout of the room stephen yelled please dont enough i opened the door shoving it against the wall so id know there was no one behind it i meant to sweep the room but what i saw on the floor stopped me cold like some kind of flashfrozen nightmare stephen lay on his back a white robe open revealing his nude body blood trailed down his chest in thin scarlet ribbons though there were no apparent wounds gabriel held stephens arms pinned underneath his body behind his back as if they might already be tied stephens waistlength yellow hair spilled over gabriels leatherclad lap gabriel was naked from the waist up a silver ring through his right nipple his curly black hair had spilled over his eyes and when he looked up at me he looked blind a second man knelt on the far side of stephen curling blond hair fell to his waist he wore an identical white robe fastened when he looked at the door his slender nearly pretty face was a mirror of stephens had to be his brother he was holding a steel knife he was in midslice when i came through the door fresh blood welled from stephens skin stephen screamed there was a naked woman curled over stephens body she straddled his lower body pinning his legs her long auburn hair fell like a curtain hiding the last indignity from sight raina raised her head from stephens groin her full lips parted in a smile shed worked him to erection even with his protests his body had gone on without him it took a heartbeat to see it all a sort of slowmotion shorthand i sensed movement to my right and tried to turn but it was too late something furred and only halfhuman slammed into me i hit the far wall hard enough to make it shudder the firestar went spinning and i fell stunned to the floor a wolf the size of a pony loomed over me it opened jaws big enough to crush my face and growled a sound low and deep enough to stop my heart i could move again but that face was an inch from my cheek i could feel its breath on my face a line of saliva fell from its mouth to glide down the edge of my mouth it lowered its muzzle that last inch lips drawn back like it was going to take a nibble the uzi was pinned between my back and the wall i went for one of the knives and knew id never make it human arms curved around the wolf tore it back away from me raina stood holding the struggling wolf like it was no effort her beautiful naked body rippled with muscles that didnt show until they were used draw no blood from her i told you that she tossed the wolf into the other wall the wall cracked and buckled the wolf lay still eyes rolled back into its skull it gave me the time i needed i pulled the uzi around on its strap when raina turned back to me i was pointing it at her she stood over me naked perfect slender where she was supposed to be slender curved where she was supposed to be curved but since id seen her sculpt her body at will i wasnt that impressed when you could manipulate your body like she could who needed plastic surgery i could have let her kill you anita you dont seem very grateful i sat on the floor propped against the wall not completely trusting that i could stand yet but the uzi was pointed nice and steady thanks a lot i said now back up slowly or i will cut you in half raina laughed a low joyous sound you are so dangerous so exciting dont you think so gabriel gabriel came to stand beside her both of them looking down at me was too much so i used the wall to brace myself and stood i could stand great i was beginning to think i could even walk better back up i said gabriel stepped around her bringing him almost close enough to have reached out and touched me shes perfect for anyone whos into pain and has a death wish he reached out as if to run his fingers down my cheek i pointed the machine gun at his waist because it would kick upward aim too high and you can actually miss the last time you pushed me gabriel all i had on me was a knife you survived having me gut you but even you cant heal from a submachine gun burst at this range ill cut you in half would you really kill me just for trying to touch you he seemed amused his strange grey eyes almost fever bright as they peered out of the tangle of his hair after what i just saw you bet i stood away from the wall back up or well find out how much damage you can take they backed up i was almost disappointed the uzi with silver ammo would do exactly what id said it would do i could cut them down kill them no muss no fuss just a hell of a mess i wanted them dead i looked at them for a heartbeat and thought about it thought about pulling the trigger and saving us all a lot of trouble raina backed up pulling gabriel with her she stared at me as she moved back towards the wall where the ponysized wolf was staggering to its feet raina looked at me and i saw the knowledge on her face of how close shed come i think until that moment she hadnt realized i could kill her and not lose sleep hell leaving her alive would cost me more sleep a roaring scream came from the other room howling vibrated through the barn there was a moment of breathless silence then growls shrieks the floor shuddered with the impact of distant bodies richard was fighting without me raina smiled at me richard needs you anita go to him well take care of stephen no thanks richard could be dying while you waste time fear flowed over me in a cool wash she was right theyd lured him here to die i shook my head richard told me to get stephen and thats what im going to do i didnt think you took orders that well she said i take the ones i like stephen had curled onto his side pulling the robe over his body his brother sat beside him smoothing his hair and murmuring its all right stephen youre not hurt you sliced him up you son of a bitch he spread stephens robe exposing his chest stephen tried weakly to close his robe his brother slapped his hands lightly he wiped his hands across the bloody chest the skin was perfect the cut had healed already which meant that all the blood was stephens get off of him right now or i will blow you away he eased back from him eyes wide he believed me that was good because it was true come on stephen weve got to go he raised his head and looked at me tears sliding down his cheeks i cant stand he tried to crawl to me but collapsed on the floor what did you give him i asked something to relax him raina said you bitch she smiled exactly go over and stand by them i said to the brother the man turned a face to me so like stephens it was startling i wouldnt let them hurt him hed enjoy it if hed just let himself go he is hurt you son of a bitch now get over there right now or ill kill you do you understand me i will kill you and be happy about it he got to his feet and went to stand beside gabriel i made sure no one hurt him he said softly the walls shuddered there was a sound of splintering wood someone had been thrown through the wall of the room next to us i had to get us out of there i had to get to richard but if i was careless id never make it richard wasnt the only one in danger of getting his throat ripped out with this many lycanthropes in a room so small they were too close they could jump me if i went to help stephen stand but with a machine gun in my hand i was betting most of them would be dead before they reached me it was a comforting thought i spotted the firestar in the far corner i picked it up and holstered it without having to look practice practice practice i kept the machine gun out it just made me feel better i knelt by stephen without taking my eyes off the others it was hard not to at least glance down but i was too damn close to them the wolf had been unbelievably fast and i didnt think raina would save me a second time i was lucky she didnt want me wounded i got my arm around stephens waist and he managed to throw his arms around my neck i stood and he was almost dead weight but we both managed to stand and with my help stephen kept his feet i was glad he was about my size bigger would have been harder his robe flapped open and he took one arm from around my shoulders and tried to tie it closed but he couldnt do it he started to take his other arm off my shoulders leave it stephen please weve got to go now i dont want people to see me he stared at me from inches away his face vague and unfocused from the drugs but a single tear trailed from the corner of one cornflower blue eye please he said shit i braced him around the waist and said go ahead i stared at raina while he tied his robe clumsy and slow from the drug shed slipped him he was making a low whimpering sound deep in his chest by the time he got it closed in some ways you are as sentimental as richard she said but you could kill us all of us even stephens brother and feel nothing i met her honey brown eyes and said id feel something what she asked safer i said i backed us towards the open door and had to glance behind to make sure nothing was coming up at me when i looked back at them gabriel had moved forward but raina had a hand on his arm stopping him she was looking at me like shed never really seen me before like id surprised her i guess it was mutual id known she was twisted but not in my wildest dreams would i have accused her of raping one of her own people stephen and i stepped out into the hall and i took a deep breath feeling something in my chest loosen the sounds of fighting crashed over us i wanted to run towards the fight richard was alive or they wouldnt have still been fighting there was time there had to be i called to raina dont show your face out here until after were gone raina or ill shoot it off there was no answer from the room i had to get to richard stephen stumbled and nearly took us both down he hung from my shoulders his arms pressing into my neck then he got his feet under him you with me stephen im all right just get me out of here his voice sounded weak thready like he was losing consciousness i could not carry him and shoot or at least i didnt want to try i got a firmer grip on his waist and said stay with me stephen and ill get you out he nodded long hair spilling around his face okay the one word was almost too soft to hear above the fighting i stepped out into the main room and it was chaos i couldnt see richard there was just a mass of bodies arms legs a clawed form rose above the rest a manwolf close to seven feet tall he reached down and drew richard out of the mess claws digging into his body richard shoved a hand that was too long to be human and not furry enough to be wolf under the werewolfs throat the creature gagged spitting blood a wolf almost as long as richard was tall leapt upon his back richard staggered but didnt fall the mouth sank teeth into his shoulder furred claws and human hands grabbed at him from every side fuck it i fired the machine gun into the wooden floor it would have looked more impressive if id fired into the overhead lights but bullets come down at the same speed they go up and i didnt want to catch my own ricochet holding the machine gun onehanded was a trip i held on and sprayed a line from me to the bed i ended with the gun pointing at the fight everyone had frozen shocked richard crawled out of the mess bleeding he got to his feet swaying a bit but moving on his own power i could never have carried both him and stephen let alone the machine gun he stopped in front of the curtain waiting for me to come to him stephen sagged against me arms limp i think hed passed out it was an agonizingly slow walk to richard if i tripped and went down theyd be on me they watched me move with eyes human and wolf but nothing i could have talked to they watched me like they wondered what id taste like and would enjoy finding out the giant manwolf spoke its furry jaws thick and strange around human words you cant kill us all human he was right i raised the machine gun a little true but whos going to be first in line no one else moved as i walked when i reached richard he took stephen from me cradling him in his arms like he was a child blood seeped down his face from a cut on his forehead it covered half his face like a mask stephen is never to come back here not ever richard said the manwolf spoke again you are not a killer richard that is your weakness even if we bring stephen back here you will not kill us for it you will hurt us but not kill us richard didnt say anything it was probably true damn ill kill you i said anita you dont understand what youre saying richard said i glanced at him then back to the waiting masses killing is all they understand richard if you arent willing to kill them stephen isnt safe i want him safe enough to kill for it richard asked yeah i said enough to kill for it the wolfman stared at me you are not one of us it doesnt matter stephen is off limits tell raina if he gets dragged back here ill hold her personally responsible tell me yourself raina stood in the hallway naked and totally comfortable as if shed been wearing the finest silk gabriel was at her back if anyone brings stephen back here tries to force him into the movies ill kill you even if i have nothing to do with it i smiled like i would believe that even if no matter who does it or why itll be your ass on the line she nodded her head almost a bow so be it anita blake but know this you have challenged me in front of my pack i cannot let that stand unanswered if you were another shapeshifter we would duel but your being human poses a problem you know this bitch i am human so if you expect me to drop my gun and fight you one on one youre crazy that would hardly be fair would it i didnt think you worried much about being fair after what i saw in the back room oh that she said stephen will never rise in the pack there is no more challenge to him he is anyones meat that is higher in the pack not anymore i said you offer him your protection she asked id been asked this question once before and knew it meant more than it sounded like it did but i didnt care i wanted stephen safe and id do what it took killing or making myself a target hell the assassin would probably finish me soon anyway yeah hes under my protection hes already under my protection anita richard said until youre willing to kill to back it up it doesnt mean a whole lot to these people you will kill to support richards claims of protection raina asked she doesnt understand what youre asking richard said it isnt a fair question unless she understands it then explain it to her richard but not tonight it grows late and if we are to get any filming done we must hurry take your little human and explain the rules to her explain how deep a hole shes dug herself tonight when she understands the rules call me and i will think of a way to make a duel between us as fair as possible perhaps i could blindfold myself or tie one arm behind my back i started to say something but richard said come on anita we have to go now he was right i could kill a lot of them but not all i hadnt brought a spare clip for the machine gun i hadnt thought id need it silly me we got out the door with me walking backwards ready to shoot anyone who stuck a head out no one followed us richard carried stephen through the late spring night and didnt look back as if he knew they wouldnt follow i opened the door and he laid stephen in the backseat can you drive home he asked yeah how bad are you hurt not bad but id like to ride back here with stephen in case he wakes up i couldnt argue with that i drove we were safe we were all actually still alive but if theyd rushed us we wouldnt be now that we were safe i could be mad well we survived no thanks to your little plan i said and no one died thanks to my little plan richard said only because i was better armed than usual you were right he said it was a trap happy yeah im happy i said glad to hear it underneath the sarcasm he was tired i could hear it in his voice what are you supposed to explain to me richard i glanced in the rearview mirror but couldnt see his face in the dark raina backs up marcuss orders shes his lupa he uses her to do things he doesnt approve of like torture so i set myself up as your lupa yes im the fenrir normally id already have a lupa picked out the pack is divided anita ive given my protection to my followers so that if marcus tries to hurt them i come after him or my followers will act to protect each other with my blessing without a fenrir or a pack leader to back you up its a sort of mutiny to go against the pack leaders orders whats the penalty for mutiny death or mutilation i thought you guys could heal anything short of a death wound not if you shove burning metal into it fire purifies and stops the healing process unless you reopen the wound it works that way with vampires too i said i didnt know that he said but not like he really cared how have you risen to next in line to lead and not killed anyone you had to fight a lot of duels to get to the top of the heap only the fight for ulfric has to be to the death all i had to do was beat them all which is why you take karate and lift weights so youll be good enough to beat them wed had this discussion before when i asked if lifting weights when you could bench press a small car was redundant hed replied not if everyone youre fighting can lift a car too he had a point yes but if you wont kill then your threat doesnt have much bite no pun intended were not animals anita just because this is the way its always been in the pack doesnt mean things cant change we are still people and that means we can control ourselves dammit there has to be a better way than slaughtering each other i shook my head dont blame it on the animals real wolves dont kill each other for dominance only werewolves he said he sounded tired i admire your goals richard but you dont agree no i dont agree his voice came from the darkness out of the backseat stephen doesnt have any wounds why was he screaming my shoulders hunched and i made myself sit up straight i turned onto old highway and tried to think of a delicate way to tell him but there was nothing delicate about rape i told him what id seen the silence from the backseat lasted a very long time i was almost to the turnoff for his house when he said and you think if id killed a few people along the way this wouldnt have happened i think theyre more afraid of raina and marcus than they are of you so yeah if you back my threat with killing it undermines everything ive tried to do i love you richard and i admire what youre trying to do i dont want to undermine you but if they touch stephen again ill do what i said id do ill kill them theyre my people anita i dont want them dead theyre not your people richard theyre just a bunch of strangers that happen to share your disease stephen is your people every shapeshifter who threw their support to you and risked marcuss anger theyre your people theyve risked everything for you richard when stephen joined the pack i was the one who told raina she couldnt have him ive always stood by him your intentions are good richard but they didnt keep him safe tonight if i let you kill for me anita its the same as doing it myself i didnt ask your permission richard he leaned on the back of the seat and i realized he wasnt wearing his seat belt i started to tell him to put it on but didnt it was his car and he could survive a trip through the windshield you mean if they take stephen again youll kill them because you said youd kill them not for me a threats not worth anything if you arent willing to back it up i said youd kill for stephen why because he saved your life i shook my head it was hard to explain not just that when i saw him tonight what they were doing to him he was crying richard he was oh hell richard hes mine now there are a handful of people that id kill for kill to keep safe kill to revenge stephens name got added to the list tonight is my name on the list he asked he rested his chin on my shoulder over the seat he rubbed his cheek on my face and i could feel a faint beard stubble scratchy and real you know it is i dont understand how you can talk about killing so casually i know my bid for ulfric would be stronger if i were willing to kill but im not sure it would be worth it if you want to martyr yourself for high ideals fine i dont like it but fine but dont martyr the people who trust you theyre worth more than any set of ideals you nearly got yourself killed tonight you dont just believe in something when its easy anita killing is wrong fine i said but you also nearly got me killed tonight do you understand that if they had rushed us i wouldnt have made it out i will not go down in flames because you want to play gandhi you can stay home next time dammit that isnt what im saying and you know it youre trying to live in some ozzie and harriet world richard maybe life used to work like that but it doesnt anymore if you dont give up on this youre going to get killed if i really thought i had to become a murderer to survive i think id rather not survive i glanced at him his expression was peaceful like a saint but you only got to be a saint if you died i looked back at the road i could give richard up but if i left him he was going to end up dead hed have gone in there tonight without anyone and he wouldnt have made it out tears burned at the back of my eyes i dont know if id survive it if you died on me richard doesnt that mean anything to you he kissed my cheek and something warm and liquid seeped down my neck i love you too they were only words he was going to get killed on me he was going to do everything short of suicide youre bleeding on me i said he sighed and leaned back into the darkness im bleeding a lot too bad jeanclaude isnt here to lick it up he made a bitter sound low in his throat do you need a doctor get me home anita if i need a doctor i know a wererat that makes house calls he sounded tired weary as if he didnt want to talk anymore not about the wounds or the pack or his high ideals i let the silence grow and didnt know how to break it a soft sound filled the quiet dark and i realized that richard was crying he whispered im sorry stephen i am so sorry i didnt say anything because i didnt have anything good to say just lately i had noticed that i could kill people and not blink no attack of conscience no nightmares nothing it was like some part of me had turned off it didnt bother me that i was able to kill so easily it did bother me that it didnt bother me but it had its uses like tonight i think every last furry one of them had believed id do it sometimes it was good to be scary it was in the morning when richard carried the still unconscious stephen into his bedroom blood had dried the back of richards shirt to his skin go to bed anita ill take care of stephen i need to look at your wounds i said im all right richard he looked at me half of his face covered in dried blood his eyes almost wild no anita i dont want your help i dont need it i took in a deep breath through my nose and let it out okay have it your way i expected him to apologize for snapping at me but he didnt he just walked into the other room and closed the door i stood there in the living room for a minute not sure what to do id hurt his feelings maybe even offended his sense of male honor fuck it if he couldnt take the truth fuck him peoples lives were at stake i couldnt give richard comforting lies when it could get people killed i went into the guest room locked the door and went to bed i put on an oversized tshirt with a caricature of arthur conan doyle on it id packed something a little sexier yes i admit it i could have saved myself the trouble the firestar was lumpy under the pillow the machine gun went under the bed within reach i laid an extra clip beside it never thought id need that much firepower but between assassination attempts and packs of werewolves i was beginning to feel a little insecure when i shoved the silver knives half under the mattress so i could get to them if i had to i realized just how insecure i was feeling but i left the knives out better insecure and paranoid than dead i got my stuffed toy penguin sigmund out of the suitcase and cuddled under the covers id had some vague idea that spending the night at richards house might be romantic shows how much i knew wed had three fights in one night a record even for me it probably wasnt a good sign for the longevity of the relationship that last thought made my chest tight but what was i supposed to do go into the other room and apologize tell him he was right when he wasnt tell him it was okay to get himself killed and take the rest of us down with him it wasnt okay it wasnt even close to okay i hugged sigmund until he was nearly squeezed in two i refused to cry question why was i more worried about losing richard than about the assassins answer killing didnt bother me losing richard did i fell asleep holding my penguin and wondering if richard and i were still dating who would keep him alive if i wasnt around something woke me i blinked up into the dark and reached under my pillow for the firestar when it was secure in my hand i listened a knock someone was knocking at the locked bedroom door soft hesitant was it richard come to apologize that would be too convenient i threw back the covers spilling sigmund to the floor i put him back in the suitcase lowering the lid without closing it and padded barefoot to the door i stood to one side of it and said who is it its stephen i let out a breath i hadnt known i was holding i crossed to the other side of the door gun still ready and unlocked the door i opened it slowly looking listening trying to make sure it was just stephen he stood outside the door wearing a pair of richards cutoff sweat pants the shorts hung nearly to his ankles a borrowed tshirt covered his knees his long yellow hair was tousled like hed been asleep whats wrong i lowered the gun to my side and he watched me do it richard went out and im afraid to be alone his eyes wouldnt quite meet mine when he said the last flinching like he was afraid of what hed see on my face what do you mean he went out where to the woods he said hed keep watch for assassins does he mean raina he did look up then amazing blue eyes wide the beginnings of panic sliding across his face i touched his arm not sure it was the right thing to do some people dont want to be touched after a sexual molestation it seemed to comfort stephen but he glanced behind him at the empty living room rubbing his hands along his bare arms richard told me to stay in the house he said i needed to rest he wouldnt meet my eyes again im afraid to be alone anita i he hung his head long yellow hair spilling like a curtain to hide his face i cant get to sleep i keep hearing noises i put a finger under his chin and lifted his face gently are you asking to sleep in here with me his eyes stared at me wide and painfilled richard said i could run that by me again i said i told him i couldnt stand to be alone he said anitas here shell protect you go sleep with her he looked at me his face awkward something must have shown on my face youre mad now i dont blame you im sorry ill he started to turn away and i caught his arm its okay stephen im not mad at you richard and i had a disagreement thats all i didnt want him to sleep in here with me the bed was too small for two people and if i was going to share it with anyone id have preferred richard but that wasnt going to happen maybe not ever at the rate we were going you can stay in here i didnt add keep your hands to yourself his face was raw with a need that had nothing to do with sex he needed to be held to be told the monster under the bed wasnt really there i couldnt help him on the last the monsters were real but the first i might manage that coldblooded killer that i am maybe i could share my toy penguin with him could you get an extra pillow from richards room i asked he nodded and fetched it he clutched it to his chest like hed have rather slept with it than on it maybe the penguin wasnt such a bad idea i locked the door behind us i could have moved into richards room it was a bigger bed but it also had a picture window with a deck and bird feeders the guest room only had one small window easier to defend unless i wanted to go out a window they were both traps so we stayed in the more secure room besides id have had to move all the weapons and it would have been dawn before i finished i pulled the covers back and said you first if something came through the door i wanted to be the first to greet it but i didnt say that out loud stephen was jumpy enough he climbed into bed with his pillow pressing it against the wall because there really wasnt room for two fullsized pillows he lay on his back staring up at me his curling yellow hair falling around his face and bare shoulders like sleeping beauty you didnt see many men with hair longer than mine he was one of those men who was pretty rather than handsome lovely as a doll staring up at me with his blue eyes he looked about twelve the look on his face was what did it like he was expecting me to kick him and hed let me because he couldnt stop me i understood in that moment what raina had meant about him being anyones meat there was nothing dominant about stephen and it made me wonder about his background abused children will sometimes have that raw look to their eyes and theyll take abuse because its normal whats wrong stephen said id been staring nothing just thinking tonight was not the night to ask if his father had beat him i thought about throwing on a pair of jeans but it would have been uncomfortable not to mention hot it was late spring the heat hadnt set in it was only seventy degrees but it wasnt cool enough to wear jeans especially if you had someone else in bed with you besides i wasnt sure how stephen would take me getting dressed to lie down beside him maybe hed be insulted it was too complicated for me i turned off the light and climbed into bed beside him if either of us had been much bigger wed have never fit stephen had to roll onto his side as it was he curled against my back spooning his body against mine one arm flung across my waist like i was the stuffed toy i stiffened but stephen didnt seem to notice he buried his face into my back and let his breath out in a sigh i lay there in the dark and couldnt sleep two months ago after id nearly ended up a vampire id had trouble sleeping close brushes with death i could handle close brushes with becoming the undead that scared me but i got over it i was sleeping just fine thank you very much until now i pushed the button on my watch that made it glow it was only id had about an hours sleep great stephens breathing deepened and his body relaxed against me a muscle at a time he whimpered softly in his sleep arm convulsing around me then the dream passed and he lay still and warm i drifted off to sleep cuddling stephens arm around my body he was almost as good as a stuffed toy though he did have a tendency to move at the odd moment daylight spilled through the thin white drapes and at first i thought the light had awakened me i woke stiff in the same position that id fallen asleep in as if i hadnt moved at all during the night stephen was still curled around me a leg over my legs along with one arm like he was trying to get as close to me as he could even in his sleep i lay there for a moment with his body wrapped around me and realized id never awakened with a man before id had a fiancй in college and id had sex with him but id never spent the night id never actually slept in the same bed with a man it was kind of odd i lay in the circle of warmth of stephens body and wished it was richard i had a vague feeling that something had awakened me but what i eased out from the covers and stephens clinging body he rolled over on his other side sighing making small protesting noises i tucked the covers around him and took the firestar out from under my pillow according to my watch it was nearly id had about five hours of sleep i slipped on a pair of jeans got my toothbrush and some clean undies and socks out of the suitcase i folded everything in a clean polo shirt and unlocked the door i kept the firestar in my hand id put it on the top of the toilet while i cleaned up id have done the same thing at home someone passed in front of the door talking two voices one of them female i laid the clothes on the floor unclicked the safety on the gun and put my left hand on the doorknob was that the safety on a gun i heard a mans voice said from the other side of the door i recognized the voice i clicked the safety back in place put the gun down the front of my pants and slipped the tshirt over it armed but not visibly i opened the door jason stood there grinning at me he was about my height his blond hair was straight and baby fine and cut just above his shoulders his eyes were the innocent blue of spring skies but the look in them wasnt innocent he peered around me at stephen still curled up in the bed is it my turn next he asked i sighed picked up my clothes tucked them under my arm and closed the door behind me what are you doing here jason you dont sound happy to see me he was wearing a fishnet tshirt his jeans were faded and soft with one knee completely out he was twenty and had been a college student before hed joined the pack now he was jeanclaudes wolf and playing bodyguard and breakfast entree to the master vampire of the city seemed to be his only job isnt it a little early in the morning for fishnet wait until you see what im wearing to tonights gala opening of jeanclaudes dance club i may not be able to make it i said he raised his eyebrows you spend one night under richards roof and you break a date with jeanclaude he shook his head i dont think thats a good idea look neither of them own me okay jason backed up hands held up in mock surrender hey dont shoot the messenger you know it will piss jeanclaude off and you know hell think you slept with richard i didnt he glanced at the closed door i know that and i am shocked anita at your choice of bed partners when you tell jeanclaude that i slept with stephen you make absolutely sure he knows we just shared the bed and nothing else if jeanclaude gives stephen a hard time because of your word games ill be angry you dont want me angry jason he looked at me for a heartbeat or two something slid behind his eyes his beast stirring to life just a touch jason had a small streak of what gabriel had a big streak of a fascination with danger pain and simply being an all round pain in the ass jason was tolerable not a bad guy all in all gabriel was perverted but it was still the same personality flaw done small after what id seen last night i wondered what jason would have thought of the entertainment i was almost sure hed have disapproved but not a hundred percent sure which told you something about jason did you really draw a machine gun on raina and gabriel last night yeah i did a woman stepped out of richards bedroom with an armful of towels she was about five foot six with short brown hair so curly it had to be natural she wore navy slacks and a shortsleeved sweater opentoed sandals completed the outfit she looked me up and down sort of disapproving or maybe disappointed you must be anita blake and you are sylvie barker she offered a hand and i took it the moment i touched her skin i knew what she was are you with the pack i asked she took her hand back and blinked at me how could you tell if youre trying to pass for human dont touch someone who knows what theyre looking for your power prickles down my skin i wont waste time trying to pass then her power flooded over me pouring like a blast of heat when you open an oven door impressive i said glad my voice was steady she gave a small smile thats quite a compliment coming from you now ive got to get these towels to the kitchen whats happening i asked sylvie and jason exchanged glances she shook her head you knew richard was hurt she made it a question my stomach clenched tight he said hed be all right he will be she said i felt my skin go pale where is he kitchen jason said i didnt run it wasnt that far but i wanted to richard sat at the kitchen table shirtless his back to me his back was a mass of fresh claw marks there was a bite mark in his left shoulder where a piece of flesh was missing dr lillian was blotting blood off his back with a kitchen towel she was a small woman in her midfifties with saltandpepper hair cut in a short nononsense style shed treated my own wounds twice before once when she was furry and looked like a giant manrat if you had called for medical attention last night i wouldnt be having to do this richard i do not enjoy causing my patients pain marcus was on call last night richard said under the circumstances i thought it best to go without you could have let someone clean and bandage the wounds yes richard you could have let me help you i said he glanced back over his shoulder his hair spilling around his face there was a bandage on his forehead id had enough help for one night why because im a woman or because you know im right lillian took a small silver knife to the lower half of a claw mark she sliced the blade down the wound reopening it richard took in a deep breath and let it out what are you doing i asked lycanthropes heal but sometimes without medical attention we can scar most of the wounds will heal but a few of them are deep enough that he really needs some stitching before the skin starts to close so im having to reopen some of the wounds and add a few stitches sylvie handed dr lillian the towels thank you sylvie what are you two lovebirds fighting about sylvie asked let richard tell you if he wants to anita agrees with you richard said she thinks i should start killing people i walked over to where he could see me without straining i leaned against the cabinet island and tried to watch his face rather than lillians slicing knife i dont want you to start killing people indiscriminately richard just back your threat up kill one person and the rest will back down he glared up at me outraged you mean make an example of one of them put that way it sounded sort of coldblooded but truth was truth yeah thats what i mean oh i like her sylvie said i knew you would jason said they exchanged a glance that i didnt quite get but it seemed to amuse the hell out of them am i missing a joke here they both shook their heads i let it go richard and i were still fighting and i was beginning to think this fight had no end he winced as the doctor sliced open another wound she was only adding a stitch here and there but it was still more than id have wanted in my flesh i didnt like stitches no painkillers i asked anesthesia doesnt work well on us we metabolize it too quickly lillian said she wiped the silver knife on one of the clean towels and said one of the claw marks drops below your jeans take them off so i can see i glanced at sylvie she smiled at me dont mind me i like girls thats what you two were laughing about i said to jason he nodded smiling happily i shook my head the others will be here soon for the meeting i dont want my ass hanging out as everyone comes in the door richard stood up lets finish up in the bedroom there were a ring of puncture wounds just below his collarbone i remembered the manwolf lifting with its claws last night you could have been killed i said he glanced at me but i wasnt isnt that what you always say i hated having my own words fed back to me you could have killed sebastian or jamil and the rest wouldnt have jumped you youve already decided who i should kill his voice was thick with anger yeah i said shes actually making pretty good choices sylvie said richard turned his dark dark eyes to her you stay out of this if it was just a lovers quarrel richard i would she said she went to stand in front of him but anitas not saying anything that i havent said that most of us havent begged you to do for a few months i was willing to try it your way i hoped you were right but it isnt working richard either youre alpha male or youre not is that a challenge he asked his voice had grown very quiet power flowed through the room like a warm wind sylvie backed up a step you know its not do i he said the power in the room built growing like a flash of electricity the hairs on my arms stood to attention sylvie stopped backing up hands in fists at her sides if i thought i could defeat marcus id do it if i could protect us all i would but i cant do it richard youre our only chance richard loomed over her it wasnt just physical size his power flowed over her filled the room until it was almost chokingly close i wont kill just because you think i should sylvie no one is going to force me into it no one he turned his gaze on me and it took a lot to meet his eyes there was a force to them a burning weight it wasnt a vampires drowning power but it was something my skin shivered with his power his energy and i didnt turn away i stared at the wounds just below his neck and knew id come close to losing him that was unacceptable i walked closer until i could have reached out and touched him his otherworldly energy whirled over me until it was hard to draw a good breath we need to talk richard i dont have time for this right now anita make time i said he glared down at me talk to me while lillian finishes up ive got people coming over for a meeting in about fifteen minutes what meeting i asked to discuss the marcus situation sylvie said he scheduled the meeting before last nights adventure richard stared at her and it wasnt a friendly look if id wanted her to know about the meeting id have told her what else havent you told me richard he turned those angry eyes to me what havent you told me i blinked at him genuinely puzzled i dont know what youre talking about a shotgun fires over your head twice and you dont know what im talking about oh that i did the right thing richard youre always right arent you i looked at the floor and shook my head when i looked back at him he was still angry but i was losing my anger a first this was going to be the fight the one that ended it i wasnt wrong no amount of talking would change that but if we were going to break up wed go down in flames lets finish this richard you wanted to go into the bedroom he stood up body stiff with an anger that was deeper than i could comprehend it was controlled rage and i didnt understand where it was coming from it was a bad sign you sure you can stand to see me naked his voice was utterly bitter and i didnt know why whats wrong richard what did i do he shook his head too vigorously making him wince as his shoulder caught the movement nothing nothing he walked out of the room lillian looked at me but followed him i sighed and joined them i wasnt looking forward to the next few minutes but i wasnt going to chicken out wed say all the ugly things and make it as nasty as possible trouble was i didnt have any nasty things to say it made the fight a lot less fun for me jason whispered as i walked by very softly go anita go anita it made me smile sylvie watched me with cool eyes good luck it didnt sound completely sincere do you have a problem id have much rather fought with her than richard if he wasnt dating you then he might choose a mate it would help things you want the job i asked yes she said i do but sex is integral and im not up for it then im not standing in your way i said not in mine no she said which implied there were others but i didnt give a shit not today i said it is too damn early in the morning for furball politics if someone wants a piece of me tell them to go to the back of the line she cocked her head to one side like a curious dog is it a long line lately yeah i thought all your enemies were dead jason said i keep making new ones i said he smiled fancy that i shook my head and walked towards the bedroom id have rather faced raina again than richard i almost hoped the assassin would jump out of the woodwork and give me something to shoot at it would hurt less than breaking up with richard richards bedroom was painted pale green a vibrant rug thrown in front of the bed like a piece of stained glass the bed was a heavy fourposter and even hurt hed made the bed pulling the solid red spread up over it he had three solid spreads that he rotated on the bed green blue and red each color picked up a different color in the rug and the painting over the bed the painting was of wolves in a winter scene the wolves were looking directly out of the picture as if youd just come around a tree and surprised them there was a deer bleeding on the snow its throat torn out it was an odd choice for a bedroom but it fit somehow besides i liked it it had that quality that all fine paintings do as if when you leave the room the painting will move life suspended and captured on canvas the green spread emphasized the evergreens the blue spread caught the washed blue of the sky and the bluish shadows the red caught the stain of blood on the snow richard lay on his stomach across the crimson cloth he was totally nude his jeans thrown on the corner of the bed his tanned skin looked dark and smooth and incredibly touchable against the red cloth i felt heat rise up my face as my eyes followed the curve of his body over the smooth expanse of his buttocks lillian had just finished sewing up a curve of claw that had spilled down from his buttocks i looked away id seen richard nude once when i first met him but never since we hadnt even been thinking about dating then i had to look away mainly because i wanted to look i wanted to see him like that and it was too embarrassing for words i studied the contents of the builtin shelves on his bedroom wall like id memorize them bits of quartz a small birds nest there was a lump of fossilized coral as big as my hand a dark rich gold in color with streaks of white quartz id found it on a camping trip and given it to him because he collected bits and pieces and i didnt i touched the bit of coral and didnt want to turn around you said you wanted to talk then talk richard said i glanced back lillian snipped the black thread she was using to close his skin there she said you shouldnt even have a scar richard folded his arms on the bed resting his chin on his forearms his hair spread around his face foaming and touchable i knew it was as soft as it looked lillian glanced from one to the other of us i believe ill leave you two alone she began putting things into her bag which was brown leather and looked more like a fishing tackle box than anything else she looked at richard and back to me take a piece of advice from an old lady dont screw up she left with richard and me both staring after her you can get dressed now i said he glanced at his crumpled jeans moving only his dark eyes his eyes came back to me and they were as angry as id ever seen them why i concentrated on meeting those angry eyes and tried not to stare at his body it was harder than i would have admitted out loud because its hard to fight with you when youre naked he raised up on his elbows hair falling down into his eyes until he stared at me through a curtain of brown gold hair it reminded me of gabriel and that was unnerving as hell i know you want me anita i can smell it oh that made me feel better i blushed for the second time in five minutes so youre gorgeous so what what the hell does that have to do with anything he raised up on all fours knees and hands i looked away so fast it made me dizzy please put on your jeans i heard him slide off the bed you cant even look at me can you there was something about the way he said it that made me want to see his face but i couldnt turn around i just couldnt if this was the last fight we ever had i didnt want the memory of his body imprinted on my mind it would be too cruel i felt him standing behind me what do you want from me richard look at me i shook my head he touched my shoulder and i jerked away you cant even stand for me to touch you can you for the first time i heard pain in his voice raw and hurting i turned then i had to see his face his eyes glittered with unshed tears eyes wide so they wouldnt fall hed pushed his hair back from his face but it was already spilling forward my eyes traveled down his muscular chest and i wanted to run my hands over his nipples down his slender waist and lower i drew my eyes back up to his face with force of will alone my face pale now rather than blushing i was having trouble breathing my heart was beating so hard it was hard to hear i love it when you touch me i said he stared down at me his eyes filled with pain i think i preferred the anger i used to admire you for saying no to jeanclaude i know you want him and you keep refusing i thought it was very moral of you he shook his head one tear slid from the corner of his eye trailing in slow motion down his cheek i brushed the tear from his face with my fingertip he caught my hand in his holding it a little too hard but not hurting only surprising it was also my right hand and drawing the gun lefthanded was going to be a bitch not that i really thought id need the gun but he was acting so strangely richard spoke staring down at me but jeanclaudes a monster and you dont sleep with monsters you just kill them tears slid from both of his eyes and i let them fall you dont sleep with me either because im a monster too but you can kill us cant you anita you just cant fuck us i jerked away from him and he let me he could have bench pressed the heavy cherry wood bed so he let me go i didnt like that much that was an ugly thing to say but its true he said i want you richard you know that you want jeanclaude too so thats not very flattering you tell me to kill marcus like it would be easy do you think it wouldnt bother me to kill him because hes a monster or because i am richard i said this was an argument i hadnt seen coming i didnt know what to say but i had to say something he was standing there with tears drying on his face even nude and gorgeous he looked lost i know it would bother you to kill marcus i never said it wouldnt i said then how can you urge me to do it i think its necessary i said could you do it could you just kill him i thought about that for a moment then nodded yeah i could and that wouldnt bother you he asked i stared straight at him looked him right in his painfilled eyes and said no if you really mean that it makes you a bigger monster than i am yeah i guess it does he shook his head it doesnt bother you does it knowing that you could take a human life he laughed and it was bitter or dont you consider marcus human the man i killed last night was human i said richard stared at me fresh horror growing in his eyes and you slept just fine didnt you i nodded pretty good considering you sent stephen to my bed a strange look passed through his eyes and for a split second i saw him wonder sweet jesus you know me better than that he looked down i know its just that i want you so badly and you keep saying no it makes me doubt everything shit i am not going to stroke your ego in the middle of a fight you sent stephen to me because you were mad said i could protect him had it occurred to you that id never sleptjust sleptin the same bed with a man before what about your fiancй in college i had sex with him but i didnt sleep over i said the first time i woke up in the morning with a man curled around me i wanted it to be you im sorry anita i didnt know i you didnt think great now whats with the no clothes whats going on richard you saw the fight last night you saw what i did what i can do some of it yeah he shook his head you want to know why i dont kill why i always stop just short of it the look in his eyes was almost desperate wild tell me i said softly i enjoy it anita i love the feel of my hands my claws ripping into flesh he hugged himself the taste of fresh warm blood in my mouth is exciting he shook his head harder as if he could erase the sensation i wanted to rip sebastian apart last night i could feel it like an ache in my shoulders in my arms my body wanted to kill him the way i want you he stared at me still hugging himself but his body was speaking for him the thought of killing sebastian did excite him really excite him i swallowed hard youre afraid that if you let go and killed that youd like that too he stared at me and that was the horror in his eyes the fear that he was a monster the fear that i was right not to touch him not to let him touch me you dont fuck the monsters you just kill them do you enjoy killing he asked i had to think about that for a second or two finally i shook my head no i dont enjoy it what does it feel like he asked like nothing i dont feel anything you have to feel something i shrugged relief that it wasnt me triumph that i was faster meaner i shrugged again it doesnt bother me to kill people richard it just doesnt did it once yes it used to bother me when did it stop bothering you i dont know not the first death or the second but when it gets to the point that you cant keep track of them all it either stops bothering you or you find another line of work i want it to bother me anita killing should mean something other than blood and excitement or even survival if it doesnt then im wrong and we are just animals his body reacted to the thought too and he did not find it exciting he looked vulnerable and afraid i wanted to tell him to get dressed but i didnt hed chosen to be naked very deliberately as if to prove once and for all that i didnt want him or that i did i didnt much like tests but it was hard to bitch with the fear in his eyes hed walked away to stand in front of the bed he rubbed one hand up and down the opposite arm as if he were cold it was may in saint louis he wasnt cold at least not that kind of cold you arent animals richard how do you know what i am and i knew that he was asking the question more of himself than of me i walked over to him i took the firestar out of the front of my pants and laid it on the night stand beside his cut glass lamp he watched me do it eyes wary almost like he expected me to hurt him i was going to try very hard not to do that i touched his arm gently where he was rubbing it he froze under my touch you are one of the most moral people i have ever met you can kill marcus and not become a ravening beast i know that because i know you gabriel and raina kill and look what they are you arent like them richard trust me on that what if i kill sebastian or marcus and i enjoy it his handsome face was raw with terror at the thought maybe it will feel good i gripped his arm tighter but if it does theres no shame in that you are what you are you didnt choose it it chose you how can you say theres no shame in enjoying killing something ive hunted deer and i love it i love the chase and the kill and eating the warm meat as before the thought excited him i kept my eyes on his face as much as possible but it was distracting everyone has different things that flip their switch richard ive heard worse hell ive seen worse he stared down at me like he wanted to believe me and was afraid to worse than this he lifted his right hand from its grip on his arm he held his hand in front of my face his power prickled over my hand down my arm until i gasped it was force of will alone that kept my hand on his arm his fingers elongated stretching impossibly long and thin the nails grew into heavy claws it wasnt a wolf hand rather his own grown into a claw nothing else had changed that i could see only that one hand i was having trouble breathing for different reasons than before i stared at the clawed hand and realized for the first time that he was right watching the bones in his hand stretch and pop sickened me scared me i kept my hand on his arm but i was shaking i found my voice and it shook too i saw raina do that once i thought it wasnt a common ability only raina marcus and i can do it within our pack we can partially change at will thats how you stabbed sebastian last night he nodded eyes searching my face i was fighting to keep it blank but what he saw there wasnt reassuring enough he turned away from me and i didnt have to see his eyes to feel the pain i grabbed his hand and wrapped my fingers around those long thin bones i felt muscles under my hands that had never been in richards hand before it took everything i had to hold that hand to touch him like that everything the effort left me shaking and unable to meet his eyes i didnt trust what hed see in them he touched my chin with his other hand and turned me slowly to face him he stared down at me i can taste your fear and i like it do you understand i like it i had to clear my throat to talk i noticed i said he had the grace to blush he bent slowly to kiss me i didnt try to stop him but i didnt help either i usually rose on tiptoe to meet him halfway i stood there too scared to move forcing his tall body to bend at the shoulders to fold down towards me the long thinfingered hand that i was holding convulsed around me the claws playing lightly on my bare forearm i tensed and his power poured over me i held onto his hand while the muscles and bones slid back into place i held on with both hands while his hand reformed under mine my skin shuddered with the spill of power his lips brushed mine and i kissed him back almost swaying i let go of his hand my fingers brushed his bare chest playing over his hardened nipples his hands slid around my waist fingers kneading upward over my ribs along my spine he whispered into my mouth youre not wearing anything under this tshirt i know i said his hands slid under the shirt caressing my back pressing our bodies together his naked body touched me and even through my jeans it made me shudder i wanted to feel his naked flesh against mine so badly i could feel it like a hunger in my skin i slipped the tshirt off and he made a sound of surprise he stared down at my bare breasts and he wasnt the only one excited he ran his hands over my breasts and when i didnt stop him he dropped to his knees in front of me he looked up at me his brown eyes filled with a dark light i kissed him while he knelt in front of me as if id eat him from the mouth down the feel of him against my naked flesh was almost too much he broke from the kiss and ran his mouth over my breasts it brought a surprised moan from my throat there was a knock at the door we froze a womans voice that i didnt recognize said i didnt come all this way to listen to you make out richard id like to remind you that all of us have incredibly good hearing not to mention sense of smell that was jason damn he said softly head buried against me i leaned my head over him burying my face in his hair i think ill just climb out the window he hugged me around the waist and stood passing his hands over my breasts one last time i cant tell you how long ive wanted to do that he reached for his jeans and underpants still lying on the bed i touched his arm bringing his attention back to me i want you richard i love you i want you to believe that he stared at me his face grew strange and solemn you havent seen me change into a wolf yet you need to see that before we go any further the thought did not excite me and i was glad i was the girl so it didnt show youre right though if youd played your cards right we might have had sex first it wouldnt be fair to you so youre saying even if wed been alone youd have stopped and shapeshifted he nodded because it wouldnt be fair to sleep with me until id seen the whole package exactly you are such a boy scout richard i think i just lost one of my merit badges he said the look on his face brought a rush of heat up my neck he grinned and slipped on his pants he wore briefs he pulled on his jeans and was careful zipping them up i watched him get dressed with a proprietary air an air of anticipation i picked the tshirt up from the floor and pulled it back on richard came up behind me sliding his hands under the shirt cupping a hand around each breast kneading them i leaned back against him he was the one who stopped hugging me around the waist picking me an inch off the floor he turned me around and gave me a quick kiss when you make up your mind to do something you really make up your mind dont you always i said he took in a deep breath through his nose and out through his mouth id try to make it a quick meeting but edward should be here soon so it doesnt matter he nodded his face falling i almost forgot that someone was trying to kill you he cupped my face in his hands and kissed me eyes searching my face be careful i touched the bandage on his shoulder you too he pulled a black tshirt from a drawer and slipped it on he tucked it into his jeans and i made myself stay away from him while he fumbled with his zipper join us after you get dressed i nodded sure he left closing the door behind him i sighed and sat down on the edge of the bed damn i didnt want to lose richard i really didnt i wanted to sleep with him i wasnt sure how i felt about seeing him change into full animal form the hand thing had bothered me enough what if i couldnt take it what if it was too gross dear god i hoped not i hoped i was a better person than that a stronger person than that richard was afraid that if he started to kill hed just keep killing it wasnt a completely unreasonable fear i hugged myself tight the feel of his body against mine clung to my skin the feel of his mouth on me i shivered and it wasnt fear it was stupid to love richard having sex with him would make it worse he was going to be dead soon if he didnt kill marcus simple as that jeanclaude would never have endangered himself like that never you could always trust jeanclaude to survive it was one of his talents i was almost sure it wasnt one of richards last night should have proved to me beyond any doubt that i should dump him or that he should dump me you could agree to disagree on politics or even religion sometimes but you either killed people or you didnt homicide was not something you could be neutral on jeanclaude didnt mind killing people once upon a time id thought that made him monstrous now i agreed with him will the real monster please stand up id finally gotten dressed red polo shirt black jeans black nikes the firestar mm in its innerpants holster the gun was very visible against the red shirt but hey why try to hide it besides i could feel the roil of power just outside the door shapeshifters not all of them happy strong emotions make it harder to hide their power richard was one of the best at hiding it that id ever met hed fooled me for a while made me think he was human no one else had ever been able to do that i looked at myself in the mirror and realized that it wasnt facing a room full of lycanthropes that bothered me it was facing a room full of people who knew that richard and i had been making out i preferred danger to embarrassment any day i was used to danger the bathroom was just off the living room so when i opened the door they were all there clustered on or around the couch they glanced at me as i stepped out and i nodded hello rafael said hello anita he was the rat king the wererats equivalent of pack leader he was tall dark and handsome with strong mexican features that made his face seem stern only his lips hinted that perhaps there were more smiles than frowns in him he was wearing a shortsleeved dress shirt that left the brand on his arm bare the brand was in the shape of a crown and was the mark of kingship there was no equivalent mark among the wolves being a lycanthrope meant different things depending on the animal different cultures as well as forms i didnt know the wererats would be interested in the packs internal squabbles i said marcus is trying to unify all shapeshifters under one leader let me guess i said he gets to be leader rafael gave a small smile yes so youve thrown in with richard as the lesser evil i made it a question ive thrown in with richard because he is a man of his word marcus has no honor his bitch raina has seen to that i still think if we killed raina marcus might be willing to talk with us this from a woman who i thought id seen before but couldnt place she sat on the floor sipping coffee from a mug she had short blond hair and was wearing a pink nylon jogging suit jacket open over a pink tshirt it was a jogging suit made for looking at not working out in and i remembered her id seen her at the lunatic cafe rainas restaurant her name was christine she wasnt a wolf she was a weretiger she was here to speak on behalf of the independent shapeshifters those who didnt have enough people to have a leader not every kind of lycanthropy was equally contagious you could get cut to pieces by a weretiger and not get it a werewolf could barely cut you and you got furry almost none of the catbased lycanthropy was as contagious as wolf and rat no one knew why it was just the way it worked richard introduced me to about fifteen others first names only i said hi and leaned against the wall by the door the couch was full and so was the floor besides i liked being out of reach of any shapeshifter i didnt know just a precaution actually ive met christine before i said yes christine said the night you killed alfred i shrugged yeah why didnt you kill raina last night when you had the chance she said before i could answer richard interrupted if we kill raina he said marcus will hunt us all down i dont think hes up to the job sylvie said richard shook his head no i still wont give up on marcus no one said anything but the looks on their faces were enough they agreed with me richard was going to get himself killed and hang his followers out to dry louie came out of the kitchen carrying two mugs of coffee he smiled at me louie was richards best friend and hed gone on a lot of hiking dates with us he was five foot six with eyes darker than my own true black not just darkest brown his babyfine black hair had been cut recently hed worn it long for all the time id known him not a fashion statement like richard he just never got around to getting it cut now it was short enough that his ears showed and he looked older more like a professor with a doctorate in biology he was a wererat and one of rafaels lieutenants he handed me one of the mugs these meetings have been so much more pleasant since richard bought that coffeemaker thanks to you i took a big breath of coffee and felt better instantly coffee might not be a cureall but it was close im not sure everyone is happy to see me theyre scared it makes them a little hostile stephen came out of the guest room dressed in clothes that fit too well to be richards a blue dress shirt tucked into faded blue jeans the only man in the room that was close to richards size was jason jason never minded sharing his clothes why does everyone look so grim i asked louie leaned against the wall sipping coffee jeanclaude withdrew his support of marcus and threw in with richard i cant believe neither of them mentioned that they said something about having formed a bargain but they didnt explain i thought about what hed just told me marcus must be pissed the smile faded from his face that is an understatement he looked at me you dont understand do you understand what i asked without jeanclaudes backing marcus doesnt stand a chance of forcing the rest of the shapeshifters under his control his dreams of empire building are finished if he doesnt stand a chance why is everyone so worried louie gave a sad smile what marcus cant control he has a tendency to kill you mean hed start a war yes not just with richard and the pack you mean but an allout war with all the other shapeshifters in town louie nodded except the wereleopards gabriel is their leader and he sides with raina i thought about it for a second or two sweet jesus it would be a bloodbath and thered be no way of containing it anita some of it would spill over onto the normal world there are still three states in this country that will pay hundreds of dollars in bounty for a dead shapeshifter no questions asked a war like this could make the practice look practical do you two have something better to do christine asked i was beginning not to like her it was she that knocked on the door and interrupted richard and me frankly for that i was sort of grateful the thought of everyone hearing us go further would have been too embarrassing for words louie moved back to sit on the floor with the others i stayed leaning against the wall sipping my coffee are you going to join us she asked im fine where i am i said too good to sit with us a man in his late thirties with dark blue eyes asked he was about five foot eight it was hard to tell with him sitting on the floor he was dressed in a suit complete with tie as if he was on his way to work his name was neal not good enough i said not good enough by half what the hells that supposed to mean he asked i dont like having a normal here leave it alone neal richard said why shes laughing at us richard glanced back at me from his corner of the couch come join us anita sylvie was sitting beside richard not too close but still there was not enough room for me rafael sat on the end of the couch spine straight ankle propped on one knee couch looks full i said richard held out his hand to me well make room she isnt even pack sylvie said i wont give up my seat to her no offense to you anita you dont know any better her voice was matteroffact not hostile but the look she gave richard wasnt exactly friendly no offense taken i said i wasnt sure i wanted to sit on the couch surrounded by lycanthropes anyway even supposedly friendly ones everyone in the room was stronger and faster than i was just a fact the only leg up i had was the gun if i sat right beside them id never get it out in time i want my girlfriend to sit with me sylvie thats all richard said it isnt meant as a challenge to your position in the lukoi his voice sounded patient like he was talking to a child what did you say sylvie asked she looked shocked we are the lukoi anita knows that you shared our words with her neal said outrage thick in his voice i wanted to say that it was just words but i didnt who says im not getting smarter there was a time when sharing our secrets with normals could get you a death sentence sylvie said even marcus doesnt allow that anymore how much of our secrets do you know human i shrugged a few words thats all sylvie stared at me you want your human girlfriend to cuddle up next to you is that it richard yes he said there was no trace of anger in his voice personally i didnt like the way shed said human sylvie knelt on the couch staring at me come human sit with us i stared at her why the change of heart not everything has to do with the pack hierarchy thats what richard is always telling us sit by your lover ill scoot over she did curling up on the couch near rafael the rat king glanced at me he raised an eyebrow almost a shrug i didnt trust sylvie but i trusted rafael and i trusted richard at least here today i realized that i would have trusted rafael last night he wouldnt have the moral qualms that richard had poor richard was like a lone voice crying in the wilderness god help me i agreed with the pagans louie and stephen were curled on the floor close by i was among friends even jason grinning up at me wouldnt let me get hurt jason was jeanclaudes wolf to call as was stephen i think if they let me get killed they might not survive much longer than i did anita richard made it a question i sighed and pushed away from the wall i was among friends so why were the muscles in my back so tight it hurt to move paranoid who me i walked around the couch coffee mug in my left hand sylvie patted the couch smiling but not like she meant it i sat beside richard his arm slid over my shoulders my right arm was pressed against his side not too tightly he knew how much i hated having my gun hand impeded leaning into the warmth of his body i relaxed the tightness in my shoulders eased i took a sip of coffee we were all being terribly civilized richard put his lips against my face and whispered thank you those two words earned him a lot of brownie points he knew what it had cost me to sit down among the wolves rats and cats not sitting with him would have undermined him in front of the pack and the other leaders i wasnt here to make the situation worse who saved you last night stephen sylvie asked her voice was sweet face pleasant i didnt trust her at all every eye turned to stephen he tried to huddle into the floor as if he could go invisible but it didnt work he stared at richard eyes wide go ahead stephen tell the truth i wont be mad stephen swallowed anita saved me richard was fighting about twenty lycanthropes at the time i said he told me to get stephen so i did neal sniffed stephen running his nose just above the other mans face and neck down his shoulder it wasnt a human gesture and it was unnerving in the welldressed man he has her scent on his skin neal glared at me hes been with her i expected an outcry but instead the others crowded around stephen sniffing his skin touching him and bringing their fingers close to their own faces only sylvie jason rafael and louie stayed sitting one by one the rest turned to richard and me hes right christine said her scent clings to his skin you dont get that much scent just by carrying someone richards hand tightened on my shoulder i glanced at his face it was calm only a slight tightness around the eyes betrayed tension i was patrolling the woods for assassins richard said stephen didnt want to be alone i sent him to anita we know about the assassination attempts sylvie said i widened my eyes you do do you richard wants us to help protect you if were going to take a bullet for you we need to know why i met her eyes her pretty face was harsh the bones in her cheeks standing out im not asking anyone to take my bullet i said i scooted out from under richards arm which put me closer to sylvie not an improvement richard didnt fight it he drew his arm back i should have talked to you before i told them damn straight i said sylvie leaned her arms on the back of the couch bringing her face inches from mine are you going to chastise our wouldbe pack leader human you say human like its a bad thing sylvie jealous she drew back like id hit her a look that was part pain part rage passed across her face most of us here survived an attack human we did not choose this her voice was chokingly harsh id expected a lot of things from her but not the pain of a survivor i was sorry id made the crack im sorry i didnt mean anything personal by it you have no idea how personal it is thats enough sylvie richard said she rose on her knees to meet richards face over my head dont you even have the balls to be angry that she slept with a subordinate male wait a minute i said stephen and i did not have sex we literally slept together nothing else neal plunged his face into stephens crotch and sniffed it wasnt a human gesture stephen let him do it and that wasnt very human either jason leaned in sniffing my leg i put my coffee cup on my knee in front of his face dont even think it i said jason grinned up at me cant blame a guy for trying i can richard said softly jason smiled at him and scooted back neal raised his face and shook his head they didnt have sex he said shed protect me stephen said the silence grew so thick you could have walked on it is that what you said sylvie asked she was staring at richard like hed done something very bad richard took a deep enough breath that his shoulders shuddered yes thats what i said stephen sylvie said did you believe shed protect you if raina had come through the door would you have trusted anita to save you stephen looked at the floor then up his eyes darted to richard then to me his eyes finally stopped staring at me she had me sleep near the wall so shed be in front in case anything came through the door and id thought id been subtle what would you have done if raina had come sylvie asked everyone was watching me except richard their eyes were very intent and i knew the question meant more than it should have id have killed her not just shot her or wounded her christine asked i shook my head she got her free pass last night if she comes after stephen again ill kill her you mean that dont you sylvie said every word i said there was a hum of energy in the room almost as if they were all sharing some telepathic message i dont think they were but something was happening the energy level in the room was rising and i didnt like it i sat the coffee mug on the floor i wanted both my hands free sylvie grabbed me around the waist and rolled us off the couch we were on the floor with her riding my back before i could react i went for the gun and her hand was there first she jerked the gun out of its holster and tossed it away she wasnt fast she was miraculous and i was in deeper shit than i could get out of the bend of her arm was tucked under my chin like in a strangle hold positioned just right so she could black me out without killing me her legs locked around my waist as close as she could get and not climb down my shirt a half dozen werewolves flowed between her and richard he was standing hands in fists at his side his power poured through the room deeper and higher until it was like being buried alive in some kind of static charge dont i whispered i wasnt talking to richard i felt something open inside sylvie a trembling vibrating energy flowed from her skin across my body it was almost hot like opening the door to an oven where her skin touched me i shivered it was painful like small electric shocks what are you doing sylvie richard asked his voice had gone low and growling deep it didnt sound human i expected his eyes to be amber but they were the same solid brown as always human eyes but the look in them was not the beast stared out of richards eyes i knew in that moment that he was truly dangerous i also knew that all that impressive power wouldnt save me if sylvie wanted to rip my head off my pulse thudded against her arm like a trapped butterfly i forced my voice calm whats going on im going to make you his mate youre not contagious in human form i said really she said the arm around my throat grew warm pulsing like a beating heart i felt the muscles slide under her skin richard my voice sounded high and wispy fear will do that to you rafael and louie were on their feet now the werewolves that had joined sylvie in this little protest fanned out to cover the rats too i couldnt see stephen he was somewhere behind us crouched on the floor last i saw jason crouched at richards feet facing the other werewolves but at least ten of them just sat there watching not taking sides youve been holding out on us jason said sylvie flexed the arm around my neck i had a glimpse of a longclawed hand only raina is higher in the pack than i am jason richard faced the werewolves he brought his hands upward making a soothing gesture like hed done at the movie set the prickling energy in the room went down a notch he was forcing their power back all it takes is a scratch richard sylvie said youll never reach us in time i forbid this richard growled no one is to be infected against their will especially anita why sylvie said because if she wasnt human you wouldnt want her not taking the pack to your bed is just another way of denying what you are richard something passed over his face behind the anger and the power uncertainty i knew in that moment she was right sylvie whispered in my ear her breath warm on my face see his face yeah i said he accuses you of not being able to sleep with him because you think hes a monster but if i make you one of us he wont want you he thinks of all of us as monsters but not good old richard hes better than the rest of us i will hurt you sylvie ill bleed you do you understand richard said but you wont kill me will you she said her arm flexed long claws tickled down my face i put my hands on her arm trying to hold it away from me and not succeeding ill kill you i said she went very still against my body for changing you into one of us for losing you richards love when he sees you monstrous and furry i spoke very low very carefully you hate what you are sylvie her arm convulsed tight enough that i couldnt breathe for a second i dont hate what i am i accept what i am her arm loosened i took a shaky breath and tried again i saw the look on your face when i accused you of being jealous you are jealous of me being human sylvie you know you are she held her other hand up in front of my face letting me get a good look at the long thin claws the hand at my throat combed claws through my hair you know that raina has forbidden us to make you lukoi shes afraid if you joined us youd be a better bitch than she is how flattering i whispered i looked at richard through the backs of the werewolves his eyes had gone amber and alien even now i knew he wouldnt kill sylvie even if she bled me infected me he wouldnt kill her it was there in the pain on his face the confusion replacing the fear maybe sylvie saw it maybe shed made her point whatever she uncurled herself from my body and stood carefully on the other side of me i scuttled away on all fours as fast as i could go it wasnt pretty it wasnt slick but it was effective i crawled until i came to the far wall i stayed sitting against it as far away from everything in the room as i could get the other werewolves had faded away sylvie and richard stood facing each other sylvies eyes had gone a strange liquid grey wolf eyes richard flung his power outward it ate along my skin tore a gasp from my throat sylvie stood in that flood of power and didnt flinch the power is impressive richard but it means nothing as long as marcus lives he backhanded her in a blur of motion that was too fast to follow sylvie careened into the wall and slid to the floor stunned i am pack leader richards voice roared and he raised clawed hands to the sky he fell to his knees and i didnt go to help i stayed huddled against the wall wishing id packed an extra gun richard crouched on the floor rocking gently he curled on his knees into a ball and i felt him swallow the power back i felt it drain away he stayed crouched on the floor hugging himself for a long time after the power vanished from the room head down his hair hiding his face sylvie got to her knees and crawled towards him she crouched beside him smoothing his hair back on one side we would follow you anywhere if you would kill for us she will kill for us if your mate your lupa will kill for us it might be enough richard raised his head up with a shudder no one is to be infected against their will that is my word and my order he raised back on his knees sylvie stayed crouched down face near the floor a sign of abasement but you will not kill to enforce it i will kill to protect anita rafael said everyone looked at him he met their eyes and didnt back down if anyone touches her against her will i and mine will hunt them down rafael richard said dont do this he stared at richard you bring a human among us but you do not protect her someone has to i wanted to say i could protect myself but it wasnt true i was good but i was just human it wasnt enough i cant let you do my dirty work for me he said i am your friend richard rafael said i do not mind sylvie hugged the ground at richards feet will you let the rat king kill your pack is he our leader now he stared down at her and something happened to his face not otherworldly or wolf but a hardness almost a sadness passed over him i watched it and i didnt like it if id had my gun i might have shot sylvie for making that look pass over his face i will kill anyone who breaks my word i have spoken and it is law sylvie abased herself even lower and the other wolves came crowding around crawling on the floor abasing themselves in front of him some of them licked his hands touched his body they moved around him until he was nearly hidden from sight richard stood up walking through them their hands clinging to his legs he bent down and picked up the firestar from the floor and walked over to me he looked normal enough all the wolfish changes hidden away he handed me the gun butt first are you all right i cradled the gun in both hands sure i value your humanity anita sylvies right how can i ask you to embrace my beast when i cant do it myself the pain on his face was heartrending i will kill to keep you safe does that make you happy i stared up at him no i said i thought it would but no i felt like rafael id kill for him id kill to keep the pain out of his eyes i holstered the gun and raised my right hand to him his eyes widened he understood the gesture he took my hand and raised me to my feet he drew me with him towards the waiting wolves i hung back pulling on his hand i said id kill for you anita his voice was soft and harsh at the same time dont you believe id do it his eyes were utterly sad it was like something inside of him that hed kept alive all these years was dead now i believed the look in his eyes he would kill to protect me and the decision had cost him dearly the werewolves closed around us i would have said they crawled around us but that didnt cover what they were doing crawling wasnt graceful or sensuous but this was they moved like they had muscles in places that people didnt they circled us and rolled their eyes up at us when i met those eyes they looked away all except sylvie she met my gaze and held it it was a challenge but i wasnt sure what i was supposed to do about it a hand touched me and i jerked away from it only richards hand on mine kept me from going for my gun he held both my hands in his and drew me to him our bodies not quite touching he met my eyes and held them he wasnt afraid i tried to relax but it wasnt working this is my lupa know her scent know her skin she has shed our blood and shed her blood for us she stands as protector for those weaker than herself she will kill for us if we ask she is your alpha sylvie and neal stood up they both moved out of the circle they stood staring at me at richard the others crouched on the floor watching she is not dominant to me sylvie said she is not even one of us neal said i wont bow to her i could break her in half with one hand he shook his head she isnt my alpha whats happening richard i asked i tried to bring you into the pack make you one of us without contaminating you why i asked if youre going to protect stephen then you deserve the protection of the pack if youre going to take risks for us then you deserve to have the benefits of our protection no offense i said but i havent been too impressed with your protection so far the minute i said it i wished i hadnt his face fell you made it personal last night with raina anita you have no idea how dangerous she is i wanted you to have everyones protection in case something happened to me i looked up at him you will kill marcus if he jumps you right no more being squeamish i touched his arm i studied his face answer me richard he nodded finally i wont let him kill me you will kill him promise me his jaw tightened the muscle thrumming i promise well hallelujah sylvie said she stared at me i withdraw my challenge you arent dominant to me but you can be his alpha female youre a good influence on him she stepped back into the circle but didnt kneel come on neal she said let it go he shook his head no she isnt one of us she cant be i wont acknowledge her as alpha all you have to do is prove to neal that youre serious sylvie said you just have to make him hurt a little since he could probably survive a direct hit with a mack truck how am i supposed to hurt him she shrugged i didnt think anyone would challenge you im sorry richard said you expect people to be nice richard its one of your best qualities and greatest weaknesses i said refuse the challenge anita if i refuse then what its over you wont be a member of the pack but i can order them to protect you from raina its almost as good i told you i dont want anyone being ordered to take a bullet for me besides no way am i volunteering to go one on one with a lycanthrope ill keep my gun thanks anyway the doorbell rang it was probably edward damn i looked at the little group and even though they were in human form hed know what they were he was better at smelling monsters than i was at least live ones if you guys can tone it down a bit ill get the door edward richard made it a question probably i said he stared around at the group everybody up off the floor hes another normal they got to their feet slowly almost reluctantly they seemed almost intoxicated as if the power in the room had done more for them than for me i went for the door i was halfway to it when richard yelled no i dropped to the ground rolling and felt the air whistling over me where neal had swung if hed been any good at fighting hed have nailed me the missed swing put him off balance and i footswept him to the floor but he got to his feet again before i could stand like there were springs in his spine it was impressive as hell stop it neal sylvie said she didnt refuse the challenge its my right i scuttled backwards still on the ground not sure what to do the closed drapes of the picture window were at my back if i stood up i wasnt sure standing up was my best bet give me the rules quick i said first blood sylvie said human form only if he shapeshifts you can shoot him richard said agreed sylvie said others murmured their agreement peachy neal leaped for me leaving the ground completely hands outstretched i came up on one knee grabbed his jacket and rolled on my back letting his amazing momentum carry us both i shoved both feet into his stomach and pushed with everything i had he flew over me in a near perfect arc hed set himself up for a textbook tomoenage throw he smashed through the window taking the curtain with him i rolled to my feet and stared at the gaping window broken shards of glass sprinkled onto the carpet and the yard beyond neal struggled out of the curtain blood running down his face where the glass had cut him edward was on the ground in a combat stance gun out he pointed it at neal as he struggled free of the curtain dont shoot him i said i think the fights over neal stood kicking free of the clinging curtain ill kill you i drew the firestar and pointed it at him i dont think so richard stepped up beside me she drew first blood neal the fight is over unless you want to fight me too and me sylvie said she stepped up on the other side of richard the rest of the pack stepped up behind us stephen crouched at my feet she is pack now sylvie said you fight one of us and you fight all of us edward raised his eyebrows at me what is going on anita i think ive been adopted i said neal glared at me do it neal sylvie said neal knelt in the glass and the curtain the cuts were already beginning to heal on his face glass wasnt silver or the claws of another monster so he healed almost magically you are dominant you are alpha the words were dragged from his throat if this window hadnt been here you couldnt have bloodied me why do you think i moved in front of it neal i asked his eyes squinted you planned this i nodded and raised my gun skyward im not just another pretty face richard took my left hand squeezing it gently thats the gods honest truth i put up the firestar edward shook his head smiling but didnt put his gun up he did stop pointing it at anyone you are the only person i know who leads a more interesting life than i do jason patted me on the back tomorrow night well take you out chasing deer i thought youd chase cars i said he grinned what fun is that cars dont bleed i smiled and then stopped his eyes were as innocent as spring skies as joyous and staring into them i wasnt sure if he was kidding me or not i almost asked but didnt i wasnt sure i wanted to know edward was five foot eight with blond hair cut very short and close to his head he was blueeyed and the epitome of wasp breeding he was also the most dangerous man id ever met living or dead he was amused as hell by the gathering of lycanthropes the group broke up soon after his arrival mainly because all the business had been taken care of the meeting had mainly been a lastditch effort to convince richard to compromise his morals and kill someone barring that for him to pick a lupa who would kill for him wed sort of killed two birds with one stone pun intended but i was very aware that id gotten lucky with neal if hed had a background in any martial art if hed known anything about fighting id have been toast richard had boarded up the broken window and had a call in to a glass repair shop that was willing for an exorbitant fee to come out and repair the damage immediately id offered to pay for the damages since i made them edward richard and i sat around the kitchen table edward and i sipped coffee richard drank tea one of his few serious faults was a total dislike of coffee hard to trust a man who wont drink coffee what have you found out i asked edward sipped his coffee and shook his head not much the contract has been picked up even with the time limit i asked he nodded when is the twentyfour hours up i asked lets say two oclock i got the offer about one oclock last night but wed add an hour to be safe to be safe richard said i think it was sarcasm whats wrong with you i asked am i the only one in this room whos worried panicking wont help richard he stood up emptying his mug in the sink and rinsing it automatically he turned leaning his butt against the cabinets arms crossed over his chest you need a clear head to plan i nodded yeah he stared at us i watched him thinking about something serious he finally said i dont understand how the two of you can be calm im shocked that someone has put a contract out on anita neither of you is shocked i looked at edward and he looked back at me we had one of those moments of perfect understanding and i knew i couldnt explain it to richard i wasnt even sure i could explain it to myself ive stayed alive this long because i dont react the way most people react youve stayed alive because youre willing to do things other people arent i nodded that too his face was very serious like a little boy asking about the facts of life let me ask one stupid question then ill shut up i shrugged ask away anita says she doesnt enjoy killing that she feels nothing when she kills i realized then that the question was going to be for edward i wasnt sure how that would go over do you enjoy killing edward sat very still in his chair drinking his coffee quietly his blue eyes were as neutral and unreadable as any vampires and in some ways just as dead i wondered for the first time if my eyes ever looked like that why do you want to know i agreed to kill marcus richard said ive never killed anyone edward stared up at him he set his coffee down carefully and met richards eyes yes yes you enjoy killing richard asked edward nodded richard was waiting for him to explain you could see it in his face hes answered your question richard but does he enjoy the sensation of killing is it physical or is it the planning that he enjoys edward picked up his coffee the question and answer session is over richard i said a look halfway between stubbornness and frustration crossed richards face but yes doesnt tell me anything after you kill marcus edward said you can ask the question again and youll answer it richard asked edward gave the barest of nods for the first time i realized that edward liked richard not as a friend maybe but he didnt think richard was a complete waste of time richard stared into edwards face for a long time then shook his head okay he sat back down no more questions whats the plan i smiled at him to keep the hitter from killing me thats your entire plan richard asked and to take out the man with the money edward said as long as the money is out there anita wont be safe any ideas how to accomplish this richard asked edward nodded and upended his coffee mug finishing the last of it he went to the counter and refilled it like he was at home he sat back down good ol edward comfortable wherever he was i sat waiting watching him quietly hed tell us when he was ready and not before richard was practically dancing in place what he finally asked edward smiled i think at richard or maybe at that eternal music that only he could hear the rhythm that kept him selfcontained and alive the assassin might come here today and well take precautions for that a herd of shapeshifters was perfect id have passed on the hit myself until they cleared out i glanced around the quiet kitchen the spot between my shoulder blades was itching you think were in danger now maybe he didnt seem too worried but i think theyll hit you tonight on your date with the master of the city how did you know i had a date tonight edward just smiled i know that the master of the city is taking the executioner to the opening of his dance club danse macabre i know that youll be arriving in a limo i didnt even know that i said he shrugged it wasnt hard to find out anita i was going to cancel my date tonight and hide out if you stay here the assassin will almost certainly come here i glanced at richard oh i said i can take care of myself richard said could you kill a human being i asked he blinked at me what do you mean i mean if someone came at you with a gun could you kill them i said id kill to protect you thats not what i asked richard and you know it he stood up and paced a small circle in the kitchen if it was standard ammunition it couldnt kill me you wouldnt know whether it was silver ammo until it was too late i said he hugged his arms ran his hands through his long hair and turned to me once you decide to start killing it never stops does it no i said i dont know if i could kill a human being thanks for the honesty i said but that means youll take an assassin into a club crowded with people youll endanger all of them to keep me safe i would endanger almost anyone to keep you safe edward made a small sound almost a laugh his face was pleasant and empty he sipped coffee which is why i dont want richard in the line of fire youll be so busy worrying about him it might make you careless but all those people you cant put them in danger richard said edward looked at me and didnt say what he was thinking i was grateful for that i think edward has a plan for that too richard i think theyll hit you on the way home from the club why work in the middle of a crowd if they dont have to plant a bomb on the limo or wait until youre alone on the drive back is that what you would do richard asked edward looked at him for a moment then nodded probably not the bomb but id hit the limo why not the bomb richard asked i didnt ask because i knew the answer edwards eyes flicked to me i shrugged because i like to kill up close and personal with a bomb theres no personal risk richard stared at him studying his face he finally said thank you for answering the question edward acknowledged him with a nod richard was gaining brownie points from both of us but i knew that richard had illusions if edward seemed to like him richard would assume edward wouldnt kill him i knew better if the situation called for it edward could pull the trigger on anyone lets say youre right i said i go on the date and let the hitter make his move then what we take him out wait a minute richard said youre betting that the two of you are better than a professional assassin that youll get to him before he gets to anita we both nodded what if youre not better edward looked at him like hed said the sun wouldnt rise tomorrow edward will be better i said youd bet your life on that richard asked i am betting my life on that i said richard looked a touch pale he nodded i guess you are what can i do to help you heard edward i said you stay here richard shook his head i heard but surely in a crowd of people even superman will need a few more eyes and ears the pack can help watch your back it doesnt bother you to endanger them you said youd risk almost anyone to keep me safe richard said i feel the same way if they want to volunteer thats one thing but i dont want them ordered into it people arent good bodyguards if they resent doing it richard laughed very practical for a second there i thought you were really worried about my wolves practical will keep me alive richard sentimentality wont if we had some extra watchers itd free me up a little edward said i looked at him youd trust monsters to watch my back he smiled and it wasnt pleasant monsters make excellent cannon fodder they arent cannon fodder richard said everyones cannon fodder edward said eventually if i really thought we were endangering innocent bystanders i wouldnt go to the club you know that richard he stared at me for a second then nodded i know that edward made a small sound low in his throat innocent bystanders he shook his head smiling lets get dressed edward said i bought some new toys for you to use tonight i looked at him dangerous toys i asked is there any other kind we grinned at each other you two are enjoying this richard said it was almost accusatory if we didnt enjoy it wed both do something else edward said anita doesnt kill people for money and you do i watched the humor drain from edwards eyes like the sun sinking behind clouds leaving them pitiless and empty think what you like loverboy but anita could have chosen another line of work one that wouldnt put her in harms way but she didnt theres a reason for that shes not like you edward looked at me with empty eyes closer than she used to be his voice was soft almost neutral but it made me shiver i met his eyes and for the first time in a long time wondered what id given up to be able to pull the trigger the same thing edward had given up inside himself to be able to kill so easily i looked up at richard and wondered if he could do it if when the fur flew he could really kill anyone some people couldnt no shame in that but if richard backed out he was dead not tonight or tomorrow but eventually because marcus would see to it richard had beaten marcus twice and refused the kill i doubted marcus would let him have another shot at it theyd taken stephen last night knowing what richard would do if i hadnt been with him he might he dead now shit all i had to do was kill the assassin before he or she killed me trust richard not to let marcus kill him keep raina from killing me and lets see i was sure there was something else oh yeah decide whether im going to sleep with richard and if i did what that would mean for jeanclaude and myself there were days when my life was too complicated even for me finding dressup clothes that you can hide a gun in is a bitch i actually hadnt planned to carry a gun on my date with jeanclaude of course that was before the assassin now i wasnt going out without one if id known id be needing a gun tonight id have worn the little black dress yesterday and saved the pants suit but who knew and now all id packed besides jeans was the dress it was a little black dress with just enough strap to allow a bra if you were careful id bought a black bra to be safe flashing a white bra strap in a black dress always looked so tacky the jacket was a deep black velvet a bolero cut that hit me at the waist black beading edged the collar and hem the jacket was hanging on the doorknob of richards closet he was sitting forlornly on the bed watching me put the last touches on my lipstick i was leaning forward peering at myself in the mirror on his dresser the skirt was short enough that i decided to wear a black teddy under it not for underwear but to go over my panty hose so everything matched ronnie hadnt trusted me not to bend over at least once tonight she was right so even if i forgot the teddy covered more than most bathing suits id have never picked out something so short on my own ronnie was a bad influence on me if shed known i was planning to wear it for jeanclaude shed have probably chosen something else she called him fangface or worse she liked richard nice dress richard said thanks i turned in front of the mirror to check the way the skirt hung it was just full enough to swing when i moved the black knife sheaths on my forearms actually matched the dress the knives made a nice touch of silver the wrist sheaths almost covered the scars on my arms only the mound of scar tissue at my left elbow was visible a vampire had torn up my arm once upon a time the same vamp had bitten through my collarbone the scars were normal for me but every once in a while id be out enjoying myself and catch someone looking staring theyd look hurriedly away or meet my eyes it wasnt that the scars were awful to look at they werent that badreally but they told a story of pain and something out of the ordinary they said id been places that most people hadnt and id survived worth a stare or two i guess the black straps that held the new knife down along my spine showed a little at the shoulders but more across the back the hilt was hidden under my hair but i wouldnt be taking the jacket off why didnt you wear this last night richard asked the pants suit seemed more appropriate he stared at me eyes roving over my body more than my face he shook his head for seeing someone youre not going to sleep with that is a very sexy outfit i had never planned on richard seeing the dress at least not on the night i wore it for jeanclaude i wasnt sure what to say but id try i trust myself with jeanclaude more than i trust myself with you so he gets the short skirt and you dont that was the truth youre saying i dont get the sexy outfit because im so irresistible something like that if i ran my hands up your legs would i find panty hose or garters he looked so solemn hurt with everything else going down i shouldnt have had to worry about my boyfriends hurt feelings but there it was life goes on even if youre ass deep in alligators panty hose i said will jeanclaude find out what kind of hose youre wearing he could ask like you did i said you know thats not what i meant he said i sighed i dont know how to make this easier on you richard if theres anything that would make you feel more secure about this ask to his credit he didnt ask me not to go i think he knew he wouldnt like the answer come here he said and held out his hand to me i walked over to him and took his outstretched hand he sat me on his lap legs sideways like youd sit on santa he encircled me with one arm then laid his other hand on my thigh promise me you wont sleep with him tonight with assassins ready to jump out of the woodwork i think thats a safe bet i said dont joke anita please i smoothed my hand through his hair he looked so serious so hurt ive said no for a very long time richard why should you be worried about tonight the dress he said i admit its short but he smoothed his hand up my thigh until it vanished under the skirt he rested his hand just below the lace of the teddy youre wearing lingerie for gods sake you never wear lingerie i would have explained about everything matching but somehow i didnt think that would be comforting okay i wont sleep with him tonight i hadnt planned on it to begin with promise me youll come back and sleep with me he smiled when he said it i smiled back and slid off his lap youd have to shift first id have to see your beast or so you keep telling me i could shift when you get back could you take human form again quickly enough to do us any good tonight he smiled im strong enough to be ulfric anita one of the things i can do is change form almost at will i dont pass out when i change back to human form like most shapeshifters handy i said he smiled come back tonight and ill change for you sylvies right i have to accept what i am part of that is trying it out on me huh he nodded i think so staring into his solemn eyes i knew that if he changed for me tonight and i couldnt deal with it it would destroy something inside of him i hoped i was up to it when i come back tonight ill watch you shift he looked grim as if he expected that id run screaming kiss me and get out of here he said i kissed him and he licked his lips lipstick he kissed me again but underneath i can still taste you hmmm i said i stared down at him and almost didnt want to go almost the doorbell rang and i jumped richard didnt as if hed heard it before i had be careful i wish i could be with you therell be media all over the place i said wouldnt do to get your picture taken with a bunch of monsters it might blow your cover id blow my cover if it would keep you safe he loved teaching yet i believed him hed come out of the closet for me thanks but edwards right id be so worried about keeping you alive i wouldnt be taking good care of myself you dont worry about jeanclaude i shrugged he can take care of himself besides hes already dead richard shook his head you dont really believe that anymore no hes dead richard that i know whatever keeps him alive is a form of necromancy different than my own powers but still magic you can say it but in your heart you dont believe it i shrugged again maybe not but its still the truth there was a knock on the door richard said your dates here im coming now i have to fix my lipstick all over again he wiped fingers across his mouth coming away with crimson stains at least ill be able to tell if youve been kissing him this stuff will show up like blood on his white shirt i didnt argue jeanclaude always wore black and white id only seen him in one shirt that wasnt white it had been black i reapplied the lipstick and put it in the beaded black purse on the dresser the purse was too small even for the firestar i did have a derringer but except at close quarters it was pretty worthless with an assassin i might not want to get that close edward had a solution hed loaned me his seecamps autoloader it was about the same size as a small only a little wider than my own hand and i had a small hand it was a very nice gun and for the caliber and the size id never seen better i wanted one edward informed me that hed had to wait nearly a year for the gun to come in it was pretty much a custom order otherwise hed have made it a gift fine id order my ownif i survived the night if i didnt well i wouldnt be ordering anything id managed not to think too much about that id concentrated on dressing putting the weapons in place richard anything but that i was putting myself out as bait for someone good enough to earn dollars a pop i was having to trust that edward would keep me alive because though edward would have stopped the limo and fired only when he could see my face most hit men wouldnt most professionals prefer to take you out from a nice safe distance a highpowered rifle could be yards or even miles away not much i or even edward could do about that i knew nothing about explosives i was going to have to depend on edward to take care of any bombs i was putting myself in edwards hands tonight trusting him like id never trusted anyone before scary thought that i checked the purse again id lipstick money gun id have normally carried a small travel hairbrush but there wasnt room i could live with messy hair for one night the thought made me check my hair in the mirror and run a brush through it one last time i had to admit that it looked great it was one of my best features even ronnie couldnt improve on it it was all natural curl even tonight id shoved hair goop in it after my shower and let it dry naturally id had a woman get angry with me once in california because i wouldnt tell her where id gotten my hair permed she wouldnt believe it was natural i slipped the purse over my shoulders so the thin strap went across my chest it blended with the dress well enough that it looked almost as good with it as without but the purse rode at my ribs just a little lower than my shoulder holster i tried drawing the gun a couple of times and it wasnt too bad not as good as a holster but what was i slipped the jacket on and checked myself in the mirror for the umpteenth time neither the knives nor the gun showed great i slipped my cross on last i made sure the cross was inside the dress then put a small piece of masking tape over it this way i kept my cross but it didnt spill out of my clothes and glow at jeanclaude i picked up the brush again and put it down without using it i was stalling it wasnt just the assassin i was afraid of i was dreading the moment richard and jeanclaude met tonight i wasnt sure how they were going to react and i wasnt up to an emotional confrontation i rarely was i took a deep breath and went for the door richard followed me it was his house i couldnt ask him to hide in the bedroom jeanclaude stood by the television peering at the shelves of videos as if studying the titles he was tall and slender though not as tall as richard he wore black pants and a short black jacket cut just at the waist like my own he had on high leather boots that covered nearly his entire leg the soft leather tops were held in place by black straps with small silver buckles his black hair spilled over his shoulders inches longer than when i first met him he turned at last as if he hadnt known we were standing there i made a small involuntary gasp as he faced me his shirt was red a pure clear crimson that blazed inside his open jacket the collar was high held in place by three antique jet beads the shirt gaped open below the collar showing a large oval of his chest the crossshaped burn scar on his chest showed in the circle of red cloth as if it were framed for viewing the circle of bare skin ended just above the black pants where the shirt was safely tucked away the shirt looked splendiferous against his pale skin the black wavy hair his midnight blue eyes i closed my gaping mouth and said spiffy very spiffy he smiled ah ma petite always the perfect thing to say he glided across the carpet in his nifty boots and i found myself wanting him to take the jacket off i wanted to see his hair spill over that shirt black over red i knew it would look wonderful richard came up behind me he didnt touch me but i could feel him standing there a warm unhappy presence at my back i couldnt blame him jeanclaude looked like an advertisement for wet dreams r us i couldnt blame anyone for being jealous jeanclaude stood in front of me close enough that i could have reached out and touched him i stood between the two of them and the symbolism wasnt lost on any of us wheres edward i managed to ask my voice sounded almost normal good for me he is checking the car i believe for incendiary devices jeanclaude said with a small smile my stomach clenched tight someone really wanted me dead by midnight tonight edward was sweeping the car for bombs even for me it didnt seem quite real ma petite are you well jeanclaude took my hand in his your hand is cold nice complaint coming from you richard said jeanclaude looked over my shoulder at richard it was not a complaint but an observation his hand was warm and i knew that he had stolen that warmth from someone oh theyd been willing enough there were always people willing to donate to the master of the city but still he was a blood sucking corpse no matter what he looked like staring up at him i realized part of me didnt buy that anymore or maybe i just didnt care anymore damn he raised my hand slowly to his lips eyes watching not me but richard i drew my hand out of his he looked at me if you want to kiss my hand fine but dont do it just to get on richards nerves my apologies ma petite you are quite right he looked past me to richard my apologies to you as well monsieur zeeman we are in a ticklish position it would be childish to make it worse with game playing i didnt have to see richards face to know he was frowning edward came in and saved us we could all shut up and leave hopefully the cars clean he said glad to hear it i said edward was dressed for the evening a brown leather coat hung to his ankles and moved like something alive as he came into the room the coat hung strangely heavy in places hed shown me some of his toys that were positioned here and there i knew there was a garotte hidden in the stiff white collar of his shirt a garotte was a little too upandclose even for me his eyes flicked to the two men in my life but all he said was ill follow the limo dont look around for me tonight anita ill be there but we dont want the hitter alerted to the fact that youve got a bodyguard a second bodyguard jeanclaude said your how do you say hitter will know i will be by her side edward nodded yeah if they hit the limo youll be there theyll have to plan on taking you out too which means its got to be serious firepower i am both a deterrent and an invitation to up the stakes is that it jeanclaude asked edward looked at him like the vampire had finally done something interesting edward didnt meet his eyes though i was the only human i knew that could meet the masters eyes and not be bespelled being a necromancer had its uses exactly he said it like he hadnt expected the vampire to grasp the situation but if there was one thing jeanclaude was good at it was surviving shall we go then ma petite the party awaits us he made a sweeping motion with his arms directing me towards the door but not taking my hand he glanced at richard then at me he was behaving himself terribly well jeanclaude was a worldclass pain in the ass it wasnt like him to be a good boy i glanced at richard go on if we kiss goodbye itll smear your lipstick again you are wearing quite enough of her lipstick already richard jeanclaude said for the first time tonight i heard that warm edge of jealousy richard took two steps forward and the tension level in the room soared i could kiss her good night again if that would make you happy stop it both of you i said by all means jeanclaude said she is mine for the rest of the evening i can afford to be generous richards hands balled into fists the first trickle of power oozed through the room im leaving now i made for the door and didnt look back jeanclaude caught up with me before i reached the door he reached for the doorknob first and then released it letting me get it i do forget your penchant for doors he said i dont richard said softly i turned and looked at him standing there in his jeans his tshirt molded to the muscles of his arms and chest he was still barefoot his hair a wavy mass around his face if id been staying here we could have cuddled on the couch in front of one of his favorite movies we were beginning to have our favorite movies songs sayings that were ours maybe a moonlight walk his night vision was almost as good as my own maybe later we could finish what wed started before the meeting jeanclaude slid his fingers through mine drawing my attention to him i stared up into those blue blue eyes like a sky before a storm or seawater where the rocks lie deep and cold i could touch those three black buttons and see if they were really antique beads my gaze traveled downward to the pale glimpse of his chest i knew that the crossshaped burn scar was a rough slickness to the touch looking at him made my chest tight he was so beautiful would my body always feel the pull of him like a sunflower turning towards the light maybe but standing there holding his hand i realized it wasnt enough jeanclaude and i could have had a glorious affair but i could see spending my life with richard was love enough even if richard killed for selfpreservation could he really accept my body count could i accept his beast or would i be as horrified by it as he was himself jeanclaude accepted me lock stock and gun but i didnt accept him just because we both looked at the world through dark glasses didnt mean i liked it i sighed and it wasnt a happy sound if this was the last time i ever saw richard i should have jumped his body and given him a kiss he would never forget but i couldnt do it holding jeanclaudes hand i couldnt do it it would have been cruel to all of us bye richard i said be careful he said he sounded so alone louie and you are going to the movies tonight right i asked he nodded he should be here soon good i opened my mouth to say more but didnt there was nothing to say i was going with jeanclaude nothing i said would change that ill wait up for you richard said i wish you wouldnt i know i left walking a little too fast out to the waiting limo it was white well isnt this shiny and bright i said i thought black looked too much like a hearse jeanclaude said edward had come out also he closed the door behind us ill be there when you need me anita i met his eyes i know you will he gave the briefest of smiles but just in case watch your back like a son of a bitch i smiled dont i always he glanced at the vampire standing by the open limo door not as well as i thought you did edward walked into the darkness towards his waiting car before i could think of a reply it was just as well he was right the monsters had finally gotten me seducing me was almost as good as killing me and nearly as crippling the name of the club danse macabre blazed in red neon letters nearly eight feet high the letters were curved and flowed at an angle like some giant hand had just finished writing them the club was housed in an old brewery warehouse the place had stood on the riverfront boarded up and abandoned for years it had been the only eyesore in a line of chic restaurants dance clubs and bars most of them were owned by vampires the riverfront was also known as the district or blood square though not in polite vampire company for some reason the nickname bugged them who knew why the crowd had spilled out from the sidewalk into the street until the limo was stopped by the sheer weight of people it was so bad that i spotted a uniformed cop trying to ease the people back enough for the cars to get through i looked through the dark tinted windows at the press of people was the assassin out there was one of those welldressed smiling people waiting to kill me i opened my purse and slipped the seecamp out jeanclaude eyed the little gun nervous ma petite yes i said he looked at me head to one side yes you are nervous why does one human assassin unnerve you so much more than all the preternatural creatures you have faced everyone else whos wanted to kill me it was personal i understand personal whoever this is wants to kill me because its business just business but why is that more frightening to you you will be just as dead regardless of your assailants motives thanks a lot i said he touched my hand as it gripped the gun i am trying to understand ma petite that is all i dont know exactly why it bothers me it just does i said i like to put a face on my enemies if someone kills you it shouldnt be only for money so killing for hire offends your moral sensibilities he asked his voice was very bland too bland as if he were laughing silently to himself yes dammit it does yet you are friends with edward i never said i was consistent jeanclaude you are one of the most consistent people i have ever known ma petite how consistent can i be if im dating two men do you think being unable to choose between us makes you frivolous he leaned towards me as he said it hand smoothing up the sleeve of my jacket the trouble was i had almost chosen i almost told him but i didnt first i wasnt a hundred percent sure second jeanclaude had blackmailed me into dating him date him or hed kill richard he wanted a chance to woo me away from richard which meant really dating him as he put it if you allow richard to kiss you but not me it is not fair supposedly if i chose richard jeanclaude would merely step aside i think he was egotist enough to mean it the master of the city couldnt imagine anyone not being won over eventually not if you had access to his lovely body he kept offering it i kept refusing if i chose richard over him would he really bow out gracefully or would he take us all down in a bloodbath i stared into his deep blue eyes and didnt know id known him for years dated him for months but he was still a mystery to me i just didnt know what he would do i wasnt willing to push that button not yet what are you thinking about so seriously ma petite do not say it is the assassin i would not believe you i didnt know what to say so i just shook my head his hand slid over my shoulders until i was resting in the curve of his arm the feel of his body that close to mine made my stomach flutter he bent forward as if to kiss me and i stopped him the back of my left hand against his chest since i was now touching bare skin i wasnt sure this helped you behaved yourself the entire drive up here what gives now i asked i am trying to comfort you ma petite yeah right i said he wrapped his other arm around my waist turning my upper body against him the gun was still in my hand but it began to seem awkward i wasnt going to use it on jeanclaude and the assassin wasnt coming through the locked doors that much violence in a crowd this large with cops directing traffic seemed a little bold even for a professional i slid my arm across his back the gun still in my hand if you kiss me ill have to redo my lipstick he leaned his face close enough to kiss lips so close to mine he could have breathed me in he whispered just above my mouth we mustnt have that he kissed my cheek running his lips down the edge of my jaw i touched his face with the edge of the gun moving his face where i could see it his eyes had gone drowning blue no necking i said i meant that id only volunteered once for blood donation and that was when he was dying i did not share bodily fluids with the master of the city he rubbed his cheek against the gun i had something a bit lower in mind he ducked his head to my collarbone licking down my skin for a second i wondered how low he was planning on going then i pushed him off of me i dont think so i said halflaughing do you feel better now ma petite i stared at him for a heartbeat then laughed i did you are a devious son of a bitch did you know that ive been told that before he said smiling the police had pushed the crowd back and the limo moved forward you did that just to cheer me up i sounded almost accusatory he widened his eyes would i do such a thing i stared at him and felt the smile slide from my face i really looked at him for a moment not just as the worlds greatest lust object but as him jeanclaude the master of the city was worried about my feelings i shook my head was he becoming nicer or was i just fooling myself why so solemn ma petite i shook my head the usual trying to figure out how sincere you are his smile widened i am always sincere ma petite even when i lie which is what makes you so good at it i said he nodded his head once almost a bow exactly he glanced ahead of us we are about to embark on a sea of media ma petite if you could put the gun up i think the press would find it a bit much press i said you mean local media local yes what arent you telling me when the door opens take my arm and smile please ma petite i frowned at him what is about to happen you are about to be introduced to the world jeanclaude what are you up to this is not my doing ma petite i do not like the limelight quite this much the vampire council has chosen me to be their representative to the media i know you had to come out of the casket to the local vampires after you won your last challenge but isnt it dangerous i mean youve been pretending to be some mysterious masters numberone flunkie its kept you safe from outside challengers most masters use a stalking horse ma petite it cuts down on challenges and human assassins i know all that so why are you going public the council believes that skulking in the shadows gives ammunition to our detractors those of us who would make good media fodder have been ordered into the light as it were i stared at him how into the light put the gun away ma petite the doorman will open the door and there will be cameras i glared at him but i slid the seecamp into my purse what have you gotten me into jeanclaude smile ma petite or at least do not frown the door opened before i could say anything else a man in a tux held the door the flash of lightbulbs was blinding and i knew it had to bother his eyes more than mine he was smiling as he held a hand back for me if he could stare that much light in the face without blinking i could be gracious we could always fight later i stepped out of the limo and was glad i was holding his hand flashbulbs were everywhere like tiny suns blasting off the crowd surged forward microphones shoved at us like knives if he hadnt been holding my hand tight id have crawled back into the limo i moved closer to him just to be able to keep my feet where the hell was crowd control a microphone nearly touched my face a womans voice yelled from far too close is he good in bed or would that be coffin what i said is he good in bed there was a moment of near silence while everyone waited for my answer before i could open my mouth and say something scathing jeanclaude moved in graceful as always we do not kiss and tell do we ma petite his french accent was the thickest id ever heard it ma petiteis that your pet name for her a mans voice oui he said i looked up at him and he leaned down as if to kiss my cheek he whispered glare at me later ma petite there are cameras everywhere i wanted to say that i didnt give a damn but i did i mean i think i did i felt like a rabbit caught in headlights if the assassin had jumped out with a gun at that moment id have stood there and let him shoot me that thought more than anything else brought me back to myself helped me to think again i started trying to see past the lights the microphones a few tape recorders and video cameras i caught at least two major network emblems on the cameras shit jeanclaude was fielding questions like a pro smiling gracious the perfect vampire cover boy i smiled and leaned into him standing on tiptoe putting my lips so close to his ear that i could have licked it but i was hoping the microphones wouldnt pick up what i was saying i was sure it looked coy and girlish as hell but hey nothing was perfect i whispered get me out of here now or i pull the gun and clear a path for myself he laughed and it flowed down my skin like fur warm and ticklish and vaguely obscene the reporters ooohed and aahed i wondered if jeanclaudes laugh worked off a recorder or on video that was a frightening thought oh ma petite you naughty girl i whispered dont ever call me that again my apologies he smiled waved and began escorting me through the press of reporters two vampire doormen had come out to help clear our path they were both large and muscular and neither of them had been dead long they looked rosycheeked and almost alive theyd fed on someone tonight but then so had jeanclaude it was getting harder and harder for me to throw stones at the monsters the door opened and we slipped inside the silence was wonderful i turned on him how dare you drag me into that kind of media coverage it does not endanger you ma petite had it occurred to you that if i chose richard over you that i might not want everybody in the world to know i was dating a vampire he gave a slight smile good enough to date but not good enough to go public with weve gone to everything from the symphony to the ballet together im not ashamed of you really the smile was gone replaced by something else not anger exactly but close then why are you angry ma petite i opened my mouth then closed it truth was that i would rather not have gone quite this public because i guess i didnt really believe i could choose jeanclaude he was a vampire a dead man in that one moment i realized how prejudiced i still was he was good enough to date good enough to hold hands with and maybe a bit more but there was a limit always a point where i knew id say stop because he was a corpse a beautiful corpse but a vampire is a vampire you couldnt really fall in love with one you couldnt have sex with one no way id broken jeanclaudes one rule for dating both of the boys id never really given jeanclaude the same chance that id given richard and now with national television coverage the bat was out of the bag it embarrassed me that anyone would think i might actually date him that i might actually care for a walking dead man the anger washed away in the knowledge that i was a hypocrite i dont know how much of it showed on my face but jeanclaude cocked his head to one side thoughts are flying across your face ma petite but what thoughts i stared up at him i think i owe you an apology his eyes widened then this is a truly historic occasion what are you apologizing for i wasnt sure how to put it into words youre right im wrong he put his fingers to his chest face wide with mock surprise you admit that you have treated me like some guilty secret hidden away exiled from your true feelings while you cuddle with richard and his living flesh i frowned at him enough already see if i ever give you another apology for anything a dance would suffice he said i dont dance you know that this is the grand opening of my dance club ma petite you are my date are you truly going to deny me even one dance put that way it sounded petty one dance he smiled wicked enticing the smile that the serpent must have given eve i think we will dance well together ma petite i doubt it i think we would do many things well together give you one dance and you want the whole package pushy bastard he gave a small bow smiling eyes shining a female vamp strode towards us she was inches taller than jeanclaude which made her at least six feet tall she was blond and blueeyed and if shed looked any more nordic shed have been a poster girl for the master race she was wearing a violet blue body suit with strategic holes cut out the body that showed through was broadshouldered muscular and still managed to be fullbreasted leather boots in the exact same color rode her long muscular legs all the way up to her thighs anita blake this is liv let me guess i said jeanclaude chose the outfit liv looked at me from her considerable height as if simply being tall made her intimidating when i didnt flinch she smiled he is the boss i stared up at her i almost asked why i could feel her age pressing down on me like a weight she was six hundred years old twice jeanclaudes age or more so why wasnt she the boss i could feel the answer along my skin like a cool wind not enough power she wasnt a master vampire and no amount of age would change that what are you staring at she asked she looked me right in the eyes and shook her head she really is immune to our gaze to your gaze i said she put her hands on her hips whats that supposed to mean it means you dont have enough juice to do me i said she took a step forward how about i just pick you up and squeeze some juice out of you here was where not having a gun in a holster was going to get me killed i could get one of the knives out but unless i was willing for her to come very close it wouldnt help i could slip my hand in the purse most people didnt expect a gun to come out of a purse so small of course if liv caught me going for the gun she could get to me before i could draw it with a holster id have tried it from a purse hanging from a strap i didnt think so vampires are just that fast how many vampire kills do you have now anita jeanclaude asked the question surprised me and my answer surprised me more over twenty legal kills how many kills altogether ma petite i dont know i said it had to be over thirty now but truthfully i didnt remember anymore i didnt know how many lives id taken a bad sign that liv is mine ma petite you may speak freely in front of her i shook my head never admit to murder in front of strangers jeanclaude just a rule liv looked at me she didnt seem to like what she saw so this is the executioner she shook her head shes a little on the small side isnt she she stalked around me like i was a horse for sale when she was at my back i opened the purse by the time she came around again i had the gun out behind the purse unobtrusive though in a pinch i guess i could have shot through the purse but why if i didnt have to liv shook her head shes pretty but shes not very impressive she stood behind jeanclaude running her strong hands over his shoulders his arms she ended with her hands around his waist fingers kneading his body i was getting very tired of liv i can do things that no human can do for you jeanclaude you are being rude to anita i will not remind you of it again there was a cold even threat in his voice liv unwrapped herself from him and stood between us hands on hips the great jeanclaude driven to celibacy by a human people are laughing behind your back celibacy i asked jeanclaude glanced at me then sighed until you give up your nunnish ways ma petite i am playing monk my eyes widened i couldnt help it i knew that richard and i had each had one lover and chosen celibacy afterwards but id never thought about jeanclaude and what he might be doing to satisfy his needs abstinence would not have been one of my choices for him you seem surprised ma petite i guess anyone who exudes sex the way you do i just never thought about it yet if you discovered that i had been sleeping with another female alive or dead while we were dating what would you do drop you in a hot minute exactly liv laughed a loud unattractive bray of sound even your human doesnt believe you jeanclaude turned to her his eyes a blaze of sapphire flame you say they laugh behind my back she nodded still laughing but only you are laughing to my face her laughter died abruptly like a turned switch she stared at him a little more submissiveness liv or is this a challenge to my authority she looked startled no i mean i never meant he just looked at her then you had best ask my forgiveness had you not she dropped to one knee she didnt look afraid more as if shed done some huge social gaffe and now had to make amends i beg your forgiveness master i forgot myself yes you did liv do not make it a habit liv got to her feet all smiles all forgiven just like that the political maneuvering was thick in the air its only that she doesnt look nearly as dangerous as you painted her anita jeanclaude said show her what you have in your hand i moved the purse to one side flashing the gun i could have your throat in my hands before you could point that toy liv said no i said you couldnt is that a challenge she asked six hundred years of life plus or minus a decade i said dont throw it away for a little grandstanding how did you know my age i smiled i am really not in the mood to bluff tonight liv dont try me she stared at me her extraordinary eyes narrowing you are a necromancer not just a corpseraiser i can feel you inside my head almost like another vampire she looked at jeanclaude why couldnt i feel her before her power flares when she feels threatened he said this was news to me to my knowledge i wasnt using any power right now but i didnt say it out loud now was not the time to ask stupid questions or even smart ones liv stepped to one side almost as if she was afraid were opening in an hour ive got work to do she moved towards the door never taking her eyes from me i watched her move happy with her reaction but not understanding it come anita jeanclaude said i want to show you my club i let him lead me into the main area of the club they had gutted the warehouse until it rose three stories straight up with railings around each floor the main dance floor was huge shining and slick gleaming in the subdued light track lighting was hidden away so it was hard to tell where the light was coming from things hung from the ceiling at first glance i thought they were bodies but they were mannequins lifesize rubber dolls crashtest dummies some were naked one wrapped in cellophane some in black leather or vinyl one rubber doll wore a metal bikini they were hung from chains at different levels it was a mobile thats different i said a promising new artist did it especially for the club i shook my head it does make a statement i slipped the gun back into my purse but kept the purse open that way i was able to get to the gun surprisingly quickly besides i couldnt walk around all night with a loaded gun in my hand eventually your hand starts cramping no matter how small the gun is jeanclaude glided across the dance floor and i followed liv was afraid of me why he turned gracefully smiling you are the executioner i shook my head she said she could feel me in her head like another vamp what did she mean he sighed you are a necromancer ma petite and your power grows with use why would that scare a sixhundredyearold vampire you are relentless ma petite its one of my best things if i answer your question will you enjoy my club with me be my date until the assassin shows up thanks for reminding me you had not forgotten no i hadnt so yeah answer my question and ill play date play stop stalling and answer the question i thought of one other question i wanted answered two questions he raised his eyebrows but nodded vampires are given powers in folklore and popular myth that we do not possess controlling weather shapeshifting into animals necromancers are supposedly able to control all types of undead control you dont mean just zombies do you no ma petite so livs afraid ill take her over something like that but thats crazy i cant order vampires around the moment i said it i wished i hadnt it wasnt true i had raised a vampire once once once had been enough something must have shown on my face because jeanclaude touched my cheek what is it ma petite what fills your eyes with such horror i opened my mouth and lied if i could order vampires around serephina wouldnt have cleaned my clock two months ago his face softened she is dead ma petite well and truly dead you saw to that he leaned forward and kissed my forehead his lips were silken soft he brushed his lips across my forehead moving his body in closer comforting me it made me feel guilty as hell i did still have nightmares about serephina that much was true just saying her name out loud made my stomach clench of all the vampires id faced shed come the closest to getting me not killing me that would happen sooner or later no she had nearly made me one of them nearly made me want to be one of them she had offered me something more precious than sex or power shed offered me peace it had been a lie but as lies go it had been a good one why not tell jeanclaude the truth well it was none of his damn business frankly what id done frightened me i didnt want to deal with it didnt want to think about it didnt want to know what the philosophical ramifications of raising a vampire during daylight hours might be i was very good at ignoring things i didnt want to deal with ma petite you are trembling he pushed me back from him to search my face i shook my head theres an assassin out to kill me and you ask why im trembling i know you too well ma petite that is not why you tremble i dont like you using me like some kind of bogeyman for vampires im not that scary no but i have encouraged the illusion i pushed away from him you mean youve been telling other vamps that i could control vampires a hint or two he smiled and in that one simple expression you just knew he was thinking wicked thoughts why for heavens sake i have taken a lesson from our diplomatic richard he has won over many wolves by simply promising to treat them well not to force them to do things they do not want to do so i said i have invited vampires to join my flock with the promise not of fear and intimidation but of safety like liv he nodded how do you make sure they dont stage a palace revolt i asked there are ways like threatening them with a necromancer i said he smiled indeed not everyone will believe it i know i dont a voice said i turned to find another new vampire he was tall and slender with skin the color of clean white sheets but sheets didnt have muscle moving underneath sheets didnt glide down the steps and pad godlike across a room his hair fell past his shoulders a red so pure it was nearly the color of blood the color screamed against his paleness he was wearing a black frock coat like something out of the s but his chest gleamed lean and naked inside it the heavy cloth was nearly covered in thick embroidery a green so vivid it gleamed the embroidery matched his eyes green as a cats eyes green as an emerald from the waist down he was wearing green lycra exercise pants that left little to the imagination a sash was tied at his waist like a pirate belt black with green fringe kneehigh black boots completed the outfit i thought i knew all the bloodsuckers in town but here were two new ones in less than two minutes how many new vampires are in the city i asked a few jeanclaude said this is damian damian this is anita i feel silly in this outfit he said but you look splendid doesnt he ma petite i nodded splendid is one way of putting it jeanclaude walked around the new vampire flicking imaginary specks of lint from the coat dont you approve anita i sighed its just i shrugged why do you make everyone around you dress like they stepped out of a sexual fantasy with a high costume budget he laughed and the sound wrapped around me tugged at things lower than hed ever gotten to touch stop that i said you enjoy it ma petite maybe but stop it anyway jeanclaude has always had a killer fashion sense damian said and sex was always one of his favorite pastimes wasnt it there was something about the way he said that last that made it not a compliment jeanclaude faced him and yet for all my foppish ways here you are in my lands seeking my protection the pupils in damians eyes were swallowed by a rush of green fire thank you so much for reminding me remember who is master here damian or you will be banished the council themselves interceded with your old master rescued you from her she did not want to give you up i spoke for you i ransomed you because i remember what it was like to be trapped to be forced to do things you didnt want to do to be used and tormented damian stood a little straighter but didnt look away youve made your point i am grateful to be here he looked away then to the floor and a shudder ran through him i am glad to be free of her when he looked back up his eyes had returned to normal he managed a smile that didnt quite reach his eyes wearing a few costumes is not the worst thing ive ever done there was a sorrow to his voice that made me want to ask jeanclaude to let him change into a pair of pants but i didnt jeanclaude was walking a very fine line here damian was over five hundred years old he wasnt a master but that was still a hell of a lot of power jeanclaude might be able to handle liv and damian but if there were more master of the city or not he wasnt up to the job which meant these little dominance games were necessary the others couldnt be allowed to forget who was master because once they did he was done for if hed asked for my vote before he put out the invitations id have said no a door at the far side of the room opened it was a black door in the black walls and it seemed almost magical as a woman stepped out she was about my own height with wavy waistlength brown hair that foamed over the shoulders of her anklelength black coat she was wearing a pair of hot turquoise exercise pants with a matching sports bra crisscrossing straps went from pants to the bra emphasizing her small waist black vinyl boots reached to her knees with a small projection that covered the knees she walked down the steps and strode across the floor with a freeswinging walk that was almost a run she entered the room like it was her room or maybe she was her own room comfortable wherever she went she stopped by us smiling pleasant hazel eyes greener because of the strip of turquoise around her neck what do you think you look lovely cassandra jeanclaude said you look better in yours than i do in mine damian said thats a matter of opinion i said the woman looked at me her eyes flicked down the length of damians body she met my eyes and we both laughed damian looked puzzled jeanclaude looked at me share your humor with us ma petite please i met cassandras eyes again swallowed another laugh and shook my head i took a few deep breaths when i was pretty sure i could speak without laughing i said girl humor you wouldnt understand very diplomatic cassandra said im impressed if you knew how hard diplomacy comes to ma petite you would be even more impressed jeanclaude said he had gotten the joke as if thered been any doubt damian was frowning at us still puzzled it was just as well jeanclaude looked from cassandra to me and back again do you two know each other we shook our heads in unison cassandra anita my newest wolf meet the light of my life cassandra is one of your guards for the night youre very good i wouldnt have picked up on it her smile widened richard said you didnt know he was a werewolf at first either instantly a little spark of jealousy flared of course if she were a werewolf and with jeanclaude then she was one of richards followers you werent at the meeting jeanclaude needed me here he couldnt do without both jason and me i looked at jeanclaude i knew what jason did for him he bled jason when he woke and sucking blood was damn close to sex for a vampire really i said dont worry ma petite cassandra wont share blood with me either she and richard have many similarities i believe that richard chose her for me because she bears a certain resemblance to you not just physically but a certain je ne sais quoi je ne sais quoi is french for nothing i said it means an indefinable something that is difficult to put into words ma petite a quality that transcends vocabulary he does talk pretty doesnt he cassandra said he has his moments i said you cant be draining jason every morning even a werewolf needs a little recoup time stephen is a willing donor why wasnt stephen with you last night i asked is that an accusation jeanclaude asked just answer the question he had requested an evening off to spend time with his brother who am i to stand in the way of familial obligations he stared at me while he answered like he wasnt completely happy with the conversation tough neither was i stephens own brother had betrayed him acted as bait for the trap damn where is stephen hes in the back room cassandra said he helped me get into this thing i couldnt reach all the straps she dropped the coat off her shoulders and turned so i could see her back the straps formed a tight web most of them in places you couldnt have fastened without help she slipped the coat back on and turned looking at me youre taking this alpha female thing seriously arent you i shrugged im serious about stephens safety cassandra nodded face solemn thoughtful i like that sometimes alpha female is just a token position just a word for the pack leaders lover most of them arent as active as raina she made a face when she said the name like shed tasted something bitter jeanclaude interrupted i will leave you two girls to your conversation i have things to attend to before the club opens he kissed the back of my hand and was gone leaving us standing in the middle of the club alone damian had gone at his heels as if hed been asked for a moment i was nervous cassandra and i were very much in the open lets go over there i motioned to the steps that led to the next level we sat down on them me having to smooth my skirts down even that didnt help i had to keep my feet and knees together or i would have flashed the room sigh let me guess i said raina wanted you for her movies she wants everyone that is remotely attractive for her movies though sometimes sharing her bed for a tryout can get you out of it she offered me to gabriel for my tryout that damn leopard is not even a pack member if he were shed make him pack leader i said cassandra shook her head gabriel couldnt defeat marcus let alone richard hes the leader of the wereleopards only because theres no one stronger hes an alpha but hes flawed it makes him weak sexual perversion doesnt always mean youll lose a fight i said its not that cassandra said hes into dangerous sex lycanthropes can take a lot of damage she shivered the things he wanted to do to me she looked at me and the fear showed in her eyes he says you nearly gutted him once while he had you pinned to the ground i looked away yeah cassandra touched my arm and there was no sense of power she was every bit as good as richard at hiding what she was she made sylvie look like an amateur the touch made me turn back to her hes hot for you anita i didnt tell richard because well im new in the pack got into town about two weeks ago i was afraid that if i told him what gabriel had said about you he might do something stupid but meeting you maybe telling you is enough you can decide whether richard needs to know she looked so serious it scared me what did gabriel say cassandra took a deep breath he has a fantasy about you he wants to arm you with knives and let you try to kill him on film while he rapes you i stared at her i wanted to say youre kidding but i knew she wasnt gabriel was just that twisted how does the movie end in his version with you dead she said while he rapes me i said she nodded i hugged myself running my hands down my arms tensing my back feeling the weapons i was carrying i was armed i was safe but shit she touched my shoulder you all right well isnt this touching a mans voice on the stairs behind us cassandra was on her feet facing it in an instant i slid my hand into the open purse and drew the seecamp out the gun caught a bit on the cloth lining and cost me a couple of seconds but it was out and ready i felt better id twisted on the steps coming up on one knee not bothering to stand sometimes standing made you a better target sabin stood about five steps above us frightfully close for neither of us to have sensed him he was dressed as id seen him in the office hooded cloak covering him from head to toe i could see under the cloak now there were no feet he was floating above the step i wish you could see the look on your face ms blake i swallowed my pulse back into my mouth and said i didnt know youd be here tonight sabin cassandra took a step towards him a soft growl oozing from her throat i dont know you she said calm yourself wolf i am jeanclaudes guest arent i ms blake yeah i said hes a guest i stopped pointing the gun at him but i didnt put it up he was awfully damn good to have snuck up on me and a werewolf you know him cassandra asked she was still standing above me blocking the vampires path she was taking this bodyguard thing very seriously ive met him he safe no i said but hes not here to hurt me who is he here to hurt cassandra asked she still hadnt given any ground sabin eased down the steps cloak billowing around him in an odd motion like the sleeve of an amputee i have come to watch the nights entertainment nothing more cassandra backed up to stand a step ahead of me i stood but still kept the gun out i was jumpier than normal i was also remembering how sabin had bled me from a distance with his laughter keeping a gun handy seemed like a good idea wheres dominic hes here somewhere his hood was a cup of darkness smooth and empty but i knew he was watching me i felt his gaze like a weight he stayed on the step just above cassandra two steps above me who is your lovely companion sabin this is cassandra cassandra sabin a blackgloved hand slid out of the cloak he reached towards cassandra as if hed caress her face she jerked back dont touch me his hand froze in midmotion a stillness washed over him id seen other vampires fill with that utter quietness but id thought it was made up of visual clues there was no visual from sabin but that same emptiness flowed outward the illusion was almost better this way as if it was just an empty cloak somehow hovering on the stairs his voice came out of that stillness it was startling is my touch so repulsive you smell of sickness and death sabin drew his hand back inside his cloak i am a visiting master it is within my rights to ask for a bit of companionship i could ask for you wolf cassandra growled at him no ones forcing anyone into anyones bed i said are you so sure of that ms blake sabin asked he floated around cassandra the cloak brushed her and she shuddered i couldnt smell him i didnt have a werewolfs sense of smell but id seen some of what was under that cloak it was worth a shudder or two cassandra is only on loan to jeanclaude she belongs to the pack so yeah im sure cassandra glanced back at me youd protect me its part of my job description now isnt it she studied my face yes i suppose it is her voice was soft the growling like a distant dream she looked terribly normal except for the outfit youve seen what i am ms blake do you shudder at my touch i moved down a step until i was on the floor better footing than the stairs i shook your hand earlier sabin floated to the floor the darkness faded from inside the hood he pushed it back to reveal that golden hair and that ravaged face cassandra let out a hiss she backed up until she hit the banister i think sabin could have pulled a gun and shot her right that second and she wouldnt have reacted in time he smiled at her his beautiful mouth pulling the rotted flesh loose have you never seen anything like this she swallowed hard enough for me to hear like she was trying not to throw up ive never seen anything so horrible sabin turned back to me his one eye was still a clear pure blue but the other had burst in the socket in a welter of pus and thinner liquid i did my own swallowing your eye was fine yesterday i told you it was virulent ms blake did you think i was exaggerating i shook my head no his gloved hand came out of hiding once more i remembered the way his hand had squished when i shook it yesterday i did not want him to touch me but there was a look in his beautiful eye some pain on what was left of his face that made me hold still i wouldnt flinch i felt sorry for him pretty stupid but true that black glove hovered beside my face not quite touching me the seecamp was forgotten in my hand sabins fingertips brushed my face the glove was liquidfilled like some kind of obscene balloon he stared at me i stared back he spread his hand over my lower jaw and pressed there were solid things inside the glove thicker pieces and bone but it wasnt a hand anymore only the glove gave it shape a small sound crawled out of my throat i couldnt stop it perhaps i should ask for you he said i eased back out of his grip i was afraid to move too quickly afraid that sudden movement might tear off the glove i did not want to see him spill out in a flood of foulsmelling liquid he was a horror show enough without that sabin didnt try to hold me maybe he was afraid of the same thing are you abusing my hospitality again jeanclaude said he stood on the dance floor looking at sabin his eyes were pure blue light his skin had gone pale and smooth like carved marble you have not yet shown me true hospitality jeanclaude it is customary to offer me companionship i didnt think there was enough of you left to have such needs jeanclaude said sabin grimaced it is a cruel illness not all of my body has rotted away the need remains though the vessel is so grotesque that no one will touch me not by choice he shook his head and the skin split on one side something black and thicker than blood oozed down the side of his face cassandra made a small sound my bodyguard was about to be sick maybe it smelled bad to her if one of my people angers me enough while you are in my territory you may have them but i cannot give someone to you just because you wish it not everyones sanity would survive it there are days jeanclaude when my own sanity is in doubt sabin looked from cassandra to me it would break your wolf i think but your servant i think she would survive she is off limits to you sabin if you abuse my hospitality with such an insult council edict or no council edict i will destroy you sabin turned to him the two vampires stared at each other there was a time jeanclaude when no one spoke to me like that no one short of the council that was before jeanclaude said sabin sighed yes before you are free to enjoy the show but do not tempt me again sabin i have no sense of humor where ma petiteis concerned you share her with a werewolf but not with me that is our business jeanclaude said and we will never speak of this again if we do it will be a challenge between us and you are not up to it sabin gave a half bow hard to get the leverage for it without legs you are master of the city your word is law the words were correct the tone was mocking liv came up to stand behind and to one side of jeanclaude it is time to open the doors master i think that last was deliberate jeanclaude usually chastised his flock for calling him master jeanclaude said everyone to their places then his voice sounded strangled i will find a table sabin said do so jeanclaude said sabin raised the hood back into place he glided back up the stairs headed for the tables on the upper level or maybe hed just float in the rafters my apologies ma petite i believe the sickness has progressed to his mind be wary of him cassandra is needed for the show liv will remain with you i looked at the tall vampire she wont take a bullet for me if she fails me i will give her to sabin liv paled which is a neat trick for a vampire even one thats fed master please now i believe shell take a bullet for me i said if the choices were sleeping with sabin or getting shot id take the bullet from the look on livs face she agreed jeanclaude left to make his entrance cassandra met my eyes she wasnt just pale she was green she jerked her gaze from mine as if afraid of what id see i am sorry anita she went for the door shed first entered through she seemed embarrassed guess i couldnt blame her cassandra had failed the bodyguard test she was a powerful lycanthrope but sabin had totally unnerved her shed have probably been just fine if the vampire had tried violence but hed just stood there and rotted at her what do you do when the monsters start being piteous the doors opened and the crowd flowed in like a tidal wave spilling in a wash of thunderous noise i slipped the gun back into the purse but didnt shut it liv was at my elbow your table is over here i went with her because i didnt want to be alone in the jostling crowd besides she was suddenly taking my safety very seriously couldnt blame her sabins diseased body was a wonderful threat id have felt better if i hadnt believed jeanclaude would do it but i knew better hed give liv to sabin he really would there was a look in the vampires eyes that said she knew it too the table was the largest of a string of small black lacquer tables it blended nearly perfectly with the black walls my dress matched the decor i was really going to have to look into something in a different color scheme the table was set away from the wall near the railing so that the growing crowd couldnt block my view of the dance floor it also meant that my back was exposed i had scooted my chair so that the wall was at my back but i was very aware that the edge of the railing curved around on my right side so that someone could walk up and shoot me relatively hidden from anyone else of course liv was with me she stood at my back arms crossed over her stomach all she needed was a sign over her head that flashed bodyguard admittedly my purse was open the gun was within reach and it was tempting to put it in my lap i was spooked but that wasnt the point we had a plan the plan did not include the assassin being scared away i touched livs arm she bent down youre supposed to be unobtrusive she looked puzzled im supposed to keep you safe then sit down and pretend to be my friend the trap wont work if i look like im being guarded she knelt by me too far to bend down i suppose i will not risk being given to sabin i dont care if your assassin knows im here or not it was hard to blame her but i was willing to make the effort i leaned into her look either work with the program or get away from me i obey jeanclaude not his strumpet as far as i could remember id never done anything in my life to deserve being called a strumpet jeanclaude said if you failed him hed give you to the rotting corpse right liv nodded her eyes searched the crowd behind me she really was trying to do the job and the effort showed he didnt say youd be punished if i got hurt did he livs eyes flicked to me what are you saying if you scare away the hitter and spoil the plan thats failure she shook her head no thats not what he meant he said never to fail him again i watched her try to work out the logic i was betting that logic wasnt one of her strong points clever anita but if you get killed jeanclaude will punish me you know he will i was wrong she was a lot smarter than she looked but if you spoil our plan hell punish you anyway fear flashed through her eyes im trapped i felt sorry for her pity for two monstersno threein one night i was losing my edge if i dont get killed ill make sure you dont get punished you swear it she said the phrase like it meant more giving your oath was not a casual thing to her a lot of vampires came from times when a mans or a womans word was their bond i give you my word she stayed kneeling for a moment longer then stood try not to get killed she moved into the crowd leaving me on my own like id asked the rest of the tables filled up quickly the crowd spilled around the edges of the room on the raised area around the dance floor so many people stood at the fenced edges that if the table had been by the wall id have lost my view of the dance floor under other circumstances id have appreciated the thoughtfulness another bodyguard could come along at any time i was ready for some company the crowd filled the two levels above standing room only i looked for sabins dark cloak but didnt see him the main dance floor was untouched the way to the floor was barred by half a dozen vampires they had quietly but firmly motioned everybody back to the sides of the room both male and female were dressed nearly identically black lycra pants boots and black fishnet shirts the women wore black bras under their shirts but that was the only difference i approved short little skirts or hot pants for the women would have pissed me off the thought occurred that maybe jeanclaude had dressed them with me in mind he knew me too well in some ways and didnt have a clue in others i scanned the crowd for edward and for anything suspicious but it was hard to pick out any one person in the jostling laughing crowd i couldnt spot edward i had to just trust that he was there somewhere and although i did trust him to be there the tightness in my chest didnt ease edward had cautioned me to be casual not to look suspicious outwardly i was trying inwardly i was almost dizzy searching the crowd and that painful empty spot to the right and almost behind me where the railing went i put my hands in my lap and forced myself to look down if the assassin came now i wouldnt be looking but i had to get hold of myself if i didnt i was going to be so busy jumping at shadows i wouldnt be ready when the real thing came i was beginning to wish id let liv stay i took deep even breaths in and out concentrating on the rhythm of my own body when i could hear the blood flowing inside my head i raised my face slowly i stared calmly out at the crowd and the dance floor i felt empty distant calm much better a vampire came up to the railing in front of my table willie mccoy was dressed in a suit so horribly green it could only be called chartreuse green shirt and a wide tie with godzilla crushing tokyo on it no one would ever accuse willie of matching any decor i smiled i couldnt help it willie had been one of the first vampires to ever cross that line from monster to friend he scooted one of the chairs around so his back was to the open space he sat down like he hadnt done it on purpose i didnt have to pretend to be happy to see him he had to lean a bit into me to be heard over the crowds rising murmur i could smell the sweet scent of the goop he used to slick back his short hair him being this close didnt even make me tense i trusted willie more than i trusted jeanclaude how ya doing anita he grinned enough to show fang willie hadnt been dead three years yet he was one of the few vamps id known before and after death ive been better i said jeanclaude said we were to bodyguard you but to keep it casual well drift in and out but you looked spooked i shook my head smiling that obvious to someone who knows ya yeah we smiled at each other looking into willies face from inches away i realized that he was on my list the list that stephen was on if someone killed willie id hunt them down it surprised me to realize that any vamp had made the list but willie had and come to think of it i guess so had one other vampire jeanclaude appeared on the far side of the club speak of the devil a spotlight hit him from somewhere it had to be coming from a fly loft but it was hidden away so that it was hard to tell a perfect place for a highpowered rifle stop it anita stop tormenting yourself i hadnt truly realized how crowded the opening would be edward by himself searching for one lone assassin in this mass of people would have been poor odds maybe the vamps and werewolves were amateurs but their extra eyes couldnt hurt the lights began dimming until the only illumination was the spotlight on jeanclaude he seemed to glow i wasnt sure if it was a trick or if he was making his own light from the skin outward hard to tell whichever i was in the dark with an assassin maybe and i was not a happy camper hell with it i put the seecamp in my lap better not perfect but better the fact that just the touch of a gun in my hand made me feel better was probably a bad sign the fact that i missed my own guns was a worse one willie touched my shoulder and made me jump enough that people near us glanced back shit he whispered i got your back covered easy willie would make great cannon fodder but he wasnt up to protecting me hed been a bit player before he died and dying hadnt changed that i realized if the shooting started and the bad guys were using silver bullets i was worried about willie worrying about your bodyguard is not good jeanclaudes voice rose through the darkness filling it with a sound that caressed my skin a woman standing near the table shivered as if shed been touched her date put his arm around her shoulders and they huddled in the dark surrounded by jeanclaudes voice welcome to danse macabre the night will be filled with surprises some wondrous two smaller spotlights hit the crowd cassandra appeared balanced on the railing on the second floor she swept the coat back revealing her body stalking along the incheswide iron bar like it was the floor nearly dancing wild applause broke out the second spot hit damian on the first floor he glided out of the crowd swishing the embroidered coat around him like a small cape if he felt silly in the outfit it didnt show he moved through the crowd with the spotlight following him he touched a shoulder here ran his hands through waistlength hair put his arm around one womans waist each one man or woman didnt seem to mind they leaned into him or whispered in his ear he came to a woman with long brown hair parted in the middle she was dressed rather modestly for the crowd navy blue business skirt and jacket her white blouse had one of those big bows that are supposed to look like a tie but never do of the women around damian she looked the most normal he circled her so closely that his body brushed her she jerked away from every touch eyes wide with fear i could see even from across the room i wanted to say leave her alone but i didnt want to yell jeanclaude wouldnt allow anything illegal at least not in front of this many witnesses bespelling a group of people wasnt illegal mass hypnosis wasnt permanent but one on one it was permanent which meant that damian could stand under the womans window and call her out some dark night no time limitation willie was leaning forward in his chair his dark eyes on the woman and damian he didnt seem to be looking for assassins right that second i watched the womans face go blank of all expression until she was like one asleep her empty eyes stared at damian he took her hand and leaned against the railing he rolled both legs over ending on his feet still holding her hand she took two hesitant steps to the railing edge he put his hands on her waist under her jacket and lifted her high in the air effortlessly setting her down on the dance floor in her sensible black pumps the spotlights on jeanclaude and cassandra died until the only light was that on damian and the woman he led her to the center of the dance floor she walked looking only at him as if the rest of the world no longer existed dammit what damian was doing was illegal most of the crowd wouldnt pick it up vampires were allowed to use their powers for entertainment purposes so even the media if they were inside would be okay with it but i knew the difference i knew the law jeanclaude had to know id recognize what was happening for what it was was she an actress a plant for the show i leaned into willie close enough to brush the shoulder of his suit is she an actress he turned startled eyes to me and i could see that the pupils had been swallowed by the brown of his eyes down a long dark tunnel there was a hint of fire i swallowed hard and eased back from him glad of the gun in my lap its real isnt it willie licked his lips nervously if i say it is youre going to do something to mess up the show jeanclaude will get mad at me i dont want him mad at me anita i shook my head but didnt argue with him id seen what jeanclaude did to vamps that angered him torture was putting it mildly i had to find out what was going on but without disrupting things and drawing more attention to myself than i wanted tonight damian stood the woman in the center of the light he focused her face on something we could not see she stood there empty and waiting for his commands he stood behind her folding his arms around her waist rubbing his cheek against her hair he undid the bow at her throat and the first three buttons of her blouse he rubbed his lips along her exposed neck and i couldnt take any more if she was an actress fine but if she was an unwilling victim this had to stop willie he turned to me slowly reluctantly his hunger made him want to watch his fear of what i was about to ask made him slower whats up go tell jeanclaude that the show is over willie shook his head if i leave your side and you get wasted jeanclaude will kill me slow and painful im not leaving your side until im supposed to i sighed fine i leaned over the railing and motioned one of the vampire waiters over to me he glanced off in the dark as if he could see jeanclaude even though i couldnt then he walked over to me what is it he whispered he leaned in close enough that i could smell the mints on his breath nearly ever vampire i knew used breath mints i still had the seecamp naked in my hand i figured i could afford to get up close and personal with the new dead so i leaned in and whispered back is she an actress he glanced back at the little tableau just a volunteer from the audience she wasnt a volunteer i said there had been a half dozen people that would have volunteered but the vampire had chosen the one who was afraid that extra little bit of sadismthey just couldnt resist it tell jeanclaude that if he doesnt stop this i will he blinked at me just do it i said he walked around the edge of the dance floor vanishing into the darkness i could sort of follow him more an impression of movement than anything else i couldnt see jeanclaude at all damian passed his hand above the womans face and when his hand came away she blinked awake at last her hands flew to her blouse eyes frantic whats happening her voice carried thin with fear damian tried to take her in his arms but she drew away and all he caught was a wrist she strained against him and he held her easily let me go let me go please she reached out to someone in the crowd help me the crowd had gone very quiet quiet enough that i could hear the voice of her supposed friend enjoy it its just part of the show damian jerked her around to face him hard enough that there would be bruises as soon as her eyes met his her face went blank she sagged to her knees still held by one wrist he raised her to her feet gently now he clasped her against him and drew her hair to one side exposing a long line of neck he turned in a slow circle as if they were dancing showing her bare flesh to all willie leaned forward tongue dancing over his lower lip as if he could taste her skin already willie was my friend but it was good to remember that he was also a monster the vampire waiter was coming back i could see him moving towards me damian curled his lips exposing fangs he thrust his neck back giving everyone a view i saw his neck muscles tense and we were out of time willie looked up as if realizing the shit was hitting a different fan but there was no time i shouted dont do it damian i pointed the gun at his back about where the heart would be when a vamp gets around five hundred one shot to the chest silver bullets or not doesnt always guarantee a kill but we would by god find out if he bit her willie raised his hand toward me dont willie i meant it just because nobody else was allowed to kill him didnt mean i couldnt willie sank back into his chair damian relaxed enough to turn his head and look at me he turned so that the girl was in front of him like a shield her hair was still back on one side her neck still exposed he stared at me running one finger down her naked flesh daring me a dim spotlight shone on me and the illumination built as i walked very carefully to the two steps that led down to the dance floor vaulting the railing might have looked better but it made it damn hard to hold a target i could probably have made the head shot from the railing but with an unfamiliar gun it was too risky i didnt want to accidentally shoot the woman in the head killing the hostage is always frowned upon the vampire waiters and waitresses didnt know what to do if id been some schmuck off the street they might have tried to jump me but i was their masters beloved which made things a little sticky i kept a sort of peripheral eye on them you guys back up and give me some roomright now they all glanced at each other you dont want to crowd me boys and girls so move it they moved when i was close enough to feel confident that i could make the shot i stopped let her go damian she will not be harmed anita just a little fun shes unwilling thats against the law even for entertainment purposes so let her go or ill blow your fucking head off would you really shoot me in front of all these witnesses you bet i said besides youre over five hundred years old i dont think one shot to the head will kill you not permanently at least but itll hurt like hell and may leave scars you wouldnt want to spoil that beautiful face now would you i was getting tired of holding one arm out it wasnt that the gun was heavy but it was hard to hold a onehanded pose for long without starting to waver i didnt want to waver he stared at me for a space of heartbeats he very carefully very slowly licked the side of the womans neck strange green eyes staring at me the whole time it was a dare if he thought i was bluffing hed picked the wrong girl i let my breath out until my body was quiet and i could hear my pulse in my ears i sighted down my arm down the gun and he was gone hed moved so suddenly it startled me i moved my finger off the trigger and pointed the gun skyward waiting for my heart to stop pounding he was standing just at the edge of the light leaving the woman emptyfaced waiting damian stared at me are you going to interrupt our entertainment every night he asked i dont like it i said but pick a volunteer and i have no quarrel with you a volunteer he said turning in a circle to view the audience they all stared at him he licked his lips and hands went up i shook my head and put the gun up i took the womans hand release her damian i said he glanced back at her and did it her eyes flew open wide searching frantically like someone awakened from a nightmare to find it real i patted her hand its all right youre safe now whats happening whats happening she caught sight of damian and started sobbing hysterically jeanclaude appeared on the edge of the light you have nothing to fear from us fair lady he glided towards us she started screaming he wont hurt you i said i promise whats your name she kept screaming she was taller than me but i touched her face putting a hand on either side forcing her to look at me whats your name karen she whispered my names karen were going to walk off this dance floor karen and no one will hurt you you have my word she nodded over and over breath coming so fast i was afraid she was going to pass out cassandra walked into the light but stayed back can i help jeanclaude had not moved since karen started screaming he just looked at me and i still couldnt read his expression yeah i said i could use some help karen shied away from her shes not a vampire i said she let cassandra take her other arm and we led her off the dance floor away from the light jeanclaude stepped onto center stage and his voice followed us into the darkness did you enjoy our little melodrama there was a puzzled silence his voice was like fur wrapping the crowd in the dark breathing in their fear giving them back desire we do not tease here at danse macabre who would like to experience the reality of damians kiss someone would take him up on it someone always did if anyone could salvage the show after the womans hysterics jeanclaude could liv came to help i think karen took one look at the musclebound vamp and fainted dead away she was not a small woman and it surprised both cassandra and myself she sagged to the floor liv started to come closer but i waved her off a woman from the crowd came towards us hesitantly can i help she asked she was about the same size as cassandra and me small with long reddish hair that swung to her waist straight and fine she was dressed in a pair of dark brown dress slacks the kind that run large and have cuffs and are usually linen for a shirt she wore only a vest with a silk camisole under it i glanced at cassandra she shrugged thanks if you could take her feet cassandra could have flung the woman across her shoulders in a firemans carry but most lycanthropes didnt like to show off their strength i could have carried her too even if she was so bloody tall i could still have carried her for a short distance but not fast and not too far the woman shoved her clutch purse under one arm and took the unconscious womans feet we got moving a little awkwardly but we managed to get a rhythm and cassandra took us to the womens rest room or i should say lounge the front part had a couch and a lighted vanity it was white and black with a mural on the wall that was from a woodcut that i knew entitled demonlover the demon in this version looked suspiciously like jeanclaude and i doubted it was accidental we laid karen on the black couch the woman who was helping dampened some paper towels without being asked and brought them back i laid them against karens forehead and neck thanks is she going to be all right the woman asked i didnt answer because that all depended on damian whats your name the woman smiled almost shyly anabelle anabelle smith i smiled up at her anita blake this is cassandra i realized i didnt know her last name jeanclaude always called his wolves by only their first names like a pet im sorry i dont know your last name cassandra is fine she shook anabelles hand they smiled at each other should we report what happened to the police anabelle asked i mean that vampire was going to force himself on her thats illegal right karen stirred on the couch moaning yeah its illegal i said anabelle raised an interesting point i could report it to the cops if a vampire acquired three complaints against him or her you could get a death warrant issued if you got the right judge i would talk to jeanclaude and damian first but if they didnt give me the answers i wanted maybe i should go to the cops i shook my head what are you thinking she asked nothing worth sharing i said the bathroom door opened raina walked in wearing a creamcolored dress as short as my own the dark hose and stiletto high heels made her legs go on forever she wore a fur jacket in a dusty red probably fox she was the only shapeshifter id met who wore real fur that wasnt her own shed pulled her auburn hair on top of her head in a soft bun with loose strands of hair curled artfully around her face and neck karen chose that minute to regain consciousness i wasnt sure she was going to like her wakeup call i knew i didnt i stood cassandra moved in front of me and a little to one side not blocking me but closer to the danger than i was i wasnt used to anyone guarding me it felt odd i could take care of myself that was the point wasnt it whats happening anabelle asked karen was looking around eyes going wide again where am i anabelle can you sit with karen please i smiled when i asked but i didnt take my eyes from raina the door had closed behind her and there wasnt enough room to maneuver not really if cassandra could hold her for a even a few seconds i could get the gun out but somehow i didnt think raina had come to fight i think shed have worn different shoes anabelle sat on the couch and literally held karens hand but she was watching the rest of us hell it might be a better show than what was outside what do you want raina i asked she gave a wide smile with her lipsticked mouth baring small even white teeth its the ladies room isnt it i came to powder my nose and to see how our frightened guest is doing she took two steps into the room and cassandra moved in front of her blocking her way raina stared down at her you forget yourself wolf her voice held a low edge of growl i forget nothing cassandra said then stand aside she said what did you mean by our guest i asked she smiled at me i am jeanclaudes partner in this little enterprise didnt he tell you from the look on her face she knew the answer and was enjoying it i guess it slipped his mind i said why arent you part of the show then im a silent partner she said she pushed past cassandra body brushing the smaller woman she knelt by the couch how are you feeling my dear karen stammered i just want to go home of course you do she glanced up and smiled if one of you would help me get her to her feet theres a cab waiting to take her anywhere she wants to go at the clubs expense or did you want to ride home with your friends karen shook her head they arent my friends so wise of you to realize that raina said so many people put their trust in the wrong people she stared at me while she said the last and they get hurt or worse anabelle had moved away from raina she was staring at all of us clutching her purse i dont think she understood everything we were saying but she obviously was not having a good time one good deed and she was already being punished can you stand why dont you help me raina asked anabelle no let cassandra help you i said afraid i might eat your newfound friend i smiled youll eat anything that cant get away we all know that her face tightened anger flashing through her amber brown eyes in the end anita we will see who eats what she helped the woman to stand cassandra whispered jeanclaude told me to guard you make sure she gets into a cab that really is going to take her home then you can follow me around for the rest of the evening okay cassandra nodded jeanclaude wont like it im not too happy with him right now either i said a little help here raina said cassandra sighed but she took karens other arm and they helped her through the door when the door closed behind them anabelle let out a long sigh what is going on i turned to the lighted mirror leaning my hands on the vanity top i shook my head its too long a story and the less you know the safer youll be i have to confess i have an ulterior motive i watched her through the mirror and she looked embarrassed i didnt just help out of the goodness of my heart im a reporter freelance a quote from the executioner would really put me on the map i mean i could name my price especially if you explained what just happened here i bowed my head a reporter not exactly what i needed tonight anabelle came up behind me it was real on the dance floor wasnt it that vampiredamian right he was really going to do her right there as part of the show i watched her face in the mirror she was vibrating with eagerness she wanted to touch me you could see her hands fluttering nervous it was a big story if i corroborated it it would serve jeanclaude right if i did something went through anabelles eyes some of the brightness leaked away several things happened almost simultaneously anabelle jerked my purse the strap broke she took a step back and drew a gun from an innerpants holster under her vest the door opened and three laughing women entered the women screamed anabelle looked at the door for just a heartbeat i drew a knife and turned i didnt try and walk those two steps to her i dropped to one knee and lunged my body like a line with the knife as the point the knife entered her upper stomach the gun moved towards me i used my left hand to sweep the arm away the shot went wild cracking the mirror i shoved the knife upward under her sternum shoved it until the hilt met flesh and bone and jerked the blade up and sideways her hand convulsed on the gun and another shot hit the carpeted floor the silencer made each shot seem muffled almost anticlimactic she sank to her knees eyes wide mouth opening and closing i ran my hand down her arm and took the gun from her she blinked at me eyes unbelieving then she fell abruptly as if her strings had been cut she twitched twice and died edward was at the door gun out pointed he stared from me to the fresh corpse he took in the knife still protruding from her chest the gun with silencer in my hand he relaxed pointing the gun at the floor some bodyguard i turned out to be letting you get dusted in the ladies room i stared up at him i felt numb distant with shock she almost got me i said but she didnt he said i heard mens voices shouting police everybody stay where they are well check it out shit i said softly and with feeling i laid anabelles gun by her body and sat back on the carpet i wasnt sure i could stand right then edward holstered his gun and moved back from the door to join the crowd that was pushing forward to see the show just another part of the anonymous throng yeah right i sat there beside the corpse and tried to think of something to tell the cops i wasnt sure the truth was an option i could afford right now i began to wonder if i was going to see the inside of a jail tonight watching the blood soak the front of anabelles vest it seemed likely i was sitting in a straightbacked chair in jeanclaudes office at danse macabre my hands were cuffed behind me they hadnt let me wash the blood off my right hand and it had dried to a nice tacky substance i was used to having dried blood on me but it was still uncomfortable the uniformed officers had taken the other knife and found the seecamp in my purse they had not found the big knife in the spine sheath it had been a sloppy search to have missed a knife longer than my forearm but the uniform that did it had at first assumed that i was another victim it had shaken him to find out that the pretty little woman was a murderer oh excuse me alleged murderer the office had white walls black carpet a desk that looked like carved ebony there was a red lacquer screen with a black castle done high on top of a black mountain there was a framed kimono on the far wall scarlet with black and royal blue designs two smaller frames held fans one white and black with what looked like a tea ceremony painted on it the other blue and white with a flock of cranes i liked the cranes best and id had plenty of time to make a choice one of the uniforms had remained in the room with me the entire time theyd drunk coffee and not offered me any the younger uniform would have uncuffed me but his partner had pretty much threatened to beat the shit out of him if he did it the partner was greyhaired with eyes as cold and empty as edwards his name was rizzo looking at him i was glad id put the gun on the floor before he came into the room why you may ask wasnt i at the police station being questioned answer the media had bayed us four uniforms had been enough to control traffic and keep the media from mobbing anyoneuntil they smelled a breaking story suddenly there were cameras and microphones everywhere like mushrooms after a rain the uniforms had called for backup and barricaded the murder scene and the office everything else had fallen to the cameras and microphones there was a homicide detective standing over melooming actually detective greeley was just under six feet tall so broadshouldered he looked like a big square most black people arent truly black but greeley was close his face was so dark it had purple highlights his closecropped greying hair looked like wool but black white or brown his dark eyes were neutral secret cop eyes his gaze said hed seen it all and hadnt been impressed by any of it he certainly wasnt impressed by me if anything he looked bored but i knew better id seen dolph get the same look right before he pounced on someone and tore their alibi apart since i didnt have an alibi i wasnt worried about that id told my story before they read me my rights after greeley mirandized me all id said was that i wanted a lawyer i was beginning to sound like a broken record even to me the detective pulled a chair around so he was sitting facing me he even hunkered down trying not to be so intimidating once we get a lawyer in here greeley said we cant help you anymore anita he didnt know me well enough to call me by my first name but i let it go he was pretending to be my friend i knew better cops are never your friends if they suspect you of murder conflict of interest it sounds like a clearcut case of selfdefense tell me what happened and ill bet we can do a deal i want my lawyer i said once we involve a lawyer the deal goes out the window he said you dont have the authority to make a deal i said i want my lawyer the skin around his eyes tightened otherwise he looked the same unmoved but i was pissing him off couldnt blame him the door to the office opened greeley looked up ready to be angry at the interruption dolph walked inside flashing his badge his eyes gave the briefest of flicks to me then settled solidly on greeley greeley stood up excuse me anita ill be right back he even managed a friendly smile he was putting so much effort into the act it was almost a shame i wasnt buying it besides if he was really being friendly hed have taken the cuffs off greeley tried to get dolph to step outside but dolph shook his head the office is secure the rest of the club isnt whats that supposed to mean greeley said it means your murder scene complete with victim is being flashed on national television you ordered that no one was to talk to the press so theyve been speculating vampires run amok is the choice rumor you want me to tell the media that a woman attached to a police squad is being charged with murder you have three witnesses that all say ms smith pulled her gun first that it was selfdefense thats something for the assistant district attorney to decide greeley said funny how when he was talking to me he could make a deal now that he was talking to another cop suddenly the ada was the only one who could make a deal call them dolph said just like that greeley said you want to cut her loose shell make a statement after we get her and her lawyer down to the station greeley made a rude sound in his throat yeah shes real hot for her lawyer go talk to the press greeley and tell them what that vampires arent involved that it was just bad timing that the murder happened at danse macabre greeley glanced back at me i want her here when i get back storr no disappearing act well both be here greeley glared at me all his anger and frustration filling his eyes for a second the friendly mask was gone make sure you are the brass may want you in on this but this is a homicide case my case he shoved a finger at dolph not quite touching him dont fuck with it greeley pushed past him and shut the door firmly silence thick enough to walk on filled the room dolph pulled a chair up in front of the desk next to me and sat facing me he clasped his big hands together and stared i stared back the three women say ms smith pulled her gun first she ripped your purse off so she knew where your gun was he said i flashed it a little too much tonight my fault i heard about you joining the show out there what happened i had to police the show a little the woman didnt want to play its illegal to use preternatural powers to coerce anyone into doing something they dont want to do you arent a policeman anita it was the first time hed ever reminded me of that usually dolph treated me like one of his people hed even encouraged me to simply say i was with his squad so people would assume i was a detective you kicking me off the squad dolph my stomach was tight as i asked i valued working with the police i valued dolph and zerbrowski and the rest of the guys it would hurt more than i wanted to admit to lose all that two bodies in two days anita both of them normal humans thats a lot of explaining at headquarters if theyd been vamps or some other creepiecrawlie everyone would look the other way is that it picking a fight with me isnt your best bet right now anita we stared at each other for a second or two i looked away first and nodded why are you here dolph i handle the media a lot but youre letting greeley talk to the press youve got to tell me whats going on anita his voice was quiet but i knew by the tightness around his eyes the way he held his shoulders that he was angry i guess i couldnt blame him what do you want to hear dolph i asked the truth would be nice he said i think i need a lawyer first i wasnt going to spill my guts just because dolph was my friend he was still a cop and i had killed someone dolphs eyes narrowed he turned to the uniform still leaning against the wall rizzo go get some coffee black for me what do you want in yours coffee was coming things were looking up two sugars one cream get some for yourself rizzo and take your time officer rizzo pushed away from the wall where hed been leaning you sure about this sergeant storr dolph looked at him just looked at him rizzo held his hands out in a sort of push away gesture i dont want greeley riding my ass about leaving you two alone get the coffee officer rizzo ill take any heat that comes down rizzo left shaking his head probably at the stupidity of plainclothes detectives when we were alone dolph said turn around i stood up and offered him my hands he uncuffed me but didnt pat me down again he probably assumed rizzo had done it i didnt tell him about the knife they missed which would piss him off if he found it later but hey i couldnt let the cops confiscate all my weapons besides i didnt want to be unarmed tonight i sat back down resisting the urge to rub my wrists i was heapbigvampireslayer nothing could hurt me yeah right talk to me anita off the record i asked he stared at me eyes flat and unreadable good cop eyes i should say no but i said off the record tell me i told him i changed only one thing that an anonymous call had alerted me to the contract on me other than that it was the absolute truth i thought dolph would be happy but he wasnt and you dont know why someone would put a contract out on you for that kind of money with a time limit on it no he stared at me as if trying to decide how much truth i was telling him why didnt you tell us about the anonymous phone call earlier he put a lot of stress on the word anonymous i shrugged habit i guess no you wanted to hotdog it instead of hiding out you came here and played bait if the hitter had used a bomb you could have gotten a lot of people hurt but she didnt use a bomb did she he took a deep breath and let it out slowly if i hadnt known better id have said he was counting to ten you got lucky he said i know dolph stared at me she nearly did you if those women hadnt come in when they did i wouldnt be talking to you now you dont seem worried shes dead im not whats to worry about for that kind of money anita therell be someone else tomorrow its after midnight and im still alive maybe the contract will be canceled why the time limit i shook my head if i knew that i might know who put the hit out on me and if you find out who put the money up what will you do he asked i stared at him off the record or not dolph was still the ultimate cop he took his job very seriously ill turn the name over to you i wish i believed that anita i really do i gave him my best wideeyed innocent look what do you mean can the little girl routine anita i know you too well fine but you and i both know that as long as the money is out there hitters will keep coming im good dolph but no ones that good eventually ill lose unless the money goes away no contract no more hitters we stared at each other we can put you in protective custody dolph said for how long forever i shook my head besides the next hitter might use a bomb you want to risk your people i dont so youll hunt the money man down and kill him i didnt say that dolph but thats what youre planning he said dont keep asking the question dolph the answer wont change he stood hands gripping the back of the chair dont cross the line with me anita were friends but im a cop first i value our friendship dolph but i value my life and yours more you think i cant handle myself i think youre a cop and that means you have to play by the rules dealing with professional hitters that can get you killed there was a knock on the door enter dolph said rizzo came in with a round tray and three slender black china mugs there were little red coffee stirrers in each one rizzo glanced from dolph to me he stared at my uncuffed hands but didnt say anything he sat the tray on the desk far enough from me that i couldnt have grabbed him officer rizzo looked like a twentyyear man and he was still treating me like a very dangerous person i doubted that hed have turned his back on anabelle if she hadnt grabbed my purse she could have shot me in the back oh id have seen it in the mirror but id have never gotten my gun out in time id never have let a man no matter how friendly or how helpful come up behind me like that id made the same mistake with anabelle that people made with me id seen a small pretty woman and underestimated her i was a female chauvinist piglet it had nearly been a fatal flaw dolph handed me the mug that held the lightestcolored coffee it was too much to hope that the cream would be real but either way it looked wonderful id never met coffee that wasnt wonderful it was just a matter of how wonderful it was i took a hesitant sip of the steaming liquid and made appreciative mmm sounds it was real coffee and real cream glad you like it rizzo said i looked up at him thank you officer he grunted and moved away from us to lean against the other wall i talked to ted forrester your pet bounty hunter the gun in your purse is registered to him dolph sat back down blowing on his coffee ted forrester was one of edwards aliases it had stood up to police scrutiny once before when we ended up with bodies on the ground he was as far as the police knew a bounty hunter specializing in preternatural creatures most bounty hunters stayed in the western states where there were still substantial bounties on shapeshifters not all of them were particularly careful that the shapeshifter they killed was really a danger to anyone the only criteria some states had was that after death the body was medically certified as a lycanthrope a blood test was sufficient in most cases wyoming was thinking of changing its laws because of three wrongful death suits that had made it all the way to their state supreme court i needed a gun small enough to fit in the purse but with stopping power i said i dont like bounty hunters anita they abuse the law i sipped coffee and stayed quiet if he knew just how much edward abused the law hed have locked him up for a very long time if hes a good enough friend to bail your ass out of this kind of trouble why havent you mentioned him before i didnt know he existed until that last trouble you had with those shapeshifter poachers poachers i said and shook my head whats wrong dolph asked shapeshifters get killed and its poaching normal people get killed and its murder you sympathizing with the monsters now anita he asked his voice was even quieter so still you might have mistaken it for calm but it wasnt he was pissed youre mad about something other than the body count i said youre involved with the master of the city is that how you keep getting all that inside info on the monsters i took a deep breath and let it out sometimes you should have told me anita since when is my personal life police business he just looked at me i looked down into my coffee mug staring at my hands i finally looked back up it was hard meeting his eyes harder than i wanted it to be what do you want me to say dolph that i find it embarrassing that one of the monsters is my boyfriend i do then drop him if it were that easy trust me id do it how can i trust you to do your job anita youre sleeping with the enemy why does everyone assume im sleeping with him doesnt anybody but me date people and not have sex i apologize for the assumption but you got to admit a lot of people are going to assume the same thing i know the door opened and greeley came back inside his eyes took in the handcuffs being gone the coffee you have a nice chat howd your statement to the press go dolph asked he shrugged i told them ms blake was being questioned in connection with a death on the premises told em that no vamps were involved not sure they believed me they kept wanting to speak to the executioner though most of them were calling her the masters girlfriend that made me flinch even with a career of my own i was going to end up being mrs jeanclaude in the press he was more photogenic than i was dolph stood i want to take anita out of here greeley stared at him i dont think so dolph set his coffee on the desk and went to stand next to the other detective he lowered his voice and there was a lot of harsh whispering greeley shook his head no more whispering greeley glared at me all right but she comes down to the station before the night is over or its your ass sergeant shell be there dolph said rizzo was staring at all of us youre taking her out of here but not to the station house it sounded accusatory even to me thats my decision rizzo greeley said you got that his voice growled the words somehow dolph had pulled rank and greeley didnt like it if rizzo wanted to make himself a convenient target for that anger fine rizzo faded back against the wall but he wasnt happy about it i got that get her out of here greeley said try the back but i dont know how youll get past the cameras well walk through dolph said lets go anita i set my mug on the desk whats up dolph i got a body for you to look at a murder suspect helping with another case wont the brass get mad i cleared it dolph said i looked at him eyes wide how i asked you dont want to know he said i looked at him he stared back i finally looked away first most of the time when people said i didnt want to know it meant just the opposite it meant i probably needed to know but from a handful of people id take their word for it dolph was one of those people okay i said lets go dolph let me wash the dried blood off my hands and we went im not a big one for idle chatter but dolph makes me seem loquacious we drove down in silence the hiss of the wheels on the road and the thrum of the engine the only sounds either hed turned off his radio or nobody was committing crimes in saint louis tonight i was betting the radio was off one of the good things about being a detective on a task force is you dont have to listen to the radio all the time because most of the calls arent your problem if dolph was needed somewhere they could always beep him i tried to hold out i tried to make dolph talk first but after nearly fifteen minutes i broke where are we going creve coeur my eyebrows raised thats a little upscale for a monster kill yeah he said i waited for more there wasnt any more well thanks for enlightening me dolph he glanced at me then back to the road well be there in a few minutes anita patience has never been my strong suit dolph his lips twitched then he smiled finally he laughed a short abrupt sound i guess not glad i could lighten the mood i said youre always good for a laugh when youre not killing people anita i didnt know what to say to that too close to the truth maybe silence settled over the car and i left it alone it was an easy friendly quiet this time tinged with laughter dolph wasnt mad at me anymore i could stand a little silence creve coeur was an older neighborhood but it didnt look it the age showed in the large houses set in long sloping yards some of the houses had circular drives and servants quarters the few housing developments that had crept in here and there didnt always have big yards but the houses had variety pools rock gardens no cookie cutter houses nothing dйclassй olive is one of my favorite streets i like the mix of gas stations dunkin donuts custom order jewelry stores mercedesbenz dealerships and blockbuster music and video creve coeur isnt like most ritzy areas at war with the peons this part of the city has embraced both its money and its commerce as comfortable buying fine antiques as taking the kiddies through the driveup line at mickeyds dolph turned on a road sandwiched between two gas stations it sloped sharply making me want to use the brake dolph didnt share this desire and the car coasted down the hill at a nice clip well he was the police no speeding ticket i guess we sped past housing developments that branched off the road like true suburbia the houses were still more distinct but the yards had shrunk and you knew that most of what you were driving past had never had servants quarters the road climbed just a touch then evened out dolph hit his turn signal while we were still in the shallow valley a tasteful sign said countryside hills police cars clogged the narrow streets of the subdivision lights strobing the darkness there was a huddle of people being held back by uniformed police people clutching light coats over their jammies or standing with robes tied tight the crowd was small as we got out of the car i saw a drape twitch in a house across the street why come outside when you can peek from the comfort of your own home dolph led me through the uniforms and the twist of yellow donotcross tape the house that was the center of attention was one story with a brick wall as tall as the walls of the house forming an enclosed courtyard there was even a wrought iron gate to the curved entrance very mediterranean except for the courtyard the house looked like a typical suburban ranch there was a stone path and square rockedged beds full of rosebushes floodlights filled the walled garden lending every petal and leaf its own shadow someone had gone way overboard on the inground lighting you dont even need a flashlight in here i said dolph glanced at me youve never been here then i met his eyes and couldnt read them he was giving me cop eyes no ive never been here should i have been dolph opened the screened door without answering he led the way in and i followed dolph prides himself on not influencing his people letting them come in cold and make their own conclusions but even for him he was being mysterious i didnt like it the living room was narrow but long with a tv and video center at the end of it the room was so thick with cops there was barely room to stand every murder scene gets more attention than it needs frankly i wonder if more evidence is lost with all the traffic than is found with all the busy hands a murder can make a cops career especially that jump from uniform to plainclothes find the clue or the evidence shine at the critical time and people notice but its more than that murder is the ultimate insult the last worst thing you can do to another human being cops feel that maybe more than the rest of us the cops parted before dolph eyes shifting to me most of the eyes were male and after the first glance almost all of them did the full body look you know the look the one that if the face and top match they just have to see if the legs are as good as the rest it works in reverse too but any man that starts at my feet and ends with my face has lost every brownie point he ever had two short hallways led straight off the living room at right angles a dining room directly off of the first room an open door revealed carpeted stairs leading to a finished basement cops were traveling up and down the stairs like ants with bits of evidence in plastic baggies dolph led me down one of the hallways and there was a second living room with a fireplace it was smaller and more boxlike but the far wall was entirely brick which made it seem warmer cozier the kitchen showed to the left through an open doorway the top half of the wall was a passthrough open like a window so you could work in the kitchen and still talk to people in the living room my fathers house had a passthrough the next room was obviously new the walls still had that raw paint look of fresh construction sliding glass doors made up the lefthand wall a hot tub took up most of the floor space water still clung in beads to its slick surface theyd finished the hot tub before theyd painted the room priorities a hallway so roughed out it still had that heavy plastic they put down for workers to walk on led away from the tub there was another larger bathroom not quite finished and a closed door at the end of the hall the door was carved new wood lightcolored oak it was the first closed door id seen inside the house that was kind of ominous except for the cops i hadnt seen a damn thing out of place it looked like a nice uppermiddleclass house a family kind of house if id walked straight into carnage id have been all right but this long buildup had tightened my stomach filled me with dread what had happened in this nice house with its new hot tub and brick fireplace what had happened that needed my kind of expertise i didnt want to know i wanted to leave before i saw some new horror id seen enough bodies already this year to last a lifetime dolph put his hand on the doorknob i touched his arm its not kids is it i asked he glanced over his shoulder at me normally he wouldnt have answered hed have said something cryptic like youll see in a minute tonight he said no its not kids i took a deep breath through my nose and let it out slowly through my lips good i smelled damp plaster fresh cement and underneath that blood the scent of freshly spilled blood faint just behind the door what does blood smell like metallic almost artificial it isnt really much of a smell all by itself the smell wont make you sick its what goes with it we all know in some ancient part of ourselves that blood is the thing without it we die if we can steal enough of it from our enemies we steal their lives theres a reason that blood has been associated with almost every religion on the planet its primal stuff and no matter how sanitized we make our world part of us still recognizes that dolph hesitated hand still on the doorknob he didnt look at me while he spoke tell me what you think of the scene then i have to take you back for a statement you understand that i understand i said if youre lying to me anita about any of this tell me tonight two bodies in two days takes a lot of explaining i havent lied to you dolph at least not much i added in my head he nodded without turning around and opened the door he went in first and turned so he could watch my face as i entered the room whats wrong dolph i asked see for yourself he said all i could see at first was pale grey carpet and a bureau with a large mirror against the righthand wall a cluster of cops blocked my view of the rest of the room the cops stepped aside at a nod from dolph dolph never took his eyes from me my face id never seen him so intent on my reaction before it made me nervous there was a body on the floor a man spreadeagled pinned at wrists and ankles with knives the knives had black hilts he lay in the middle of a large red circle the circle had had to be large so the blood didnt leak out and spoil it blood had soaked into the pale carpet spread across it like a red ruin the mans face was turned away from me all i could see was short blond hair his chest was bare so slick with blood it looked like a red shirt the knives held him in place they hadnt been what killed him no what had killed him was a gaping hole in his lower chest just below the ribs it was like a redlined cave big enough to plunge both hands into they took his heart i said dolph looked at me you know that from the doorway im right arent i if you were going to take his heart out why not go straight down if you wanted him to survive like heart surgery youd have to break the ribs and go down the hard way but they wanted him dead if all you want is the heart going under the ribs is easier i walked towards the body dolph moved ahead of me watching my face what i said he shook his head just tell me about the body anita i stared at him what is your problem tonight no problem it was a lie something was up but i didnt press it it wouldnt have done me any good when dolph decides not to share information he doesnt share period there was a kingsize bed with purple satin sheets and more pillows than you knew what to do with the bed was rumpled as if it had been used for something other than sleeping there were dark stains on the sheets nearly black is that blood we think so dolph said i glanced at the body from the murder when youre finished looking at the body well bag the sheets and get them down to the lab a subtle hint to get on with the job i walked towards the body and tried to ignore dolph that was easier than it sounded the body sort of stole the show the closer i got the more details i could see and the more i didnt want to see under all that blood was a nice chest muscular but not too much of a good thing the hair was cut very short curly and blond there was something naggingly familiar about that head the black daggers had silver wire curled around them theyd been shoved to their hilts in the flesh bones had broken when theyd been driven in the red circle was definitely blood cabalistic symbols ran round the inside of the circle traced in blood i recognized some of them enough to know that we were dealing with some form of necromancy i knew the symbols that stood for death and the symbols that watched against it for some reason i didnt want to enter the circle i walked carefully around the edge of it until i could see the face with my back leaning against the wall i stared into the wide eyes of robert the vampire monicas husband the soontobe daddy shit i said softly you know him dolph asked i nodded robert his names robert the death symbols made sense if you were going to sacrifice a vampire but why why like this i took a step forward and hit the circle i stopped dead it was like a million insects crawled and swarmed over my body i couldnt breathe i stepped back off the blood line the sensation stopped i could still feel it like a memory on my skin in my head but i was okay now i took a deep breath let it out slowly and stepped forward again it wasnt like hitting a wall it was more like hitting a blanket a drowning suffocating maggotcrawling blanket i tried to walk forward tried to move past the circle and couldnt i staggered back from it if the wall hadnt been there id have fallen i let myself slide down until i was sitting with my knees tucked up my toes were inches from the circle i did not want to touch it again dolph walked through the circle like it wasnt there and knelt beside me part of him still in the circle anita whats wrong i shook my head im not sure i stared up at him its a circle of power and i cant cross it he glanced back at his own body partially inside the circle i can youre not an animator im not a witch and i dont know a lot of official magic but some of the symbols are either death symbols or maybe symbols of protection from the dead i stared up at him my skin still shivering from trying to cross the line a new horror spread through my mind its a spell to both contain and keep out the dead and i cant cross it he stared down at me what exactly does that mean anita it means said a female voice that she didnt create the circle a woman stood just inside the door she was tall slender dressed in a purple skirt suit with a white mantailored shirt she walked into the room with an eagerness that made me knock about ten years off her age she looked thirty but she wasnt twentysomething and full of herself probably around my own age but there was a shiny newness to her that id lost years ago dolph stood offering me a hand up i shook my head unless you want to carry me i cant stand yet anita this is detective reynolds he said he didnt sound entirely happy about it reynolds walked around the edge of the circle as i had but she was coming for a better view of me she ended up on the opposite side from dolph she stared down at me smiling eager i stared up at her skin still jumping from trying to force my way past the circle she leaned down and whispered youre flashing the room dear thats why the underwear matches i said she looked surprised there was no way for me to stretch my legs out without touching the circle again so if i wanted to quit flashing the room i had to stand up i held my hand up to dolph help me up but whatever you do dont let me fall into that thing detective reynolds took my other arm without being invited but frankly i needed the help my legs felt like spaghetti the moment she touched me the hair on my body stood at attention i jerked away from her and would have fallen into the circle if dolph hadnt caught me whats wrong anita dolph asked i leaned into him and tried to breathe slowly and evenly i cant take anymore magic right this moment get her a chair from the dining room dolph said he didnt speak to anyone in particular but a uniform left the room probably to get the chair dolph picked me up while we waited since i couldnt stand it was hard to protest but i felt like a damn fool whats on your back anita dolph asked id forgotten about the knife in the spine sheath i was saved from having to answer by the uniform bringing one of the straightbacked chairs into the room dolph eased me into the chair did detective reynolds try a spell on you i shook my head someone explain what just happened an unhealthy flush crept up reynolds pale neck i tried to read her aura sort of why dolph asked just curious ive read about necromancers but never met one before i looked up at her if you want to do any more experiments detective ask first she nodded looking younger more unsure of herself i am sorry reynolds dolph said she looked at him yes sir go stand over there she glanced at both of us and nodded yes sir she walked over to stand by the other cops she tried to be nonchalant about it but she kept looking over at us since when do you have a witch on the payroll i asked reynolds is the first detective ever with preternatural abilities she got her pick of assignments she wanted to join our squad i was happy to hear him call it our squad she said i didnt draw the circle did you really think id done that i pointed at the body he stared down at me you didnt like robert if i killed everyone i didnt like saint louis would be littered with bodies i said why else did you drag me down here shes a witch she probably knows more about the spell than i do dolph stared down at me explain i raise the dead but im not a trained witch most of what i do is just i shrugged sort of natural ability i studied basic magic theory in college but for only a couple of classes so if you want feedback on a detailed spell like this one i cant help you if reynolds hadnt been here what would you have suggested we do find a witch to undo the spell for you he nodded any thoughts on who or why he jabbed his thumb behind his back at the body jeanclaude made robert a vampire thats a strong bond i think the spell was to prevent him from knowing what was happening could robert have alerted his master from this far away i thought about that i wasnt sure i dont know maybe some master vampires are better at telepathy than others im not sure how good jeanclaude is with other vampires this setup took a while dolph said why kill him like this good question i said i had a nasty idea its a weird way to do it but this might be a challenge to jeanclaudes control over his territory how so dolph had his little notebook out now pen poised it was almost like old times robert belonged to him and now somebodys killed him could be a message he glanced back at the body but who is the message meant for maybe robert pissed someone off and it was personal if it was a message for your boyfriend why not kill him at jeanclaudes club thats where he worked right i nodded whoever did this couldnt have pulled off something so elaborate at the club with other vampires around no way they needed privacy they might have needed the spell just to keep jeanclaude or some other vamp from riding to the rescue i thought about it what did i really know about robert not much i knew him as jeanclaudes flunkie monicas boyfriend now husband a soontobe daddy everything i knew about him was through other peoples perceptions of him hed been killed in his own bedroom and all i could think of was that it was a message for jeanclaude i was thinking of him like a flunkie because jeanclaude treated him that way because he wasnt a master vampire no one would want to kill him for his own sake geez i was actually thinking of robert like a disposable commodity we could always make more youve thought of something dolph said not really maybe ive been hanging around vampires too long im beginning to think like one of them explain dolph said i assumed that roberts death was connected to his master my first thought was that no one would kill robert for his own sake because he wasnt important enough to kill i mean killing robert wont make you master of the city so why do it dolph looked at me youre beginning to worry me anita worry hell i said im beginning to scare me i tried to look at the murder scene fresh not like a vampire who would go to this much trouble to kill robert i didnt have the faintest idea except for this being a challenge to jeanclaudes authority i have no idea why anyone would kill robert i guess i dont really know that much about him it could be one of the hate groups humans first or humans against vampires but theyd have to have some heavy magical knowhow and either group would stone a witch as fast as stake a vampire they consider them both devil spawn why would the hate groups single out this vampire his wifes pregnant i said another vampire dolph asked i shook my head human dolphs eyes widened just a fraction it was the most surprise id ever seen from him dolph like most cops doesnt ruffle easily pregnant and the vampire is the father yes i said he shook his head yeah that might earn him a starring roll on the hate group hit parade tell me about vampire reproduction anita first i need to call jeanclaude why warn him i said i agree this probably is something personal to robert youre right humans first especially would kill him in a heartbeat but just in case i want to warn jeanclaude i had another thought maybe thats why someone wanted me dead what do you mean if they want to harm jeanclaude killing me would be a good way to do it i think half a million dollars is a little steep for bumping off someones girlfriend he shook his head that kind of money is personal anita someones afraid of you not your toothy boyfriend two hired killers in two days dolph and i still dont know why i stared up at him if i dont figure this thing out ill be dead he touched my shoulder well help you cops are good for some things even if the monsters wont talk to us thanks dolph i patted his hand did you really believe reynolds when she said i could have done this he straightened then met my eyes for a second yes after that it was a matter of listening to my detective we hired her so she could help out on the preternatural stuff it would be stupid to ignore her on her first case not to mention demoralizing i thought okay but did you really think i was capable of doing that i motioned towards the body ive seen you stake vamps anita ive seen you decapitate them why not this because robert was alive while they carved open his chest until they removed his heart he was alive hell when they took his heart im not sure how long he might have lived vampires are strange when it comes to death wounds sometimes they linger is that why they didnt take his head so hed suffer more maybe i said jeanclaude needs to be told in case it is a threat i repeated ill have someone call you dont trust me to tell him leave it alone anita for once i did what he asked even a year ago i wouldnt have trusted anyone dating a vampire id have assumed they were corrupt sometimes i still assumed that fine just call him now be bad if jeanclaude got wasted while we were debating who should warn him dolph motioned one of the uniforms over he scribbled something in his notebook tore the page out folded it and handed it to the uniform take this to detective perry the uniform left note in hand dolph glanced back at his notes now tell me about vampire reproduction he stared at what hed written in his notebook even saying that sounds wrong newly dead males often have leftover sperm from before death thats the most common doctors recommend you wait six weeks before sex after youve become a vampire sort of like after a vasectomy those babies are usually healthy being fertile is a lot rarer in older vamps frankly until i saw robert and his wife at a party i didnt know vamps as old as he is could make babies how old was robert a century and some change can female vamps get pregnant he asked sometimes with the newly dead it happens but the body spontaneously aborts or reabsorbs the baby a dead body cant give life i hesitated what dolph asked there have been two reported cases of an older female vampire giving birth i shook my head it wasnt pretty and it certainly wasnt human did the babies survive for a while i said the case thats the best documented was from the early s back when dr henry mulligan was trying to find a cure for vampirism in the basement of old saint louis city hospital one of his patients had given birth mulligan thought it was a sign that life was returning to her body the baby had been born with a full set of pointed teeth and been more cannibal than vampire doctor mulligan carried a scar on his wrist from the delivery until the day he died which was about three years later when one of his patients crushed his face dolph stared down at his notebook i write it all down but frankly this is one bit of information i hope i never have to use they killed the baby didnt they yes i said before you ask the father was not mentioned the implication is that the father was human and may even have been dr mulligan himself vampires cant make babies without a human partner as far as we know nice to know humans are good for something besides blood he said i shrugged i guess truthfully the thought of giving birth to a child with severe vlad syndrome scared the hell out of me i never planned on having sex with jeanclaude but if it ever came up we were definitely taking precautions no spontaneous sex unless it included a condom something must have shown on my face because he asked penny for your thoughts just glad i have high moral standards i guess like i said until i saw robert and his wife i thought a vampire over a century was sterile and considering the length of time youd have to keep the vamps body temperature up i shook my headi dont see how it could be accidental but they both claimed it was she hasnt even gotten their amnio results back yet amnio test for what he asked vlad syndrome i said is she healthy enough to stand up under this kind of news he asked i shrugged she looked fine but im no expert id say she shouldnt be told over the phone and she probably shouldnt be alone i just dont know are you friends with the wife i shook my head no and dont even ask i am not going to hold monicas hand while she cries over her dead husband all right all right its outside your job description maybe ill let reynolds do it i glanced at the young woman she and monica probably deserved each other but jeanclaude might know who monicas friends are if he doesnt i know of one catherine maisongillete and monica work together monica is a lawyer dolph said i nodded great he said how much are you telling jeanclaude about this i asked why dolph asked because i want to know how much i can tell him you dont discuss ongoing homicide cases with the monsters he said the victim was his companion for over a century hes going to want to talk about it i need to know what youre telling him so i wont let something slip by accident you dont have a problem withholding information from your boyfriend not on a homicide whoever did this is at the very least a witch and maybe something scarier its probably one of the monsters one way or another so we cant tell the monsters all the details dolph looked at me long and steady then nodded keep back the heart and the symbols used in the spell hell have to know about the heart dolph or hell guess head or heart there isnt a lot else thatll kill a centuryold vamp you said youd withhold information anita im telling you what will wash and what wont dolph keeping back the heart from the vamps wont work because theyll guess the symbols fine but even there jeanclaudes going to have to have to wonder why he didnt feel robert die so what can we withhold from your boyfriend the exact symbols used in the spell the knives i thought about it for a moment how they got the heart out most people will still go through the ribs to tear out a heart they see all the hospital shows on tv and they dont think about doing it differently so if we get a suspect we ask howd you get the heart out i nodded the crazies will start talking about stakes or be vague okay he said dolph looked at me if anyone hated the monsters i thought it was you how can you date one of them i met his eyes this time not flinching i dont know he closed his notebook greeleys probably wondering where i took you what did you whisper to him i would have bet money that hed have held on to me told him you were a suspect in another murder said i wanted to watch your reaction and he bought that dolph glanced back at the body close to the truth anita he had me there greeley didnt seem to like me very much i said youd just killed a woman anita tends to give a bad first impression he had a point do i need to have catherine meet us down at the station i asked youre not under arrest dolph said id still like catherine to meet us at the station call her i stood dolph touched my arm wait he turned to the other cops everybody wait outside for a minute there were some glances but no one argued they just went theyd all worked with dolph before and no one present outranked him when we were alone behind closed doors he said give it up what youve got some kind of freaking blade down your back lets see it i sighed and reached under my hair to the hilt i drew the knife out it took a while it was a long knife dolph held out his hand i handed it to him he balanced it on his open hands and gave a low whistle jesus what were you planning to do with this i just looked at him who frisked you at the club rizzos partner i said have to have a talk with him dolph looked up at me be a bad thing to miss on someone who might use it is it the only weapon he missed yep he stared at me lean on the bureau anita my eyebrows raised youre going to pat me down yeah i thought about arguing but decided not to there were no more weapons to find i leaned on the bureau dolph laid the knife on the chair and searched me if thered been anything to find hed have found it dolph was thorough in everything he did methodical it was one of the things that made him a great cop i looked at him in the mirror without turning around satisfied yeah he handed the knife back to me hilt first i must have looked as surprised as i felt youre giving it back to me if youd lied to me about it being your last weapon id have kept it and everything i found he took a deep breath and let it out but i wont take your last weapon not with a contract out on you i took the knife and resheathed it it was a lot harder putting it back than getting it out i finally had to use the mirror to sort of direct me i take it its a new weapon dolph asked yeah i flipped my hair out over the sheath and presto you couldnt see it i was really going to have practice with it more it was too good a hiding place not to use more often any other impressions of the scene before i take you back was there forced entry no someone he knew then i said maybe i glanced at roberts still form could we finish this discussion in another room this one bother you i knew him dolph i might not have liked him but i knew him dolph nodded you can finish telling me all about it in the nursery i looked at him i could feel myself going pale i was not up to seeing what monica would have done with a nursery youre developing a mean streak dolph cant seem to get past the fact youre dating the master of the city anita just cant shake it you want to punish me because im dating a vampire he looked at me a long searching look i didnt look away i want you to not date him youre not my dad does your family know i did look away then no theyre catholic arent they i am not going to have this discussion with you dolph you need to have it with someone he said maybe but not with you look at him anita look at him and tell me you could sleep with that drop it i said i cant we stared at each other i was not going to stand here and explain my relationship with jeanclaude to dolph it wasnt any of his business then we have a problem there was a knock on the door not now dolph said come in i said the door opened goody zerbrowski walked in even better i knew i was grinning like an idiot but i couldnt seem to stop the last time id seen him had been the day he got out of the hospital hed been nearly gutted by a shapeshifter a wereleopard the size of a pony his attacker had been not a lycanthrope but a shapeshifting witch that was why zerbrowski wasnt turning furry once a month the witch had clawed him up horribly id killed it id held my hands over his stomach and pressed his intestines back into his body i still had the scars from the same monster zerbrowskis hair is normally curly and a mess black going grey hed cut it short enough that it stayed in place made him look more serious more grownup less like zerbrowski his suit was brown and looked like hed slept in it his tie was medium blue and matched nothing that he was wearing blake long time no see i couldnt help myself i walked over and hugged him there are benefits to being a girl though before richard came into my life i might have resisted the urge richard was bringing out my feminine side zerbrowski hugged me awkwardly laughing i always knew you wanted my body blake i pushed away from him you wish he eyed me up and down eyes glittering with laughter if you dress up like that every night i might leave katie for you if that skirt was any shorter itd be a lamp shade even with the teasing i was glad to see him how long have you been back on full duty not long i saw you on the news with your boyfriend news i said id forgotten about the media blitz jeanclaude and i had walked through he sure was pretty for a dead guy shit what dolph asked it was national media not just local so my father doesnt know zerbrowski laughed he does now shit i guess youll have that talk with your father after all dolph said there must have been something in dolphs voice or my face because the humor faded from zerbrowskis face whats up you two you look like someone stepped on your puppy dolph looked at me i looked at him philosophical differences i said finally dolph didnt add anything i hadnt really expected him to okay zerbrowski said he knew dolph well enough not to pry me alone hed have bugged the hell out of me but not dolph one of the nearest neighbors is a serious rightwing vampire hater he said that got our attention explain dolph said delbert spalding and his wife dora sat on the couch holding hands she offered me iced tea he objected to me saying that robert had been murdered said you couldnt kill the dead zerbrowski dug a wrinkled notebook out of his suit pocket he flipped some pages tried to smooth the page down gave up and quoted now that someone has destroyed that thing the woman should abort that monster shes carrying i dont believe in abortion normally but this is abomination pure abomination humans against vampires at the very least i said maybe even humans first maybe he just doesnt like living next door to a vampire dolph said zerbrowski and i looked at him did you ask mr spalding if he belonged to either of the hate groups dolph asked he had havs newsletters scattered on his coffee table gave me one great i said evangelizing hatemongers hav doesnt advocate this kind of violence dolph said the way he said it made me wonder what mailing list dolph was on i shook my head i wouldnt believe the worst of him just because he didnt like me dating the walking dead a few months back id have felt the same way humans first does i said well find out if mr spalding is a member of humans first dolph said you also need to find out if the spaldings have any magical talent i said how dolph said i could meet them be in the same room with them to be sure i might have to touch them shake hands i shook mr spaldings hand zerbrowski said it was like shaking anybody elses hand youre a great cop zerbrowski but youre almost a null you could shake the grand high poohbahs hand and not get more than a twinge dolphs a complete null whats a null dolph asked a magical null someone who has no magical or psychic ability its what let you cross the blood circle and kept me out so youre saying i have some magical ability zerbrowski asked i shook my head youre a tiny bit sensitive probably one of those people who get hunches that turn out to be right i get hunches dolph said ill bet your hunches are based on experience years of police work zerbrowski will make a leap of logic that makes no sense but proves to be true am i wrong they looked at each other then at me then both nodded zerbrowski has his moments dolph said you want to come shake the spaldings hands zerbrowski asked detective reynolds can do it its one of the reasons you brought her on board right they looked at each other again zerbrowski grinned ill get reynolds and go back over he stopped at the door katies been after me to invite you over for dinner meet the kids a real domestic affair he stared at me with his brown eyes guileless behind darkrimmed glasses i was going to tell you to bring richard but if youre dating count dracula now guess thatd be awkward he stared at me asking without asking im still seeing richard you pushy son of a bitch he smiled good bring him over a week from saturday katiell fix her famous mushroom chicken if i was only dating jeanclaude would the invitation still include my boyfriend no he said katies a little nervous i dont think shed be up to meeting count dracula his names jeanclaude i know he shut the door behind him and dolph and i were alone with the body once more the night was not looking up what are we hunting for anita i was actually relieved that dolph was talking business id had enough personal chitchat to last the night more than one murderer why i looked up at him i dont know if theres enough humans in the world to pin a vampire to the floor like that even if it was other vampires or shapeshifters itd take more than one id say two beings with abnormal strength to hold and a third to put in the knives maybe more to hold maybe more to do the spell i dont know but at least three even if they were vampires dolph asked i nodded unless one vamp was strong enough to have mind control over robert i looked down at the body careful not to touch the circle i forced myself to stare at what had been done to him no once they started putting knives in him i dont think any mind control would work a human yeah they could have done this to a human and made him smile while they did it but not another vamp did any of the neighbors see or hear anything i mean the spaldings may be involved so theyd lie but someone had to see or hear something he didnt go quietly they say no dolph said he said it like he knew some or all of them had lied one of the things cops learn first is that everyone lies some people to hide things some people just for the hell of it but everyone lies assume that everyone is hiding something it saves time i stared at roberts face his mouth halfopen slack there were rubbed marks at each corner of his mouth a slight reddening did you notice the marks by his mouth yes dolph said and you werent going to mention them to me you were a suspect i shook my head you didnt really believe that youre just playing all the details close to your chest like always i get tired of putting the pieces together when youve already done it so what do you make of the marks he asked his voice neutral you know damn well what i make of them he may have been gagged while they did this to him the neighbors really might not have heard anything but that still doesnt say how the killers got into the house if vampires were involved they couldnt cross the threshold without an invitation robert wouldnt have invited strange vamps into his house so someone with them had to be known or human or at least not vampire could a human cross the threshold and invite vampires inside yes i said dolph was making notes not looking at me so were looking for a mixed group at least one vamp at least one not vamp at least one witch or necromancer you got that last from reynolds i said you disagree no but since im the only necromancer in town it has to be outside talent the moment i said it i realized that outside talent was in town now dominic dumare john burke couldnt do it i thought about that johns a vaudun priest but this isnt voodoo i dont know if his knowledge of the arcane stretches this far i also dont know if hes powerful enough to have done this even with the knowledge are you powerful enough i sighed i dont know dolph im sort of new at necromancy i mean ive raised the dead for years but not this formally i motioned at the body ive never seen a spell like this he nodded anything else i hated dragging dominic into it but it was too bloody big a coincidence that a powerful necromancer hits town and a vamp gets taken out with necromancy if he was innocent id apologize if he wasnt innocent it was a death penalty case dominic dumare is a necromancer he just got into town could he have done this dolph asked i only met the man once dolph give me an opinion anita i thought about the feel of dominic in my head his offer to teach me necromancy the big thing was that killing robert and leaving the body for us to find was stupid dominic dumare didnt strike me as a stupid man he could have hes a vampires human servant so it gives you two of your mixed group did the vampire know robert i shook my head not to my knowledge you got a number where we can reach mr dumare i can call our night secretary and get it for you great dolph stared down at his notes is dumare your best suspect i thought about that yeah i guess he is you got any proof hes a necromancer and this was done by someone with knowledge of necromancy i shrugged the same reason we suspected you dolph said he almost smiled when he said it point taken i said prejudiced little me dolph closed his notebook ill take you down for your statement then fine now can i call catherine theres a phone in the kitchen zerbrowski opened the door the wifes here and shes pretty hysterical whos with her dolph asked reynolds through the open door i heard a woman talking just below the level of screaming robert my husband dead he cant be dead he cant be dead i have to see him you dont understand what he is he isnt dead the voice was coming closer shes doesnt need to see this anita i nodded i walked out the door and closed it tightly behind me i couldnt see monica yet but i could hear her her voice rising growing thinner with panic you dont understand he isnt really dead i was betting that monica wouldnt take my word for robert being well and truly dead i guess if it was jeanclaude lying in there i wouldnt either id have to see for myself i took a deep breath and walked forward to meet the grieving widow damn this night just kept getting better and better the hospital room was soft mauve with paintings of flowers on the wall the bed had a mauve bedspread and pink sheets monica lay in the bed hooked up to an iv and two different kinds of monitors a strap across her belly monitored the contractions gratefully the lines had gone flat the other monitor was the babys heartbeat the sound had scared me at first too fast like the heart of a small bird when the nurses assured me the heartbeat was normal i relaxed after nearly two hours the frantic beat had become a comforting sound like white noise monicas auburn hair was plastered in wet tendrils to her forehead her careful makeup was smeared across her face they had been forced to give her a sedative though it wasnt great for the baby she had fallen into a light almost feverish sleep her head turned eyes flicking behind her lids mouth working caught in some dream a very bad dream probably after the night shed had it was almost two oclock and i still had to go to the station and make my statement to detective greeley catherine was on her way to take my place at monicas bedside id be glad to see her i had little crescent nail marks on my right hand monica had clung to it like it was all that was holding her together at the worst of the contractions when it looked like monica would lose her baby as well as her husband her long painted nails had bitten into me and only when blood trickled down my hand in fine crimson lines did a nurse say something when monica calmed down they had insisted on messing with the wounds theyd used the cartoon bandages they kept for the babies so that my hand was covered in mickey mouse and goofy there was a television on a shelf on the wall but i hadnt turned it on the only sounds were the whirr of air circulating through the vents and the babys heartbeat a uniformed cop stood outside the door if robert had been killed by a hate group then monica and the baby were possible targets if hed been killed for personal reasons monica might know something either way she was in danger so theyd put a guard on her fine with me since all i had left was a knife i was really missing my guns the phone on the bedside table rang and i flung myself out of the chair scrambling for it terrified that it would wake monica i cupped the receiver against my mouth and spoke quietly while my pulse pounded yes anita it was edward how did you know where i was all that matters is that if i can find you so can someone else is the contract still on yes damn what about the time deadline expanded to fortyeight hours well shit arent they determined i think you should go underground for a while anita you mean hide yeah i thought you wanted me to be bait if you stay out as bait we need more bodyguards the werewolves and vamps are monsters but theyre still amateurs were professionals its what gives us our edge im good but i cant be everywhere like following me into the womens john i said i heard him sigh i let you down i was careless too edward so you agree to hiding yeah you got some place in mind as a matter of fact i do i dont like the tone in your voice edward its the most secure place in town and has builtin bodyguards where that one word sounded suspicious even to me circus of the damned he said you have got to be out of your freaking mind its the masters daytime retreat anita its a fortress jeanclaudes sealed up the tunnel we came through to get nikolaos its secure you want me to spend the day bedded down with vampires i dont think so you going back to richards house edward asked how safe are you going to be there how safe will you be anywhere above ground dammit edward im right and you know it i wanted to argue but he was right the circus was the most secure place i knew hell the place had dungeons but the idea of voluntarily sleeping there made my skin crawl how can i rest surrounded by vampires even friendly ones jeanclaudes offered you his bed before you get mad hell sleep in his coffin thats what he says now i said im not worried about your virtue anita im worried about keeping you alive and im admitting that i cant keep you safe im good im the best money can buy but im only one person one person no matter how good isnt enough that was scary edward admitting that he was in over his head i never thought id live to see it come to think of it i almost hadnt okay ill do it but for how long you hide out and ill check some things if i dont have to guard you i can do more how long a day maybe two what if whoever it is finds out im at the circus they might try for you edward said his voice was very matteroffact when he said it and if they do if you a half dozen vampires and almost that many werewolves cant handle the action then i dont think it matters youre just comforting as hell i know you anita if i was any more comforting you might refuse to hide twentyfour hours edward then i want another plan i am not going to hide at the bottom of a hole and wait for people to kill me agreed ill pick you up after you make your statement to the cops where do you get your information he laughed but it was harsh if i know where youll be so does someone else might ask your cop friends if they have a spare vest you mean a bulletproof vest couldnt hurt are you trying to scare me yes youre doing a good job thanks dont come out of the police station until i come in and get you avoid being in the open if you can you really think someone else will try to hit me tonight were planning for worstcase scenarios from now on anita no more chances ill see you then he hung up before i could say anything else i stood there holding the phone scared in all the panic with monica and her baby id almost forgotten that someone was trying to kill me probably not a good thing to forget i started to hang the phone up but dialed richards number instead he answered on the second ring which meant hed been waiting up damn richard its me anita where are you his voice sounded relieved then cautious i mean are you coming back here tonight the answer was no but not for the reasons he feared i told him what had happened the shortest possible version whose idea was it that you stay with jeanclaude there was a hint of anger in his voice i am not staying with jeanclaude i am staying at the circus and the difference is what look richard i am too tired to argue with you about this edward suggested it and you know he likes jeanclaude even less than you do i doubt that he said richard i did not call you to fight i called to tell you whats happening i appreciate the call id never heard him sound so sarcastic do you want your clothes damn i hadnt even thought about that ill bring them to the circus you dont have to do that richard you dont want me to no id love to have my stuff and not just the clothes if you get my drift ill bring it all thanks ill pack a bag for myself do you think thats a good idea ive stayed at the circus before remember i used to be one of jeanclaudes wolves i remember should you ask jeanclaudes permission before you invite yourself over ill phone first unless you dont want me there tonight his voice was very quiet if its okay with jeanclaude its fine with me i could use the moral support he let out a breath like hed been holding it great great ill see you there i have to give a statement to the cops about the incident at danse macabre it could take a couple of hours so dont rush afraid jeanclaude will hurt me he was quiet for a moment or are you afraid ill hurt him i thought about that worried about you glad to hear it he said and i could hear him smile the reason i was worried about richard is he wasnt a killer jeanclaude was richard might start a fight but jeanclaude would finish it i didnt say any of this out loud richard wouldnt have appreciated it im looking forward to seeing you tonight he said even at the circus anywhere love you love you too we hung up neither of us had said goodbye a freudian slip perhaps i was betting that richard and jeanclaude would find something to fight about and i was really too tired to mess with it but if id told richard to stay away he would have assumed i wanted to be alone with jeanclaude which was certainly not true so theyd have their little fight frankly i had my own fight all picked out one involving me jeanclaude and damian theyd broken the law at danse macabre broken it enough that with the right judge i might have gotten a warrant of execution on damian we could have one great big glorious knockdown dragout fight i wondered where everybody would sleep and with who circus of the damned is a combination of traveling carnival circus and one of the lower rungs of hell out front fanged clowns dance above the lights that spell the name posters stretch the sides of the building proclaiming watch zombies rise from the grave see the lamiahalfsnake halfwoman there is no trickery at the circus everything advertised is absolutely real it is one of the few vampire tourist attractions that welcome children if id had a kid i wouldnt have brought the little tyke near the place even i didnt feel safe edward had picked me up outside the police station just like he said he would my statement had taken three hours not two the only reason i got out that soon was bob catherines husband and fellow lawyer had finally told them to charge me or let me go truthfully i thought they might charge me but i had three witnesses saying the killing was selfdefense witnesses that id never met before tonight that helped the da usually didnt charge on selfdefense cases usually edward took me into the circus through a side door there were no lights to mark it as special but there was also no doorknob on the outside of the steel reinforced door edward knocked the door opened and in we went jason closed the door behind us i had missed him earlier at danse macabre i certainly would have remembered the outfit he was wearing a sleeveless plastic shirt molded to his body the pants were half crinkly blue cloth that looked like colored foil with oval plastic windows exposing his thigh calf and as he turned one buttock i shook my head smiling please tell me jeanclaude didnt make you wear that out where people could see you jason grinned at me and turned so he flashed his butt at me dont you like it im not sure i said discuss fashion later in a more secure place edward said he glanced at the door to our right that led into the main part of the circus it was never locked though it had a sign above the door about authorized personnel only we were standing in a stone room with an electric light dangling from the ceiling it was a storage area a third door was set in the far wall behind it was a stairway and the nether regions where the vampires stayed during the day ill be underground literally soon enough edward edward looked at me for a long moment you promised to hide out for twentyfour hours no going outside for any reason dont even go into the main part of the circus when its open to the public just stay downstairs aye aye captain this isnt a joke anita i tugged at the bulletproof vest id put over my dress it was too large for me hot and uncomfortable if i thought it was funny i wouldnt have worn this ill bring you some armor that fits when i come back i met his pale blue eyes and saw something id never seen before he was worried you think theyre going to kill me dont you he didnt look away he didnt flinch but what i saw in his face made me wish he had when i come back tomorrow ill have help with me what kind of help my kind what does that mean he shook his head twentyfour hours means that you hide until dawn tomorrow anita with luck ill have a name for us and we can kill him dont be careless while im gone i wanted to say something casual joking like i didnt know you cared but i couldnt i couldnt joke staring into his serious eyes ill be careful he nodded lock the door behind me he went outside and jason locked the door jason leaned against the door for a second why does he scare me because youre not stupid i said he smiled thanks lets get downstairs i said nervous its been a long night jason no games he pushed away from the door and said lead the way i opened the door to the stone stairway which led downward it was wide enough for us to walk abreast in fact there was almost room for a third as if the stairway had been built for wider things than human bodies jason closed the door with a resounding thank it made me jump he started to say something but the look on my face stopped him edwards parting comments had unnerved me if i didnt know better id have said i was scared naw jason walked down the steps ahead of me exaggerating his walk just a touch to show off his derriere you can cut the peep show i said you dont like the view he leaned against the wall hands pressed behind him showing off his chest i laughed and walked past him clicking my nails down his shirt it was solid and hard as a beetles carapace is that as uncomfortable as it looks he fell into step beside me its not uncomfortable the ladies at danse macabre liked it a lot i glanced at him i bet they did i like flirting no joke he laughed for someone who doesnt flirt you have a lot of guys after you maybe because i dont flirt i said jason was quiet as we walked to the bend in the stairs you mean because youre a challenge they keep coming around something like that i couldnt see around the bend of the stairs i hated not being able to see around corners but this time i was invited i hadnt come to kill anybody the vamps tended to be a lot friendlier when you werent trying to kill them is richard here yet not yet he glanced back at me do you think its a good idea to have them both here at the same time no i said absolutely not well at least we all agree its a bad idea he said the door at the bottom of the stairs was iron bound made of a heavy dark wood it looked like a portal to another timea time when dungeons were in vogue and knights rescued ladies fair or slaughtered a few peasants and no one minded except maybe the peasants jason drew a key out of his pants pocket he unlocked the door and pushed it opened on welloiled hinges since when did you get a key i asked i live here now what about college he shrugged it doesnt seem very important anymore you plan on being jeanclaudes lapwolf forever im having a good time he said i shook my head i fight like hell to stay free of him and you just give in i dont understand that at all you have a college degree right he asked yeah i dont but here we both are ending up in the same place he had me there jason motioned me through the door with a low flourish that had imitation jeanclaude written all over it jeanclaude made it seem courtly and real jason meant it for a joke the door led into jeanclaudes living room the ceiling stretched up into darkness but silken drapes hung in black and white folds that formed cloth walls on three sides the fourth side was bare stone painted white a white stone fireplace looked original which i knew it wasnt the mantlepiece was blackveined white marble a silver fireplace screen hid the hearth there were four chairs in black and silver grouped around a wood and glass coffee table a black vase sat on the table filled with white tulips my high heels sank into the thick black carpet there was one other addition to the room that stopped me in my tracks a painting hung above the fireplace three people dressed in the style of the s the woman wore white and silver with a square bodice showing quite a bit of dйcolletage her brown hair styled in careful ringlets she held a red rose loosely in one hand a man stood behind her tall and slender with dark gold hair in ringlets over his shoulders he had a mustache and a vandyke beard so dark gold they were almost brown he wore one of those floppy hats with feathers and was dressed in white and gold but it was the other man who made me walk towards the painting he was seated just behind the woman he was dressed in black with silver embroidery and a wide lace collar and lace cuffs he held a floppy black hat with a single white feather and a silver buckle across his lap black hair fell in ringlets over his shoulders he was clean shaven and the artist had managed to capture the sinking blue of his eyes i stared at jeanclaudes face painted hundreds of years before i was born the other two were smiling only he was solemn and perfect dark to their lightness he was like the shadow of death come to the ball i knew jeanclaude was centuries old but id never had such obvious proof never had it shoved in my face the portrait bothered me for another reason it made me wonder if jeanclaude had lied about his age a sound made me turn jason had slumped into one of the chairs jeanclaude stood behind me hed taken off his jacket and his curling black hair spilled across the shoulders of his crimson shirt the shirt cuffs were long and tight at the wrist held by three antique jet beads just like the high neck of the shirt without the jacket to distract the eye the pale oval of skin framed by the red cloth gleamed the cloth covered his nipples but left his belly button bare and drew the eye to the top of his black pants or maybe it just drew me it was a bad idea to be here he was just as dangerous as the assassin maybe more dangerous in ways i had no words for he glided towards me in his black boots i watched him walk closer like a deer caught in headlights i expected him to flirt or ask how i liked the painting instead he said tell me of robert the police said he was dead but they know nothing you have seen the body is he truly dead his voice was thick with concern worry it caught me completely off guard they took his heart if it is only a stake through the heart he might survive if it was removed i shook my head the heart was taken out completely we couldnt find it in the house or the yard jeanclaude stopped he slumped suddenly into one of the chairs staring at nothing or nothing i could see then he is truly gone his voice held sorrow the way it sometimes held laughter so that i felt his words like a cold grey rain you treated robert like dirt why all this weeping and wailing he looked at me i am not weeping but you treated him badly i was his master if i had treated him kindly he would have seen it as a sign of weakness he would have challenged me and i would have killed him do not criticize things that you do not understand there was anger in that last sentence enough to brush heat along my skin normally it would have pissed me off but tonight i apologize youre right i dont understand i didnt think you gave a damn about robert unless he could further your power then you do not understand me at all ma petite he was my companion for over a century after a century i would mourn even an enemys passing robert was not my friend but he was mine mine to punish mine to reward mine to protect i have failed him he stared up at me eyes gone blue and alien i am grateful to you for seeing to monica the last thing i can do for robert is to tend his wife and child they will want for nothing he stood suddenly in one smooth motion come ma petite i will show you to our room i didnt like the our but i didnt argue this new improved emotional jeanclaude had me confused who are the other two in the painting he glanced at it julianna and asher she was his human servant the three of us traveled together for nearly twenty years good he couldnt give me some bullshit about the clothing being costumes now youre too young to have been a musketeer he stared at me face carefully blank giving nothing away whatever do you mean ma petite dont even try the clothing is from the s around the time of dumass the three musketeers when we first met you told me you were two hundred and ten eventually i figured out you were lying that you were closer to three hundred if nikolaos had known my true age she might have killed me ma petite yeah the old master of the city was a real bitch but shes dead why still lie you mean why am i lying to you he said i nodded yeah thats what i mean he smiled you are a necromancer ma petite i would have thought you could judge my age without my help i tried to read his face and couldnt youve always been hard to read you know that so glad i can be a challenge in some area i let that go he knew exactly how much of a challenge he was but for the first time in a long time i was bothered telling a vamps age was one of my talents not an exact science to be sure but one i was good at id never been off by this much a century older my my are you so sure that it is only a century i stared at him i let his power beat across my skin rolled the feel of it around in my head pretty sure he smiled do not frown so ma petite being able to hide my age is one of my talents i pretended to be a hundred years older when asher was my companion it allowed us freedom to wander through the lands of other masters what made you stop trying to pass for older asher needed help and i was not master enough to help him he looked up at the portrait i humbled myself to gain him aid why the church had a theory that vampires could be cured by holy items they bound asher with holy items and silver chains they used holy water on him drop by drop trying to save his soul i stared up at that handsome smiling face id been bitten by a master vampire once upon a time and had the wound cleansed with holy water it had felt like a redhot brand was being shoved into my skin like all the blood in my body had turned to boiling oil i had vomited and screamed and thought myself very brave for not passing out altogether that had been one bite mark one day having what amounted to acid dripped on you until you died was in the top five ways not to go out what happened to the girl julianna she was burned as a witch where were you i had taken a ship to see my mother she was dying i was on my way back when i heard ashers call i could not get there in time i swear by all that is holy or unholy that i tried i rescued asher but he never forgave me hes not dead i asked no how hurt was he until i met sabin i thought ashers scars the worst injury id ever known a vampire to survive why did you hang the painting if it bothers you this much he sighed and looked at me asher sent it as a present to congratulate me for becoming master of the city the three of us were companions almost family asher and i were true friends both masters both of near equal power both in love with julianna she was devoted to him but i had her favor as well you mean a mйnage а trois he nodded asher doesnt hold a grudge oh no he holds a grudge if the council would allow it he would have come with the picture and had his revenge to kill you jeanclaude smiled asher always had a strong sense of irony ma petite he petitioned the council for your life not mine my eyes widened what did i ever do to him i killed his human servant he kills mine justice i stared back up at the handsome face the council said no indeed you have any other old enemies running around jeanclaude gave a weak smile many ma petite but none in town at the moment i looked up at those smiling faces i didnt know quite how to phrase it but said it anyway you all look so young i am physically the same ma petite i shook my head maybe young isnt the word i want maybe naive he smiled by the time this painting was made ma petite naive was not a word that described me either fine have it your way i looked at him studying his face he was beautiful but there was something in his eyes that wasnt in the painting some level of sorrow or terror something i had no word for but it was there just the same a vampire may not wrinkle up but living a couple of centuries leaves its mark even if its only a shadow in the eyes a tightness around the mouth i turned to jason who was still slumped in the chair does he give these little history lessons often only to you jason said you never ask questions i asked im just his pet you dont answer questions for your pet and that doesnt bother you jason smiled why should i care about the painting the womans dead so i cant have sex with her why should i care i felt jeanclaude move past me but couldnt follow with my eyes his hand was a blur the chair clattered to the floor spilling jason with it blood showed at his mouth never speak of her again in such a manner jason touched the back of his hand to his mouth and came away with blood whatever you say he licked the blood off his hand with long slow movements of his tongue i stared from one to the other of them you are both crazy not crazy ma petite merely not human being a vampire doesnt give you the right to treat people like that richard doesnt beat people up which is why he will never hold the pack whats that supposed to mean even if he swallows his high morals and kills marcus he will not be cruel enough to frighten the rest he will be challenged again and again unless he begins slaughtering people he will eventually die slapping people around wont keep him alive i said it would help torture works well but i doubt that richard would have the stomach for it i couldnt stomach it but you litter the ground with bodies ma petite killing is the best deterrent of all i was too tired to be having this conversation its in the morning i want to go to bed jeanclaude smiled why ma petite you are not usually so eager you know what i mean i said jeanclaude took a gliding step towards me he didnt touch me but he stood very close and looked at me i know exactly what you mean ma petite that brought heat in a rush up my neck the words were innocent he made them sound intimate obscene jason righted the chair and stood licking the blood off the corner of his mouth he said nothing merely watched us like a welltrained dog seen and not heard jeanclaude took a step back i felt him move but couldnt follow it with my eyes there had been a time only months ago that it would have looked like magic like hed just appeared a few feet away he held his hand out towards me come ma petite let us retire for the day id held his hand before so why was i left standing staring like he was offering me the forbidden fruit that once tasted would change everything he was nearly four hundred years old jeanclaudes face from all those long years ago was smiling down at me and there he stood with almost the same smile if id ever needed proof i had it hed struck jason down like a dog he didnt much like and still he was so beautiful it made my chest ache i wanted to take his hand i wanted to run my hands over the red shirt explore that open oval of flesh i folded my hands over my stomach and shook my head his smile widened until a hint of fang showed you have held my hand before ma petite why is tonight any different his voice held an edge of mockery just show me the room jeanclaude he let his hand drop to his side but he didnt seem offended if anything he seemed pleased which irritated me bring richard through when he arrives jason but announce him before he comes i dont want to be interrupted anything you say jason said he smirked at us at me a knowing look on his face did everyone and their wolf believe i was sleeping with jeanclaude of course maybe it was a case of the lady protesting too much maybe just bring richard to the room when he comes i said you wont be interrupting anything i glanced at jeanclaude while i said the last he laughed that warm touchable sound of his that wove over my skin like silk even your resistance to temptation grows thin ma petite i shrugged i would have liked to argue but hed smell a lie even a runofthemill werewolf can smell desire jason wasnt runofthemill so everyone in the room knew i was hot for jeanclaude so what no is one of my favorite words jeanclaude you should know that by now the laughter faded from his face leaving his blue blue eyes gleaming but not with humor something darker and more sure of itself looked out his eyes i survive on hope alone ma petite jeanclaude parted the black and white drapes to reveal the bare grey stones that the room was made of a large hallway stretched deeper into the labyrinth torchlight gleamed beyond the electricity of the living room he stood there backlit against the flame and the soft modern lights some trick of light and shadow plunged half his face into darkness and brought a pinprick glow to his eyes or maybe it wasnt a trick of the light maybe it was just him shall we go ma petite i walked into that outer darkness he didnt try to touch me as i moved past him id have given him a brownie point for resisting the urge except i knew him too well he was just biding his time touching me now might piss me off later it might not even i couldnt guarantee when the mood would be right jeanclaude moved ahead of me he glanced back over his shoulder after all ma petite you do not know the way to my bedroom ive been there once i said carried unconscious and dying it hardly counts he glided down the hall he put a little extra sway to his walk somewhat like jason had done on the stairs but where it had been funny with the werewolf jeanclaude made it utterly seductive you just wanted to walk in front so id have to stare at your butt he spoke without turning around no one makes you stare at me ma petite not even me and that was the truth the horrible truth if in some dark part of my heart i hadnt been attracted to him from the beginning id have killed him long ago or tried to i had more legal vampire kills than any other vampire hunter in the country they didnt call me the executioner for nothing so how did i end up being safer in the depths of the circus of the damned with the monsters than above ground with the humans because somewhere along the line i didnt kill the monster i should have that particular monster was gliding up the hallway ahead of me and he still had the cutest butt id ever seen on a dead man jeanclaude leaned one shoulder against the wall hed already opened the door he motioned me inside with a graceful sweep of his hand my high heels sank into the deep white carpet white wallpaper with tiny silver designs graced the walls there was a white door in the lefthand wall near the bed the bed had white satin sheets a dozen black and white pillows were grouped at the head of the bed a fan of black and white drapes fell from the ceiling forming a partial canopy over the bed the black lacquer vanity and chest of drawers still sat in opposite corners the wallpaper and the door were new guess which bothered me more where does the door go the bathroom he closed the outer door and walked past me to sit on the edge of the bed there were no chairs a bathroom that wasnt here last time i said not in its present form but it was here just the same he leaned back on his elbows the movement strained the cloth of his shirt exposing as much skin as the shirt would allow the line of dark hair that started low on his belly peeked just above the cloth the room was getting warmer i undid the velcro fastenings on the bulletproof vest and slid it over my head where do you want me to put this anywhere you like he said his voice was soft and more intimate than the words themselves i walked around to the far side of the bed away from him and laid the vest across the satin sheets he lay back against the sheets his black hair framing his pale face to perfection warmer it was definitely getting warmer in here mind if i freshen up whatever i have is yours ma petite you should know that by now i backed into the door and opened it with a feeling of relief i closed the door without really looking at the bathroom when i looked up i let out a silent wow the room was long and narrow it had a double sink and mirrors with round white lightbulbs edging it the sinks were black marble with white veins running through every faucet every metal edge gleamed silver the floor was black carpeting a half wall of silver and mirrored panels hid the black stool against a black wall another half wall graced the other side then there was the bathtub three marble steps led up to a black bathtub big enough for four people the faucet was a silver swan with outspread wings there was no way to take a shower which was my preferred method and the swan was a bit much but other than that it was lovely i sat down on the cool marble edging it was nearly five in the morning my eyes burned from lack of sleep the adrenaline rush of nearly getting killed had long since faded what i wanted was to be comforted held yes sex was in there somewhere but that wasnt my highest priority tonight i think both richard and jeanclaude would say it was never my highest priority but that was their problem okay it was our problem if it had been richard stretched out on the bed in the next room i would have jumped him tonight but it wasnt richard and once richard got here wed be sleeping in jeanclaudes bed seemed pretty tacky to have sex for the first time in your other boyfriends bed but it wasnt just the boys suffering from sexual tension i was drowning too was richard right was the fact that jeanclaude wasnt human the only thing keeping me out of his bed no or at least i didnt think so out of richards bed the answer sadly was yes maybe i freshened up and couldnt help checking myself in the mirror the makeup had faded a little but the liner still made my large dark eyes stand out in dramatic contrast the blush was almost gone and the lipstick had long ago vanished i had lipstick in my purse i could freshen that at least but freshening my lipstick was like admitting i cared what jeanclaude thought of me i did care that was the truly scary part i did not put on more lipstick i walked back into the bedroom as is let him make of it what he would he was leaning on one elbow watching me as i came through the door ma petite you are beautiful i shook my head pretty ill give you but not beautiful he cocked his head to one side sending a wave of hair over one shoulder who told you you were not beautiful i leaned against the door when i was a little girl my father would come up behind my mother he would wrap his arms around her waist bury his face in her hair and say how is the most beautiful woman in the world today he said it at least once a day she would laugh and tell him not to be silly but i agreed with him to me she was the most beautiful woman in the world she was your mother all little girls think that of their mother maybe but two years after she died dad remarried he married judith who was tall and blond and blueeyed and nothing like my mother if he had really believed my mother was the most beautiful woman in the world why did he marry some nordic ice princess why didnt he marry someone small and dark like my mother i dont know ma petite he said quietly judith had a daughter only a couple of years younger than me then they had josh together and he was as blond and blueeyed as the rest of them i looked like a small dark mistake in the family photos your skin is almost as pale as mine ma petite but i have my mothers eyes and hair my hair isnt brunette its black a woman asked judith once in front of me if i was adopted judith said no i was from her husbands first marriage jeanclaude slid off the bed he moved towards me and i had to look at the floor i wanted badly to be held to be comforted if it had been richard id have gone to him but it wasnt richard jeanclaude touched my cheek and raised my face until i had to look at him i have lived for over three hundred years in that time the ideal of beauty has changed many times large breasts small thin curved tall short they have all been the height of beauty at one time or another but in all that time ma petite i have never desired anyone the way i desire you he leaned towards me and i didnt move away his lips brushed mine in a gentle kiss he took that one last step to press our bodies together and i stopped him one hand on his chest but all i met was bare skin the slickness of his crossshaped burn scar met my fingertips i moved my hand and found his heart beating against my palm not an improvement he drew back a breath and whispered into my mouth tell me no ma petite and i will stop i had to swallow twice before i could speak no jeanclaude stepped away from me he lay back on the bed as he had earlier propped on his elbows his legs from the knees hung off the bed he stared at me daring me to come join him i think i wasnt that stupid there was some dark part of me that was tempted lust has less logic than love sometimes but its easier to fight i have played the mortal for you these many months i thought in march when you held my naked body when you shared blood with me that it would be a changing point for us that you would give in to your desire and admit your feelings for me a burning wash of color crept up my face i had no good excuse for the foreplay that got out of hand i was weak so sue me i gave you blood because you were dying id have never done it otherwise you know that he stared at me it wasnt vampire tricks that made me want to look away it was a raw honesty that id never seen in his face before i know that now ma petite when we returned from branson you threw yourself into richards arms as though he were a lifeline we continued to date but you drew away i felt it and did not know how to stop it he sat up on the bed hands clasped in his lap a look of frustration and confusion passed over his face i have never had another woman deny me ma petite i laughed oh your ego isnt big it is not ego ma petite it is the truth i leaned against the bathroom door and thought about that one no one in almost three hundred years has ever said no to you you find that so hard to believe if i can do it so can they he shook his head you do not appreciate how very harsh your strength of will is ma petite it is impressive you have no idea how impressive if id fallen into your arms the first time we met or even the dozenth time we met youd have bedded me bled me and dumped me i watched the truth of my words fill his face i hadnt realized until this moment how much control he kept over his facial expressions how it was the lack of reaction that made him seem more otherworldly than he was you are right he said if you had giggled and fawned over me i would not have given you a second glance your partial immunity to my powers was the first attraction but it was your stubbornness that intrigued me your flat refusal of me i was a challenge yes i stared into his suddenly open face for the first time i thought i might see the truth in his eyes good thing i resisted i dont like being used and tossed aside once you were only a challenge something to be conquered then i became intrigued by your growing powers i saw possibilities that i could use you to strengthen my position if only you would join with me something like pain passed over his face and i wanted to ask if it was real if any of this was real or if it was only another act i trusted jeanclaude to do whatever it took to stay alive i didnt trust him to tell the truth sitting on a stack of bibles i saved your ass enough times im your declared human servant what more do you want you ma petite he stood but didnt come closer it is no longer challenge or the promise of power that makes me look to you my pulse was suddenly thudding in my throat and he hadnt done a damn thing i love you anita i stared at him my eyes growing wide i opened my mouth closed it i didnt believe him he lied so easily so well he was the master of manipulation how could i believe him now what do you want me to say he shook his head and his face fell back into its normal lines that beautiful perfection that was what passed for ordinary but i knew now that even this was a mask hiding his deeper emotions how did you do that after several centuries of being forced to school your face into pleasant unreadable lines you lose the knack of anything else my survival has depended on my expression more than once i wish you understood the effort that little display of humanity cost me what do you want me to say jeanclaude you love me a little that i am sure of i shrugged maybe but a little isnt enough you love richard a lot dont you i met his eyes and wanted to lie to save his feelings but those kinds of lies hurt more than the truth yeah yet you have not made your choice you have not told me to leave the two of you to matrimonial bliss why is that last time we had this talk you said youd kill richard if that is all that is stopping you ma petite have no fear i will not kill richard merely because you go to his bed and not mine since when i asked when i threw my support to richard marcus became my enemy that cannot be changed he leaned his shoulder against the dark wooden bedpost closest to me i had thought to petition another pack there is always an ambitious alpha male out there somewhere someone who would like his own pack but either through sentimentality or lack of strength is doomed to play second forever i could kill richard and bring someone else in to kill marcus i listened to his plan told so matteroffactly what changed your mind you come again you love him ma petite you truly love him his death would destroy something inside of you when julianna died i thought i would never feel for anyone again and i didnt until i met you you wont kill richard because it would hurt me oui so i could tell richard when he gets here that ive chosen him and you would let us go off get married whatever isnt there one hurdle to your marriage besides myself he asked what you must see him change into wolf form jeanclaude smiled and shook his head if richard was human you would meet at the door with a smile and a yes but you fear what he is he is not human enough for you ma petite he isnt human enough for himself i said jeanclaude raised his eyebrows yes richard runs from his beast as you have run from me but richard shares a body with his beast he cannot outrun it i know that richard is still running ma petite and you run with him if you were secure that you could accept him all of him you would have done it by now he keeps finding excuses not to change for me he fears your reaction jeanclaude said its more than that i said if i can embrace his beast im not sure hell be able to accept me jeanclaude cocked his head to one side i do not understand he hates what he is so badly i think if i can accept his beast he wont he wont love me anymore being able to embrace his beast would make you what perverse i nodded i think so you are trapped on the horns of a nasty dilemma ma petite he will not make love to you or marry you until you have seen and accepted his beast yet if you accept it you fear he will turn from you yeah he shook his head only you could choose two men in one human lifetime that are this confusing i didnt do it on purpose he pushed away from the bed he stopped two small steps from me staring down i tried to play the mortal for you ma petite but richard is much better at being human than i am i have not been truly human for so very long if i cannot be the better man let me be the better monster my eyes narrowed whats that suppose to mean it means ma petite that jason told me of what happened this afternoon i know how close you and richard came how much had the lycanthropes been able to hear more than i was comfortable with that was for sure i just love being spied on do not be flippant ma petite please it was the please that got me im listening i told you once that if richard could touch you and i could not it would not be fair that is still true i pushed away from the door hed stepped over the line are you asking me to let you touch me where richard touched me he smiled such righteous indignation ma petite but have no fear forcing myself upon you in such a way would smack of rape i have never been interested in such things i took a step back putting a little space between us unless i was really angry it was never good to get that close so what are you saying you have always forbidden me to use vampire tricks as you call them with you he held a hand up before i could say it i do not mean bespelling you with my eyes i am not even sure that is possible anymore i cannot be human ma petite i am a vampire let me show you that has pleasures beyond humanity i shook my head no way a kiss ma petite that is all i ask a chaste kiss and the catch is i asked his eyes were solid sparkling blue his skin glowed like alabaster under lights i dont think so i said if you were truly sure of richard i would leave you to him but does the fact that i love you not earn me so much as a kiss he glided towards me i backed up but the door was right there and there was nowhere to go he was like a living sculpture all ivory and sapphire too beautiful for words too beautiful to touch his hands smoothed over my forearms along my hands i gasped power rushed along my skin in a smooth wash like air dancing over my body i must have tensed up because jeanclaude said it will not hurt that i promise just a kiss i whispered just a kiss he whispered his face lowered towards mine his lips brushed mine gently slowly the power flowed across his lips into my mouth i think i stopped breathing for a second my skin felt like it was melting away and i would sink into his body into that shining power looks like i got here just in time it was richard in the doorway i shoved my hand into jeanclaudes chest and pushed him away hard enough for him to stumble i was gasping for air like id been drowning my skin pulsed and beat with the power that still crawled over me into me richard i whispered i wanted to say that it wasnt what it looked like but i couldnt get enough air jeanclaude turned smiling he knew exactly what to say richard how good of you to join us how did you get past my wolf it wasnt that hard i stared at both of them i was still having trouble breathing it felt like every nerve in my body had been touched all at once the line between pleasure and pain was damn narrow and i wasnt sure which side this went on the light was seeping away from jeanclaude leaving him pale lovely almost human richard stood directly inside the door his eyes glowed not with inner light but with anger an anger that made his eyes dance tightened the muscles across his shoulders and down his arms so that the effort showed from across the room id never been so aware of how physically large he was he seemed to fill more space than he should have the first skinprickling rush of his power swirled over me i took a deep shaking breath and started walking towards him the closer i got the thicker the power until about six feet from him it was like stepping into a nearly solid mass of pulsing vibrating energy i stood there trying to swallow my heart back into my throat he was dressed in jeans and a green flannel work shirt with sleeves rolled over his forearms his hair fell loose round his shoulders in a wavy mass id seen him like this a hundred times but suddenly it was all different i had never been afraid of richard not really now for the first time i saw that there was something to fear something swam behind his eyes his beast he called it it was there now just behind those true brown eyes a monster waiting to be set loose richard i said and had to cough to clear my throat whats wrong with you tomorrow is the full moon anita strong emotions arent good right now rage thinned his face made those lovely cheekbones high and tight if i hadnt interrupted would you have broken your promise to me he still doesnt know what kind of hose im wearing i said richard smiled some of the tension easing away too smooth for garters jeanclaude said panty hose though they could be crotchless of that i am not sure richard snarled i glanced back at jeanclaude dont help me he smiled and nodded hed leaned his back on one of the bedposts fingers playing over the bare skin of his chest it was suggestive and he meant it to be damn him a low bass growl brought my attention back to richard he stalked towards the bed as if each movement hurt the tension sang through the building power was i going to get to see him change here and now if he changed thered be a fight and for the very first time i was worried for jeanclaudes safety as well as richards dont do this richard please he was staring past me at jeanclaude i didnt dare look behind to see what mischief the vampire was doing i had my hands full with the werewolf in front of me something flickered across his face i was sure jeanclaude had done something behind my back richard made a sound more animal than human and rushed for the bed i didnt move out of the way i stood my ground and when he was even with me moving past me i threw my body into him and threw him in a nearly perfect shoulder roll his momentum did the rest maybe if id let go of his arm we could have avoided the rest but i made the classic mistake i didnt think richard would really hurt me he grabbed the arm that was holding him and flung me across the room he was flat on his back and didnt have much leverage and that was all that saved me i was airborne for just a second and rolled along the carpet when i hit the world was still spinning when my hand went for the knife i couldnt hear anything but the blood rushing in my own head but i knew i knew he was coming he touched my arm rolled me over and i laid the silver blade against his neck he froze bent over trying i think to help me stand richard and i stared at each other from inches away the anger was gone from his face his eyes were normal as lovely as ever but i kept the knife against the smooth skin of his neck dimpling it so he knew i meant business he swallowed carefully i didnt mean to hurt you anita i am so sorry back off i said are you hurt back off richard now let me help you he bent closer and i pressed the blade in hard enough to draw a trickle of blood let go of me richard he let go and moved slowly away he looked puzzled and hurt he touched the blood at his neck as if he didnt know what it was when he was out of reach i let myself sag against the carpet nothing was broken of that i was sure and i wasnt bleeding if hed thrown me into a wall with that much force it would have been a different story id been dating him for seven months nearly slept with him more than once and in all that time i hadnt fully appreciated what i was playing with ma petite are you all right jeanclaude was standing at the foot of the bed he was watching richard closely as he moved towards me im all right im all right i glared up at him what did you do behind my back to piss him off jeanclaude looked embarrassed i did tease monsieur zeeman perhaps i even wanted a fight jealousy is a foolish emotion how was i to know you would not move out of the way of a charging werewolf i dont back up not for anyone i almost laughed though next time maybe ill make an exception i didnt mean to hurt you richard said but seeing you together like that knowing youre with him isnt the same thing as having it rubbed in my face his anger had vanished the moment hed hurt me horror at what hed done fear for my safety sanity returning in a rush we were only kissing richard nothing else no matter what he wants you to believe i was suddenly so jealous im sorry i know it was an accident richard im just glad there wasnt a wall closer i could have hurt you badly he took a step towards me hands reaching and stopped himself and you want me to let the beast loose enough to kill dont you understand how hard i fight to control it i understand better than i did a few minutes ago i said your bags are in the hallway ill bring them in then ill go this was the look id been dreading this crushed puppy dog look the anger had been easier to deal with if more dangerous dont go they both looked at me jeanclaude staged this i held a hand up before he could protest oh i know you enjoyed yourself but you still wanted richard to see us together you wanted to pick a fight you wanted to show me he was as much a monster as you are you succeeded on all counts beautifully now get out you are throwing me out of my own bedroom he looked amused yeah i stood up and was only a little wobbly on the high heels jeanclaude sighed i am to be relegated forever to my coffin then to never know the joy of your company for my slumber you dont go to sleep jeanclaude you die maybe i lust after your warm breathing body but im not up to the full package yet he smiled very well ma petite i will leave you and monsieur zeeman to discuss the last few minutes i would ask one thing and that is i asked that you not make love in my bed when i cannot join you i sighed it would be pretty tacky to make love with richard in your bed i think youre safe on that one jeanclaude glanced at richard his eyes seemed to take in every inch of him lingering on the open wound at his neck though maybe that was just my imagination if anyone could withstand the temptation it is you ma petite jeanclaude looked at me his face unreadable i am sorry you were nearly hurt i did not mean for that to happen you always have good intentions i said he sighed then smiled he glanced at richard perhaps i am not the better monster after all get out i said he left still smiling he closed the door behind him and i was left with his power dancing over my skin the feel of his lips and hands on my body it was only a kiss foreplay but even the rush of adrenaline of nearly being thrown into a wall couldnt chase away the aftereffects richard stood staring at me as if he could sense the power somehow ill go get the bags he said he could have said so many things but that was safest he went to get the bags and i sat down on the bed richard could have killed me jeanclaude would never have lost control like that i wanted richard to embrace his beast but maybe just maybe i didnt understand what that meant i sat on the edge of the bed waiting for richard to come back into the room my skin was jumping from jeanclaudes parting gift only a kiss and richard had nearly torn into jeanclaude and me what would richard have done if hed caught us doing something truly lascivious it was better not to find out richard set my suitcase and both bags inside the door he went out and came back with his small overnight bag he stood there just inside the door staring at me i stared back blood still trickled down his throat from where id cut him neither of us seemed to know what to say the silence grew until it was so thick it began to have weight im sorry i hurt you he said ive never lost control like that before he took a step into the room but seeing you with him he held out his hands then let them fall to his sides helplessly it was only a kiss richard thats all its never only a kiss with jeanclaude i couldnt argue that i wanted to kill him richard said i noticed youre sure youre all right hows your neck i asked he touched the wound and came away with fresh blood silver blade it wont heal immediately he came to stand in front of me looking down so close that the legs of his jeans nearly brushed my knees it was almost too close the lingering brush of jeanclaudes power made my skin ache richards nearness made it worse if i stood up our bodies would touch he was that close i stayed sitting trying to swallow the last bits of jeanclaudes kiss i wasnt sure what would happen if i touched richard now it felt almost like whatever jeanclaude had done reacted to richards body or maybe it was me maybe i was becoming that needy maybe my body was tired of saying no would you really have killed me richard asked could you have plunged that blade home i stared up at him and wanted to lie to the sincerity in his eyes but i didnt whatever we were doing with each other whatever we meant to each other it couldnt be based on lies yes just like that he said i nodded just like that i saw it in your eyes cold dispassionate like someone else was looking out if i was sure i could kill coldly it wouldnt scare me so much i wish i could promise you that you wouldnt enjoy it but i cant i know that he stared at me i couldnt kill you not for any reason it would destroy something in me to lose you richard but my first reaction is to protect myself at all costs so if we ever have another misunderstanding like we did tonight dont help me up dont come close to me until im sure youre not going to eat me okay he nodded okay the energy rush that jeanclaude had given me was fading calming i stood up and richards body touched mine i felt an instant rush of warm energy that had nothing to do with the vampire richards aura enveloped me like a breath of warm air his arms slid behind my back i slid my hands around his waist and laid my cheek against his chest i listened to the deep throbbing of his heart running my hands over the softness of the flannel shirt there was a measure of comfort in richards arms that simply wasnt there when jeanclaude held me he ran his hands through my hair putting one on either side of my face he pulled me back until he could see my face he bent towards me lips parted i stretched on tiptoe to meet him a voice said master richard turned with me still in his arms so we could see the door jason crawled across the white carpet dripping crimson drops as he moved my god what happened to you i asked i happened to him richard said he walked over to the crawling man what do you mean you happened to him jason abased himself at richards feet face pressed to the carpet im sorry richard knelt and raised jason to a sitting position blood ran down his face from a cut above his eyes it was deep and would need stitches you threw him into a wall i asked he tried to stop me from reaching you i cant believe you did this richard looked up at me you want me to be pack leader you want me to be alpha well this is what it takes he shook his head you should see your face you look so damned outraged how can you want me to kill another human being and be upset by a little rough and tumble i didnt know what to say jeanclaude said that killing marcus wouldnt be enough that youd have to be willing to terrorize the pack to rule it hes right richard wiped the blood off jasons face the cut was already beginning to close he put his bloody fingers into his mouth and licked them clean i stood there frozen staring like an unwilling witness to a car crash richard bent close to jasons face i thought i knew what he was going to do but i had to see it to believe it he licked the wound he ran his tongue over the open wound like a dog will do i turned away this couldnt be my richard my safe comforting richard you cant stand to watch can you he asked did you think that killing was the only thing i had refused to do his voice made me turn back there was a smudge of blood on his chin watch it all anita i want you to see what it takes to be alphic then you tell me if its all worth it if you cant stomach it dont ever ask me to do it again the look in his eyes made it a challenge i understood challenges i sat on the edge of the bed go to it im all yours richard brushed the hair on one side exposing the wound on his neck i am alpha and i feed the pack i spilled your blood and now i give it back to you the warm rush of his power spilled through the room jason stared up at him his eyes rolled almost to white marcus doesnt do this because he cant richard said i can feed on my blood on my apology my power and never stand against me again the air was so thick with power it was hard to breathe jason rose on his knees and put his mouth over the wound tentatively at first as if afraid hed be turned away or hurt when richard didnt say anything jason pressed his mouth to the open wound and drank his jaw muscles worked his throat swallowed one hand slipped behind richards back one hand on his shoulder i walked around them until i could see richards face his eyes were closed his face peaceful he must have felt me watching him because he opened his eyes there was anger there anger at me partly it wasnt only about killing marcus it was about giving up pieces of his humanity i hadnt understood that not until now he touched jasons shoulders enough jason pressed himself harder against the wound like a nursing puppy richard pulled him forcibly off of his neck a hicky had already spread around the wound jason lay back halfcradled in richards arms he licked the edges of his mouth getting the last drops of blood he giggled and rolled away from richard to kneel on the floor he rubbed his face along richards leg ive never felt anything like that marcus cant share power like that does anybody else in the pack know you can share blood tell them richard said tell them all you really are going to kill marcus arent you jason asked if he gives me no other choice yes now go jason your other master is waiting jason stood and almost fell he righted himself rubbing his hands down his legs and arms as if he was bathing in something i couldnt see maybe it was the warm ruffling power that he tried to tie around himself he laughed again if youll feed me you can hit me into a wall anytime get out richard said jason got out richard was still kneeling on the floor he looked up at me do you understand now why i didnt want to do this yes i said maybe if marcus knows i can share blood my power hell back down youre still hoping not to kill him i said its not only the killing anita its everything that goes with it its what i just did with jason a hundred things none of them very human he looked at me and there was a sorrow in his brown eyes that i had never seen before i understood suddenly it isnt the killing exactly is it once you take over the pack by blood and brute force you have to keep the pack with blood and brute force exactly if i could force marcus out somehow if i could make him back down then id have room to do things differently he came to stand in front of me his face eager ive brought nearly half the pack either to my side or at least to be neutral they arent backing marcus anymore no ones ever divided a pack like this without deaths why cant you split into two packs he shook his head marcus would never allow it the pack leader gets a tithe from every member it would cut not just his power but his money you getting money now i asked everyones still tithing to marcus i dont want the money and its just one more fight i think tithing should be abolished i watched the light in his face the plans the dreams he was building a power base of fairness and boy scout virtues with creatures that could rip out your throat and eat you afterwards he believed he could do it watching his handsome eager face i almost believed it too i thought you could kill marcus and that would be it but it wont be will it raina will see to it that im challenged unless i put the fear of me into them as long as raina is alive shell be trouble i dont know what to do about raina i could kill her i said the look on his face was enough just kidding i said sort of richard wouldnt agree with the ultimate practicality but if he was going to be safe raina had to die coldblooded but true what are you thinking anita that maybe youre right and the rest of us are wrong about what maybe you shouldnt kill marcus richards eyes widened i thought you were angry with me for not killing marcus its not killing marcus its endangering everybody by not killing marcus he shook his head i dont see the difference the difference is that killing is a means to an end not an end in itself i want you alive marcus gone the pack members that follow you safe i dont want you to have to torture the pack to keep your place if we can accomplish all that without you having to kill anyone im okay with that i dont think theres an option that doesnt involve killing but if you can come up with one ill support you he studied my face are you telling me that you think i shouldnt kill now yeah he laughed but it was with more irony than humor i dont know whether to yell at you or hug you i affect a lot of people that way i said look when we went to rescue stephen you should have called a few people gone into the situation from a position of strength with three or four lieutenants at your back there is a compromise between playing sir lancelot and being vlad the impaler he sat down on the edge of the bed being able to feed power through my blood is a rare talent its impressive but it wont be enough id have to have some major scary stuff to get marcus and raina to back down im powerful anita really powerful he said it like it was simply the truth no ego no pride but its not that kind of powerful i sat down beside him ill do anything i can richard just promise me you wont be careless he smiled but it didnt reach his eyes i wont be careless if youll kiss me we kissed the taste of him was warm and sure but underneath it was the sweet salt of blood and jasons aftershave i drew away from him whats wrong i shook my head telling him i could taste other peoples blood in his mouth was not going to be helpful we were going to work so he didnt have to do things like that it wasnt his beast that would steal his humanity it was a thousand smaller things change for me i said what change for me here now he stared at me as if trying to read something in my face why now let me see all of you richard the whole package if you dont want jeanclaude sharing the bed you dont want a wolf in bed with you either you wouldnt you be trapped in wolf form until morning you said so earlier no i wouldnt he said softly if you change tonight and i can accept it we can make love we can start planning the wedding he laughed can i kill marcus before i have to kill jeanclaude jeanclaude promised not to hurt you i said richard went very still youve already talked to him about this i nodded why wasnt he angry with me he said hed step aside if he couldnt win me so hes stepping aside i didnt add the part about jeanclaude loving me save it for later call your beast richard he shook his head it isnt just my beast anita its the lukoi the pack you have to see them too ive seen them he shook his head you havent seen us at the lupanar our place of power were real there no pretense not even to ourselves ive just told you that i want to marry you did you pick up on that i asked richard stood i want to marry you anita more than almost anything in the world i want you so badly my body aches with it i dont trust myself to be here tonight weve managed to stay chaste so far i said by the skin of our teeth he picked up his overnight case the lukoi call sex the killing dance so we use the same phrase for battles of succession i still dont understand the problem he stared at me you will god help us both you will there was something so sad so wistful about him suddenly that i didnt want to let him go tomorrow hed face marcus and just because hed agreed to kill didnt mean he could when the moment came i didnt trust him not to flinch i didnt want to lose him stay with me richard please it wouldnt be fair to you dont be such a frigging boy scout he smiled and gave a very bad popeye imitation i am what i am he closed the door behind him i didnt even get to kiss him goodbye i woke to darkness and someone bending over me i couldnt really see but i felt something in the air above me like a weight my hand slid under the pillow and came out with the firestar i shoved the gun into whoever it was and they were gone like a dream i slid off the bed pressing my back against the wall making myself as small a target as possible a voice came out of the darkness i aimed for it straining my ears for sounds of more intruders its cassandra the light switch is above you ill stay right here while you turn on the lights her voice was low even the sort of voice you used for crazy people or people who had guns pointed at you i swallowed past my pulse and scooted my back up the wall i swiped my left hand up the wall until it hit the switch plate then i knelt back down fingers touching the switch when i was as far down as i could get and still turn on the light i hit it light flared there was a moment of dazzling blindness while i hunkered on the floor gun pointed blindly when i could see cassandra stood near the foot of the bed hands out to either side staring at me her eyes were a little too wide the lace on her victorian nightgown fluttered with her breath yes victorian nightgown she looked delicate dolllike id asked her last night if jeanclaude picked out the gown no shed picked it out each to their own she stood on the carpet frozen staring anita are you all right her tone said she didnt think so i took a deep breath and pointed the gun at the ceiling yeah im all right can i move i stood holding the gun at my side dont try to touch me when im in a sound sleep say something first ill remember that she said may i move sure whats up i asked richard and jeanclaude are outside i checked my watch it was one oclock in the afternoon id had nearly six hours of sleep or would have had if cassandra and i hadnt talked for an hour i hadnt had a sleepover in years and frankly girl or no she was still a lycanthrope that id met only that night it felt strange to trust her at my back as my bodyguard ive never been too fond of sleeping with strangers its not sexual its plain suspicion being deeply asleep is as helpless as most of us get what do they want richard said he has a plan i didnt need to ask what plan there was only one thing on his mind the day of the full moon marcus tell them im getting dressed first i went for my suitcase cassandra padded to the door she opened it only a crack speaking softly she closed it firmly behind her and came back to me she looked puzzled in the nightgown with a puzzled frown on her face she looked about twelve i knelt by the suitcase clothes in my hands looking up at her what now jeanclaude said not to bother getting dressed i stared at her for a heartbeat yeah right im getting dressed they can just bloody well wait that long she nodded and went back to the door i went for the bathroom i stared at myself in the mirror i looked as tired as i felt i brushed teeth took care of necessities and wished for a shower it would have helped wake me up i could have run a bath but i wasnt sure the boys would last that long besides a bath was something i did to get ready for bed not for waking up i needed something stimulating not something soothing richard had a plan but jeanclaude was with him that meant that the vampire had helped come up with the plan it was a scary thought tonight richard would fight marcus he could be dead by tomorrow the thought made my chest tight there was a pressure behind my eyes that had more to do with tears than anything else i could live with richard off somewhere it would hurt if he wasnt with me but id survive i might not survive his death i loved richard i really loved him i didnt want to give him up not for anything jeanclaude was being a perfect gentleman but i didnt trust it how could i he always had a dozen different reasons for everything he did what was the plan the quicker i dressed the quicker id find out id pretty much just grabbed stuff out of the suitcase you can mix and match almost all the clothing i own dark blue jeans navy blue polo shirt white jogging socks i hadnt dressed to impress anyone now that i was a little more awake i wished id chosen something a little less practical love makes you worry about stuff like that i opened the door richard stood by the bed the sight of him stopped me in my tracks his hair was brushed until it fell like a frothy mass around his shoulders he was wearing nothing but a pair of silky undershorts royal purple they were slit high on each side giving glimpses of his thighs as he turned towards me when i could close my mouth and talk i said why are you dressed like that jeanclaude leaned one shoulder against the wall he was wearing a black anklelength robe edged with black fur his hair mingled with the fur collar until it was hard to tell where one blackness ended and the other began his pale neck and a triangle of his chest showed almost perfectly white against the fur you look like youve just stepped out of two different porno movies cassandra said something about a plan whats the plan richard glanced at jeanclaude they exchanged a look between them that said better than words that theyd been plotting behind my back richard sat on the edge of the bed the shorts clung a little too close for comfort and i had to look away so i looked at jeanclaude not comforting but at least most of him was covered do you remember some months ago before christmas when we accidently set off some sort of magical energy in your apartment jeanclaude asked i remember i said monsieur zeeman and i believe that the three of us could share power become a triumvirate i looked from one to the other explain there is a link between myself and wolves there is a link between you my little necromancer and the dead lust and love have always held a magical energy i can show you individual spells that can use the link between vampire and their animal between necromancer and vampire we should not be surprised that there is power between us make your point i said jeanclaude smiled i believe we could call up enough power to back down a certain ulfric i know marcus he will not fight if he believes he has no hope of winning jeanclaudes right richard said if i can shine with enough power marcus will back down how do you know we can even call this whateveritis up again i asked i have done some research jeanclaude said there are two cases of master vampires who could call animals who then made one of those animals in wereform a sort of human servant so it means that there is a chance of my being able to bind you both i shook my head no way no vampire marks been there done that didnt like it there were no marks on either of you in december jeanclaude said i think it will work without any now why are the two of you dressed like that richard looked embarrassed it was all i brought i thought we were going to be sharing the bed last night i motioned at the shorts those would not have helped us stay chaste richard heat crept up his face i know sorry tell me there is no lingerie in your suitcase ma petite i never said there wasnt ronnie had talked me into an outfit just in case i gave in to richard she was willing for me to bed him before the wedding if it would knock jeanclaude out of the running whod you buy it for richard asked quietly you but dont distract me why the nice jammies richard and i have made an attempt or two on our own to call the power it does not work with only the two of us his dislike of me has rendered it useless is this true richard he nodded jeanclaude says we need our third we need you whats with the clothes lust and anger were what drew the power the first time ma petite we have our anger we are missing our lust wait just a damn minute i stared from one to the other of them are you saying we become a mйnage а trois no richard said he stood up he walked towards me in his little shorts flashing the room no sex i promise you that even for this i wouldnt have agreed to sharing you with him i ran my fingertips down the silk of his shorts lightly almost like i was afraid then why the costumes were running out of time anita if this is going to work its got to work fast he gripped my arms his hands warm on my skin you said youd help me with a plan this is the plan i drew away from him slowly and turned to jeanclaude and what do you get out of it your happiness no wolf will challenge richard if we are a true triumvirate my happiness right i studied his calm lovely face and had an idea you tasted jason didnt you you tasted the power that he sucked off of richard didnt you didnt you you son of a bitch i walked towards him as i talked fighting an urge to hit him when i got there what of it ma petite i stood right in front of him throwing the words into his face what do you gain from all this and dont give me crap about my happiness ive known you too long his face was at its mildest its most disarming i would gain enough power that no master vampire short of the council itself would dare challenge me i knew it i knew it you dont do anything without a dozen ulterior motives i benefit in exactly the same way monsier zeeman benefits we would both secure our power bases fine what do i get out of it why monsieur zeemans safety anita richard said softly he touched my shoulder i whirled to face him my angry words died at the look on his face so serious so solemn he gripped my shoulders one hand cupping the side of my face you dont have to do this if you dont want to do you understand what hes suggesting richard we would never be free of him i touched his hand where he held my face dont tie us to him like this richard once he gets a piece of you he never lets go if you really believed he was evil you would have killed him a long time ago and been free of him if i didnt do this and richard died tonight would i be able to live with it i leaned into him pressing my face against his chest breathing in his scent no if he died and i could have saved him id never be rid of the guilt jeanclaude came to stand near us it may have been one of those freakish accidents that cannot be duplicated under controlled conditions ma petite magic is often like that i turned my face and looked at him cheek still pressed to richards bare chest his arms wrapped around my back no vampire marks on either of us right i promise the only thing i would ask is that none of us back away we need a true idea of how much power we can call if it is not much then it is moot but if it is as i believe then it will solve a great many problems you manipulative bastard is that a yes he asked yes i said richard hugged me i let his arms hold me comfort me but it was jeanclaudes eyes i met there was a look on his face that was hard to describe the devil must look like that after youve signed on the dotted line and given away your soul pleased eager and a little hungry you and monsieur zeeman have a nice visit i will take my turn in the bathroom then join you just hearing him say it out loud made me want to refuse but i didnt are you sure this isnt just your elaborate way of forming us into a mйnage а trois would i be so devious yeah he laughed and the sound shivered over my skin like an ice cube dropped down my spine i will leave you two alone he brushed past us into the bathroom i stalked after him and caught the door before it could close he looked at me through the opening yes ma petite there better be something under that robe besides skin he smiled wide enough to show just a hint of fang would i be so crude ma petite i dont know he nodded and closed the door i took a deep breath and turned to face the other man in my life richards clothes lay folded on my suitcase he moved towards me the shorts were slit high enough that i could see almost a clear line from foot to waist if we were truly alone i would have gone to him what should have been romantic was suddenly chokingly awkward i was very aware of the sounds of running water from the bathroom jeanclaude planned to join us sweet jesus richard still looked scrumptious with his hair falling across one eye he had stopped moving closer he finally shook his head why is this suddenly so awkward i think the biggest reason is in the bathroom getting ready to join us he laughed and shook his head again it doesnt usually take us this long to be in each others arms no i said at this rate we were going to be staring at each other like high school kids at a dance when jeanclaude came back out meet me halfway i said richard smiled always he walked to meet me the muscles in his stomach rippled as he moved i was suddenly sorry that i was wearing jeans and a polo shirt i wanted him to see me in the lingerie id bought i wanted his hands to run over the silk and my body underneath richard and i stopped inches away from each other neither one touching i could smell his aftershave faintly i was close enough to feel the warmth of his body i wanted to run my hands over his bare chest i wanted to run my hands down the front of those silk shorts the thought was so real i crossed my arms to keep my hands busy richard leaned over me he ran his lips over my eyebrows kissed my eyelids ever so gently he reached my mouth and i rose on tiptoe to meet him he slid his arms around me i fell against him my hands searching his body my mouth pressing against his he bent and slid his arms under my butt lifting me until our faces were even i broke the kiss and started to say put me down but staring at his face from an inch away i couldnt say it i wrapped my legs around his waist he braced his legs to catch his balance i kissed him and the first brush of power broke over me in a line of skinprickling bellytickling warmth richard made a small sound in his throat that was more growl than moan he knelt on the floor with me still riding him and when he took me to the floor i didnt stop him he raised his upper body over me bracing with his arms his lower body pressed against me when he stared down at me his eyes had gone wolfish something must have shown on my face because he turned his head so i wouldnt see i raised up underneath him grabbed a handful of his thick hair and turned his head back to me none too gently whether it was the pain or something else he turned back with a snarl i didnt flinch i didnt look away richard lowered his face towards mine and i lay back on the floor his mouth hovered over mine there was a brush of warmth as our mouths met as if i was tasting his energy his essence the bathroom door opened the sound froze me making my eyes slide towards the open door richard hesitated for a second mouth uncertain above mine then he kissed the edge of my chin running his lips down my neck jeanclaude stood in the doorway dressed in black silk pajamas the longsleeved top was unbuttoned so that it fanned around his naked upper body as he moved the look on his face in his eyes panicked me i patted richards shoulder hed worked his way to the base of my neck and was nuzzling the collar of my polo shirt as if hed put his face inside the shirt he raised those startling amber wolf eyes to me and the only thing i could read on his face was desire almost a hunger his power breathed along my skin like a line of hot wind my pulse thudded against the skin of my throat until i thought it would burst the skin whats wrong with you richard tonight is the full moon ma petite his beast calls to him jeanclaude padded across the carpet towards us let me up richard richard went to his hands and knees leaving me to squirm out from under him i stood and he knelt in front of me wrapping his arms around my waist dont be afraid im not afraid of you richard i stared at jeanclaude richard ran his hands down my ribs fingers digging into the flesh as if he were massaging my back it brought my attention back to him i would never hurt you willingly you know that i did know that i nodded trust me now his voice was soft and deep with a roll of bass to it that wasnt normal he started pulling my shirt out of my pants i want to touch you smell you taste you jeanclaude padded around us not coming any closer he circled us like a shark his midnight blue eyes were still human more human looking than richards richard raised my shirt free of my pants pushing it back until he exposed my stomach he ran his hands over my bare skin and i shuddered but it wasnt sex or not only sex that warm electric power of his flowed from his hands across my skin it was like having a lowlevel current tracing over me it didnt quite hurt but it might if it didnt stop or it might feel very good better than anything else i wasnt sure which thought scared me more jeanclaude stood just out of reach watching that thought scared me too richard put his hands on either side of my exposed waist holding the shirt up draped over his wrists jeanclaude took that last step pale hand outstretched i tightened up fear overriding the remains of desire he let his hand fall back without touching us richard licked my stomach a quick wet motion i stared down at him and he stared back with brown eyes human eyes i wont let anything happen to you anita i didnt know what it had cost him to swallow his beast back down inside but i knew it hadnt been easy there were many lesser lycanthropes who could not go back once they started to change it would have been more reassuring if his true brown eyes hadnt held a darkness all their own but it wasnt his beast it was something more basic more human sex even lust doesnt cover that look in a mans eyes jeanclaude was standing behind me i could feel him without touching me at all i could feel his power like a cool seeking wind he brushed his face against my hair my heart was beating so loudly i couldnt hear anything but the thundering of my own blood in my head jeanclaude brushed my hair to one side his lips touched my cheek and his power burst over me in a quiet rush cool as a wind from the grave it flowed through me seeking richards warmth the two energies hit mingled inside me i couldnt breathe i felt that thing inside me that could call the dead from the gravemagic for lack of a better wordi felt it coil and flare against them both i tried to pull away from richard but his fingers dug into my ribs jeanclaudes arms tightened around my shoulders build the power do not fight it ma petite i fought the panic my breath coming in quick gasps i was going to hyperventilate and pass out if i couldnt get a handle on it i rode the power and my own fear and i was losing richards mouth bit gently at my stomach his mouth sucking my skin jeanclaudes lips touched my neck nibbling gently his arms cradled me against his chest richard was a growing warmth at my waist jeanclaude like some cool fire at my back i was being eaten from both ends like a piece of wood going up in flames the power was too much it had to go somewhere i had to do something with it or it was going to burn me alive my legs buckled and only richards and jeanclaudes hands on me kept me from falling they lowered me to the floor still cradled in their arms my shoulder touched the ground then my hand and i knew what i could do with the power i felt it surge through the ground seeking seeking the dead i rolled onto my stomach jeanclaudes hands were on my shoulders his face brushing mine richards hands were under my shirt touching my back roaming higher but it was all secondary i had to do something with the power i found the dead i needed and it didnt work the power continued to build until i would have screamed if i could have gotten enough air a step an ingredient something was missing i rolled onto my back staring up at both of them they stared down at me jeanclaudes eyes had gone solid midnight blue they both leaned towards me at once richard went for my mouth jeanclaude went for my neck richards kiss was almost a burning i could feel the brush of fangs as jeanclaude fought not to bite me temptation was everywhere someones hand was under my shirt and i wasnt sure whose it was anymore then i realized it was both of them what was one thing i needed for raising the dead blood i must have said it out loud blood jeanclaude raised up staring at me from inches away his hand was just below my breast id grabbed his wrist without thinking about it what ma petite blood to finish it we need blood richard raised his face up like a drowning man what i can give you blood ma petite jeanclaude leaned into me i stopped him with a hand on his chest at the same time that richard put a hand on his shoulder the power poured over us in a searing wash and i was seeing white spots you wont use me to sink fangs into her for the first time richard growled it at him his anger fed the magic and i screamed give me blood or get off me i held up my own wrist between them i dont have a knife someone do it richard leaned over me he swept his hair back from one side of his neck heres your blood jeanclaude didnt argue he leaned into him lips drawn back i watched in a sort of slow motion as he bit the side of richards neck richard tensed a hiss of breath as the fangs sank home jeanclaudes mouth sealed over his skin sucking throat working the power roared through me raising every hair on my body creeping through my skin until i thought id come apart i sent it all outward to the dead that id found i filled them up and still there was too much power i reached outward outward and found what i was looking for the power left us in a cool burning rush i lay gasping on the floor jeanclaude lay on my left propped on one elbow blood stained his lips trickling down his chin richard lay on his stomach to my right pinning my arm underneath his cheek his chest rose and fell in great gasps sweat glistening along his spine the world was goldedged almost floating sound returned slowly and it was like i was listening down a long tube jeanclaude licked the blood from his lips wiping a shaking hand across his chin licking the hand clean he lay down beside me one hand across my stomach his head cradled on my shoulder his bare chest and stomach lay across my arm his skin was almost hot feverish hed never felt like that before his heart pounded against my skin like a captive bird his hair fell against my face it smelled of some exotic shampoo and of him he gave a shaky laugh and said it was glorious for me was it good for you ma petite i swallowed and was too tired to even laugh trust you to know just what to say richard raised himself up on his elbows blood trickled down his neck where two neat fang marks showed i touched the bite mark and my fingers came away stained crimson does it hurt i asked not really he grabbed my wrist gently licking the blood off my fingers sucking them clean jeanclaudes strangely warm hand caressed my stomach under my shirt he undid the button of my pants dont even think it i said too late ma petite he bent and kissed me i could taste the metallic sweetness of richards blood on his tongue i rose up to meet him pushing at his mouth id asked for the blood not either of them the truth was we werent done with the bloodletting today whatever id called from the grave had to be put back that would take blood fresh blood the only question was who would donate it and how would it be gathered oh one more question how much blood would we need jeanclaudes fingertips slid along the edge of my pants richard grabbed his wrist anger flared from both of them and that shared power flickered to life you wont use this as an excuse to get into her pants either richard said his voice was thick and dark with more than anger his hand tightened on jeanclaudes wrist jeanclaude balled his hand into a fist and bent his arm at the elbow concentration and anger touched both their faces i could feel the trembling effort through their chests their anger prickled along my skin it was too soon to do all this shit over again you can armwrestle later boys weve got to go see what i raised from the dead there was a fraction of hesitation then they both looked down at me their arms were still straining against each other richards face showed the effort jeanclaudes face had gone blank and curious as if it was no effort to hold off a werewolf but i could feel the fine trembling through his body illusion was all with jeanclaude with richard it was all nerve endings and reality what did you say ma petite she said she raised the dead richard said yep so get off me you can fight later but right now we need to check on what i did we did jeanclaude said he eased away from richard and after a second richard released his hand what we did i said richard stood the muscles in his bare legs moving under the skin and it was hard not to touch them feel the movement of him he offered me a hand up give me a minute i said jeanclaude stood as if drawn to his feet by strings he offered me a hand too they stood glaring at each other their anger played through the air like invisible sparks i shook my head i seemed to be more worse for wear than either of them poor human that i was id have actually taken a hand up which was rare for me i sighed got my feet under me and stood without help from either of them behave yourselves i said cant you feel whats in the air anger works just fine to call whatever it is so stop it we may have to do it again to lay to rest what weve already called from the grave jeanclaude looked instantly relaxed at ease he gave a low bow as you like ma petite richard rotated his neck trying to loosen his shoulders his hands were still balled into fists but he nodded i dont understand how what we did called zombies i can act as a focus for other animators its a way to combine powers and raise an older zombie or more than one or two zombies i dont know how to do anything else but raise the dead so when you shoved that much power in my face i shrugged i did what i know how to do did you raise all of nikoloass old cemetery jeanclaude asked if were lucky i said he put his head to one side puzzled richard looked down at himself can i get some pants on i smiled seems a shame i said but yeah i will fetch my robe from the bathroom jeanclaude said help yourself i said no comment about how it is a shame that i am getting dressed i shook my head cruel ma petite very cruel i smiled and gave him a little bow he returned the smile but there was a challenge to his eyes as he walked towards the bathroom richard was sliding into his jeans i watched him zip them up and button them into place it was fun just to watch him dress love makes the smallest movements fascinating i walked past him towards the door leaving him to put a shirt on if he was going to the only way to ignore him was to just not look the same theory worked with jeanclaude most of the time i walked to the door my hand was reaching for the knob when richard grabbed me from behind lifting me off my feet carrying me back from the door my feet were literally dangling off the ground what the hell are you doing put me down my wolves are coming he said as if that explained everything put me down he lowered me enough for my feet to touch the floor but his arms stayed wrapped around me as if he was afraid id go for the door his face was distant listening i heard nothing a howl echoed up the corridor and raised the hairs on my arms whats going on richard danger he almost whispered it is it raina and marcus he was still listening to things i could not hear he pushed me behind him and went to the door still shirtless wearing nothing but his jeans i ran for the bed and the weapons i got the firestar out from under the pillow dont go out there emptyhanded dammit i dragged the uzi out from under the bed a chorus of howls went up richard flung the door open and raced down the hallway i called his name but he was gone jeanclaude came out of the bathroom in his black furlined robe what is it ma petite company i slipped the uzis strap across my chest the sounds of snarling wolves came distant jeanclaude ran past me the long robe flying out behind him he ran like a dark wind when i got out to the corridor he was nowhere in sight i was going to be the last one there dammit running full tilt towards a fight was not the best way to stay alive caution was better i knew that and it didnt matter nothing mattered but getting there in time in time to save them them i didnt dwell on that i ran the firestar gripped tightly in my right hand the uzi in my left i was running like an idiot but at least i was armed a roaring shout thundered off the walls ahead dont ask me how but i knew it was richard i didnt think i could run any faster i was wrong i spilled into the open breath coming in throatclosing gasps not looking left or right if someone had had a gun they could have blown me away richard stood in the middle of the room a zombie held at arms length above his head a wolf the size of a pony had pinned another zombie to the floor savaging it stephen stood at richards back in human form but crouched and ready to fight cassandra stood back from them she turned to me as i skidded into the room there was a look on her face that i couldnt quite read and didnt have time to puzzle over jeanclaude was at the far left away from the werewolves he was staring at me too i couldnt read his face but he was in no danger he hadnt waded into the zombies he knew better richard didnt the room had been a narrow rectangle but the far wall had blasted outward scattering rubble across the floor it looked like the zombies had crawled out from behind the wall a graveyard that i at least hadnt known was there the dead stood in front of the ruins their eyes shifted to me as i saw them and i felt the weight of their gaze like a blow to my heart the fear for everyones safety was gone washed away in a rush of anger richard put it down please it wont hurt you call jason off the other one it had to be jason unless there was another werewolf down here and if it was someone else where was jason richard turned his head to look at me the zombie once a human male still held effortlessly above his head they attacked jason they wouldnt have done anything without orders jason jumped the gun they didnt attack us cassandra said they started pouring out of the wall jason changed and attacked them the giant wolf had opened the zombies stomach and was tearing at intestines id had enough grab the wolf i said the zombie under him locked its arms around the wolfs forequarters the wolf sank teeth into the corpses throat and tore it out in a spurt of dark fluid and flesh the rest of the zombies somewhere between sixty and eighty surged toward the wolf let him up jason or ill show you what its like to be attacked by zombies richard bent his elbow and tossed the zombie away from him the body tumbled through the air and landed in the mass of waiting zombies they fell like bowling pins except that these bowling pins got to their feet though one lost an arm in the process richard crouched by his wolves youre attacking us he sounded outraged pull your wolf off my zombie and it stops here you think you can take us cassandra said with this many dead i know i can i said stephens face crumpled almost like hed cry youd hurt us shit id forgotten i was their lupa now id threatened to kill raina if she hurt stephen again and here i was about to feed him to zombies there was a logic gap somewhere if im supposed to protect you all then you have to obey me right so jason gets the fuck off my zombie or i beat the hell out of him isnt that pack protocol richard turned to me there was a look on his face id never seen before anger and arrogance or something close to it i dont think jason really expected you to demand his obedience i dont think any of us did then you dont know me very well i said mes amies if we kill each other wont marcus be pleased we all turned to jeanclaude i said stop all the zombies stopped at once like a freeze frame one tumbled to the floor caught in midshuffle rather than take that last partial step zombies were terribly literal the giant wolf tore another piece out of the zombie the dead man made a small involuntary cry drag jason off of it now or we are going to do this dance fuck marcus ill worry about it later off of him jason now richard said the wolf reared back tearing at the zombies arm bone cracked the wolf worried the arm like a terrier with a bone blood and thicker fluids flew in a spray richard grabbed the wolf by the scruff of the neck jerking it off its feet he grabbed the front of its furry throat and turned it to face him the muscles in his arms corded with the effort the wolfs claws scrambled in the air while it strangled the massive claws raked richards bare skin blood flowed in thin crimson lines he threw the wolf across the room into the waiting dead never disobey me again jason never his voice was lost in a growling that turned into a howl he threw back his head and bayed the sound rose from his human throat cassandra and stephen echoed him their howls filled the room with a strange ringing song i realized then that richard might avoid killing marcus but hed never control the lukoi without brutality he was already casual about it almost as casual as jeanclaude bad sign or good sign i wasnt sure jason scrambled out of the dead he turned pale green wolf eyes to me as if waiting for something dont look at me i said im pissed with you too jason stalked towards me on paws bigger across than my hands the fur at his neck rose in a prickling brush his lips curled back from his teeth in a silent growl i pointed the firestar at him dont do it jason he kept coming each step so stiff and full of tension that it looked robotic he gathered his body legs squirming into position for a leap i wasnt going to let him finish the movement if hed been in human form id have aimed to wound but in wolf form i wasnt taking any chances one scratch and id be alpha female for real i sighted down the barrel and felt that quietness fill me i felt nothing while i stared down the gun at him nothing but a cool white emptiness stop it both of you richard growled he walked towards us i kept my eyes on the wolf but had a peripheral sense of richard moving closer he kept coming easing himself between jason and me i had to aim the gun skyward to keep from pointing it at his chest he stared at me his face thoughtful you wont need the gun he knocked the great wolf to the floor with his fist the wolf lay stunned only the rise and fall of its chest showed it was still alive when he turned back to me his eyes were amber and no longer human you are my lupa anita but i am still ulfric i wont let you do to me what raina has done to marcus i lead this pack there was a hardness to his voice that was new id discovered his male ego at last jeanclaude laughed a high delighted sound that made me shiver richard hugged his bare arms as if he felt it too dont you realize by now richard that ma petiteis either your equal or your master she knows no other way to be he came to stand by us he looked amused as hell i want her to be my equal richard said but not within the pack jeanclaude said richard shook his head no i mean no anita is my equal then what are you bitching about i said he glared at me with his alien eyes i am ulfric not you lead and ill follow richard i stepped close to him almost touching but lead richard really lead or get out of the way as amusing as this is jeanclaude said and believe me ma petite richard it is amusing we do not have time for this particular argument not if richard stands any hope of not being forced to kill tonight we both glared at him and he gave that graceful shrug that meant everything and nothing we must call the magic again but this time richard needs to try and pull some of it into himself he needs to do something that would impress his pack this he motioned to the zombies though impressive looks too much like anitas work youve got a suggestion i take it perhaps he said his eyes turned very serious then the humor dying away until his face was lovely and blank but first i think i have a question or two for you myself ma petite i think it is not only richard that you are emasculating today what are you talking about i asked he cocked his head to one side perhaps you honestly do not know he sounded surprised there is a small hallway to the right look inside it i could see the archway at the top of the hall but the zombies filled the space hiding the rest from view move forward i said the zombies moved like a single organism their dead eyes watching my face as if i were all that mattered to them i was the zombies moved like a shambling curtain i could see the smaller hallway now and the figures waiting inside stop i said the zombies stopped as if id hit a switch liv the blond bouncer from danse macabre stood just inside the smaller hallway she was still dressed in her violet body suit her extraordinary violet eyes stared at me empty waiting my pulse thudded in my throat there were other figures behind her richard said softly this isnt possible i didnt argue with him it would have been too hard bring them out ma petite let us see who you have called from their coffins his voice was warm with the beginnings of anger whats eating you he laughed but it was bitter i threatened my people with this but you said nothing you did not tell me you could truly raise vampires like any other zombie ive only done it once before indeed he said dont get all pissy on me i shall get pissy if i want to he said these are my people my companions and you have them walking around like puppets i find that most disquieting so do i i said i looked back at the vampires liv who had been so animated last night stood there like a wellpreserved zombie no no id never have mistaken her for a zombie i could feel a difference but there she stood that muscular body waiting for my next order there were others behind her i couldnt see how many too many can you put my vampires back ma petite i continued to look at liv avoiding jeanclaudes eyes i dont know he touched my chin turning me to face him he studied my face eyes searching as if some hint of truth might show through i let anger fill my face anger was always a great thing to hide behind what did you do with the last vampire you raised ma petite i pulled away from him he grabbed my arm unbelievably fast too fast to see what happened next was simply automatic he held my right upper arm but i could still bend at the elbow and point the firestar at him the uzi in my left hand pointed at him too he could have crushed my arm before i fired one gun but not both but for the first time staring down the barrel of a gun at him was problematic the sash of his robe had come loose and i could see a triangle of pale flesh i could see where his heart would be i could blow his heart out his back and sever his spine and i didnt want to do it i didnt want to splatter that beautiful body all over the wall damn richard came closer he didnt touch either of us he just stared from one to the other is he hurting you anita no i said then should you be pointing a gun at him he shouldnt be touching me i said richards voice was very mild he just finished touching you a lot more than this anita why are you helping him he helped me besides if you kill him over something small and stupid youll never forgive yourself i took a deep breath and let it out some of the tension eased with the breath i lowered the uzi jeanclaude released my arm i pointed the firestar at the floor and looked at richard there was something in his eyes even the wolfs amber eyes that was all too human pain he knew how much jeanclaude meant to me it was there in his eyes that one comment said that he understood my relationship with the vampire maybe better than i did i wanted to apologize to him but i wasnt sure hed understand what it was for i wasnt even sure i could explain it if you love someone truly love them you should never cause them pain never fill their eyes with something so close to grief im sorry i got mad at you earlier you want whats best for the pack i know that you still think im a fool to want a bloodless coup he said i stood on tiptoe and kissed him gently not a fool just naive terribly naive very touching ma petite and i do appreciate your interference on my behalf richard but these are my people i promised them certain freedoms when they joined me i ask again can you put them back as they were i turned to jeanclaude one hand still balancing against richards chest i dont know then you had better find out ma petite it sounded too much like a threat for my taste but there was a figure behind liv the bouncer that i couldnt take my eyes off of i walked towards the waiting vampires i opened my mouth but no sound came out my stomach clenched into a hard lump my chest was tight i finally said it willie mccoy come to me willie walked out from behind the tall blond vampire he was wearing the same chartreuse suit hed had on at danse macabre his brown eyes seemed to see me but they were empty of that spark that was willie he wasnt home it was like watching a puppet moving and i was the puppet master i tasted something bitter at the back of my throat my eyes were hot and tight i wasnt sure if i was going to throw up or cry first i stopped him about two feet from me close enough that i couldnt pretend or wish it away i swallowed hard and tears hot enough to scald ran down my face i didnt want to know this i whispered jeanclaude came to stand beside me willie he said his voice vibrated through the room willies body thrummed to the sound like a tuning fork struck willie look at me the blank familiar face turned slowly towards his master something flickered through the eyes for a moment something moved that i had no name for this has possibilities jeanclaude said willie i said look at me my voice wasnt nearly as impressive as the vampires but willie turned to me no jeanclaude said look at me willie willie hesitated willie i said come to me i held out a hand and he took a step towards me jeanclaude said stop willie do not go to her willie hesitated almost turning to jeanclaude i concentrated on that curl of power inside of me that thing that allowed me to raise the dead and let it wash over me flow out of me i called willies body to me and nothing jeanclaude could do would get him to turn away from me richard said stop it both of you he isnt a doll he isnt alive either i said he deserves better than this richard said i agreed i turned to jeanclaude hes mine jeanclaude theyre all mine when night falls they will be yours again but their empty shells are mine i stepped close to him and that swirl of power lashed out he took a hissing breath and backed up holding his hand as if id struck him never forget what i am and what i can do no more threats between us ever or it will be the last threat he stared at me and for just a second there was a flash of something i hadnt seen before fear fear of me for the first time good willie stared at me with empty waiting eyes he was dead well and truly dead tears flowed down my face tight and hard poor willie poor me he wasnt human all these months of being his friend and he was dead just dead damn what happened to the first vampire you raised ma petite why didnt you put it back into its coffin a thought slid behind his eyes i watched the idea form and fall from his lips how did monsieur bouvier get the lower half of his body melted away magnus bouvier had been serephinas mortal servant it had been his job to keep me near serephinas coffin until she rose to finish me off i scrubbed at my face trying to get rid of the tears always ruins the effect when you cry you know the answer i said my voice sounded strained and small say it aloud ma petite let me hear it from your own lips i feel like im missing part of this conversation richard said what are you two talking about tell him ma petite the vampire grabbed magnus around the waist and held on id planned on it slowing him down nothing else i got to the door and ran outside the sunlight hit the vampire and it burst into flames i expected magnus to go back inside but he didnt he kept coming dragging her into the light saying it fast didnt make it any better i stood in the middle of the dead i had called hugging myself i still had dreams about serephina still saw magnus reaching out to me begging me to save him i could have shot him and never lost a moments sleep but burning him alive was torture i didnt do torture not to mention that ellie quinlan had already risen as a vampire which made her legally alive id killed them both and it hadnt been pretty richard was looking at me a look of something close to horror on his face you burned the man and the vampire alive i watched the brown in his eyes swim back to the surface the entire shape of the eye changed while i watched it looked almost like it should hurt if it did hurt he never showed it i didnt plan it richard i didnt want it to happen but i would have done anything to escape serephina anything i dont understand that i know i said there is no shame in surviving ma petite i turned to jeanclaude there was no shock on his face it was lovely and unreadable as a dolls then why cant i read your face right now life flowed back into his face filled his eyes moved behind his skin until he was there staring at me the look in his eyes wasnt what i expected fear was still there and surprise but underneath was worry better he asked yes i frowned whats worrying you he sighed all honesty is eventually punished but not usually this quickly answer me jeanclaude his eyes went past me to the werewolves waiting at richards back no one must speak of what has happened here not to anyone why not richard asked it would embarrass ma petite thats true i said but thats not what you mean you dont mind embarrassing me hell this story would make a great threat for all your vampires itd scare the hell out of them that ma petite is the point i sighed stop being obtuse and just tell us i do not want this he waved at the vampires coming to the attention of the vampire council why not richard and i asked together put simply ma petite they will kill you im your registered human servant i said you said you did that to keep me safe for this they will come and see for themselves ma petite whoever they send will know instantly that you do not bear my marks you are my servant in name only that will not be enough for them without any binding between us they will not trust you so theyll kill her just like that richard asked he moved closer to me as if hed touch me but his hands hesitated above my shoulders without looking at him i said one story about burning people alive and you dont want to touch me you prejudiced little werewolf you i tried to keep my voice light but a harsh edge crept in his hands gripped my shoulders tightly it really bothers you what you did doesnt it i turned to see his face his hands still on my shoulders of course it bothers me i didnt just kill magnus i tortured him to death ellie quinlan didnt deserve to be burned alive i shook my head and tried to step away from him he slid his arms across my back holding me gently against him im sorry you had to do it he touched my hair with one hand the other still against my back your eyes are haunted by it by what you did dont take this wrong but it makes me feel better to see that pain in your eyes i pushed away from him did you think i could kill someone by torture and feel nothing he met my eyes but it seemed like it was an effort i wasnt sure i shook my head jeanclaude took my left hand the other was still holding the firestar he turned me to face him he raised my hand towards his lips as he bowed slowly towards me he spoke as he moved there is nothing that you could ever do that would make me not desire the touch of your body he kissed my hand his lips lingered a little longer than was polite his tongue licked across my skin and i pulled away it scares you that i can raise vampires like this perhaps ma petite but i have frightened you for years and yet you are still here he had a point i stared at willie lets see if we can put everyone back where they belong i hoped i could do it i wanted willie back even if it was only a lie he walked he talked it was still willie or maybe i just wanted it to be willie maybe i needed it to be willie take me to the coffin room i said why jeanclaude asked there was something in the way he said that one word that made me stare at him because i asked how would my flock feel if i allowed the executioner to enter their private chamber while they slept helpless im not going to kill anybody today not on purpose i do not like the way you said that ma petite uncontrolled power is unpredictable jeanclaude all sorts of unpleasant things can happen i need to see where the vampires will be resting i want to try and put them back in a controlled manner what sorts of unpleasant things richard asked it was a good question since i was pretty much flying blind i didnt have a good answer it takes less power to put back than it does to raise if we just call it up wild and try to will them back i shook my head you could extinguish their life force cassandra said i looked at her what did you say youre going to put them back in their coffins as you would a zombie but with a zombie you will it to be dead again correct i hadnt really thought of it that way but she was right if you will the vampires back in their coffins youre in effect willing them dead again like a zombie right yeah but you dont want them permanently dead my head was beginning to hurt no i dont want them permanently dead how do you know so very much about necromancy cassandra jeanclaude asked i have a masters degree in magical theory that must be useful on a resume i said not in the least she said but it might be useful now did you know your newest pack member was so welleducated richard jeanclaude asked yes he said its one of the reasons i gave her permission to move here permission to move here i said why did she need your permission a werewolf has to get the permission of the local pack leader before they can enter a new territory if they dont its considered a challenge to his authority did she have to ask your permission or marcuss both cassandra said most werewolves wont come near saint louis while this power struggle is going on why did you come then my wolf jeanclaude asked i liked what i heard about richard hes trying to bring the pack into the twentieth century did you come planning to be his lupa i asked yes a little twinge of jealousy had reared its ugly head cassandra smiled maybe but the jobs filled i came here to avoid fighting not to start it you have come to the wrong place i fear jeanclaude said she shrugged if i waited until the battle was over and it was safe i wouldnt be worth much would i you came to fight at monsieur zeemans side i came because i agree with what hes trying to do you dont approve of killing i asked not really why richard you have found a kindred spirit jeanclaude said smiling and far too pleased cassandra believes in the sanctity of life a lot of people do richard said he wouldnt look at me if shes a better match for you than i am i wont stand in your way he turned to me a look of astonishment on his face anita he shook his head im in love with you youd get over it i said my chest was tight with the offer but i meant it richard and i had a basic fundamental difference of opinion it wasnt going away one of us was going to have to compromise and it wasnt going to be me i couldnt quite meet richards eyes but i didnt take it back he stepped in front of me and all i could see was his bare chest there was a scratch just below his left nipple blood drying on his skin in darkening strings he touched my chin raising my face until i met his eyes he studied my face like hed never seen it before i would never get over losing you anita never nevers a long time to tie yourself to a killer you dont have to be a killer he said i stepped away from him if youre hanging around me waiting for me to soften up and become this good little girl you might as well leave now he grabbed my arms pulling me against his body i want you anita all of you he kissed me arms locked behind my back raising me up against him i slid my hands behind his back firestar still in one hand i pressed my body against his hard enough to know he was happy to see me we came up for air and i pulled back but not out of his arms halflaughing i caught a glimpse of jeanclaude standing to one side the look on his face wiped the smile from my lips it wasnt jealousy it was hunger desire watching us together had excited him i drew back from richard and found blood on my hands it was hard to tell on the navy blue shirt but there were wet spots where id pressed myself against the bloody scratches some of the wounds were deep enough that they were still seeping blood richard was looking at jeanclaude too now i stepped away from richard holding up the bloody hand i walked towards the vampire and his eyes stayed on the fresh blood not on me i stopped less than a foot from him my hand held out in front of his face which would you rather have right now sex or blood his eyes flicked to my face back to my hand then to my face i watched the effort it took for him to keep eye contact ask richard which he would rather have just after he changes into a wolf sex or fresh meat i glanced back at richard whats your choice just after the change meat he said it like i should have known the answer i turned back to the vampire i slid the firestar into the front of my pants and moved the bloody hand towards his lips jeanclaude grabbed my wrist do not tease me ma petite my control is not boundless a tremor ran through his arm and down his hand he looked away eyes closed i touched his face with my right hand turning him back to face me who says im teasing i said softly take us to the coffin room jeanclaude searched my face what do you offer me ma petite blood i said and sex he asked which would you rather have right this minute i stared at him willing the truth in his face he gave a shaky laugh blood i smiled and pulled my wrist away remember it was your choice a look passed over his face that was a mixture of surprise and irony touchй ma petite but i am beginning to have hopes that this will not be the last time i am given the choice there was a heat to his voice his eyes just standing this close to his body that made me shiver i glanced back at richard he was watching us i expected to see jealousy or anger but all i could read in his eyes was need lust i was pretty sure that richards choice right this minute would be sex but the thought of a little blood thrown in didnt seem to worry him in fact it seemed to excite him i was beginning to wonder if the werewolf and vampire shared similar tastes in foreplay the thought should have scared me but it didnt that was a very very bad sign the last time id been in the coffin room under circus of the damned id come to slay the current master of the city id come to slay every vampire in the place my how things had changed track lighting in solid white fixtures clung to the walls casting soft halos of light on each of seven coffins three of the coffins were empty their lids propped open all of the coffins were modern new roomy they were all a rich varnished oak stained nearly black silver handles graced the wood the satin linings of the open coffins were different colors white blue red the coffin with the red interior held a sword in a specially made side sheath a freaking twohanded sword as long as i was tall a pair of the ugliest fuzzy dice id ever seen were suspended from the white satin coffin it had to be willies the blue satin held a small extra pillow standing over the coffin the smell of herbs rose musty vaguely sweet i touched the small pillow and found it filled with dried herbs herbs for sweet dreams i said to no one in particular is there some purpose to you handling their personal belongings ma petite i looked at him what keepsakes do you have in your coffin he just smiled why all the same coffins if you came in here to kill us where would you start i looked around at the identical coffins i dont know if someone comes in they cant tell whos the oldest or whos the master of the city it covers your ass but endangers the rest if someone comes to kill us ma petite it is to everyones benefit if the oldest are not killed first there is always a chance that one of the older ones could awaken in time to save the rest i nodded why the extrawide extrahigh interiors would you want to spend eternity on your back ma petite he smiled and came to stand beside me leaning his butt against the open coffin arms crossed over his chest there are so many other more comfortable positions i felt heat rise up my face richard joined us are you two going to exchange witty repartee or are we going to do this he leaned on the closed end of the coffin forearms resting on it there was a bloody scratch on his right upper arm he seemed at home jason still furry and big enough to ride padded over the stone floor nails clicking the wolfs head was high enough that it licked richards bloody arm while still on all fours there were moments when i felt richard was too normal to fit into my life this wasnt one of them yeah were going to do it i said richard stood running his fingers through his thick hair getting it out of his face and showing his chest off to good advantage for the first time i wondered if hed done it on purpose i searched his face for that edge of teasing that jeanclaude had that knowledge that even that simple movement touched me there was nothing richards face was guileless handsome empty of ulterior motives i exchanged glances with jeanclaude he shrugged if you do not understand him do not look to me i am not in love with him richard looked puzzled did i miss something he stroked under the wolfs throat pressing the head against his chest the wolf made a high whimpering sound of pleasure glad to be back in the pack leaders good graces i guess i shook my head not really why are we here stephen asked he was as close to the door as he could get and not be outside the room his shoulders were hunched he was scared but of what cassandra stood near stephen inside the room closer to us her face was bland unreadable except for a certain wariness around the eyes they both wore jeans with oversized shirts stephens was a mans pale blue dress shirt cassandra had an oversized tshirt a dull pine green with a wolfs head done large with huge yellow eyes whats wrong stephen richard asked stephen blinked and shook his head we all heard anita tell jeanclaude shed need more blood fresh blood cassandra said she looked at me while she finished the thought i think stephens worried where the fresh bloods coming from im not into human sacrifice i said some people dont consider a lycanthrope human cassandra said i do i said she looked at me judging my words some lycanthropes could tell if you were lying i was betting she was one of them then where are you going to get the blood it was a good question i wasnt sure i had a good answer i dont know but it wont take a death are you sure she asked i shrugged if it takes a death to put them back theyre dead im not going to kill anybody else to bring them back i looked at the three waiting vampires after i said it liv willie and surprisingly damian raising the vampires was impressive enough raising one as powerful as damian was downright scary he wasnt a master vampire never would be but hed have frightened me in a fair fight now he stood dressed only in the green lycra pants and the pirate sash his upper body gleamed like muscled marble under the glow of the lights his green eyes stared at me with a patient waiting that only the truly dead can manage you are shivering ma petite we raise the power again then we need blood i looked at jeanclaude and richard if richard has to fight marcus tonight im not sure he should be the one who supplies this round of blood jeanclaude cocked his head to one side i expected him to say something irritating but he didnt maybe even a very old dog could learn new tricks he is not sinking fangs into you richard said anger made his brown eyes dark and sparkling he was lovely when he was angry that aura of energy flared around him close enough to creep down my bare skin you cant donate twice this close together with marcus waiting for you i said richard grabbed me by the upper arms you dont understand anita feeding is like sex to him again i halfexpected jeanclaude to chime in but he didnt i had to say it damn it wont be the first time hes done it richard richards fingers dug into my arms i know that i saw the fang marks on your wrist but remember you werent under any mind control that time i remember i said it hurt like hell richard drew me to him with his hands still holding only my upper arms drew me to tiptoe as if hed drag me to his face without mind control its like rape not the real thing itll be real this time youre hurting me richard my voice was calm steady but the look on his face scared me the intensity in his hands his face his body was unnerving he eased down but didnt take his hands away take blood from jason or cassandra i shook my head that might work or it might not if the blood comes from one of us i know itll work besides should you be offering up other peoples blood without asking them first doubt slid behind his eyes and he let me go his long hair fell forward hiding his face you say youve chosen me that youre in love with me that you dont want to have sex with him now you tell me you want him to feed off of you thats as bad as sex he stalked the room pacing around the waiting vampires swinging back in an agitated stride that filled the room with a warm creeping power i didnt say i wanted to feed him i said he stopped in the middle of the room staring at me but you do dont you no i said and it was true ive never been interested in that she speaks the truth jeanclaude said at last you stay out of this richard said pointing a finger at him jeanclaude gave a small bow and fell silent he was behaving himself far too well made me nervous of course richard was having enough of a fit for both of them then let me feed him again isnt it sexual for you too i asked richard shook his head it was you i was looking at anita not him a little pain is fine it was my turn to shake my head are you truly saying that letting him sink fangs into my body would bother you as much as sinking i let the thought die unspoken i see donating blood as the lesser evil richard dont you yes he hissed his power was filling the room like warm electric water i could almost reach out and grab it then what are you bitching about i said we wouldnt have done it the first time but you wanted me to do it you wanted us to do it i stalked towards him finally angry myself you dont want to kill marcus fine but this is the price you want enough power to cow the rest of the pack without losing your humanity great but that kind of power isnt free i stood in front of him so close that his power danced over my skin like fine needles like sex that rode that edge between pleasure and pain its too late to back out now we are not going to strand willie and the others because youre getting cold feet i took that last step putting our bodies so close together that a deep breath would have made them touch i lowered my voice to a whisper though i knew everything in the room would still hear me it isnt the blood that bothers you what bothers you is that you enjoyed it i lowered my voice until it was almost a movement of lips with only a breath of sound jeanclaude isnt just seducing me hes seducing us richard stared down at me and the look in his true brown eyes was lost hopeless a little boy whos discovered the monster under the bed is actually real and its screwing mommy jeanclaudes power eased through the room mingling with richards electric warmth like a cool wind from the grave we both turned and looked at the vampire he was smiling ever so slightly he undid his robe and let it fall to the floor he glided towards us wearing nothing but his silk pajamas and a knowing smile his own power making his long hair flare round his face like a small wind richard touched my shoulders and even that chaste touch sent a line of warm shivering energy along my skin the power was there for the calling just below the surface we didnt need all the sexual charades jeanclaude reached a pale hand out towards me i met his hand with mine and that one touch was enough that cool burning power flowed over me through me into richard i heard richard gasp jeanclaude started to move forward like hed press his body against mine i held him away from me with the hand that was entwined in his straightarming him its here jeanclaude cant you feel it he nodded your power calls to me ma petite richards hands slid over my shoulders his face brushing my hair now what we ride the power this time it doesnt ride us how richard whispered jeanclaude looked at me with eyes that were deep as any ocean and as full of secrets i believe ma petitehas a plan yeah i said i have a plan i looked from one to the other of them im going to call dominic dumare and see if he knows how to put vampires back in their coffins dominic had been cleared of roberts murder he had an airtight alibi hed been with a woman even if he hadnt been i might have asked for his help i wanted to save willie more than i wanted to revenge robert a strange expression crossed jeanclaudes face you asking for help ma petite that is unusual i drew away from both of them we could get the power back i was pretty certain of that i looked at willies empty face and the fuzzy dice hanging from his coffin if i make a mistake willies gone i want him back there were times when i thought that it wasnt jeanclaude who had convinced me that vampires werent always monsters it was willie and dead dave excop and bar owner it was a host of lesser vampires that seemed occasionally like nice guys jeanclaude was a lot of things nice was not one of them dominic dumare showed up wearing a pair of black dress slacks and a black leather jacket unzipped over a grey silk tshirt he looked more relaxed without sabin looking on like an employee on his day off even the neatly trimmed vandyke beard and mustache seemed less formal dominic walked around the three vampires id raised wed moved back out into the rubblestrewn main area so he could see the zombies and the vampires all at once he paced around the vampires touching them here and there he grinned at me teeth flashing in his dark beard this is marvelous truly marvelous i fought the urge to frown at him forgive me if i dont share your enthusiasm can you help me put them back the way they were theoretically yes when people start using the word theoretically it means they dont know how to do something you cant help me can you now now dominic said he knelt by willie staring up at him studying him like a bug under a bioscope i didnt say i couldnt help its true that ive never seen this done and you say youve done this before he stood up brushing off the knees of his pants once that time was without the triumvirate dominic asked id had to tell him i understood enough about ritual magic to know that if we withheld how wed gotten this much power anything dominic helped us come up with wouldnt work it would be like telling the police it was a burglary when it was really a murder theyd be trying to solve the wrong crime yeah the first time was just me but both times in daylight hours he asked i nodded that makes sense we can only raise zombies after the souls have flown it would make sense that vampires can only be raised during the day when darkness falls their souls return i wasnt even going to try and argue about whether or not vampires had souls i wasnt as sure of the answer as i used to be i cant raise zombies during daylight hours let alone vampires i said dominic motioned at all the waiting dead of both kinds but you did it i shook my head thats not the point im not supposed to be able to do it have you ever tried to raise normal zombies during daylight hours well no the man who trained me said it wasnt possible so you never tried dominic said i hesitated before answering you have tried he said i cant do it i cant even call the power under the light of the sun only because you believe you cant dominic said run that by me again belief is one of the most important aspects of magic you mean if i dont believe i can raise zombies during the day i cant exactly that doesnt make sense richard said he leaned against one of the intact walls hed been very quiet while i talked magic with dominic jason still in wolf form lay at his feet stephen had cleared some of the broken stones and sat beside the wolf actually i said it does ive seen people with a lot of raw talent that couldnt raise anything one guy was convinced it was a mortal sin so he just blocked it out but he shone with power whether he wanted to accept it or not a shapeshifter can deny his power all he wants but that doesnt keep him from changing richard said i believe that is why lycanthropy is referred to as a curse dominic said richard looked at me the expression on his face was eloquent a curse youll have to forgive dominic jeanclaude said a hundred years ago it never occurred to anyone that lycanthropy could be a disease concern for richards feelings i asked his happiness is your happiness ma petite jeanclaudes new gentlemanly behavior was beginning to bug me i didnt trust his change of heart cassandra said if anita didnt believe she could raise the dead during daylight hours then how did she do it she had joined in the metaphysical discussion like it was a graduate class in magical theory id met people like her in college theorists who had no real magic of their own but they could sit around for hours debating whether a theoretical spell would work they treated magic like higher physics a pure science without any true way of testing heaven forbid the ivory tower magicians should actually try out their theories in a real spell dominic would have fit in well with them except he had his own magic both occasions were extreme situations dominic said it works on the same principle that allows a grandmother to lift a truck off her grandchild in times of great need we often touch abilities beyond the everyday but the grandmother cant lift a car at will just because she did it once i said hmm dominic said perhaps the analogy is not perfect but you understand what i am saying if you say you do not you are merely being difficult that almost made me smile so youre saying that i could raise the dead in daylight if i believed i could i believe so i shook my head ive never heard of any animator being able to do that but you are not merely an animator anita dominic said you are a necromancer i have never heard of a necromancer that could raise the dead in broad daylight jeanclaude said dominic shrugged gracefully it reminded me of jeanclaude it takes a couple hundred years to make a shrug pretty i dont know about broad daylight but just as some vampires can walk around during the day as long as they are sufficiently sheltered i believe the same principle would apply to necromancers so you dont believe anita could raise the dead at high noon out of doors either cassandra said dominic shrugged again then he laughed you have caught me my studious beauty it may well be possible for anita to do exactly that but even i have never heard of such a thing i shook my head look we can explore the magical implications later right now can you help me figure a way to put the vampires back without screwing them up define screwing them up dominic said do not joke dominic jeanclaude said you know precisely what she means i want to hear it from her lips jeanclaude looked at me and gave a barely perceptible shrug when darkness falls i want them to rise as vampires im afraid if i do this wrong theyll just be dead permanently you surprise me anita perhaps your reputation as the scourge of the local vampire populace is exaggerated i stared at him before i could say something that sounded like bragging jeanclaude spoke i would think what she has done today is proof enough of how very much she deserves her reputation dominic and the vampire stared at each other something seemed to pass between them a challenge a knowledge something she would make an amazing human servant if only some vampire could tame her dominic said jeanclaude laughed the sound filled the room with echoes that shivered and danced across the skin the laughter swept through my body and for the briefest moment i could feel something touch me deep inside where no hand belonged in another context jeanclaude might have made it sexual now it was simply disturbing dont ever do that again richard said he rubbed his bare arms as if he were cold or trying to erase the memory of that invasive laughter jason trotted over to jeanclaude to butt his head against the vampires hand hed liked it dominic gave a little bow my apologies jeanclaude you have made your point if you wished to you could cause the damage that my master caused by accident at your office my office i said personally i didnt think that jeanclaude could cause damage with just his voice id been in situations where if he could have done it he would have no sense telling dominic that though dominic gave an even lower bow in my direction your office of course can we cut the grandstanding i said can you help us i am more than willing to try i walked up to him picking my way over the broken stones when i was standing as close as was polite and maybe an inch or so more i said these three vampires are not an experiment this is not some graduate study in magical metaphysics you offered to teach me necromancy dominic i think youre not up to the job how can you teach me when i can do things you cant unless of course you can raise vampires from their coffins i stared into his dark eyes the entire time i spoke watching the anger narrow his eyes tighten his lips his ego was as big as id hoped i knew he wouldnt disappoint me dominic would do his best for us now his pride was at stake tell me exactly how you called the power anita and i will build you a spell that should workif you have the control to make it work i smiled at him and i made sure it was just this side of condescending you come up with it i can pull it off he smiled arrogance is not a becoming trait in a woman i find it a very becoming trait jeanclaude said if its deserved if you had just raised three vampires from their daytime rest wouldnt you be arrogant dominic his smile widened yes i would be truth was i didnt feel arrogant i was scared scared that id screwed willie up and he would never rise again i felt bad too about liv and damian it wasnt a matter of liking them or not i didnt mean to do it you shouldnt extinguish someones life force by accident if i felt half as secure as my words to dominic why did my stomach hurt dominic cassandra and i came up with a spell the part of the plan that was my idea was very simple i had put zombies back in their graves for years i was good at it as far as i was able i was going to treat this like just another job laying the dead to rest nothing special lay the zombies first worry about the vamps later i had cassandra fetch one of my knives and a wrist sheath from the bedroom if id been acting as a focus for another animator i wouldnt have let him sink teeth into me so why did the blood have to come from jeanclaude drinking it it didnt or i didnt think it did dominic agreed with me but he wasnt a hundred percent sure so zombies first theyd be the practice if the knife didnt work wed go to fangs but what little normalcy was left to me i was going to cling to id sent stephen for a bowl to hold the blood hed returned with a small golden bowl i wondered if the size was deliberate to encourage me not to spill too much blood for a werewolf stephen didnt seem to like blood very much the bowl was polished to a shine so bright it almost glowed the inside showed the dimpled blows of hammer work beaten gold and i knew as soon as i touched it it was old why does everyone think you have to have something special to hold the blood tupperware would have worked we stood in the rubblestrewn room where the zombies waited patient as only the dead can be some of the eyes that watched me were sunken like the blind eyes of dead fish a few skulls were empty and even without eyes they all seemed to be looking at me i stood knife strapped to my left wrist facing them richard stood to my left jeanclaude to my right they werent touching me by my request dominic had asked for enough details of the first triumvirate that id been embarrassed he agreed with me that the power was probably there without us having to crawl all over each other agreeing to that alone earned him brownie points after all the plan was to raise the magic tonight in front of the whole pack i didnt really want to be having sex in front of that many strangers all right it wasnt exactly sex but it was close enough that i didnt want an audience the glow was fading staring at the partially rotting zombies it was hard to regain the mood my zombies usually hold together better than this i said if you had pulled this much power from two other necromancers the zombies would be better dominic said perhaps it was the lack of control jeanclaude said i turned and looked at him i think dominic means that some of the power that raised them was taken from a dead man do you believe i am a dead man ma petite i stared into that lovely face and nodded the vampires i raised are just corpses whatever you are its a form of necromancy necromancy only works when you start with a dead body he cocked his head to one side i hear your words ma petite but i do not think you believe them not completely i shook my head i dont know what i believe anymore actually dominic said i dont believe it matters that jeanclaude is a vampire i think it is more that neither he nor richard know anything of raising the dead that is your talent alone i think with practice you could channel the power into perfect zombies but in a way jeanclaude is right the wildness of it the lack of control made the zombies less perfect something must have shown on my face because he said you had too many things to control to pay attention to all the details i think you instinctively let the zombies go because it was the part you were most sure of you have excellent instincts thanks i guess i said he smiled i know time is growing short as we can see from jeanclaudes presence not all vampires sleep until full dark i fear that if one of the vampires passes its waking hour that he or she will be lost but i would ask anita to do one thing for me that has nothing to do with her problem but everything to do with mine what problem i asked sabin jeanclaude said dominic nodded sabins time is running short sabin the vampire at the club cassandra asked yeah i said what do you need dominic make it quick and im your girl dominic smiled thank you anita concentrate on one of your zombies try to bring it closer to perfection i frowned at him heal one of your zombies ma petite you cant heal the dead i said but i can make them more lifelike dominic nodded that would do very nicely i usually do that during the initial rush of power ive never tried to fiddle with my dead once they were raised please try dominic said we could raise the power between the three of us then try it i said dominic shook his head i am not sure what that would do to the spell i think it would be taking a great risk with your companions i stared at him for a heartbeat or two youd risk leaving sabin to rot to save our friends you asked for my help anita i think you are not a woman who asks for help often it would be poor payment of such a compliment if i let you risk your friends for mine if you can heal your dead cold as it were so be it if you cannot we will proceed to save these three vampires a very honorable sentiment jeanclaude said there are moments when honor is all that is left dominic said the vampire and the man seemed to have a moment of near perfect understanding a wealth of history if not shared then similar passed between them i was odd woman out i looked to richard and we had our own moment of perfect understanding we valued our mortal life span the fatalism in dominics voice had been frightening how old was he i could usually tell with a vampire but never with a human servant i didnt ask there was a weight of years in dominics brown eyes that made me afraid to ask i looked at jeanclaudes lovely face and wondered if i would be as honorable or would i have risked anyone everyone to heal him to see jeanclaude dead would be one thing but rotted away like sabin it would be worse than death in many ways of course sabin was dying powerful as he was he couldnt hold himself together forever or maybe he could maybe dominic could sew him up in a big sack like the gloves the vampire wore on his hands maybe sabin could go on living even after hed been reduced to so much liquid now that was a hideous thought i stared at the standing dead they looked back one of the zombies was almost intact grey skin clung to the bones more like clay than flesh one blue eye stared at me the other eye had shriveled like a raisin it reminded me of what had happened to sabins eye it would make more sense to say i touched the eye and healed it or that i thought at it and smoothed the flesh like clay it wasnt like that i stared at the zombie i touched that spark inside me that allowed me to raise the dead i drew that part of me outward coaxed it like feeding a small flame and threw it outward into that one zombie i whispered live live id watched it before but it never ceased to amaze me the flesh filled out plumping smoothing a warm flesh tone spread like heat across the grey skin the dry strawlike hair grew and curled brown and soft the dead eye blew up like a small balloon filling the socket two good eyes looked back at me even the tattered clothing mended itself he wore a vest with a gold watch chain his clothes were a hundred years or more out of date i am most impressed dominic said if you changed his clothes he could pass for human i nodded i make great zombies but that wont help your master call one of the vampires from the coffin room why i asked dominic drew a small silver knife from a sheath at his back i hadnt known he had a weapon careless of me what are you going to do with that jeanclaude asked with your permission i will cut one of the vampires and ask anita to heal the wound jeanclaude considered the request then nodded a small cut dominic bowed of course the vamps could heal a small cut on their own eventually if i couldnt heal it no harm done though i wasnt sure the vampires would agree with me anita dominic said i called damian come to me jeanclaude raised his eyebrows at my choice i think if he expected me to call willie he didnt understand willie was my friend even dead i didnt want to see him cut up damian had tried to mindrape a woman tonight at the club let him get cut up just a little damian walked in staring until he found me his face was still blank and empty emptier than sleep empty as only death can make it damian stop the vampire stopped his eyes were the greenest id ever seen greener than catherines more cat than human dominic stepped in front of damian he stared at the vampire he laid the silver blade against the pale cheek and pulled the point downward sharply blood flowed down that perfect paleness in a thin crimson wash the vampire never reacted not even to blink anita dominic said i stared at damian no damians shell i flung power at him into him i willed him to live that was the word i whispered to him the blood slowed then stopped the cut knit together seamlessly it was easy dominic wiped the blood away with a handkerchief hed drawn from his jacket pocket damians pale cheek was flawless once more it was cassandra who said it first she could heal sabin dominic nodded she just might he turned to me with a look of triumph elation you would need the power of your triumvirate to raise sabin during his daylight slumber but once raised i think you could heal him a shallow cut is one thing i said sabin is a mess will you try if we can put these three vamps back unharmed yeah ill try tomorrow i nodded why not i cannot wait to tell sabin what i have seen here today he has been without hope for so long but first we must put your friends back i will help you all i can i smiled i know enough of magic dominic to know that all you can do is advise from the sidelines but it will be very good advice he said with a smile i believed him for sabins sake he wanted us to succeed okay lets do it i held my hands out to richard and jeanclaude they took my hands dutifully enough and it was pleasant holding their hands both of them were warm and lovely but there was no instant magic no spark i realized that in some strange way the sexual interplay took the place of the ritual rituals arent absolutely necessary to most magic but they serve as a way to focus to prepare yourself for the act of casting a spell i had no blood circle to walk i had no sacrifice to kill i had no paraphernalia to use all i had was the two men standing in front of me my own body and the knife at my wrist i turned away from both of them nothings happening i said what do you expect to happen dominic asked i shrugged something i dont know you are trying too hard anita relax let the power come to you i rotated my shoulders trying to ease the tension it didnt work i really wish you hadnt reminded me that some of the vamps could rise before dark its late afternoon and were underground it could already be too late thinking like that is not helpful dominic said jeanclaude walked up to me and even before he touched me there was a rush of power like a spill of warmth over my skin dont touch me i said i felt him hesitate behind me what is wrong ma petite nothing i turned to face him i held my hand just above his bare chest and that line of warmth traveled from his skin to mine it was as if his body breathed against me do you feel that he cocked his head to one side magic aura i said i had to fight an urge to glance at dominic like looking to a coach to see if this was the play he wanted i was afraid to look away to lose that thread i held my hand out to richard walk towards me but dont touch me he looked puzzled but did what i asked when my hand was just above his skin that same line of warmth came up like a small captive wind i could feel their energy breathing against my skin one to each hand i closed my eyes and concentrated on the sensation there i could feel a difference slight almost indiscernible but there there was a prickling almost electric tremble to richard jeanclaude was cool and smooth all right we could touch auras so what where did that get us i pressed my hands suddenly forward through the energy against their bodies i forced that energy back into them and got a gasp from both of them the shock of it ran up my arms and i bowed my head breathing through the rush of power i raised my face up to meet their eyes i dont know what showed on my face but whatever it was richard didnt like it he started to take a step back i dug fingernails into his stomach just enough to get his attention dont break the connection he swallowed his eyes were wide and there was something close to fear in them but he stayed put i turned to jeanclaude he didnt look scared he looked as calm and controlled as i felt very good anita dominics voice came soft low combine their power as if they were simply two other animators you are acting as focus youve done that before youve laid the dead to rest a thousand times this is only one more time okay coach i whispered what richard said i shook my head nothing i stepped back from them slowly hands extended towards them the power trailed between us like two ropes there was nothing to see but from the look on richards face we all felt it i unsheathed the knife and picked up the golden bowl without looking down my gaze on the two of them there was a difference between this and combining with other animators there was lust love something whatever it was it acted like fuel or glue i had no words for what it was but it was there when i looked at them i held the gold bowl in my left hand knife in the right i walked back to them hold the bowl for me one hand apiece why richard asked because i said so he looked like he wanted to argue i laid the flat of the blade against his lips if you question everything i say it spoils my concentration i took the knife away from his mouth dont do that again he said voice soft almost harsh i nodded fine i held my wrist over the empty bowl and drew the knife down the skin in one sharp movement blood welled out of the cut falling in thick drops splashing down the sides and bottom of the gleaming gold bowl yes it did hurt your turn richard i kept my wrist over the bowl no need to waste the blood what do i do put your wrist over the bowl he hesitated then did what i asked he put his arm over the bowl hand balled into a fist i turned his hand over to expose the underside of his arm i steadied his hand with my still bleeding hand the bowl wavered where his free hand was still holding it with jeanclaude i looked up at his face why does this bother you more than jeanclaude tasting you he swallowed a lot of things dont bother me when im thinking about sex spoken like someone with only one x chromosome i said i drew the knife down his skin in one firm bite while he was still looking at my face the only thing that kept him from pulling away was my hold on him he didnt struggle after that initial surprise he watched his blood splash into the bowl mingling with mine the bottom of the bowl was hidden from sight covered in warm blood i released his hand and he held his bleeding wrist over the bowl jeanclaude i said he held his own slender wrist out to me without being asked i steadied his wrist as i had richards i met his dark blue eyes but there was no fear there nothing but perhaps a mild curiosity i cut his wrist and the blood welled crimson against his white skin his blood splashed into the bowl it was all red human lycanthrope and vampire you couldnt tell who was who by just looking we all bleed red there still wasnt enough blood to walk a circle of power around the sixty or so zombies there was no way short of a true sacrifice to get that much blood but what i had in my hands was a very potent magic cocktail dominic thought it would be enough i hoped so a sound brought my attention away from the blood and the growing warmth of power stephen and jason were crouched near us one in human form one wolf with nearly identical looks in their eyes hunger i looked past them to cassandra she was standing her ground but her hands were balled into fists and a sheen of sweat gleamed on her upper lip the look on her face was near panic dominic stood smiling and unaffected he was the only other human in the room jason growled at us but it wasnt a real growl there was a rhythm to the noise he was trying to talk stephen moistened his lips jason wants to know if we can lick the bowl i looked at jeanclaude and richard the looks on their faces were enough am i the only one in this room not lusting after the blood except for dominic i fear so ma petite do what you have to do anita but do it quick its full moon and fresh blood is fresh blood richard said the two other vamps id raised shuffled towards me their eyes still empty of personality like wellmade dolls did you call them richard asked no i said the blood called them dominic said the vampires came into the room they didnt look at me this time they looked at the blood and the moment they saw it something flared in them i felt it hunger no one was home but the need was still there damians green eyes stared at the bowl with the same hunger his handsome face thinned down to something beastial and primitive i licked my lips and said stop they did but they stared at the freshly spilled blood never raising their eyes to me if i hadnt been here to stop them they might have fed fed like revenants animalistic vampires that know nothing but the hunger and never regain their humanity or their minds my heart thudded into my throat at the thought of what id almost loosed upon some unsuspecting person the hunger wouldnt have differentiated between human and lycanthrope wouldnt that have been a fine fight i took the bloody bowl cradling it against my stomach the knife still in my right hand do not be afraid dominic said lay the zombies to rest as you have a thousand times over the years do that and that alone one step at a time right i said indeed he said i nodded okay everyone but the three vampires looked at me as if they believed i knew what i was doing i wished i did even dominic looked confident but he didnt have to put sixty zombies back in the ground without a circle of power i did i had to watch my step on the rubblestrewn floor it wouldnt do to fall and spill all this blood all this power because thats what it was i could feel jeanclaude and richard at my back like two braids of a rope twisting inside me as i moved dominic had said that i would be able to feel both of the men when id asked for specifics about how i would be able to feel them he had gone vague magic was too individualistic for exactness if he told me one way and it felt another it would have made me doubt hed been right i stirred the knife through the blood and flung blood on the waiting zombies with the blade only a few drops fell on them but every time the blood touched one i could feel it a shock of power a jolt i ended in the center of the once walled room surrounded by the zombies when the blood touched the last one a shock ran through me that tore a gasp from my throat i felt the blood close round the dead it was similar to closing a circle of power but it was like the closure was inside me rather than outside back i said back into your graves all of you back into the ground the dead shuffled around me positioning themselves like sleepwalkers in a game of musical chairs as each one reached its place it lay down and the raw earth poured over them all like water the earth swallowed them back and smoothed over them as if a giant hand had come to neaten everything up i was alone in the room with the earth still twitching like a horse thick with flies when the last ripple had died away i looked out of the blasted wall at the others jeanclaude and richard stood at the opening of the wall the three werewolves clustered around them even cassandra had knelt on the ground beside the wolf that was jason dominic stood behind them watching he was grinning at me like a proud papa i walked towards them my legs a touch rubbery and i stumbled splashing blood down the side of the bowl crimson drops fell onto the swept earth the wolf was suddenly there licking the ground clean i ignored it and kept walking vampires next everyone moved to let me pass as if they were afraid to touch me except for dominic he crowded almost too close i felt his own power crackle between us shivering over my skin down the ropes of power that bound me to richard and jeanclaude i swallowed and said back up my apologies he moved back until i couldnt feel him quite so tightly good enough i nodded the three vampires waited with hungry eyes i sprinkled them with the cooling blood they twitched when the blood touched them but there was no rush of power nothing shit dominic frowned the blood is still warm it should work jeanclaude moved closer i could feel it without turning around i could feel him coming down the line of power between us like a fish being reeled in but it is not working he said no i said they are lost then i shook my head willie was staring at the bowl of blood the look was feral pure hunger id thought that the worst thing that could happen would be for willie to simply lie down in his coffin and be truly dead i was wrong having willie crawl out of his coffin craving nothing but blood knowing nothing but hunger would be worse i would not loose him not yet any bright ideas i asked feed them the blood in the bowl dominic said but hurry before it grows colder i didnt argue there was no time i wiped the knife on my jeans and sheathed it id have to clean it and the sheath later but i needed my hands free i dipped my fingertips into the blood it was still warm but barely the eyes were still brown as they followed my hand but it wasnt willie looking out of them it just wasnt i lifted the gold bowl to willies mouth and said willie drink his throat moved swallowing furiously and i felt that click he was mine again stop willie he stopped and i took the bowl away from him he didnt grab for it he didnt move at all his eyes were blank and empty above his bloody mouth go back to your coffin willie rest until nightfall back to your coffin to rest he turned and walked back down the hallway id have to trust he was going back to the coffin id check later one down two to go liv left like a good little puppet the blood was getting pretty low by the time i raised it to damians lips he drank at it his pale throat swallowing the blood passed down his throat and something brushed me something that wasnt my magic something else damians chest rose in a great breath like a man struggling back from drowning and that something thrust me backwards cast out my power turned it back on me it was like a door slammed but it was more than that a force thrust at me hit me and the world swirled around my vision was eaten away in greyness and white spots i heard my own heartbeat impossibly loud the thudding chased me down into the darkness then even that was lost i woke staring up at the white drapes above jeanclaudes bed there was a damp washcloth folded over my forehead and voices arguing i lay there for a few seconds just blinking i couldnt remember how id gotten here i remembered the sensation of being cast out of damian id been cast out like an intruder something to be protected against the force that touched me hadnt been evil id felt evil before and that wasnt it but it certainly hadnt been a beneficent force either more neutral maybe the voices were jeanclaude and richard the argument was about me big surprise how can you let her die when you could save her richard asked i do not believe she is dying but even if she was without her permission i will never again invade her mind even if she was dying yes jeanclaude said i dont understand that you dont have to understand it richard anita would agree with me i brushed the rag from my head i wanted to sit up but it seemed too much effort richard sat down on the bed taking my hand i wasnt sure i wanted him to but i was still too weak to stop him jeanclaude stood behind him watching me his face was blank and perfect a mask how do you feel richard asked i had to swallow before i could speak not sure dominic walked into view he had wisely stayed out of the argument besides he was already a vampires human servant what was he going to say that the mark was evil or that it was no big deal lies either way i am very glad to see you awake it thrust me out i said he nodded indeed what thrust her out richard asked dominic looked at me i shrugged when the power that animates the vampire returned and found anita still inside the body the power cast her out richard frowned why i shouldnt have been there did the soul return as you touched it jeanclaude asked ive felt the brush of a soul before that wasnt it jeanclaude looked at me i looked back he was the one who looked away first richard touched my hair where it had gotten wet from the rag i dont care if it was a soul or the bogeyman i thought id lost you i always seem to survive richard no matter who else dies he frowned at that i let him is damian all right i asked he seems to be jeanclaude said what were you two arguing about dominic could you leave us now jeanclaude asked dominic smiled gladly i am eager to speak with sabin tomorrow you and richard can raise him and you anita he touched my face lightlycan heal him i didnt like him touching me but there was almost a reverence in his face it made it hard to yell at him ill do my best i said in all things i think with that he bid us a good day and left when the door closed behind him i repeated my question what were you two arguing about richard glanced behind at jeanclaude then back to me you stopped breathing for a few seconds no heartbeat either i thought you were dying i looked at jeanclaude tell me richard wanted me to give you the first mark again i refused smart vampire i said he shrugged you have made yourself very clear ma petite i will not be accused of forcing myself upon you again not in any sense did someone do cpr you started breathing on your own richard said he squeezed my hand you scared me i drew my hand out of his so you offered me to him as his human servant i thought wed agreed to be a triad of power maybe i dont understand what that means i wanted to sit up but still wasnt sure i could do it so i had to be content with frowning up at him ill share power with you both but i wont let jeanclaude mark me if he ever forces himself on me again ill kill him jeanclaude nodded you will try ma petite it is a dance i do not wish to begin im going to let him mark me before i leave for the pack tonight richard said i stared up at him what are you talking about jeanclaude cant come tonight he isnt a member of the pack if were joined i can still call the power i struggled to sit up and if richard hadnt caught me id have fallen i lay cradled in his arms digging fingers into his arms trying to make him listen to me you dont want to be his servant for all eternity richard the joining of master and animal is not the same as between master and servant ma petite it is not quite as intimate i couldnt see the vampire over richards broad shoulders i tried to push myself up and richard had to help me explain i said i will not be able to taste food through richard as i could through you it is a minor side effect but in truth one i miss i enjoyed tasting solid food again what else richard is an alpha werewolf he is an equivalent power to mine in some ways he will have more control over my entering his dreams his thoughts he would be able to keep me out as it were and i couldnt i said he looked down at me even then before you had explored your powers of necromancy you were harder to control than you should have been now he shrugged now i am not sure who would be master and who would be servant i sat up on my own i was feeling just a tad better thats why you didnt mark me while you had the chance and richard to take the blame after what i did today youre afraid that id be the master and youd be my servant thats it isnt it he smiled softly perhaps he sat on the bed on the other side of richard i have not worked for over two hundred years to be master of my own lands to give up my freedom to anyone even you ma petite you would not be a cruel master but you would be an exacting one its not pure master and servant i know that from alejandro he couldnt control me but i couldnt control him either did you try jeanclaude asked that stopped me i had to think about it no you simply killed him jeanclaude said he had a point would i really be able to order you around i have never heard of another vampire choosing a necromancer of your power as human servant what about dominic and sabin i asked dominic is no match for you ma petite if i agreed to the first mark would you do it or not i asked richard tried to hug me to his chest but i moved away i had to put both arms down to prop myself up but i was sitting on my own jeanclaude sighed looking down at the floor if we truly joined no one could stand against us that much power is very tempting he looked up suddenly letting me see his eyes emotions rolled across his face excitement fear lust and finally just weariness we could be bound together for all eternity bound together in a threeway struggle for power it is not a pleasant thought jeanclaude told me that he would not be my master richard said we would be partners and you believed him i said richard nodded looking terribly earnest i sighed jesus richard i cant leave you alone for a minute it is not a lie ma petite yeah right if its a lie richard said ill kill him i stared at him you dont mean that yes i do something moved through his brown eyes something low and dark and inhuman once you decide to kill someone it becomes easier to kill others doesnt it i said richard didnt flinch or look away yes it does but thats not it i wont be anyones servant not jeanclaudes not yours not marcuss not rainas do you understand that once youre bound to him that hurting him can hurt you killing him can kill you i d rather be dead than trapped i watched the absolute certainty in his eyes he meant it youll kill marcus tonight i said richard looked at me and an expression passed over his face that id never seen before a fierceness that filled his eyes and sent his power shivering through the room if he doesnt back down ill kill him for the first time i believed him there was a knock on the door richard and jeanclaude spoke at the same time enter come in they stared at each other as the door opened edward walked in his cool blue eyes took in the three of us at a glance what happened to you long story i said it wasnt the assassin if thats what youre worried about i wasnt your wolves are guarding my backup they wouldnt let me bring him in without somebodys approval he looked at jeanclaude and richard they werent absolutely clear on whose permission i was supposed to get he didnt smile while he said it but i knew him well enough to see the shadow of humor on his face this is my home jeanclaude said it is my permission that is needed i slid to the edge of the bed and found i could sit up the movement put me between the two men richard hovered close to help me if i fell onto my face jeanclaude just sat there not touching me not offering to in many ways he understood me better than richard did but then hed known me longer i was sort of an acquired taste jeanclaude stood up i will go escort your guest in i better go with you edward said harley doesnt know you but hell know what you are whats that supposed to mean i asked if a strange vampire walked up to you in this place and said follow me would you do it i thought about that probably not edward smiled neither would harley edward and jeanclaude left to fetch edwards friend i tried standing while they were gone just to see if i could do it i always like to meet new people especially new hired muscle on my feet richard tried to help me and i pulled away i had to grab for the wall to keep from falling i was trying to help he said dont try so hard what is the matter with you i dont like being helpless richard you arent superwoman i glared at him i fainted for gods sake i never faint you didnt faint he said whatever it was threw you out of damian i was still tied to you when it happened anita i felt it brush me he shook his head hugging his arms to his chest you didnt faint i leaned my back against the wall it scared me too did it he came to stand in front of me you dont seem scared are you scared about joining with jeanclaude that bothers you more than me killing for the first time tonight doesnt it yeah the door opened before we could continue the conversation it was just as well wed found something else we disagreed on letting someone tie themselves to my mind my soul frightened me a lot more than killing someone the man that followed edward didnt look that impressive he was slender only a couple of inches taller than edward he had curly brownish red hair receding in a soft circle to nearly the middle of his head he slouched even when he walked and i couldnt tell if it was habit or some sort of spinal problem brown tshirt over black corduroy pants and sneakers everything looked like it had come from the salvation army he wore a patched leather aviators jacket that might have been original world war ii issue under the jacket i got a glimpse of guns he was wearing a double shoulder holster so that he had a millimeter under both arms id seen holsters like it but never knew anyone who actually wore one i thought they were mostly for show very few people are equally good with both hands there was a crisscross of straps beneath the tshirt that i didnt understand but i knew it was for carrying something lethal he had a duffel bag in one hand crammed full and big enough to carry a body in he wasnt even straining stronger than he looked i met his eyes last they were pale and greyish green with lashes so gingery red they were almost invisible the look in the eyes was the emptiest id ever seen in another human being it was as if when he looked at me he wasnt seeing me at all it wasnt like he was blind he saw something but i wasnt sure what he saw not me not a woman something else that one look was enough i knew that this man walked in a circle of his own creation saw a version of reality that would send the rest of us screaming but he functioned and he didnt scream this is harley edward said he introduced us all as if it was an ordinary meeting i stared at harleys pale eyes and realized that he scared me it had been a long time since another human being frightened me just by entering a room richard offered his hand and harley simply looked at it i wanted to explain to richard why he shouldnt have made the gesture but i wasnt sure i could i did not offer to shake hands i found out the name of the money man behind the attempts on your life edward said he said it without preamble three of us stared at him harley disquietly kept staring at me what did you say i asked i know who we have to kill who i asked marcus fletcher the head of our local werewolf pack he smiled pleased with himself on the effect the news was having on richard youre sure richard said absolutely sure edward nodded studying richards face does he hate you enough to kill anita i didnt think so richard turned to me the look on his face stricken horrified my god i never dreamt hed do something like this why how well would you have fought tonight with ma petitedead jeanclaude asked richard stared at him so obviously overwhelmed by the dastardliness of what marcus had done that i wanted to pat his head and tell him it was all right i nearly get killed twice and i wanted to comfort him love is just plain stupid sometimes its all so convenient edward said with a happy lilt to his voice what do you mean richard asked he means you are supposed to kill him tonight richard so we dont have to i said i just cant believe that marcus would do something so evil i suggested he nodded it would seem more rainas sort of idea than marcuss jeanclaude said its twisted enough for her i said marcus could have said no richard said he ran his hands through his hair combing it back from his face his handsome face was set in very stubborn lines this has got to stop hell do anything she asks anything and shes crazy my eyes flicked to harley i couldnt help it he caught my look and smiled i didnt know exactly what he was thinking but it wasnt pleasant and it wasnt pretty having harley as backup made me wonder if i was on the right side edward can i talk to you a minute in private i didnt want to be this obvious but harley was bothering me that much i walked away from the others and edward trailed behind it was kind of nice to walk across the room lower my voice and know the person i was whispering about wouldnt hear me both jeanclaude and richard would edward looked at me and there was that same touch of amusement to him as if he knew what i was going to say and thought it was a hoot why does he keep looking at me you mean harley you know damn well who i mean i said hes only looking anita no harm but why me youre a girl maybe stop it edward whatever hes thinking it isnt sex and if it is i dont want to know the details edward stared at me ask him what ask him why hes staring at you just like that he nodded harley will probably get a kick out of it do i want to know i asked i dont know do you i took a deep breath and let it out slowly youre stringing me along here edward whats the deal if something happens to me during the fighting harley needs at least one other person that hell mind mind hes absolutely reliable anita hell stay at my back never flinch and kill anyone i tell him to but hes not good without specific orders and he doesnt take orders from just everybody so you designated me edward shook his head i told him to pick someone in the room why me ask him fine i walked back towards the others and edward followed me harley watched us like he was seeing other things it was too damned unnerving why are you staring at me i asked his voice was quiet as if he never yelled youre the scariest motherfucker in the room now i know you cant see i see whats there he said what the hell is wrong with you nothing i tried to think of a better question and finally asked what do you see when you look at everybody in the room the same thing you see monsters why do i think the monsters i see in the room arent the same ones you see he smiled a bare upturning of lips they may look different but theyre still monsters theyre all monsters he was a cardcarrying rubberroomrenting psychotic by the time most people got to the point where they werent seeing reality they were so far gone that there was no going back sometimes drug therapy helped but without it the world was a frightening overwhelming place harley didnt look frightened or overwhelmed he looked calm when you look at edward he always looks the same to you i mean you recognize him harley nodded youd recognize me i said if i make an effort to memorize you yes thats why you were staring yes he said what happens if edward and i both go down harley smiled but his eyes shifted to one side as if something low to the ground and rather small had run across the room the movement was so natural that i looked nothing harley i said he looked back at me but his eyes were just a little higher up than my face should have been yes he said his voice so quiet what happens if edward and i are both killed harley stared at me his eyes shifted to my face for just a second as if the fog had cleared that would be bad there would be no backing down for marcus tonight he had to die one way or another richard wasnt arguing anymore but there was still the chance that raina would lead a revolt of the other lukoi their loyalty was divided enough for a war even with marcus dead jeanclaude came up with a solution wed put on a better show a better show than raina and marcus he had to be kidding richard agreed to let jeanclaude costume him up for the night as his lupa that meant i had to get dressed up too jeanclaude took richard off to dress him he sent cassandra with a white cardboard clothes box to me she was supposed to help me change she said i opened the box and all that was in it was a pile of black leather straps i kid you not i drew it out of the box and it didnt improve i dont know how to get into this even if i was willing to ill get stephen cassandra said i dont want to undress in front of stephen hes a stripper she said he dressed me last night at danse macabre remember she patted my hand hell be a perfect gentleman i sat down on the bed and scowled at the door i was not wearing this crap an hour later stephen and cassandra were turning me in front of the bathroom mirrors so i could see myself it had been embarrassing at first having a man help squeeze me into the thing but cassandra was right stephen was not only a perfect gentleman he simply didnt seem to be moved at all by the fact that i was mostly naked it was like having two girlfriends help me one just happened not to be a girl the top was mostly a leather bra with lining for comfort it was one of those that lifted and showed your cleavage to absolute best advantage but it was tight and held in place nothing was falling out my cross was visible though i taped it id peel the tape when i left the circus werewolves on the menu tonight not vamps the bottom was sort of leather shorts except that where the shorts stopped straps took over i wouldnt be caught dead or alive in something like this not even to make a good show of things for richard except that there were extras two leather sheaths covered my upper arms complete with a knife apiece the knives were high quality high silver content if the hilts were a little elaborate for my taste the balance was good and thats what counted two more sheaths covered my lower arms with two more knives smaller balanced more for throwing though they both had hilts and werent true throwing knives the bulge under harleys tshirt had been throwing knives the real mccoy slender and innocent looking until you saw them used there was a leather belt around the top of the shorts that my brownings shoulder holster fit on nicely edward had bought me a new browning it wasnt my very own gun but it was still nice to have harley had fished a clipon holster for the firestar out of his duffel the small clipon rode to one side of my waist for a cross draw the straps down my legs had small silver loops sheaths two more knives one on each thigh no knife sheaths below the knees because boots came with the outfit jeanclaude had finally gotten me out of my nikes the boots were soft black suede with heels only a touch higher than i would have liked a tiny stoppered vial fit in small loops just below the top of each boot i held one up to the light and knew what it was holy water a nice gift from my vampire boyfriend heh i stared at myself in the mirror how long has jeanclaude been planning this outfit a little while stephen said he was kneeling by me tugging the straps into place we all had a running bet that hed never get you to wear it whos we his flunkies stephen stood up stepped back and nodded you look amazing i look like a biker slut from hell meets soldier of fortune pinup that too stephen said i turned to cassandra be honest you look dangerous anita like somebodys weapon i stared in the mirror shaking my head somebodys sex toy you mean a dominatrix maybe but nobodys toy cassandra said why didnt that make me feel better cassandra had insisted on helping me with my makeup she was a great deal more skilled at it than i years of practice shed said my hair was tight and curling falling just below my shoulders now it needed a cut but for tonight the hair was perfect the face was still pretty makeup is a wonderful thing but the outfit stripped away the pretense i looked like what i was something that would kill you before it would kiss you we walked out of the bathroom and found edward and harley waiting for us they had brought two straightbacked chairs to sit on the white carpet facing the bathroom door i froze as edward stared at me he didnt say a word just sat there with a sort of halfsmile on his face well say something dammit i would say it isnt you but in a way it is i took a deep breath yeah harley stared at me with vacant eyes he was smiling but not at the outfit smiling at some internal music or vision that only he could perceive there was a long leather coat on the bed one of the vampires dropped it off edward said thought you might want something to cover up with until the big unveiling youre enjoying this arent you id feel better if i could guard your back youre going to do that with a rifle from the closest hill remember night vision and scope fine but i cant kill them all from a distance you couldnt kill them all if you were johnny on the spot either i said no but id feel better worried about me he shrugged im your bodyguard if you die under my protection the other bodyguards will make fun of me it took me a second to realize he was making a joke harley looked back at him with an almost surprised look i dont think either of us heard humor from edward much i walked towards edward the leather made that little creaking sound it makes i stopped in front of him legs a little apart staring down at him he widened his eyes a little yes i cant imagine anyone making fun of you edward he touched one of the leather straps if i went around dressed like this they might i had to smile you probably would be dressed like this if you were going to be down in the clearing with us tonight he turned pale blue eyes to me ive worn worse than this anita im a fine actor when i have to be the humor drained away from his face leaving something feral and determined behind edward would still do things that i wouldnt still had fewer rules than i did but in some ways edward was a mirror for me a warning of what i was becoming or maybe a preview richard would have said it was a warning i hadnt made up my mind yet there was a knock on the door richard came in without waiting for an invitation he was scowling but the grumpy look faded when he got a good look at me his eyes widened i was going to come in and complain about my outfit he shook his head if i complain will you just shoot me a smile spread across his face no laughing i said the smile got wider his voice was a little choked but he managed wonderful you look wonderful there are only two things you can do when youre dressed like barbie does bondage you can be embarrassed or you can be aggressive guess what my choice was i stalked towards him putting a little extra sway into my walk the boots made it easier somehow giving just the right roll i put into my eyes my face what the outfit promised sex violence heat the humor faded from richards face replaced by an answering heat and a hesitation like he wasnt exactly sure we should be doing this in public he was wearing black leather pants with soft suede boots that were almost a match to my own his hair had been slicked back tied off with a black ribbon his shirt was silk and a vibrant blue somewhere between turquoise and royal it looked splendid against his tanned skin i stopped just in front of him legs apart i stared up at him defying him to think it was funny i put a finger to his lips trailing my fingertip down his cheek his neck caressing the edge of his collarbone tracing the skin until it vanished down the buttoned front of his shirt i stalked to the bed fetching the leather coat i threw it over one shoulder so that it trailed down like a limp body not hiding much of the outfit i opened the door and stood for just a moment framed in it coming i said i walked away without waiting for an answer the look on his face was enough he looked like id hit him between the eyes with a sledgehammer great now all i had to do was try the outfit out on jeanclaude and we could go the may woods were a warm close darkness richard and i stood outside the barn where raina shot dirty pictures the pack meeting place was among the trees around the farmhouse there were so many cars that they were parked on every bit of spare ground some so close to the woods that they touched the trees there may have been a full moon up there somewhere but the clouds were so thick the darkness so complete that it was like standing inside a cave except this cave had movement a small oozing wind trailed through the thick nightdarkened leaves it was like some invisible giant trailed fingertips through the trees bending them rattling the leaves giving movement to the night that made my shoulders tight it was like the night itself was alive in a way that id never seen before richards hand was warm and slightly moist hed dampened that creeping energy so that it wasnt uncomfortable to touch him i appreciated the effort his leather cloak whispered as he moved closer it was tied across his chest covering only one shoulder the cloak combined with the full sleeves of the brilliant blue shirt made the whole outfit seem antique richard pulled on my hand bringing me against his body into the circle of his arms the brush of the leather cloak the clouds slid apart and suddenly we were bathed in a thick silver glow richard was staring outward he seemed to be listening to something that i couldnt hear his hands convulsed around my hands an almost painful squeeze he stared down at me as if just remembering i was there he smiled can you feel it what the night i started to answer no then stopped i looked around at the hurrying woods the feeling of movement the woods seem more alive tonight his smile widened a brief flash of teeth almost a snarl yes i tried to pull away but his hands tightened youre doing it i said my heart was suddenly thudding in my throat id thought to be afraid of a lot of things tonight but not of richard were supposed to share power thats what im doing but it has to be my power anita the pack wont be impressed with zombies i swallowed past my beating heart and forced myself to stand very still made myself return the grip of his hands i hadnt thought what it would mean i wasnt going to be in charge not my power but his i was going to be fuel for his fire not the other way around its jeanclaudes mark i said thats whats doing it we hoped it would work this way richard said and i knew that the we he was referring to didnt include me how does it work like this that trembling energy broke over his skin like a rush of warmth it plunged through his hands into my hand it rode like a wave over my body and everywhere it touched the hair and skin of my body raised and shivered are you all right sure but my voice was a breathless whisper he took me at my word some barrier went down and richards energy crashed into me like a fist i remembered falling and the feel of richards arms around my waist catching me then it was like i was elsewhere i was everywhere i was over there in the trees staring at us with eyes that tried to turn and see me but i wasnt there it was like the wind that opened inside me when i walked a cemetery except it wasnt power that was spreading outward it was me i flashed through a dozen eyes brushed bodies some furred some still skinned i hurried outward outward and touched raina i knew it was her her power lashed out like a shield casting me away from her but not before i felt her fear richard called me back though call implies a voice i slipped back inside myself in a rush of curling golden energy i could see the color behind my eyes though there was actually nothing to see i opened my eyes though i wasnt a hundred percent sure that theyd been closed that golden energy was still there swirling inside along my skin i curled my hands over richards shoulders and felt an answering energy in him i didnt have to ask what i had just experienced i knew it was what it meant at least for someone as powerful as richard to be alpha he could fling his essence outward and touch his pack it was how he kept the werewolf from changing form two days ago it was how he could share blood marcus couldnt do it but raina could jeanclaudes power even my own power never felt so alive it was like i was drawing energy from the trees the wind like being plugged into a vast battery as if there was enough magic to go on forever i had never felt anything like it can you run richard asked the question meant more than just the words and i knew that oh yeah he smiled and it was joyous he took my hand and flung us into the trees even if hed been human i couldnt have kept up with richard in a dead run tonight he didnt run so much as flowed into the woods it was like he had sonar telling him where every branch every tree root every fallen trunk would be it was like the trees moved away from him like water or maybe moved into him like something else that i had no words for he pulled me with him not just with his hand but with his energy it was like hed entered me and tied us together somehow it should have been intrusive and frightening but it wasnt we spilled into the great clearing and richards power filled it flowed over the lycanthropes like a fire springing from one dry branch to another it filled them and made them turn to him only marcus raina jamil sebastian and cassandra were untouched only they kept him out by force of will he swept everyone else before him and i knew that part of what let him do that was me distant as a dream or a halfremembered nightmare was jeanclaude down that twisting power that was almost buried under richards shining light i felt every movement it was like the world was suddenly crystalline almost like the effect from an adrenaline rush or shock where everything seems carved and hardedged and terribly frightfully clear it was like being dipped in reality as if anything else would forever be a dream it was almost painful marcus sat in a chair that had been carved from rock so long ago the edges were rounded with weather and hands and bodies i knew that this clearing had been the meeting place for the lukoi for a very long time marcus wore a brown satinlapeled tux the shirt was of gold cloth not gold lamй but the real deal as if theyd melted down jewelry and beaten him out a shirt raina curled on the edge of the stone chair her long auburn hair was done in an elaborate swirl of soft curls on top of her head down along her face a gold chain cut across her forehead with a diamond the size of my thumb in it more diamonds burned like white fire at her throat she was absolutely naked except for a sprinkling of gold body glitter done thick enough on her nipples to make them seem metallic a diamond anklet glittered on her right ankle three gold chains rode low on her hips and that was it and id complained about my outfit welcome richard anita marcus said welcome to our happy family his voice was deep and thick it flowed with its own edge of power but it wasnt enough it would never be enough richard could have worn his jeans and tshirt and still he would have won them over there are things beyond clothing that make a king marcus raina richard released my hand slowly and as he pulled away the tie remained it was a shadow of the way id bound richard and jeanclaudes auras to me but more he took a few steps away to stand a little in front of me i could feel him like a large shimmering thing his energy was amazing the closest thing id ever felt was the power of a daoine sidhe a fairie of the highest court you naughty boy raina said youve made her one of us no richard said she is what she always has been herself then how can you ride her power how can she ride yours raina pushed away from the chair stalking along the ground in front of it pacing like a caged animal what have you done richard marcus asked she is my mate raina test it marcus said raina smiled most unpleasant and stalked over the open ground she swayed transforming walking into a seductive dance i felt her power tonight her sex rode the air like the threat of lightning prickling along the skin drying out the mouth i felt every male watch her even richard i didnt resent it hell i watched her she was magnificent in her sheer naked lust it was like sex for raina was power literally i slipped off the long black coat and let it fall to the ground there was a collective gasp from the human throats i traced my hands over the bare skin of my waist trailing down my leatherclad thighs i laughed a loud joyous bark of noise it was raina i was riding her power dancing along the edge of her energy i stalked towards her not waiting but meeting her in the middle of the circle we moved around each other and i could match her dance i pulled her aura of sex and violence into me pulled it like a hand reaching inward and stealing bits of her fear widened her eyes brought her breath faster she knew how to protect herself against another werewolf but my brand of power was just different enough that she didnt know what to do with me id never done anything like this before didnt understand exactly what i was doing until raina backed off she didnt run back to marcus but the shine was gone she slunk back with her tail between her legs and i could taste her inside my mind like id licked her skin i turned back to richard and stalked towards him in the highheeled boots i felt every man watching i knew it i wrapped it around me and threw it all back into richard he stood almost frozen his dark eyes filled with a heat that was part sex part energy part something else and for the first time i understood that something else i heard that music felt it dance inside my body i grabbed the leather cloak and pulled him down to me we kissed and it burned as if more than flesh was mingling i released him abruptly and my eyes didnt go to his face but fell lower without touching him i knew he was hard and ready i could still feel the pack distant but touchable jasons great wolf head brushed my thigh i dug my fingers into that thick fur and knew that if richard and i made love the pack would know it here tonight theyd be along for the ride it wouldnt just be sex it would be magic and it didnt seem shameful or pagan or wrong you cant let them do this raina said marcus pushed himself to his feet he seemed tired no i dont suppose i can he looked at raina naked beautiful fearful but it is not your blood that will be spilled tonight is it my love the irony was thick enough to walk on and for the first time i realized that marcus knew what raina was maybe had always known raina went to her knees in front of him hands clutching at his legs she rubbed her cheek along his thigh one hand smoothing perilously close to his groin even now it was what she knew best sex and pain he touched her hair gently he stared down at her and the naked tenderness on his face made me want to look away it was a terribly intimate look more intimate than sex more powerful the fool loved her if he hadnt been paying to kill me id have felt sorry for him marcus stepped away from raina he began walking across the clearing his power opened like a door flowing like electric water across the wolves across me he undid his tie opened the first few buttons of his shirt no more preliminaries richard let us do this i know you tried to have anita killed richard said marcus stopped in midmotion his small sure fingers hesitated surprise chased across his face then changed into a smile you have surprised me twice tonight richard lets see if you can make it three i will kill you tonight marcus you know that marcus shrugged out of his jacket you can try richard nodded id planned on giving you the chance to just leave i tried to have your mate killed you cant leave me alive now he undid the cuffs of his shirt no i cant richard undid the cloaks tie letting it fall to the floor he pulled his shirt out of his pants and slid it over his head in one quick movement the moonlight made shadows on the muscles of his arms and chest i suddenly didnt want him to do it i could shoot marcus and it would all be done richard would never forgive me but hed be alive they wouldnt kill each other with power theyd use claws and teeth for the killing all richards trembling eager power wouldnt keep him from getting his throat ripped out richard turned to me wearing only the leather pants and the boots marcus had asked that they not strip down said something about saving an old mans dignity bullshit there was something in the air that i didnt like as if marcus had known what was coming and he was ready as acknowledged ulfric marcus gets to choose the form we fight in richard said what form did he choose richard raised his hand in front of my face touch my hand he made it sound so serious for such a small request i touched the back of his hand lightly grip my palm anita i wrapped my fingers around the lower part of his hand before i could look to his face or ask a question i felt it energy welled up his hand like oil up the wick of a lamp his skin flowed under my hand i felt the bones lengthening i felt his body give as if the boundaries that confined him to skin and bone and flesh had dissolved it felt almost like he would scatter himself outward like id done earlier but it wasnt his essence that was reaching outward it was his body he held up his other hand and i took it i locked my fingers in his and felt his bones grow across my skin watched claws form as his flesh flowed like clay distant as a scream i knew i should have been scared or sickened the power flowed down his shifting hands to my hands flowing between us like cool fire he stopped when his hands were human claws with talons that could have ripped me apart the power didnt stop abruptly it wasnt like turning off a switch it was like turning off a faucet slowing the flow down to a trickle a drop then nothing i was on my knees and hadnt remembered getting there richard knelt in front of me hands still clasped in mine it took me two tries to be able to talk how can you stop like that he drew his newly formed hands carefully out of my hands i shivered as the tips of his claws trailed over my skin controlling the change is what separates the sheep from the wolves he said it took me a second to realize hed made a joke he leaned into me and whispered if i lose control in the fight or if im losing ill shift completely i want you to come touch me if i ask you why his breath was warm against my cheek he wrapped his arms around me held me in the circle of his body claws playing along the leather straps of the outfit i want you to feel the rush of power i want you to know what it can be like between us his arms tightened if im losing you can ride the power and use it to get my wolves out of here the others will kill anyone they think is disloyal i pushed away enough to see his face how can i use the power to do that youll know he kissed my forehead ever so gently save them anita promise me i promise he stood my hands slipping over his body as he got to his feet i caught one of his hands my hand slid down the long curved claw it was as hard and solid and unreal as it looked id felt his body shift and yet staring up at richards handsome face and those monstrous hands it was jarring still i held on i didnt want to let him go careful of the claws anita im not in human form anymore he meant that a scratch might make me furry might not hard to tell but it was enough to make me let go no matter how good richard felt i wasnt ready to throw humanity completely behind me richard stared down at me and there was a world in his eyes of things unsaid things undone i opened my mouth closed it do you have this much control over every body part he smiled yes i was so scared i couldnt speak id made my last joke the only thing left was truth i raised up putting my hands on his legs for support and kissed the back of his hand the skin was still as soft still smelled and tasted like richard the bones underneath felt like someone else dont get killed he smiled there was a sadness in his eyes that was bottomless even if he won this fight it would cost him dearly murder thats how he would see it no matter how justified moral high ground is dandy but itll get you killed raina kissed marcus goodbye pressing her body so tightly against him it was like she was trying to walk through him part him like a curtain and slip inside she pushed him away with a rich throaty laugh it was the kind of laughter that made you turn your head in bars a joyous slightly wicked sound raina stared across the clearing at me the laughter still sparkling in her eyes on her face one look was enough she was going to kill me if she could since i was pretty much thinking the same thing about her i gave her a little nod and a salute wed see who was dead come morning it might be me but somewhere on the lists of the dead would be raina that i could almost promise marcus raised his clawed hands over his head he turned in a slow circle two alphas fight for you here tonight one of us will leave this circle alive one of us will feed you tonight drink of our blood eat of our flesh we are pack we are lukoi we are one jason threw his head back and howled so close to me that i jumped furred throats echoed him human throats joining the chorus i stood alone among the pack and did not join in when the last echo faded off in the rolling wooded hills marcus said death between us then richard i offered you life marcus you chose death marcus smiled i suppose i did marcus jumped straight at him no feinting no practice just a blur of speed richard rolled to the ground up and away coming to his feet three thin lines bled across his belly marcus didnt give him a chance to recover he covered the distance between them like a bad dream i couldnt even keep track of it with my eyes id seen lycanthropes move before and id thought they were fast but marcus was breathtaking he slashed richard forcing him back towards the edge of the clearing where raina stood richard wasnt being hurt but the flurry of attacks forced him backwards kept him from attacking i needed to ask a question i looked down at jason he turned pale wolf eyes to me if anyone else helps marcus its cheating right it felt vaguely stupid talking to something that looked like an animal but the look in those eyes wasnt animal i wasnt sure it was human but it wasnt animal the wolf nodded its head awkwardly richards back was almost within rainas reach jamil the black werewolf from two nights ago had joined her sebastian was already at her side shit if they cheat can i shoot them yes cassandra joined us walking up through the pack like a warm prickling wind i got the first real brush of her power and knew she could have been lupa if she wanted to be i pulled the browning out and it felt odd in my hands as if i didnt need it i was channeling more of the pack than i knew if i didnt want my gun a dangerous amount more i wrapped my fingers around the butt of the browning digging my hand around it remembering the feel of it the sensory memory brought it back to me pushed some of the glow of power away i didnt see a weapon but richards back was to raina and sebastian i raised the browning not aiming not yet i yelled behind you i saw richards back spasm he collapsed to his knees everything slowed down carved in crystal sebastians hand moved with a flash of silver blade i was already aiming at him marcuss claw drew back for a downward swipe at richards unprotected throat i pulled the trigger and turned the gun towards marcus but it would be too slow too late the top of sebastians head exploded i had a fraction of a second to wonder what ammunition edward had put in the gun the body started to fall backwards marcuss claw came sweeping down and richard drove his hand under the arm into marcuss upper stomach marcus stopped froze for a second as the claws dug into his stomach up under his ribs richards hand went into marcuss body past the wrist i kept the browning pointed at raina in case she got any ideas about picking up the knife marcus drove his claws into richards back richard tucked his face and neck against the other mans body protecting himself from the claws marcus shuddered richard broke away from him bringing his bloody hand out of marcuss chest he tore the stillbeating heart out of his chest and flung it to the wolves they fell on the morsel with small yips and growling richard collapsed to his knees beside marcuss body blood poured down his lower back where the knife had gone in i walked to him the gun still pointed at raina i knelt still keeping a bead on her richard are you all right it was a stupid thing to ask but what else was i supposed to say put up the gun anita its over she tried to kill you i said its over he turned his face to me and his eyes were already gone his voice fell towards a growl put it away i stared up at raina and knew if i didnt kill her now id have to kill her later shell see us dead richard richards hand was suddenly there faster than i could see he hit my hand and the gun went spinning my hand was numb i tried to back away but he grabbed me wrapping his clawed hands around my upper arms no more killing tonight he threw back his head and howled his mouth was full of fangs i screamed ride the power anita ride it or run his hands convulsed around my arms i backpedaled dug my heels in and tried to get loose he collapsed on top of me too hurt for the struggle too far gone to fight the change his power roared over me into me i couldnt see anything but the glow of power behind my eyes if i could have breathed id have screamed again but there was nothing but the force of his power and it spread outward from him like a rock in water the waves touched the pack and where it touched fur flowed richard shifted and took everyone with him everyone i felt raina struggle next to us i felt her fight it heard her shriek but in the end she fell to the ground and changed i held onto richards arms and fur flowed under my hands like water muscle formed and shifted bones broke and reknit my lower body was trapped underneath him clear liquid gushed from his body pouring over me in a near scalding wave i screamed and struggled to get out from underneath him and the power rode me down filled me up until i thought my skin wouldnt hold couldnt hold it finally he rose off me not a wolf but manwolf covered in fur the color of cinnamon and gold his genitalia hung large and full underneath him he stared at me with amber eyes and offered me a clawed hand as he rose on two slightly bent legs i ignored the hand and scooted backwards i got to my feet a little unsteady and stared the wolf form was actually taller than his human shape about seven feet muscled and monstrous there was nothing left of richard but i knew how good it had felt to let loose the beast i had felt it rise out of him like a second mind soul rising upward outward filling him spilling out of his skin my body was still tingling with the brush of his beast i could feel the thick softness of his fur under my fingertips like a sensory memory that would haunt me marcuss very humanlooking body lay on the ground at richards feet the scent of fresh blood ran through him ran through them all i felt it thrill through my body i stared down at the dead man and wanted to go down to my knees and feed i had a strong visual image of tearing flesh warm viscera it was a memory it jerked me back a step i stared at the manwolf i stared at richard and shook my head i cant feed i wont he spoke but it was twisted and guttural youre not invited we will feast then hunt you can watch you can join the hunt or you can go i backed away slowly im going the pack was creeping closer gigantic wolves mostly but here and there were manwolves watching me with alien eyes i couldnt see the browning that richard had knocked from my hand i drew the firestar and started to back away no one will hurt you anita you are lupa mate i stared into the cool eyes of the nearest wolf right now im just food richard you refused the power he said he was right in the end id panicked and hadnt gotten the full dose whatever i eased through the wolves but they didnt move i walked out brushing through fur like wading through a fur coat factory every brush of breathing living animal scared me panic climbed at my throat and i still had enough glow left to know that my fear excited them the more scared i got the more i smelled like food i kept the gun ready but i knew if they went for me i was dead there were too many of them they watched me walk they stubbornly refused to move forcing me to brush their furred bodies i realized they were using me for a sort of appetizer my fear to spice their food the brush of my human body to flavor their chase when i passed the last furred body the sound of tearing flesh brought my head around i couldnt stop myself in time richards muzzle was raised skyward slick with blood throwing down a piece of meat that i tried not to recognize i ran the woods that id glided through with richards help suddenly became an obstacle course i ran and tripped and fell and ran some more i finally got back to the parking lot i had driven because nobody but me was going home tonight theyd stay here and have a moonlight jamboree edward and harley had watched all of it from a nearby hill with night scopes i wondered what they thought of the show edward made me promise to go back to the circus for one more night marcus was dead so there was no more money but if someone else had taken the contract they might not know that yet it would be a shame to get killed after all the effort wed put in to save me i walked all the way down the damn stairs to the ironbound door before i realized i didnt have a key and nobody was expecting me the clear liquid that had gushed out of richards body had dried to a sticky viscous substance somewhere between blood and glue i needed a bath i needed clean clothes i needed to stop seeing richards mouth while he ate pieces of marcus the harder i tried not to flash on it the clearer the image got i banged on the door until my hands stung then i kicked it no one came shit i screamed at no one and everyone shit the feel of his body on top of mine his bones and muscle sliding on top of me like a bag of snakes the warm rush of power and that moment when i had wanted to drop to my knees and feed what if i had swallowed the power whole what if i hadnt backed off would i have fed on marcus would i have done that and enjoyed it i screamed wordlessly smacking my hands into the door kicking it beating on it i collapsed to my knees stinging palms pressed against the wood i leaned my head against the door and cried ma petite what has happened jeanclaude stood behind me on the stairs richard is not dead i would feel it i turned and pressed my back against the door i wiped at the tears on my face hes not dead not even close then what is wrong he came down the steps like he was dancing too graceful for words even after an evening spent with shapeshifters his shirt was a deep rich blue not quite dark enough to be navy the sleeves were full with wide cuffs the collar high but soft almost as if it were a scarf id never seen him in blue of any shade it made his midnight blue eyes seem bluer darker his jeans were black and tight enough to be skin the boots were kneehigh with a trailing edge of black leather that flopped as he moved he knelt beside me not touching me almost like he was afraid to ma petite your cross i stared down at it it wasnt glowing not yet i wrapped my hand around the cross and jerked snapping the chain i flung it away it fell against the wall glinting silver in the faint light happy jeanclaude looked at me richard lives marcus is dead correct i nodded then why the tears ma petite i do not think i have ever seen you cry i am not crying he touched my cheek with one fingertip and came away with a single tear trembling on the end of his finger he raised it to his lips the tip of his tongue licked it off his skin you taste like your heart has broken ma petite my throat choked tight i couldnt breathe past the tears the harder i tried not to cry the faster the tears flowed i hugged myself and my hands touched the sticky gunk that covered me i held my hands away from my body like id touched something unclean i stared at jeanclaude with my hands held out in front of me mon dieu what has happened he tried to hug me but i pushed him away youll get it all over you he stared at the thick clear gunk on his hand how did you get this close to a shapeshifting werewolf an idea flowed across his face its richard you saw him change i nodded he changed on top of me it was oh god oh god oh god jeanclaude pulled me into his arms i pushed at him youll ruin your clothes ma petite ma petite its all right it is all right no its not i sagged against him i let him wrap me in his arms i clutched at him hands digging into the silk of his shirt i buried my face against his chest and whispered he ate marcus he ate him hes a werewolf ma petite thats what they do it was such an odd thing to say and so terribly true that i laughedan abrupt almost angry sound the laughter died in choking and the choking became sobs i held onto jeanclaude like he was the last sane thing in the world i buried myself against him and wept it was like something deep inside me had broken and i was crying out bits of myself onto his body his voice came to me dimly as if he had been speaking for a long time but i hadnt heard he was speaking french softly whispering it into my hair stroking my back rocking me gently i lay in his arms quiet i had no more tears left i felt empty and light numb jeanclaude smoothed my hair back from my forehead he brushed his lips across my skin like richard had done earlier tonight even that thought couldnt make me cry again it was too soon can you stand ma petite i think so my voice sounded distant strange i stood still in the circle of his arms leaning against him i pushed away from him gently i stood on my own a little shaky but better than nothing his dark blue shirt was plastered to his chest covered with werewolf goop and tears now we both need a bath i said that can be arranged please jeanclaude no sexual innuendo until after im clean of course ma petite it was crude of me tonight my apologies i stared at him he was being far too nice jeanclaude was a lot of things but nice wasnt one of them if youre up to something i dont want to know about it i cant handle any deep dark plots tonight okay he smiled and gave a low sweeping bow never taking his eyes off me the way you bow on the judo mat when youre afraid the person may pound you if you look away i shook my head he was up to something nice to know that not everyone had suddenly become something else one thing i could always depend on was jeanclaude pain in the ass that he was he always seemed to be there dependable in his own twisted way jeanclaude dependable i must have been more tired than i thought jeanclaude opened the bedroom door and stepped inside ushering me through with a sweep of graceful hands the bed stopped me thered been a change of bedding red sheets covered the bed crimson drapes formed a half canopy over the nearly black wood there were still a dozen pillows on the bed and they were all screaming brilliant red even after the night id had it was eyecatching i like the new decor i guess the linens needed to be changed you are always complaining that i should use more color i stared at the bed ill stop complaining i will run your bath he went into the bathroom without a single joke or risquй comment it was almost unnerving whoever had changed the sheets had also removed the chairs that edward and harley had used i didnt want to sit on the clean sheets still covered in whatever the hell i was covered in i sat down on the white carpet and tried not to think not thinking is a lot harder than it sounds my thoughts kept chasing each other like a werewolf chasing its tail the image tore a laugh from my throat and on the end of it a sound like a sob or a moan i put the back of my hand against my mouth i didnt like that sound coming out of me it sounded hopeless beaten i was not beaten dammit but i was hurt if what i felt had been an actual wound id have been bleeding to death the bathroom door opened at long last a puff of warm moist air flowed around jeanclaude he had taken off his shirt and the crossshaped burn scar marred the perfection of his chest he held his boots in one hand a towel as scarlet as the sheets in the other i washed up in the sink while the tub filled he walked barefoot across the white carpeting im afraid i used the last clean towel i will fetch you more i took my hand away from my mouth and nodded i finally managed to say fine i stood before he could offer to help me up i didnt need any help jeanclaude moved to one side his black hair lay in nearly tight curls across his pale shoulders curled from the humidity of the bathroom i ignored him as much as it was humanly possible and walked inside the room was warm and misty the black marble tub full of bubbles he offered me a black lacquer tray from the vanity top shampoos soap bath crystals and what looked like oils were grouped on the tray get out so i can undress it took two people to dress you tonight ma petite wont you need help getting undressed his voice was utterly bland his face so still his eyes so innocent it made me smile i sighed if you get the two straps in back i think i can manage the rest but no monkey business i held my hands over the bra because one strap would loosen it the other strap as far as i could tell was the pivot point for the rest of the outfit his fingers moved to the top strap i watched him in the fogged mirror the strap came unbuckled and the leather gave with a small sigh he moved to the second strap without so much as an extra caress he undid it and took a step back no monkey business ma petite he backed out of the room and i watched him go like a phantom in the mistcovered mirrors when the door was shut i started on the rest of the straps it was like peeling myself to get the goosoaked leather off i put the tray of bath accessories on the tub edge and slipped into the water the water was hot just this side of too hot i sank into it up to my chin but i couldnt relax the gunk clung to my body in patches i had to get it off me i sat up in the tub and started scrubbing the soap smelled like gardenia the shampoos smelled like herbs trust jeanclaude not to buy a name brand from the grocery store i washed my hair twice sinking under the water and coming up for air i was scrubbed and virtuous or at least clean the mirrors had cleared and i had only myself to stare at id washed off all the careful makeup i smoothed my thick black hair back from my face my eyes were enormous and nearly black my skin so pale it was almost white i looked shocked ethereal unreal there was a soft knock on the door ma petite may i come in i glanced down at myself the bubbles were still holding i drew a pile of them a little closer to my chest and said come in it took a lot of effort not to hunch down in the water i sat up straight trusting in the bubbles besides i would not huddle so i was naked in a tub of bubble bath so what no one can embarrass you unless you let them jeanclaude came in with two thick red towels he closed the door behind him with a small smile we wouldnt want to let the hot air out i narrowed my eyes but said i guess not where do you want the towels here he started to lay them on the vanity i cant reach them there i said here he laid them on top of the stool he stood there staring down at me still wearing nothing but the black jeans his feet were startlingly pale against the black carpet still too far away he sat down on the edge of the tub placing the towels on the floor he stared down at me as if he could will the bubbles away is this close enough maybe a little too close i said he trailed fingertips over the bubbles at the edge of the tub do you feel better now ma petite i said no sexual innuendo remember as i remember you said no sexual innuendo until after you were clean he smiled at me youre clean i sighed trust you to be literal he trailed his fingers in the water he turned his shoulder enough that i could see the whip scars on his back they were slick and white and i suddenly had an urge to trace them with my fingers he turned back to face me he wiped his wet fingers across his chest trailing shining lines of moisture across the flat slickness of the burn scar down along his belly his fingers played with the line of dark hair that vanished into his pants i closed my eyes and let out a sigh what is the matter ma petite i felt him leaning over me are you faint i opened my eyes he had leaned his entire upper body across the tub right arm on the far rim the left near my shoulder his hip was so far over the water that if id touched his chest hed have fallen in i dont faint i said his face leaned down over mine so glad to hear it he kissed me lightly a brush of lips but even that small movement made my stomach jerk i gasped and pushed him away he fell into the tub going completely under only his feet sticking out he landed on my naked body and i screamed he came up for air his long black hair streaming around his face across his shoulders he looked as surprised as id ever seen him he crawled off me mainly because i was shoving at him he struggled to his feet water streamed down his body he stared down at me i was huddled against the side staring up at him pissed he shook his head and laughed the sound filled the room played along my skin like a hand i have been a ladys man for nearly three hundred years anita why is it only with you that i am awkward maybe its a hint i said perhaps i stared up at him he stood there knee deep in bubble bath he was soaking wet and should have been ridiculous but he wasnt he was beautiful how can you be so damn beautiful when i know what you are he knelt in the water the bubbles covered his waist so he looked naked water trailed down his chest in fine beads i wanted to run my hands over him i wanted to lick the water off his skin i drew my legs to my chest and locked my arms around them not trusting myself he moved towards me the water sloshed and curled around my naked body he stayed kneeling so close that his jeans brushed my huddled legs the feel of him in the water that close made me hide my face against my knees the pounding of my heart gave me away i knew he could taste my need on the air tell me to go ma petite and i will go i felt him lean over me his face just above my wet hair slowly i raised my face he placed a hand on the tub edge one arm on either side of me bringing his chest dangerously close to my face i watched the water bead on his skin the way that he sometimes watched blood on mine a need almost too overwhelming to deny an urge so complete that i didnt want to say no i unclenched my arms from my knees and leaned forward i whispered dont go i touched hands to his waist tentative as if it should burn but his skin was cool under the slickness of water cool and smooth to the touch i glanced up at his face and knew that there was something close to fear on my own face his face was lovely and uncertain as if he didnt know what to do next it was a look i never thought to see on jeanclaudes face when i was naked in his arms i kept my eyes on his face as i moved my mouth towards his stomach i ran my tongue over his skin a quick tentative movement he sighed eyes fluttering shut body almost sagging i pressed my mouth against his skin drinking the water off of him i couldnt reach his chest i moved to my knees hands steadying me against his slender waist the air was cool against my naked breasts kneeling had bared them i froze suddenly unsure i wanted desperately to see his face and was afraid to look up his fingertips brushed my shoulders sliding down the wet skin i shivered and glanced up the look on his face caught my breath in my throat tenderness need amazement you are so beautiful ma petite he put his fingertips to my lips before i could protest you are beautiful on this i do not lie his fingers moved across my lips down my chin he slid his hands to my shoulders down my back in slow teasing lines his hands stopped on either side of my waist mirroring my hands on his own waist now what my voice was a little breathless whatever you like ma petite i massaged my hands against his waist feeling the flesh underneath feeling him under my hands i spread my hands wide splaying my fingers tense against his skin dragging my hands up his ribs he kneaded his fingers into my waist pressing his hands against my ribs he inched his hands upward along my sides strong fingers pressed into my skin just enough to make me sigh he stopped with his thumbs below my breasts his touch was feather light almost not touching at all but that one small brush of his skin against my breasts made my body react tightening nipples hardening my body wanted him wanted him so badly that my skin felt large and aching with the thought of it my own hands were pressed against his chest i realized that he was still mirroring me waiting for me to move i stared up into his face i searched that beauty those dark eyes there was no pull to them no power except the thick black line of his lashes and the rich color like the sky just before darkness swallows the world when you think all is black but there in the west is a shade of blue dark and rich as ink beauty had its own power i slid my hands up his chest fingers brushing across his nipples i stared at his face while i did it heart pounding in my throat breath coming too fast his hands slid upward cupping my breasts the touch of his hands made me gasp he scooted lower in the water still touching me he bent over my breasts and laid a gentle kiss on them he licked the water off my skin lips working gently i shuddered and had to steady myself on his bare shoulders all i could see was his long dark hair bent over me i caught sight of us in the mirrors i watched his mouth close over my breast felt him take me into his mouth as far as he could fangs pressed against my breast for a second i thought they would sink into my flesh draw blood in a fine hot line but he drew back he dropped to all fours in the water which made me taller allowed me to look down into his face there was no uncertainty in his face now his eyes were still lovely still human but there was a knowledge in them now a growing darkness sex for want of a better word but that look in a mans eyes is too primitive for vocabulary its the darkness we all have inside of us peeking out that part of us that we trap in our dreams and deny in daylight hours he stayed crouched in the water with that feral light in his eyes and i went to him i kissed him light a brush of lips i flicked my tongue along his lips and he opened his mouth for me i cupped his face between my hands and kissed him tasted him explored him he came up out of the water with a sound between a moan and a cry his arms locked behind my back and he rolled us in the water like a shark we came up gasping he pushed away from me to lean against the far edge of the tub i was breathing so hard i was trembling my pulse thudded at the back of my throat i could taste it on my tongue almost roll the beating pulse in my mouth like candy i realized it wasnt just my heart i was hearing it was jeanclaudes i could see the pulse in his neck like something alive and separate but it wasnt only my eyes that could see it i could feel it like it was my own i had never been so aware of the blood coursing through my body the pulsing warmth of my own skin the thick pumping of my heart my life thundering inside me jeanclaudes body pulsed in time to mine it was like he was riding my pulse my blood i felt his need and it wasnt just sex but for the first rime i understood it wasnt just the blood either it was all of me he wanted to warm himself in my body like holding hands to a flame gathering my warmth my life to him i felt his stillness a depth of quiet that nothing living could touch like a still pool of water hidden away in the dark in one crystalline moment i realized that for me this was part of the attraction i wanted to plunge my hands into his stillness into that quiet place of death i wanted to embrace it confront it conquer it i wanted to fill him up with a burning wash of life and i knew in that moment that i could do it but only at the price of drinking in some of that still dark water my deepest apologies ma petite you have almost undone me he sank into the water leaning against the edge of the tub i did not come here to feed ma petite i am sorry i felt his heartbeat going away from me pulling away from me my pulse slowed the only heart thudding in my ears was my own he stood water dripping down his body i will go ma petite he sighed you rob me of my hardwon control only you can do that to me only you i crawled through the water towards him and let the darkness fill my eyes dont go i said he watched me with a look that was part amazement part amusement part fear as if he didnt trust meor didnt trust himself i knelt at his feet running my hands up the soaked cloth of his jeans i dug my nails lightly into the cloth over his thighs and stared up at him my face was dangerously close to places i had never touched before not even with my hands this close i couldnt help noticing that he was stretched hard and firm under the tight heavy cloth i had a terrible urge to lay my cheek over his groin i ran my hand lightly over him barely touching that small touch brought a soft groan from him he stared down at me like a drowning man i met his eyes no teeth no blood he nodded slowly he tried twice before he found his voice as my lady wishes i laid my cheek across him feeling him firm and large against my skin i felt his whole body tense i rubbed my face against him like a cat a small sound escaped him i looked up his eyes were closed his head thrown back i grabbed the waistband of his jeans and used it to pull myself to my feet water ran down my body suds clung to my skin his hands encircled my waist but his eyes went lower he met my gaze and smiled it was the smile he always had that smile that said he was thinking wicked little thoughts things youd only do in the dark on a dare for the first time i wanted everything that smile promised i tugged at his jeans off he unsnapped the jeans carefully he peeled the wet cloth away from his body if thered been underwear i never saw it the jeans ended up on the carpet he was somehow suddenly nude he was like carved alabaster every muscle every curve of his body pale and perfect telling him he was beautiful was redundant saying golly gee whiz seemed too uncool giggling was out my voice came small and strangled hoarse with all the words i couldnt find youre not circumcised no ma petite is that a problem i did what id wanted to do since i first saw him i wrapped my fingers around him squeezing gently he closed his eyes shuddering steadying his hands on my shoulders not a problem i said he pulled me against him suddenly pressing our naked bodies together the feel of him hard and firm against my stomach was almost overwhelming i dug fingers into his back to keep my suddenly weak knees from giving out i kissed his chest i rose on tiptoe and kissed his shoulders his neck i ran my tongue along his skin and tasted him rolling the scent of him the feel of him in my mouth we kissed a nearly innocent brush of lips i locked my hands behind his neck arching my body against him he made a small sound low in his throat he slid down my body arms locked behind my back holding me against him as he left my arms and left me standing staring down at him he licked my stomach with quick wet flicks of his tongue his hands played along my buttocks teasing he licked back and forth where stomach ended and lower things began his fingers slid between my legs i gasped what are you doing he rolled his eyes upward mouth still pressed low on my stomach he raised his face just enough to speak you may have three guesses ma petite he whispered he put a hand on each of my thighs and spread my legs wider his hand slid over me exploring me my mouth was suddenly dry i licked my lips and said i dont think my legs will hold he ran his tongue down my hip when the time comes ma petite i will hold you he kissed his way down my thigh his finger slid inside of me my breath fell outward in a sigh he kissed the inside of my thighs running his tongue his lips along my skin the feel of his fingers between my legs tightened my body and i could feel the beginnings of something large and overwhelming he stood hand still between my legs he bent and kissed me long and slow the movement of his hand matched his mouth slow and lingering teasing along my body when his fingers plunged inside me i cried out shuddering against him he left me standing in the water alone and shivering but not from cold i couldnt even think enough to ask whered he gone he appeared in front of me with a condom in his hand like hed plucked it from the air he traced the foil down my body i touched him while he unwrapped it i held him in my hands and felt the velvet smoothness of him the skin was unbelievably soft he drew himself gently out of my hands with a shaking laugh when he was ready he picked me up hands on the backs of my thighs he pressed himself against me without entering rubbing himself where his hand had touched i whispered please he spread my legs and eased inside of me slowly so slowly as if he were afraid hed hurt me but it didnt hurt when he was sheathed inside me he looked at me the look on his face was haunting emotions flowed over his face tenderness triumph need i have wanted this for so long ma petite so very long he eased in and out slowly almost tentatively i watched his face until the play of emotions was too much too honest there was something like pain in his eyes something that i didnt even come close to understanding the movements of his hips were still slow careful it was amazing but i wanted more i brought my mouth up to his and said i wont break i pressed my mouth to his hard enough to feel the press of fangs he went to his knees in the water pressing me against the side of the tub his mouth fed at mine and there was a small sharp pain sweet copper blood filled my mouth filled his mouth and he plunged inside of me hard and fast i watched him in the mirrors watched his body coming in and out of mine i gathered him in my arms in my legs i held him to me feeling his body plunging inside of mine felt his need someone was making a high moaning sound and it was me i wrapped my legs around his waist the muscles in my lower abdomen spasmed tightened i pressed my body against jeanclaude as if i would climb through him into him i grabbed a handful of his long hair and watched his face from inches away watched his face while his body pumped into mine the emotions were gone his face was almost slack with need blood spilled down the corner of my mouth and he licked it away his body tightening against me he slowed the rhythm of his body i felt the effort strain through his arms and back he slowed every time he thrust into me it was like i could feel it into the middle of my chest as if hed grown impossibly large within me my body spasmed around him tightened like a hand he cried out and his body lost its rhythm he plunged inside me faster harder as if he would meld our bodies together weld us into one flesh one body a wave of pleasure burst over me in a skintingling bodysweeping rush it burst over me like a rush of cool flame and still he was not done every thrust of his body reached inside of me and caressed things that should never have been able to be touched it was as if his body could reach the places his voice could touch as if it were more than his body that plunged inside of me the world became for a moment a shining whiteness a melting thing i dug fingers into jeanclaudes back noises fell from my mouth that were too primitive for screams when i realized i was drawing blood on his back i scratched my own arms i hadnt asked what he thought about pain i cuddled around him letting him hold the full weight of my body he climbed up the edge of the tub lifting me out of the water he crawled on all fours to the raised area around the tub with me hanging onto him he lowered his body and i moved away from him he slid out of me and was still as hard and ready as when he had started i looked at him you didnt come i have not waited this long to end it so quickly he lowered himself in a sort of pushup and ran his tongue down one of the scratches on my arm he rolled his tongue around his lips if you did this for my benefit i appreciate it if you did it to keep from damaging me it was not necessary i do not mind a little pain me either he slid his body across mine i noticed that he kissed me slowly he lay beside me then scooted until he was lying on his back and i was almost back in the tubi want to watch you move ma petite i want you above me i straddled his waist and slid slowly over him it was deeper from this angle sharper somehow his hands moved up my body over my breasts he lay back underneath me his long curling black hair was almost completely dry it fanned out around his face in a thick soft wave this was what i wanted seeing him like this feeling him inside me move for me anita i moved for him i rode his body he tightened inside me and i gasped i watched us in the mirrors watched my hips swaying above him ma petite he whispered look into my eyes let it be between us as it always could have been i stared into his dark blue eyes they were lovely but they were just eyes i shook my head i cant you must let me inside your mind as you let me inside your body he spasmed inside of me and it was hard to think i dont know how i said love me anita love me i stared down at him and did i do love you then let me in ma petite let me love you i felt it like a drape being pulled away i felt his eyes and they were suddenly drowning deep an endless midnight blue ocean that somehow managed to burn i was aware of my body i could feel jeanclaude inside my body i could feel him like a brush of silk inside my mind the orgasm hit me unexpectedly opened my mind to him more than id planned flung me wide open and falling into his eyes he cried out underneath me and i realized i could still feel my body feel my hands on his chest feel my pelvis riding him i opened my eyes and for a dizzying second i saw his face go slack that moment of total abandon i collapsed on top of him trailing my hands down his arms feeling his heart pound against my chest we lay quietly for a few moments resting holding each other then i slid off him curling beside him you cant hold me with your eyes anymore even if i let you i can still break the hold at any time yes ma petite does that bother you he lifted a lock of my hair running it between his fingers let us say it does not bother me as much as it might have a few hours ago i raised up on one elbow so i could see his face meaning what that now that ive had sex with you im not dangerous he stared up at me i couldnt read his eyes you will always be dangerous ma petite he raised upward bending at the waist bringing his lips against mine in a gentle kiss he moved back from me just enough to speak propping himself on one arm there was a time when you would have taken my heart with stake or gun he took my hand in his and raised it towards his mouth now you have taken it with these delicate hands and the scent of your body he kissed the back of my hand ever so gently he lay back drawing me with him come ma petite enjoy your conquest i held my face back avoiding a kiss you arent conquered i said nor ma petite are you he ran his hands up my back i am beginning to realize that you will never be conquered and that is the greatest aphrodisiac of all a challenge forever i said for all eternity he whispered i let him draw me down into a kiss and part of me was still not sure if id done a good thing or a bad thing but just for tonight i didnt care i woke surrounded by bloodred sheets naked and alone jeanclaude had kissed me goodbye and gone to his coffin i didnt argue if id awakened to him cold and dead beside me lets just say id had all the shock i could handle from my boyfriends for awhile boyfriend that was a word for someone who walked you to your class it didnt seem the right word after last night i lay there clutching the raw silk sheets to my chest i could smell jeanclaudes cologne on the sheets on my skin but more than that i could smell him i cuddled that scent to me rolled in it he said he loved me and for a time last night i believed him in the light of day i wasnt so sure how stupid was it to halfbelieve the vampire loved me not nearly as stupid as halfloving him but i still loved richard one night of great sex didnt change that i think i had hoped it would lust may die that easily but love doesnt true love is a much harder beast to kill there was a soft knock on the door i had to reach under two red pillows before i came out with the firestar i held it at my side and said come in a man entered the room he was tall muscular with hair shaved on either side the back left in a long ponytail i pointed the gun at him and clutched the sheets to my chest i dont know you his eyes went wide his voice shook im ernie im supposed to ask if you want breakfast no i said now get out he nodded eyes on the gun he hesitated in the doorway even staring down the barrel of a gun i made a guess what did jeanclaude tell you to do it was amazing how many people were more afraid of jeanclaude than of me i pointed the gun at the ceiling he said i was to be at your disposal anything you want he said i was to make that very clear to you its clear now get out he still hesitated id had enough ernie i am sitting here naked in a bed and i dont know you get out or im going to shoot you on principle i aimed the gun at him for dramatic emphasis ernie ran for it leaving the door open great now i had the choice of walking to the door naked and closing it or draping a kingsize sheet around me and stumbling to the door and closing it sheet i was sitting on the edge of the bed with the sheet in front of me and most of my backside not covered gun still clutched in one hand when richard appeared in the doorway he was dressed in jeans white tshirt jeans jacket and white tennis shoes his hair foamed around his face in a mass of golden brown waves a claw had caught him across the face leaving angry red welts that chased across the entire left side of his face the injury looked days old it had to have happened after i left last night he had my leather coat in one hand and the browning in the other he just stood there in the doorway i sat on the bed neither of us said anything i wasnt slick and sophisticated enough for this what do you say to boyfriend a when he finds you naked in the bed of boyfriend b especially if boyfriend a turned into a monster the night before and ate someone i bet miss manners didnt cover this at all you slept with him didnt you his voice was low almost soft as if he was trying very hard not to yell my gut tightened i was not ready for this fight i was armed but i was naked i would have traded the gun for clothes in a hot second i would say its not what it looks like but it is my attempt at humor did not work he strode into the room like an approaching storm his anger riding before him in a crackling wave the power poured over me and i wanted to scream stop leaking all over me it stopped him almost literally in midmotion what are you talking about your power aura its raining all over me stop it why does it feel good until you panicked last night it felt good didnt it i shoved the firestar under the pillow and stood clutching the sheet to me yeah it felt good until you shapeshifted on top of me i was covered in that clear gunk thick with it the memory was new enough that i shuddered and looked away from him so you fucked jeanclaude oh that makes perfect sense i looked at him and felt an answering anger if he wanted to fight hed come to the right place i held up my right hand it was covered in a wonderful multicolored bruise you did this when you knocked my gun away thered been enough killing anita no one else had to die do you really think that raina is just going to let you take over no way shell see you dead first he shook his head his face set in stubborn lines i am ulfric now im in control shell do what i say nobody bosses raina not for long has she offered to fuck you yet yes he said the way he said it stopped me brought my breath up short did you after i left it would serve you right if i had i couldnt meet his eyes on that one if you make her lupa shell let it go she just doesnt want to lose her power base i forced myself to look up to meet his eyes i dont want raina something passed over his face so raw that it brought tears to my eyes i want you you cant want me now not after last night is that why you slept with jeanclaude did you think it would keep you safe from me i wasnt thinking that clearly i said he laid the coat and the gun on the bed he gripped the end of the bed the wood groaned under the strength of his hands he jerked back from it as if he hadnt meant to do it you slept with him in this bed right here he put his hand over his eyes as if he was trying to erase an image inside his head he screamed wordlessly i took a step towards him hand out and stopped how could i comfort him what could i say to make this better not a damn thing he jerked at the bottom sheet tugging it until it came loose he grabbed the top mattress and pulled it off the bed he grabbed the bottom of the bed and lifted i screamed richard the bed was antique solid oak and he tossed it on its side like it was a toy he pulled the bottom sheet off the silk tore with a sound like skin peeling back he was on his knees with the butchered silk in his hands he held his hands out to me and the sheets fell away like blood richard got to his feet a little unsteady he caught himself against the bed and took a step towards me the firestar and the browning were somewhere on the floor in the welter of red silk and tossed mattress i backed away until i hit the corner and i had nowhere else to go i was still clutching the sheet around me like it was some kind of protection i held out a hand towards richard as if that would help what do you want from me richard what do you want me to say im sorry i am sorry that i hurt you im sorry that i cant handle what i saw last night im sorry he stalked towards me not saying anything hands balled into fists i realized that i was afraid of richard that i wasnt sure what hed do when he reached me and i wasnt armed part of me felt like i deserved to be hit at least once that i owed that to him but after seeing what hed done to the bed i wasnt sure id survive it richard grabbed the front of the sheet balling it in his fist jerking me against him he used the sheet to raise me to tiptoe he kissed me for a second i froze hitting yelling that id expected but not this his mouth bruised against my lips forcing my mouth open the moment i felt his tongue i jerked my head back richard put a hand on the back of my head like hed force me to kiss him the rage in his face was frightening not good enough to kiss now i saw you eat marcus last night he let me go so suddenly i fell to the floor stumbling over the sheet i tried to get to my knees but my legs had tangled the sheet slipped over one breast i struggled to cover myself embarrassed at last two nights ago you let me touch them suck them now i cant even see them dont do this richard he went to all fours in front of me so wed be on eye level dont do what dont be mad that you let the vampire fuck you he crawled forward until our faces were almost touching you fucked a corpse last night anita did it feel good i stared at him from inches away not embarrassed anymore instead i was getting pissed yeah it did he jerked back from me like id hit him his face crumpled and his eyes searched the room frantically i love you he looked up suddenly eyes wide and painfilled i love you i kept my eyes very wide so the tears in them wouldnt fall out and run down my cheeks i know and im sorry he turned away from me still kneeling he slapped his hands against the floor he pounded his hands into the floor over and over until blood smeared on the white carpet i got to my feet i hovered over him afraid to touch him richard richard dont please dont the tears fell and i couldnt stop them i knelt beside him youre hurting yourself stop it i grabbed his wrists held his bleeding hands in mine he stared at me and the look on his face was raw human i touched his face gently tracing the claw marks he leaned into me tears spilling down his cheeks the look in his eyes held me immobile his lips brushed mine soft i didnt flinch but i didnt kiss him back either he moved back from me just enough to see my face clearly goodbye anita he got to his feet i wanted to say so much but none of it would help nothing would make it better nothing would erase what id seen last night or how it had made me feel richard i im sorry so am i he walked to the door he hesitated with his hand on the doorknob ill always love you i opened my mouth but no sound came there was nothing left to say but i love you richard and i am sorrier than i know how to say he opened the door and stepped through it without looking back when the door closed behind him i sat on the floor huddled in the silk sheet i could smell jeanclaudes cologne on the silk but i could smell richard now too his aftershave clung to the sheets to my mouth how could i let him go like this how could i call him back i sat on the floor and did nothing because i didnt know what to do i called edwards answering service and left a message i couldnt stay where i was i couldnt stay here staring at the wrecked bedroom and remembering richards wounded eyes i had to get out i had to call dominic and tell him i wasnt coming the triad of power didnt work without at least two of us on the spot jeanclaude was in his coffin and richard was out of the picture i wasnt sure what would happen with our little triumvirate now i didnt see richard standing around watching me grope jeanclaude if i wasnt groping him too i couldnt blame him on that strangely the thought of him sleeping with raina still made me see green i had no right to be jealous of him now but i was go figure i dressed in black jeans a black shortsleeved blouse and a black blazer i had to work tonight and bert would kick a fit about me wearing black he thought it gave the wrong image screw him tonight black fit my mood the browning in its shoulder holster firestar in the uncle mikes sidekick holster a knife on each arm and a knife down my spine i was ready for work i was going to give edward ten more minutes and then i was out of there if there was still an assassin lurking around id almost have welcomed him or her there was a knock on the door i sighed who is it cassandra come in she opened the door caught one sight of the wrecked bed and grinned ive heard of rough sex but this is ridiculous she was wearing a long white dress that fell nearly to her ankles white hose and white canvas flats completed the outfit she looked light and summery with her long hair trailing down her back i shook my head richard did it the smile left her face he found out you slept with jeanclaude does everyone know i asked not everyone she walked into the room shutting the door behind her she shook her head did he hurt you he didnt hit me if thats what you mean but i feel pretty shitty cassandra walked to the bed staring up at it she grabbed the edge of the frame she pulled with one hand and steadied with the other she pulled several hundred pounds of wood and metal around like it was nothing she settled the bed gently to the carpet i raised an eyebrow that was impressive she smiled almost shyly one of the fringe benefits of being a lycanthrope is that you can pretty much lift anything you want i see the appeal of that i knew you would she said she started picking up the pillows and ripped sheets i joined her we should probably put the mattress back first she said okay you need help she laughed i can lift it but its awkward sure i grabbed the other side of the mattress cassandra came up beside me lifting the mattress with her left hand a look passed over her face i am sorry i meant what i said about you and richard earlier i want him to be happy i said thats very flattering i like you anita i like you a lot i wish i didnt i had time to frown at her then her delicate fist came out of nowhere a blur of speed that smashed into my face i felt myself fall backwards i smashed into the floor and couldnt save my head from that extra smack against the carpet it didnt hurt i didnt feel a damn thing when blackness closed over me i rose out of the darkness slowly dragging upwards like being awakened from deep sleep i wasnt sure what woke me i couldnt remember going to sleep i tried to roll over and couldnt i was suddenly very awake eyes wide body straining id been tied up before it was one of my least favorite things i had a few moments of pure panic i bucked against the ropes that tied me at the wrists and ankles i fought pulling until i realized that the knots were getting tighter as i struggled i forced myself to lie very still my heart pounded in my ears so loudly that i couldnt hear anything else my wrists were tied over my head at an angle sharp enough to squeeze my shoulder blades and put strain all the way down to my wrists even raising my head the little bit i needed to see my ankles was painful my ankles were tied together to the foot of an unfamiliar bed i rolled my head back and saw the rope that tied my wrists to the head of the bed the rope was black and soft and if i had to guess id say it was woven silk it looked like something jeanclaude might have lying around in a closet somewhere i considered it for only a split second then reality stepped into the room and my heart stopped for just a second gabriel came to the foot of the bed he was wearing black leather pants so tight they looked poured on and high black boots that rode his thighs all the way up with straps at the top to hold the soft leather in place he was naked from the waist up a silver ring through his left nipple and another through the edge of his belly button more silver marched up his ears to the curve glittering as he walked around the bed his long thick black hair fell across his face framing his pale storm grey eyes he walked around behind the headboard out of sight then slowly back into frame my heart had started beating again it was beating so hard i was going to choke on it theyd taken the browning and firestar holsters and all the wrist sheaths were gone i tensed my back and could still feel the back sheath when i put my head back i didnt feel the knifes handle i guess i was grateful they hadnt stripped me to get the sheath the way gabriel was circling the bed i was betting wed get to that i tried to talk couldnt swallowed and tried again whats going on my voice sounded amazingly calm even to me a womans laugh high and rich filled the room but of course it wasnt a room we were at the farm where they made dirty movies the room i was tied in had only three walls the lights hung above me were dead not on yet raina stalked into sight on high spiked heels the color of blood she was wearing what looked like a red leather teddy that left most of her long legs and hips bare hello anita youre looking well i took a deep breath in through my nose and let it out slowly my heart slowed a bit good you should talk to richard before you do anything drastic the position of lupa just opened up today she cocked her head to one side puzzled what are you talking about she slept with jeanclaude cassandra came to stand on the edge of the fake room back to the wall she looked like shed always looked if she felt uncomfortable having betrayed me to raina it didnt show i hated her a lot for that arent you going to sleep with both of them raina asked hadnt planned on it i said every time i opened my mouth and nobody touched me i got a little calmer if raina had done this to get me out of the way then she didnt need to go any further if it was revenge for marcus i was in deep shit raina sat down on the end of the bed near my feet i tensed when she did it i couldnt help myself she noticed and laughed oh you are going to be a lot of fun you can be alpha female i dont want the job i said raina sighed running her hand along my leg massaging the muscle in my upper thigh almost absently like youd pet a dog richard doesnt want me anita he thinks im corrupt he wants you she squeezed my thigh until i thought she was going to grow claws and tear out the muscle she forced a small sound out of my throat before she stopped what do you want your pain she smiled when she said it i turned my head to cassandra there had to be someone sane in this room why are you helping them i am sabins wolf my eyes narrowed what are you talking about raina crawled up on the bed lying beside me insinuating her body against mine one finger tracing over my stomach it was an idle gesture as if she wasnt really concentrating i didnt want to be here when she started concentrating cassandra was a plant from the very beginning werent you dear cassandra nodded coming to stand beside the bed her hazel eyes were calm too calm whatever she was feeling was there behind that pretty face carefully controlled the trick was was there anything behind that face that could help me dominic sabin and i are a triumvirate we are what you and richard and jeanclaude could have been i didnt like her using the past tense youre the woman he gave up fresh blood for i believe in the sanctity of life i thought i valued that above all watching sabins golden beauty rot away has convinced me otherwise i will do anything anything to help him recover something like pain crossed her eyes and she looked away when she looked back her face was forcibly blank the effort trembling down her hands she noticed and hugged her hands to her arms she smiled but it wasnt a happy smile i have to make it up to him anita i am sorry that you and yours have become entangled in our problems how am i caught up in it raina slid her arm over my stomach putting her face very near mine dominic has a spell to cure sabin of the rotting disease a transfer of magical essence you might say all he needed was exactly the right donor she leaned in so close that only my turning my head kept our lips from touching she whispered against my skin breath warm a perfect donor a vampire who shares sabins powers exactly a perfect match and a servant either alpha werewolf or necromancer bound to that same vampire i turned and looked at her i couldnt help it she kissed me pressing her mouth against mine trying to force her tongue inside i bit her lip hard enough that i tasted blood she jerked back with a startled scream she put her hand to her mouth and stared down at me that is going to cost you dearly i spit her blood at her it spattered along my chin it was a stupid thing to have done making her angrier was not helpful but watching the blood drip down her lovely face had almost been worth it gabriel entertain ms blake that got my attention gabriel slid onto the bed folding himself against me as raina had done on the other side he was taller six feet so he didnt fit quite as well but what he lacked in matching size he made up for in technique he straddled my body and leaned over me in a sort of pushup bringing his mouth close and closer he licked my bloody chin one quick flick of his tongue i jerked my head away he grabbed my chin with one hand forcing me to look at him he held my chin like a vise fingers digging in when i struggled the strength in his fingers was enough to crush my jaw if he squeezed he licked the blood off my chin and lips in slow lingering licks i screamed then mentally cursed myself this was what they wanted panic would not help panic would not help i kept repeating it over and over until i stopped pulling at the ropes i would not lose it not yet not yet cassandra crawled up on the bed i could only see her white dress out of the corner of my eye gabriel still held me immobile let go of her face so she can look at me gabriel glanced at her and hissed a low rolling growl trickled out from behind her lips im in the mood for a fight tonight kitty dont make it easy for me arent you expected at the ceremony raina said doesnt dominic need you there for it to work cassandra reared back and the voice that came was low and fell from her human lips with effort i will speak with anita before i go or i will not go raina came to stand on the other side of the bed youll never find another master vampire who matches your master as perfectly as jeanclaude never youd jeopardize his one chance at a cure i will do as i wish on this one thing raina for i am alpha when richard is gone i will lead the pack do not forget that that wasnt our bargain our bargain was that you would kill the executioner before we arrived in town you failed marcus hired the best who knew she would be so hard to kill i did the first time i met her you are always underestimating other women raina it is one of your weaknesses cassandra leaned towards raina you tried to kill richard before dominic could use him in the spell he was going to kill marcus cassandra shook her head you panicked raina you and marcus now marcus is dead and you cant hold the pack too many of them hate you and many of them love richard or at least admire him i wanted to ask where jeanclaude and richard were but i was afraid i knew a ceremony sacrifice but they needed cassandra to make it work i didnt want her to rush off you were dominics alibi i said not that im complaining but why am i still alive cassandra looked down at me gabriel and raina want you on film if you would give me your word that you would seek no revenge against any of us for the deaths of your two men then i would fight to see you go free i started to open my mouth and promise she waved a finger in front of my mouth no lies anita not between us too late for that i said cassandra nodded true and that grieves me under other circumstances we might have been friends yeah of course that made it hurt all the more nothing rubs salt in the wounds like betrayal richard could probably compare notes with me right now where are richard and jeanclaude she stared down at me even now you think you can save them dont you i would have shrugged but i couldnt it was a thought you were a lure and a hostage for the two men cassandra said gabriel had settled on top of me body pressing along the length of my body he was heavy you never noticed how heavy a man was when you were enjoying yourself he had sunk down so that his feet trailed off the bed and he could fold his arms across my chest his chin rested on his arms and he stared at me like that like he knew he had all day all night all the time in the world i am very surprised that you broke up with richard today anita raina said we sent him a lock of your hair with a note saying wed send a hand next he came alone and told no one as we had said to do he really is a fool it sounded like something richard would do but it surprised me anyway you didnt get jeanclaude to hand himself over for a lock of my hair raina moved where i could see her better and smiled down her lip was already beginning to heal very true we didnt even try jeanclaude would have known we meant to kill you regardless hed have come with all his vampires all the wolves that are loyal to him it would have been a bloodbath how did you get him then cassandra betrayed him didnt you cassandra cassandra just looked at us if richard hadnt broken with you you might have been able to cure sabin seeking your aid was originally only an excuse to enter jeanclaudes territory but you were more powerful than dominic first thought you surprised us by bearing none of the vampires marks you were supposed to be part of the sacrifice but without at least the first mark it will not work hurrah for me you saw me heal damians cut and the zombie i can heal sabin you know i can cassandra you saw it she shook her head the sickness has moved inside sabin his brain is going if you had cured him today it would be moot but he must be sane for the spell to work even one more day might be too late if you kill richard and jeanclaude i wont have the power to heal sabin if dominic came here planning to sacrifice all three of us then the spell must need all three of us to work something flickered across her face i was right dominics not sure it will work without a human servant in the loop is he cassandra shook her head it has to be tonight if you kill them both and it doesnt cure sabin youve destroyed the only real chance he has our triumvirate can cure him you know it can i know no such thing you would promise me the moon itself if you thought it would save you all thats true but i still think we can cure him if you kill richard and jeanclaude the chance is gone let us at least try if it doesnt work you can sacrifice them tomorrow ill let jeanclaude give me the first mark well either cure sabin tomorrow or well be the perfect sacrifice for dominics spell i willed her to listen to me to believe me will sabin be able to read his part of the spell tomorrow night raina asked she moved in very close to cassandra once his brain is rotted away there will be nothing left to do but lock him in a box with crosses on it hide him away cassandras hands balled into fists a fine trembling ran through her body raw fear showed on her face raina turned to me almost conversationally sabin wont die you understand hell melt down into a little puddle of slime but he wont die will he cassandra no cassandra almost shouted no he wont die hell just go insane hell still have all the powers of the triumvirate but hell be mad well have to lock him away and pray that dominics spells can hold his power in check if we cant hold his powers prisoner the council will force us to burn him alive only that would be sure death but if you do that raina said you and dominic will die as well all those vampire marks dragging you down to hell with him yes cassandra said yes she stared at me anger and helplessness in her face am i supposed to feel sorry for you i asked no anita youre just supposed to die she said i swallowed hard and tried to think of something useful it was hard to do with gabriel lying on top of me but if i didnt think of something we were all dead cassandra startled as if someone had touched her a prickle of energy swept over my body from her raising goose bumps where it touched gabriel ran his fingertips over the skin of my arms making the gooseflesh stay just a little longer i must go cassandra said before the night is over you may wish you were being sacrificed she looked from gabriel to raina a slit throat would be quicker i agreed with her but i wasnt sure what to say we were discussing different ways to kill me none of them seemed particularly good choices cassandra stared down at me i am sorry if youre really sorry i said untie me and give me a weapon she smiled wistfully sabin has ordered me not to you always do what youre told i asked on this one thing yes if youd watched jeanclaudes beauty rot before you youd do anything to help him whore you trying to convince me or you she swayed slightly and i felt the roll of power out of her body and along mine gabriel licked my arm i must go the circle will be closed soon she stared down at me at gabriel running his tongue up my arm i am truly sorry anita if youre looking for forgiveness pray god may forgive you i wont cassandra stared down at me for another heartbeat so be it goodbye anita she ran in a blur of white like a fastforward ghost good raina said now we can set up the lights and make some test shots the lights sprang into a dazzling brightness i closed my eyes against the glare gabriel moved up my body and i opened my eyes we were going to strip you naked and tie you spreadeagled but cassandra wouldnt let us but now shes too busy with the spell he put a hand on either side of my head pinning some of my hair we did makeup on your face while you were out we can make the body makeup part of the show what do you think i tried to think of anything useful anything at all nothing came to mind he leaned over me bringing his face close and closer he opened his mouth enough to show fangs not vampire fangs but small leopard fangs richard had told me once that gabriel spent too much time in animal form so he didnt come completely back anymore great gabriel kissed me lightly then harder forcing his tongue in my mouth he drew back from me bite me he kissed me then raised his lips back just enough to whisper bite me pain excited gabriel i didnt want him more excited but with his tongue halfway down my throat it was hard not to give him what he wanted he ran his hand over my breasts squeezing hard enough to make me gasp bite me and ill stop i bit his lip i bit him until he pulled back the flesh straining between us blood poured from his mouth to mine i let go and spit blood into his face he was close enough that it splattered in a red rain he laughed wiping his fingers on the bloody lip putting them in his mouth sucking the blood off of them do you know how i became a wereleopard he asked i looked at him he slapped me lightly casually starbursts exploded across my vision answer me anita when i could focus i asked what was the question do you know how i became a wereleopard i didnt want to play this game i didnt want to participate in gabriels idea of pillow talk but i didnt want to be hit again either it wouldnt take much for him to knock me unconscious if i ever woke up again i would be in worse shape than i was now hard to believe but true no i said ive always liked pain even when i was human i met elizabeth she was a wereleopard we fucked but i wanted her to change while we did it she said she was afraid shed kill me he leaned over me blood dripped from his lip in slow heavy drops i blinked turning my face trying to keep the blood out of my eyes i almost died i had turned my head completely to the side while his blood dropped on the side of my face was the sex worth it he leaned down and began to lick the blood oft my face best sex i ever had a scream started in my throat i swallowed it and it hurt going down there had to be a way out of this there had to he a mans voice said lie on top of her like youre going to do for the shot and lets get some light readings i realized that there was a crew here a director a cameraman a dozen people scurrying around not helping me gabriel drew a knife out of his high black boot the hilt was black but the blade had a high silver sheen i watched that knife couldnt help myself id been scared before but not like this the fear burned at the back of my throat threatened to spill out in screams it wasnt the sight of the blade that frightened me a moment ago id have done anything to have him cut the ropes now i would have given anything for him not to cut the ropes gabriel put his hand on my stomach and slid one knee between my tied legs there wasnt a lot of give i was grateful he twisted his upper body and reached downward with the knife i knew what he was going to do before i felt the ropes give at my ankles he cut my feet loose and collapsed his lower body against me at almost the same time no time to struggle no time to take advantage hed done this before he wiggled his hips against me spreading my legs wide enough that i could feel him against me through the jeans i didnt scream i whimpered and hated it my face was pressed into his naked chest just above his pierced nipple his chest hair was coarse scratchy against my cheek his body covered me almost completely they couldnt have seen much more than my hands and my legs from the camera i had a very strange idea youre too tall i said gabriel had to raise up a little to look down at my face what the camera will never see anything but your backside youre too tall he crawled backwards raising himself in a little pushup position he looked thoughtful he turned around without getting off of me frank can you see her at all nope shit gabriel said he stared down at me then smiled dont go anywhere ill be right back he slid off me with my feet free i could sit up my hands were still above my head but i could huddle against the headboard it was an immense improvement gabriel raina and two men in scruffy clothes were talking in a huddled group i caught snatches of the conversation maybe if we hang her from the ceiling well have to change the room setup for that i had bought some time but time for what there was a long table near the room my weapons were on it laid in neat lines like props everything i needed was right there but how could i get to it raina wasnt going to hand me a knife so i could cut myself loose no raina wouldnt but maybe gabriel would he walked towards the bed moving as if he had more muscles more something than a human did he moved like a cat if a cat could walk on two legs he knelt on the bed and started untying the rope from the headboard but leaving my wrists bound why not cut the rope i asked frank got pissed that i cut the first one this is real silk its expensive nice to know that franks fiscally responsible gabriel grabbed my face forcing me to meet his eyes were going to change the room and tie you standing up im going to fuck you until you go with me inside you then im going to change and ill rip you apart you may even survive like i survived i swallowed and spoke very carefully is that really your fantasy gabriel yes not your best fantasy i said what raping me while im helpless isnt your idea of hot sex he grinned flashing fangs oh yes it is dont panic dont panic dont panic i leaned into him and he released my face so i could do it but he jerked the rope up tight making sure my hands stayed in sight he had definitely done this before i forced myself to lean into his naked chest my tied hands pressed against his skin i leaned my face towards him and whispered dont you want a blade inside you while you do it i touched the silver ring in his nipple pulled on it until the flesh bowed outward and he gave a little gasp dont you want the feel of silver burning up inside you while youre shoving yourself inside of me i went up on my knees so our faces would be closer together dont you want to know im trying to kill you while you fuck me your blood pouring over my body while you fuck me isnt that your fantasy i whispered the last against his lips gabriel had gone very very still i could see the pulse in his throat thudding against the skin his heart beat fast and hard against my hands i jerked the ring out of his nipple and he let out a low moan blood trickled down his chest i raised the ring and he let the rope go so i could move my hands i raised the bloody ring between our lips almost as if wed both kiss it youll only have one chance to fuck me gabriel one way or another rainy will see me dead tonight youll never get another chance at me the tip of his tongue curled out and caught the ring licking it from my fingers he rolled it in his mouth and brought it back out clean and free of blood he held it out to me on the tip of his tongue i picked the ring off and wrapped my fingers around it you just want me to give you a knife he said i want to shove a silver blade so deep inside you that the hilt bruises your flesh he shuddered breath escaping in a long sigh youll never find anyone else like me gabriel play with me gabriel and ill be the best sex you ever had youll try and kill me he said i slid my fingers along the top of his leather pants oh yeah but have you ever really been in danger of dying since that first time with elizabeth since she shapeshifted underneath you have you ever feared for your life during sex did you ever ride that thin shining line between pleasure and death again he turned away from me not meeting my eyes i touched his face with my bound hands turned him back to me raina hasnt let you has she just like she wont let you tonight youre alpha gabriel i can feel it dont let her steal this from you dont let her steal me from you gabriel stared at me our bodies touching faces close enough to kiss youll kill me maybe or youll kill me you might survive he said i did are you still fucking elizabeth now that you survived i kissed him softly running my teeth along his skin elizabeth bores me would you bore me gabriel if i survive would you be boring no he whispered i knew i had him just like that i either had the beginnings of a brilliant plan or id bought myself some time some options it was an improvement the real question was how much time did jeanclaude and richard have how long until dominic cut them open if i couldnt get there in time i didnt want to get there at all if they both died i almost wanted gabriel to finish me almost they kept me tied to the bed but gabriel slipped the knives back in the wrist sheaths he held the big knife that went down along my spine up to the light i thought he wouldnt give it back but in the end he swept my hair to one side and slipped it into the sheath dont cut the ropes until im in the shot i want the camera to know why youre scared promise not to spoil it give me a gun and ill wait until youre on top of me to pull the trigger he smiled and waved a finger in my face like youd scold a child uh uh uh no rough stuff i took a deep breath and let it out cant blame a girl for trying gabriel laughed high and nervous no cant blame you for trying we had lights camera all we needed was action gabriel had wiped the blood off his chest and put the silver ring back into his flesh we were starting over for the camera theyd even cleaned the blood off my mouth and freshened the makeup it was the young woman heidi the lycanthrope that did the makeup her eyes were too wide her hands shook when she touched me she whispered as she dabbed at my face be careful when he kisses you he ate a girls tongue out once can you get me a gun she shivered eyes rolling white and panicked she shook her head rainad kill me not if shes dead heidi shook her head over and over and backed off the bed most of the rest of the crew walked out when the director realized they were going to lose too many people to run things he offered bonuses big bonuses and a few people stayed the rest left they didnt do snuff films they wouldnt watch gabriel kill me but they wouldnt stop it either maybe one of them would call the police it was a nice thought but i didnt pin any hopes on it power rushed over me in a skinprickling wave it tugged at something low and deep in my body the sensation was gone almost as soon as it came but a smell lingered over my skin like id walked through somebodys ghost i smelled richards aftershave richard was trying to tell me something either on purpose or because he was being driven by fear either way time was running out i had to save them i had to there was no other choice saving them meant bringing gabriel in close enough to kill him close to me a mixed blessing at best get on with it i said you are terribly eager for someone whos about to die a truly horrible death raina said i smiled i made the smile everything gabriel wanted it to be confident dangerous sexual i dont plan to die gabriels breath sighed outward lets do it raina shook her head and stepped back out of the shot fuck her gabriel make her cry out your name before you kill her my pleasure he whispered he stalked onto the floor of the fake bedroom i unsheathed a wrist knife and cut the rope that held me to the headboard my wrists were still bound i watched him while i turned the blade to cut between my hands he could have jumped me then but he didnt he glided around the bed while i cut my hands loose he ended on his knees beside the bed staring at me i backed away from him knife in my right hand i was going to get off the damn bed gabriel crawled up on the bed as i crawled off it he mimicked my movements but made them graceful and painfully slow he shimmered with contained energy he wasnt doing a damn thing but crawling across a bed but the promise of violence and sex rode the air like lightning he was faster than me his reach was almost twice mine he was certainly stronger than i was the only thing i really had going for me was the fact that i planned on killing him as quickly as possible and he planned on raping me first it meant i was willing to do things he wasnt at least at first if it wasnt over quickly i was sunk i dropped to one knee and braced myself with a blade in each hand he wanted to come in close he even wanted to be hurt so no feinting no trying each others skill id make him come to me and id cut him up power curled inside my stomach it burst over me in a wave of sensations the smell of the summer woods was so strong it was choking for a second i couldnt see the room i had a glimpse of somewhere else chaotic bits and pieces like a jigsaw puzzle thrown across the ground i came away with three thoughts fear helplessness and need my vision cleared to gabriel frowning down at me what is wrong with you anita did cassandra hit you a little too hard i shook my head and took a shaky breath are you all talk and no bite gabriel he smiled a slow lazy grin that showed his fangs he was suddenly there i slashed out without thinking pure reaction no thought he leaped away and blood seeped down his stomach in a thin crimson line he rubbed his fingers in the blood slowly sensuously then licked them with long slow tongue movements playing for the camera he crawled onto the bed and wrapped the white sheets around his body rolling in them until he was tangled he leaned over backwards exposing his neck almost within reach of me come play anita it was tempting and it was meant to be but i knew better id seen richard rip sheets earlier like they were paper im staying here gabriel youre going to have to come to me he rolled onto his stomach i thought id get to chase you this isnt any fun i smiled come closer and itll be a lot of fun he rose onto his knees the sheets were smeared with blood as he crawled out of them gabriel was just suddenly there too fast for me to see it he was by me and past me before i could react i fell back on my butt trying desperately to keep him in sight but he stood there just out of reach a second later a sharp pain ran through my right arm i glanced and found bleeding claw marks on my upper arm he raised one hand in front of his face and claws sprang out from under his fingernails meow he said i tried to swallow my beating heart and couldnt this meant that even if he didnt kill me a month from now i might be sprouting fur it wasnt a scream that you could hear with your ears it wasnt a sound i had no words for it but i felt richard scream inside me his power poured over me and down that long line i felt jeanclaude something tight and painful held him down i tried to get to my feet and stumbled whats wrong anita i didnt hurt you that badly i shook my head and got to my feet he wasnt going to come to me richard was growing desperate i reached outward with that flare of power and i could feel dominics spell hed been shielding it somehow but he couldnt hide from me the spell was growing the time of sacrifice was coming i didnt have time for gabriel to play with me stop playacting gabriel or dont you want me his eyes narrowed youre up to something you bet now fuck me gabriel if youve got the balls for it i put my back to the wall and hoped it would be enough and knew it wouldnt be i threw a thread of power back to richard hoping hed get the hint and not interrupt for the next few minutes if he distracted me at the wrong time it would be all over gabriel stalked in front of me daring me to come out from the wall and get him i did what he thought i would do i tried for him and he just wasnt there it was like trying to cut air he slashed out with one hand and sliced the back of my left hand open i slashed at him with my right hand trying to hold onto the lefthand knife he hit the hand again not with claws but backhanded my hand spasmed and the knife went spinning his body hit mine full out slamming me to the floor i shoved the righthand knife into his stomach before my back hit the ground but shoving the knife in meant i took the full force of the fall it stunned me for a heartbeat a heartbeat was all he needed he ran his hands under my arms not trying to pin them but forcing them up away from the knife in his stomach he pinned me to the floor with his body i expected him to draw out the blade but he didnt he pressed the hilt against my body and pushed he shoved the blade into him up to the hilt and kept pressing the hilt bruised against my stomach and he ground it into both of us he shuddered over me he raised his upper body off me pinning me with his lower body snuggling it between my legs so i could feel him hard and firm he pulled the blade out in a burst of crimson and plunged it downward so fast my arms were only halfway up to protect my face when the blade bit into the carpet he drove the blade hilt deep into the plywood floor so close to my head that it pinned my hair on one side he undid the button on my jeans he wasnt even trying to control my hands but i only had one knife left if i lost it i couldnt kill him we were about to find out just how good my nerves were richards power flowed over me again but it wasnt the same it was less frantic more as if he was trying to whisper something to me offer me something then i realized what it was the first mark jeanclaude and richard for it was they couldnt do it now without my permission i was too powerful to be forced at least psychically gabriel kept my legs pinned with his hips and grabbed the front of my jeans fingers pointing outward away from my body his claws sprang out through the cloth and he ripped upward slicing the cloth nearly to my pubic bone i screamed and let richard do me better the monster you know than the monster about to go down your pants a line of warmth ran through my body it had been even simpler when jeanclaude did it on his own once upon a time even knowing what it was it didnt feel like much but i felt better instantly clearerheaded more something gabriel hesitated on top of me what the hell was that the skin of his bare arms was prickled with gooseflesh hed gotten a taste of the power didnt feel a thing i said i tugged on the knife in the floor pulling at it gabriel ripped my jeans in both hands and they split down the middle leaving nothing between him and me but my panties and his leather pants i was at a bad angle for the knife and it was only halfway out when he slid his hand down my panties i screamed i screamed richard the power flowed over me with jeanclaude i had watched his burning blue eyes enter me with richard as focus there was nothing to see but smells the forest his skin jeanclaudes perfume i could taste them both in my mouth like drinking two strong wines one mouthful after another gabriels hand froze down the front of my body he was staring down at me what did you just do his voice was a whisper did you think raping me would be easy i laughed and it unnerved him i saw something close to fear in his storm grey eyes hed moved his hand not having him down my underwear was too big an improvement for words i never wanted him to touch me like that again never i had two choices i could bluff and hope i could run or i could reinitiate sex and kill him the second mark didnt give me that much more power in fact it gave the boys more pull on my power than the other way around so sex it was whats wrong raina asked out of camera range gabriels getting cold feet i said i raised up on my elbows the knife hed shoved in the floor held my hair pinned and i kept raising up tearing a hunk of my hair out it was a small pain but i knew it would appeal to gabriel it did i was sitting up with my legs on either side of his thighs he picked me up hands sliding over my undies cupping my buttocks he leaned back on his knees supporting my weight he watched me and i saw something slide through his eyes felt it tremble through his hands for the first time he thought i really might kill him and it turned him on fear was the rush he kissed the side of my face gently go for the last knife anita go for it he leaned into me while he said it biting gently down my face i felt the pressure of his fangs down my jawline onto my neck he set his teeth into the side of my neck bearing down hard and harder a slow building pressure his tongue licked across the skin i didnt go for the knife i ran my hands through his thick hair pulled it back from his face his teeth continued to press into my skin his hands slid inside my underwear cupping my bare buttocks i stiffened then forced myself to relax this would work it had to work i traced my fingers along his face his teeth bit in enough to draw the first faint blood i gasped and his claws dug into me i ran my fingers along either side of his face tracing his cheeks his eyebrows he came up for air eyes wide and unfocused lips halfparted i caressed his face and pulled him in for a kiss i traced his thick eyebrows as he kissed me he closed his eyes and i put my thumbs over his eyelids his eyelashes fluttered against my skin i shoved my thumbs into both eyes digging trying to shove my thumbs into his brain and out the other side gabriel reared back shrieking his claws ripped up my back i gasped but didnt have time for screaming i drew the big knife from the back sheath raina screamed instead i shoved the blade under gabriels ribs i shoved it into his heart he tried to fall backwards but my weight pinned his knees so his back bowed backwards but he didnt fall i shoved the blade through him i felt the tip of it burst out the other side raina was suddenly there grabbing me by the hair flinging me off him i flew through the air smashed into the fake wall and kept going the wall splintered i lay on my stomach relearning how to breathe my pulse was so loud in my head i was deaf for a few seconds my body stopped being numb in stages and let me know it was scraped and bruised but nothing was broken it should have been two marks and i was suddenly anita the human battering ram when it happened the first time i hadnt appreciated it now i did i wasnt hurt badly hurrah but i still had to get past raina everybody else would fold and run for cover if she were dead question was how to get her there i looked up and realized i was right next to the prop table with my guns on it were they loaded if i went for them and they werent raina was going to kill me of course if i just lay here and bled shed kill me anyway i heard her high heels coming my way i pushed to my knees my feet and went for the table she still couldnt see me through the partial wall but she could hear me she rushed up her side of the wall in those ridiculous high heels i grabbed for the firestar and rolled over the table as i moved i ended on my back staring up as she leapt over the table i hit the safety with my thumb and pulled the trigger the gun exploded in my hand and took her in the upper stomach the bullet seemed to slow her in midmotion and i had time for another shot higher up in the chest raina collapsed to her knees honey brown eyes wide with shock she reached out one hand and i scooted backwards still on my butt and lower back i watched her eyes go that light sliding away she slumped over on her side her long hair spilling like auburn water across the floor the crew had hightailed it only heidi was crouched by the wall crying covering her ears as if afraid to leave or stay i got to my feet using the prop table for support i could see gabriels body now blood and clear fluid flowed down his face from his eyes his body still hadnt fallen it knelt in a strange parody of life as if he would open his eyes and it would all be pretend edward came in through the covered door he had a shotgun at his shoulder harley followed at his side with a machine gun he surveyed the room and finally came back to me is anita in this room yes edward said i cant recognize her harley said hold your fire ill go find her for you he walked towards me eyes taking it all in how much of this blood is yours he asked i shook my head howd you find me i tried to return your message nobody knew where youd gone then nobody knew where richard had gone or jeanclaude or raina i felt richard scream through me and i didnt fight it this time i let the scream come out my mouth if edward hadnt caught me i would have fallen weve got to get to jeanclaude and richard right now you cant even walk he said i grabbed his shoulders help me and ill run edward didnt argue he simply nodded and slid one arm around my waist harley handed my knives and the browning to edward i was inches away but he didnt try to touch me he looked past me as if i wasnt there maybe for him i wasnt i cut the legs of my jeans off which left me in nothing but underwear and nikes from the waist down but i could run now and we needed to run i could feel it i could feel the power growing on the summer night dominic was preparing the blade i could taste it i prayed as we ran prayed that wed be in time we ran i ran until i thought my heart would burst jumping trees and dodging things in the dark only halffelt and not seen at all branches and weeds raked my legs in thin scratches a branch caught my cheek and sent me stumbling edward caught me harley said what is that there was a bright white glow through the trees it wasnt fire crosses i said what harley asked theyve hung jeanclaude with crosses as the words left my mouth i knew they were the truth i ran towards the glow edward and harley followed i spilled out to the edge of the clearing with them at my back i raised the browning without thinking about it i had a second to take it all in richard and jeanclaude were bound so thick with chains that they could barely move let alone escape a cross had been thrown around jeanclaudes neck it glowed like a captive star resting on the folds of chain someone had blindfolded him as if afraid the glow would hurt his eyes which was odd since they meant to kill him considerate murderers richard was gagged hed managed to work one hand free and he and jeanclaude were touching fingertips straining to retain that touch dominic stood over them in a white ceremonial robe the hood was thrown back his arms wide holding a short sword half the length of my body he held something dark in his other hand something that pulsed and seemed to live it was a heart robert the vampires heart sabin sat in marcuss stone chair dressed as id seen him last hood up hiding in the shadows cassandra was a shining whiteness on the other side of the circle of power forming the last point of a triangle with her two men my two men lay bound on the ground i pointed the browning at dominic and fired the bullet left the gun i heard it i saw it but it didnt go near dominic it didnt seem to go anywhere i blew my breath out and tried again dominic stared at me his darkbearded face was calm totally unafraid you are of the dead anita blake neither you nor anything of yours may pass this circle you have come only to watch them die youve lost dominic why kill them at all now we will never find what we need again the necromancer said sabin spoke his voice thick awkward as if talking was hard it must be tonight he pushed to his feet and shoved the hood back his flesh was almost completely gone only straggles of hair and raw putrefying tissue were left dark liquid oozed from his mouth maybe he didnt have one more night of sanity but that wasnt my problem the vampire council has forbidden any of you to fight each other until brewsters law is either passed or voted down theyll kill you for disobeying them i was half guessing on this but id been around enough masters of the city to know how very seriously they took disobedience the council was in fact the biggest baddest master of the city around they would be less forgiving not more i will take that chance sabin said every word careful showing the effort it took to speak did cassandra tell you about my offer if we cant cure you tomorrow ill let jeanclaude mark me tonight you only have part of what you need for the spell you need me sabin one way or another you need me i didnt tell them i was already marked they obviously hadnt felt it if they knew i was already marked all i could offer was to die tonight with the boys dominic shook his head i have searched sabins body anita tomorrow will be too late there will be nothing to save he dropped to his knees beside richard you dont know that for sure i said he laid the stillbeating heart on top of richards bare chest dominic please it was too late for lies im marked dominic were the perfect sacrifice open the circle and ill come inside he looked at me if this is true then you are all far too dangerous to trust the three of you together without the circle would overwhelm us you see anita i have been part of a true triumvirate for centuries you have no dreams of the power you can touch you and richard are more powerful than cassandra and i you would have been a force to be reckoned with the council itself might have feared you he laughed they may forgive us for that alone he spoke words that curled power over me i walked to the edge of the circle and touched it it was like my skin tried to crawl off my bones i fell forward and slid down something that couldnt be there jeanclaude shrieked it hurt too much for me to scream i lay curled by the circle and even when i breathed i could taste death old rotting death in my mouth edward knelt by me what is it without your other parts you do not have the power to force this circle anita dominic got to his feet raising the sword twohanded for a downward blow dolph had passed the circle earlier in the room where they had taken roberts heart i grabbed edwards shirt you pass the circle now and kill that son of a bitch if you cant how can i youre not magic thats how it was one of those rare moments when you understand how great trust can be edward knew nothing about the ceremony yet he didnt argue he accepted what i said and simply did it i wasnt a hundred percent sure it would work myself but it had to dominic brought the sword down i screamed edward crossed the circle like it wasnt there the sword bit into richards chest pinning the beating heart to his body the pain of the blade drove me to my knees i felt it enter richards body then i felt nothing like a switch had been turned off edwards shotgun blast took dominic in the chest dominic didnt fall he stared at the hole in his chest and then at edward he pulled the sword out of richards chest and slid the stillbeating heart off it he faced edward with the sword in one hand and the heart in the other edward fired again and cassandra leapt on his back harley crossed the circle then he grabbed cassandra around the waist and pulled her off of edward they fell rolling to the ground a gun sounded and cassandras body jerked but her dainty fist came up and smashed downward edward fired the shotgun until dominics face vanished in a spray of blood and bones and he fell slowly to his knees his outstretched hand spilled the heart onto the ground beside richards terribly still body sabin levitated upward i will have your soul for that mortal i ran my fingers over the circle and it was still there edward started to turn the shotgun towards the vampire the naked heart pulsed and shimmered in the crosss glare the heart shoot the heart edward didnt hesitate he turned and shot the heart exploding it into so much meat sabin hit him a second later and he went flying he ended up very still on the ground with sabin on top of him i pushed my hand forward it met empty air i fired twohanded at sabin as i walked towards him i put three shots into his chest forcing him to his feet back from edward sabin raised a hand in front of his skeletal face almost a pleading gesture i stared down the barrel of the gun into his one good eye and pulled the trigger the bullet took him just above the crumbling remains of his nose it made a nice big exit wound like it was supposed to spattering blood and brains on the grass sabin collapsed backwards onto the grass i fired two more shots into his skull until it looked like id decapitated him edward it was harley he was standing over cassandras very still very dead body his eyes searched wildly for the one person he recognized harley its me its anita he shook his head as if i was a buzzing fly edward i still see monsters edward he raised the machine gun at me and i knew i couldnt let him fire no it was more than that or less i raised the browning and fired before id had time to think the first shot sent him to his knees edward he squeezed off a round of fire that went inches above the mens heads i fired another into his chest and put one through his head before he fell i approached him gun at the ready if hed twitched id have shot him again he didnt twitch i knew nothing about harley except he was genuinely crazy and very good with weapons now id never know because edward didnt volunteer information i kicked the machine gun out of harleys dead hand and went for the others edward was sitting up rubbing the back of his head he watched me walk away from harleys body did you do it i faced him yes ive killed people for less so have i i said but if were going to fight can we unchain the boys first i dont feel richard anymore i couldnt say the word dead out loud not yet edward got to his feet a little shaky but standing well fight later later i said edward went to sit by his friend i went to sit by my lover and my other boyfriend i holstered the browning slipped the cross off jeanclaudes neck and threw it spinning into the woods the darkness was suddenly velvet and intense i bent to undo his chains and one of the links went spinning by my head shit i said jeanclaude sat up sweeping the chains down his body like a sheet he slipped off the blindfold last i was already crawling to richard id seen the sword pierce his heart he had to be dead but i searched for the big pulse in his neck and i found it it beat against my hand like a weak thought and i slumped forward with relief he was alive thank you god jeanclaude knelt on the other side of richards body i thought you could not bear his touch that is what he told me before they gagged him they were afraid he would call his pack to aid him i have already called jason and my vampires they will be here soon why cant i feel him in my head i am blocking it it is a fearful wound and i am better practiced at dealing with such things i pulled the gag from richards mouth i touched his lips gently the thought of how id refused to kiss him earlier that day bit at me hes dying isnt he jeanclaude broke richards chains more carefully than his own i helped him clear them from richards limp body richard lay on the ground in the bloodstained white tshirt id last seen him in he was just suddenly richard again i couldnt imagine the beast id seen i suddenly didnt care i cant lose him not like this richard is dying ma petite i feel his life slipping away i stared up at him youre still keeping me from feeling it arent you i am protecting you there was a look on his face that i didnt like i touched his arm his skin was cool to the touch why he turned away i jerked him hard forced him to look at me why even with only two marks richard can try and drain us both to stay alive i am preventing that youre protecting us both i asked when he dies i can protect one of us ma petite but not both i stared at him youre saying that when he dies youre both going to die i fear so i shook my head no not both of you not all at once dammit youre not supposed to be able to die i am sorry ma petite no we can share power just like we did to raise the zombies the vampires like we did tonight jeanclaude slumped suddenly downward one hand on richards body i will not drag you to the grave with me ma petite i would rather think of you alive and well i dug my fingers into jeanclaudes arm i touched richards chest a shuddering breath ran up my arm from him ill be alive but i wont be well id rather die than lose you both he stared at me for a long second you do not know what you are asking we are a triumvirate now we can do this jeanclaude we can do this but you have to show me how we are powerful beyond my wildest dreams ma petite but even we cannot cheat death he owes me one jeanclaude flinched as if in pain who owes you death ma petite do it jeanclaude do it whatever it is whatever it takes do it please he slumped on top of richard head barely raised the third mark it will either bind us forever or kill us all i offered him my wrist no ma petite if it is to be our only time come to me he lay half on richards body arms open for me i lay in the circle of his arms and realized when i touched his chest there was no heartbeat i turned and stared into his face from inches away dont leave me his midnight blue eyes filled with fire he swept my hair to one side and said open for me ma petite open for us both i did sweeping my mind open dropping every guard id ever had i fell forward impossibly forward down a long black tunnel towards a burning blue fire pain cut the darkness like a white knife and i heard myself gasp i felt jeanclaudes fangs sink into me his mouth sealing over my flesh sucking me drinking me a wind swept through the falling darkness catching me like a net before i touched that blue fire the wind smelled of growing earth and the musty scent of fur i felt something else sorrow richards sorrow his mourning not of his death but of my loss dead or alive hed lost me and among his many faults was a loyalty that went beyond reason once in love he was a man to stay there regardless of what the woman did a knight errant in every sense of the word he was a fool and i loved him for it jeanclaude i loved in spite of himself richard i loved because of who he was i wouldnt lose him i wrapped his essence like winding myself in a sheet except that i had no body i held him in my mind my body and let him feel the love my sorrow regret jeanclaude was there too i halfexpected him to protest to sabotage it but he didnt that blue fire spilled upward through the tunnel to meet us and the world exploded into shapes and images that were too confusing bits and pieces of memory sensations thoughts like three separate jigsaw puzzles shaken and tossed into the air and every piece that touched formed a picture i padded through the forest on four feet the smells alone were intoxicating i sank fangs into a dainty wrist and it wasnt mine i watched the pulse underneath a womans neck and thought of blood warm flesh and faroff and distant sex the memories came fast then faster flowing like some sort of carnival ride blackness gained on the images like ink filling water when the darkness ate everything i floated for an impossible second then went out like a candle flame nothing i didnt even have time to be scared i woke in a pastel pink hospital room a nurse in a matching pink smock smiled down at me fear pumped like fine champagne where was richard where was jeanclaude what i finally managed to ask was how did i get here your friend brought you she motioned with her head edward sat in a chair by the far wall leafing through a magazine he looked up and our eyes met his face gave away nothing edward my friends call me ted anita you know that he had that good of boy smile that could only mean he was pretending to be ted forrester it was his only legal identity that id ever met even the cops thought he was this ted person nurse can we have a few minutes alone the nurse smiled looked curiously from one to the other of us and left still smiling i tried to grab edwards hand and found my left hand was taped to a board and stuck with an iv i grabbed at him with my right hand and he held it are they alive he smiled a mere twitch of lips yes a relief like id never known flowed through my body i collapsed back against the bed weak what happened you came in suffering from lycanthrope scratches and a very nasty vampire bite he almost drained you dry anita maybe thats what it took to save us maybe edward said he sat on the edge of the bed his jacket gaped enough to flash his shoulder holster and gun he caught me looking the police agree that the monsters might hold a grudge theres even a cop outside your door we werent holding hands now he stared down at me and something very cold passed over his face did you have to kill harley i started to say yes but i stopped myself i replayed it in my mind finally i looked up at him i dont know edward when you were knocked out he couldnt see you anymore i tried to talk to him but he couldnt hear me he started to raise the machine gun i met edwards empty blue eyes i shot him you saw the body i even put one through his head a coupe de grace i know his face his voice gave nothing away it was like watching a mannequin talk except that this mannequin was armed and i wasnt it never occurred to me not to shoot edward i didnt even hesitate edward took a deep breath through his nose and let it out through his mouth i knew thats what had happened if youd lied to me id have killed you he walked away to stand at the foot of the bed while im unarmed i tried to make light of it but it didnt work check your pillow i slid my hand under and came up with the firestar i held it in my lap laying it on my sheetcovered legs what now you owe me a life i looked up at that i saved your life last night our lives dont count wed back each other up no matter what i dont know what youre talking about then occasionally ill need help like harley next time i need help ill call you i wanted to argue because i wasnt entirely sure what mess edward would drag me into but i didnt looking into his empty eyes holding the gun hed put under my pillow i knew hed do it if i refused his bargain his trade as it were hed pull down on me and wed find out once and for all who was better i stared down at the gun in my hands ive already got the gun out all i have to do is point youre injured you need the edge his hand hovered near the butt of his gun i laid the gun on the sheets beside me and looked at him i lay back on the pillows i dont want to do this edward then when i call youll come i thought about it for another brief second then said yeah ill come he smiled his ted good ol boy forrester smile ill never find out how good you really are until you draw down on me we can live with that i said by the way why the invitation to come monster hunting now and dont tell me its about harley you killed him anita you killed him without thinking about it even now theres no regret in you no doubt he was right i didnt feel bad about it scary but true so you invited me to come play because im now as much of a sociopath as you are oh im a much better sociopath he said id never let a vampire sink his fangs into my neck and i wouldnt date the terminally furry do you date anyone ever he just smiled that irritating smile that meant he wasnt going to answer but he did even death has needs edward dating that was something i had to see i got out of the hospital with no permanent scars that was a switch richard had touched the wounds gabriel gave me his face very serious no one had to say it out loud in a month wed know the doctors offered to put me in one of the shapeshifter halfway houses read prisons for the firsttime furry it has to be voluntary but once you sign yourself in its almost impossible to sign yourself out i told them id take care of it myself they scolded me and i told them to go to hell i spent the night of my first full moon with richard and the pack waiting to see if i was going to join the killing dance i didnt either id gotten incredibly lucky or just as a vampire cant catch lycanthropy neither could i richard wouldnt have much to do with me after that i cant blame him i still love him i think he still loves me i love jeanclaude too but its not the same kind of love i cant explain it but i miss richard for brief moments in jeanclaudes arms i forget but i miss richard the fact that we are both bound to jeanclaude doesnt help richard has accidentally invaded my dreams twice having him that close to me is too painful for words richard fought it but he finally agreed to let jeanclaude teach him enough control so that he doesnt leak all over both of us he talks to jeanclaude more than he talks to me the triumvirate is useless richard is too angry at me too full of selfloathing i dont know how hes doing with the pack hes forbidden anyone to speak of pack business with me but he hasnt chosen a new alpha female willie mccoy and the rest of the vampires i accidentally raised seem fine big relief there monicas baby is due in august her amnio came back clean no vlad syndrome she seems to think im her friend now im not but i help out sometimes jeanclaude is playing the good master and taking care of her and the baby monica keeps talking about me babysitting i hope shes kidding
