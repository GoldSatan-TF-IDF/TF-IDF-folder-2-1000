silence please arthur c clarke popular publications inc you come upon the white hart quite unexpectedly in one of these anonymous little lanes leading down from fleet street to the embankment its no use telling you where it is very few people who have set out in a determined effort to get there have ever actually arrived for the first dozen visits a guide is essential after that youll probably be all right if you close your eyes and rely on instinct alsoto be perfectly frankwe dont want any more customers at least on our night the place is already uncomfortably crowded all that ill say about its location is that it shakes occasionally with the vibration of newspaper presses and that if you crane out of the window of the gents room you can just see the thames from the outside it looks like any other pubas indeed it is for five days of the week the public and saloon bars are on the ground floor there are the usual vistas of brown oak paneling and frosted glass the bottles behind the bar the handles of the beer engines nothing out of the ordinary at all indeed the only concession to the twentieth century is the juke box in the public bar it was installed during the war in a laughable attempt to make gis feel at home and one of the first things we did was to make sure there was no danger of its ever working again at this point i had better explain who we are that is not as easy as i thought it was going to be when i started for a complete catalogue of the white harts clients would probably be impossible and would certainly be excruciatingly tedious so all ill say at this point is that we fall into three main classes first there are the journalists writers and editors the journalists of course gravitated here from fleet street those who couldnt make the grade fled elsewhere the tougher ones remained as for the writers most of them heard about us from other writers came here for copy and got trapped where there are writers of course there are sooner or later editors if drew our landlord got a percentage on the literary business done in his bar hed be a rich man one of our wits once remarked that it was a common sight to see half a dozen indignant authors arguing with a hard faced editor in one corner of the white hart while in another half a dozen indignant editors argued with a hardfaced author so much for the literary side you will have id better warn you ample opportunities for closeups later now let us glance briefly at the scientists how did they get in here well birkbeck college is only across the road and kings is just a few hundred yards along the strand thats doubtless part of the explanation and again personal recommendation had a lot to do with it also many of our scientists are writers and not a few of our writers are scientists confusing but we like it that way the third portion of our little microcosm consists of what may be loosely termed interested laymen they were attracted to the white hart by the general brouhaha and enjoyed the conversation and company so much that they now come along regularly every wednesdaywhich is the day when we all get together sometimes they cant stand the pace and fall by the wayside but theres always a fresh supply with such potent ingredients it is hardly surprising that wednesday at the white hart is seldom dull not only have some remarkable stories been told there but remarkable things have happened there for example there was the time when professor passing through on his way to harwell left behind a briefcase containingwell wed better not go into that even though we did so at the time and most interesting it was too any russian agents will find me in the corner under the dartboard i come high but easy terms can be arranged now that ive finally thought of the idea it seems astonishing to me that none of my colleagues has ever got round to writing up these stories is it a question of being so close to the wood that they cant see the trees or is it lack of incentive no the last explanation can hardly hold several of them are quite as hard up as i am and have complained with equal bitterness about drews no credit rule my only fear as i type these words on my old remington noiseless is that john christopher or george whitley or john beynon are already hard at work using up the best material such as for instance the story of the fenton silencer i dont know when it began one wednesday is much re another and its hard to tag dates on to them besides people may spend a couple of months lost in the white hart crowd before you first notice their existence that had probably happened to harry purvis because when first came aware of him he already knew the names of most of the people in our crowd which is more than i do these days now that i come to think of it but though i dont know when i know exactly how it all started bert huggins was the catalyst or to be more accurate his voice was berts voice would catalyse anything when he indulges in a confidential whisper it sounds like a sergeant major drilling an entire regiment and when he lets himself go conversation languishes elsewhere while we all wait for those cute little bones in the inner ear to resume their accustomed places he had just lost his temper with john christopher and the resulting detonation had disturbed the chess game in progress at the back of the saloon bar as usual the two players were surrounded by backseat drivers and we all looked up with a start as berts blast whammed overhead when the echoes died away someone said i wish there was a way of shutting him up it was then that harry purvis replied there is you know not recognizing the voice i looked round i saw a small neatly dressed man in the late thirties he was smoking one of those carved german pipes that always make me think of cuckoo clocks and the black forest that was the only unconventional thing about him otherwise he might have been a minor treasury official all dressed up to go to a meeting of the public accounts committee i beg your pardon i said he took no notice but made some delicate adjustments to his pipe it was then that i noticed that it wasnt as id thought at first glance an elaborate piece of wood carving it was something much more sophisticateda contraption of metal and plastic like a small chemical engineering plant there were even a couple of minute valves my god it was a chemical engineering plant i dont goggle any more easily than the next man but i made no attempt to hide my curiosity he gave me a superior smile all for the cause of science its an idea of the biophysics lab they want to find out exactly what there is in tobacco smoke hence these filters you know the old argumentdoes smoking cause cancer of the tongue and if so how the trouble is that it takes an awful lot oferdistillate to identify some of the obscurer byproducts so we have to do a lot of smoking doesnt it spoil the pleasure to have all this plumbing in the way i dont know you see im just a volunteer i dont smoke oh i said for the moment that seemed the only reply then i remembered how the conversation had started you were saying i continued with some feeling for there was still a slight tintinus in my left ear that there was some way of shutting up bert wed all like to hear itif that isnt mixing metaphors somewhat i was thinking he replied after a couple of experimental sucks and blows of the illfated fenton silencer a sad story yet i feel one with an interesting lesson for us all and one day who knowssomeone may perfect it and earn the blessings of the world suck bubble bubble plop well lets hear the story when did it happen he sighed im almost sorry i mentioned it still since you insistand of course on the understanding that it doesnt go beyond these walls erof course well rupert fenton was one of our lab assistants a very bright youngster with a good mechanical background but naturally not very well up in theory he was always making gadgets in his spare time usually the idea was good but as he was shaky on fundamentals the things hardly ever worked that didntseem to discourage him i think he fancied himself as a latterday edison and imagined he could make his fortune from the radio tubes and other oddments lying around the lab as his tinkering didnt interfere with his work noone objected indeed the physics demonstrators did their best to encourage him because after all there is something refreshing about any form of enthusiasm but noone expected hed ever get very far because i dont suppose he could even integrate e to the x as such ignorance possible gasped someone maybe i exaggerate lets say x e to the x anyway all his knowledge was entirely practicalrule of thumb you know give him a wiring diagram however complicated and he could make the apparatus for you but unless it was something really simple like a television set he wouldnt understand how it worked the trouble was he didnt realize his limitations and that as youll see was most unfortunate i think he must have got the idea while watching the honours physics students doing some experiments in acoustics i take it of course that you all understand the phenomenon of interference naturally i replied hey said one of the chessplayers who had given up trying to concentrate on the game i dont purvis looked at him as though seeing something that had no right to be around in a world that had invented penicillin in that case he said coldly i suppose i had better do some explaining he waved aside our indignant protests no i insist its precisely those who dont understand these things who need to be told about them if someone had only explained the theory to poor fenton while there was s still time he looked down at the now thoroughly abashed chessplayer i do not know he began if you have ever considered the nature of sound suffice to say that it consists of a series of waves moving through the air not however waves like those on the surface of the seaoh dear no those waves are up and down movements sound waves consist of alternate compressions and rarefactions rarewhat rarefactions dont you mean rarefications i do not i doubt if such a word exists and if it does it shouldnt retorted purvis with the aplomb of sir alan herbert dropping a particularly revolting neologism into his killingbottle where was i explaining sound of course when we make any sort of noise from the faintest whisper to that concussion that went past just now a series of pressure changes moves through the air have you ever watched shunting engines at work on a siding you see a perfect example of the same kind of thing theres a long line of goodswagons all coupled together one end gets a bang the first two trucks move togetherand then you can see the compression wave moving right along the line behind it the reverse thing happensthe rarefactioni repeat rarefactionas the trucks separate again things are simple enough when there is only one source of soundonly one set of waves but suppose you have two wave patterns moving in the same direction thats when interference arises and there are lots of pretty experiments in elementary physics to demonstrate it all we need worry about here is the factwhich i think you will all agree is perfectly obviousthat if one could get two sets of waves exactly out of step the total result would be precisely zero the compression pulse of one sound wave would be on top of the rarefaction of anothernet resultno change and hence no sound to go back to my analogy of the line of wagons its as if you gave the last truck a jerk and a push simultaneously nothing at all would happen doubtless some of you will already see what i am driving at and will appreciate the basic principle of the fenton silencer young fenton i imagine argued in this manner this world of ours lit said to himself is too full of noise there would be a fortune for anyone who could invent a really perfect silencer now what would that imply t it didnt take him long to work out the answer i told you he was a bright lad there was really very little in his pilot model it consisted of a microphone a special amplifier and a pair of loudspeakers any sound that happened to be about was picked up by the mike amplified and inverted so that it was exactly out of phase with the original noise then it was pumped out of the speakers the original wave and the new one cancelled out and the net result was silence of course there was rather more to it than that there had to be an arrangement to make sure that the canceling wave was just the right intensityotherwise you might be worse off than when you started but these are technical details that i wont bore you with as many of you will recognize its a simple application of negative feedback just a moment interrupted eric maine eric i should mention is an electronics expert and edits some television paper or other hes also written a radio play about spaceflight but thats another story just a moment theres something wrong here you couldnt get silence that way it would be impossible to arrange the phase purvis jammed the pipe back in his mouth for a moment there was an ominous bubbling and i thought of the first act of macbeth then he fixed eric with a glare are you suggesting he said frigidly that this story is untrue ahwell i wont go as far as that but erics voice trailed away as if he had been silenced himself he pulled an old envelope out of his pocket together with an assortment of resistors and condensers that seemed to have got entangled in his handkerchief and began to do some figuring that was the last we heard from him for some time as i was saying continued purvis calmly thats the way fentons silencer worked his first model wasnt very powerful and it couldnt deal with very high or very low notes the result was rather odd when it was switched on and someone tried to talk youd hear the two ends of the spectruma faint bats squeak and a kind of low rumble but he soon got over that by using a more linear circuit and in the later model he was able to produce complete silence over quite a large area not merely an ordinary room but a fullsized hall yes now fenton was not one of these secretive inventors who wont tell anyone what they are trying to do in case their ideas are stolen he was all too willing to talk he discussed his ideas with the staff and with the students whenever he could get anyone to listen it so happened that one of the first people to whom he demonstrated hisimproved silencer was a young arts student called i thinkkendall who was taking physics as a subsidiary subject kendall was much impressed by the silencer as well he might be but he was not thinking as you may have imagined about its commercial possibilities or the boon it would bring to the outraged ears of suffering humanity oh dear no he had quite other ideas please permit me a slight digression at college we have a flourishing musical society which in recent years has grown in numbers to such an extent that it can now tackle the less monumental symphonies in the year of which i speak it was embarking on a very ambitious enterprise it was going to produce a new opera a work by a talented young composer whose name it would not be fair to mention since it is now wellknown to you all let us call him edward england ive forgotten the title of the work but it was one of these stark dramas of tragic love which for some reason ive never been able to understand are supposed to be less ridiculous with a musical accompaniment than without no doubt a good deal depends on the music i can still remember reading the synopsis while waiting for the curtain to go up and to this day have never been able to decide whether the libretto was meant seriously or not lets seethe period was the late victorian era and the main characters were sarah stampe the passionate postmistress walter partridge the saturnine gamekeeper and the squires son whose name i forget its the old story of the eternal triangle complicated by the villagers resentment of changein this case the new telegraph system which the local crones predict will do things to the cows milk and cause trouble at lambing time ignoring the frills its the usual drama of operatic jealousy the squires son doesnt want to marry into the post office and the gamekeeper maddened by his rejection plots revenge the tragedy rises to its dreadful climax when poor sarah strangled with parcel tape is found hidden in a mailbag in the dead letter department the villagers hang partridge from the nearest telegraph pole much to the annoyance of the linesmen he was supposed to sing an aria while he was being hung that is one thing i regret missing the squires son takes to drink or the colonies or both and thats that im sure youre wondering where all this is leading please bear with me for a moment longer the fact is that while this synthetic jealousy was being rehearsed the real thing was going on back stage fentons friend kendall had been spurned by the young lady who was to play sarah stampe i dont think he was a particularly vindictive person but he saw an opportunity for a unique revenge let us be frank and admit that college life does breed a certain irresponsibilityand in identical circumstances how many of us would have rejected the same chance i see the dawning comprehension on your faces but we the audience had no suspicion when the overture started on that memorable day it was a most distinguished gathering everyone was there from the chancellor downwards deans and professors were two a penny i never did discover how so many people had been bullied into coming now that i come to think of it i cant remember what i was doing there myself the overture died away amid cheers and i must admit occasional catcalls from the more boisterous members of the audience perhaps i do them an injustice they may have been the more musical ones then the curtain went up the scene was the village square at doddering sloughleigh circa enter the heroine reading the postcards in the mornings mail she comes across a letter addressed to the young squire and promptly bursts into song sarahs opening aria wasnt quite as bad as the overture but it was grim enough luckily we were to hear only the first few bars precisely we need not worry about such details as how kendall had talked the ingenuous fenton into itif indeed the inventor realized the use to which his device was being applied all i need say is that it was a most convincing demonstration there was a sudden deadening blanket of silence and sarah stampe just faded out like a tv program when the sound is turned off everyone was frozen in their seats while the singers lips went on moving silently then she too realized what had happened her mouth opened in what would have been a piercing scream in any other circumstances and she fled into the wings amid a shower of postcards thereafter the chaos was unbelievable for a few minutes everyone must have thought they had lost the sense of hearing but soon they were able to tell from the behavior of their companions that they were not alone in their deprivation someone in the physics department must have realized the truth fairly promptly for soon little slips of paper were circulating among the vips in the front row the vicechancellor was rash enough to try and restore order by signlanguage waving frantically to the audience from the stage by this time i was too sick with laughter to appreciate such fine details there was nothing for it but to get out of the hall which we all did as quickly as we could i think kendall had fledhe was so overcome by the effect of the gadget that he didnt stop to switch it off he was afraid of staying around in case he was caught and lynched as for fentonalas we shall never know his side of the story we can only reconstruct the subsequent events from the evidence that was left as i picture it he must have waited until the hall was empty and then crept in to disconnect his apparatus we heard the explosion all over the college the explosion someone gasped of course i shudder to think what a narrow escape we all had another dozen decibels a few more phonesand it might have happened while the theatre was still packed regard it if you like as an example of the inscrutable workings of providence that only the inventor was caught in the explosion perhaps it was as went at least he perished in the moment of achievement and before the dean could get at him stop moralizing man what happened well i told you that fenton was very weak on theory if hed gone into the mathematics of the silencer hed have found his mistake the trouble is you see that one cant destroy energy not even when you cancel out one train of waves by another all that happens then is that the energy youve neutralized accumulates somewhere else its rather re sweeping up all the dirt in a room at the cost of an unsightly pile under the carpet when you look into the theory of the thing youll find that fentons gadget wasnt a silencer so much as a collector of sound all the time it was switched on it was really absorbing sound energy and at that concert it was certainly going flat out youll understand what i mean if youve ever looked at one of edward englands scores on top of that of course there was all the noise the audience was makingor i should say was trying to make during the resultant panic the total amount of energy must have been terrific and the poor silencer had to keep on sucking it up where did it go well i dont know the circuit detailsprobably into the condensers of the power pack by the time fenton started to tinker with it again it was like a loaded bomb the sound of his approaching footsteps was the last straw and the overloaded apparatus could stand no more it blew up for a moment noone said a word perhaps as a token of respect for the late mr fenton then eric maine who for the last ten minutes had been muttering in the corner over his calculations pushed his way through the ring of listeners he held a sheet of paper thrust aggressively in front of him hey he said i was right all the time the thing couldnt work the phase and amplitude relations purvis waved him away thats just what ive explained he said patiently you should have been listening too bad that fenton found out the hard way he glanced at his watch for some reason he now seemed in a hurry to leave my goodness times getting on one of these days remind me to tell you about the extraordinary thing we saw through the new proton microscope thats an even more remarkable story he was half way through the door before anyone else could challenge him then george whitley recovered his breath look here he said in a perplexed voice how is it that we never heard about this business purvis paused on the threshold his pipe now burbling briskly as it got into its stride once more he glanced back over his shoulder there was only one thing to do he replied we didnt want a scandalde mortuis nil nisi bonum you know besides in the circumstances dont you think it was highly appropriate toa hush the whole business up and a very good night to you all
