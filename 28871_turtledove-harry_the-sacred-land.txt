harry turtledove the sacred land h n turteltaub is a pen name of harry turtledove a note on weights measures and money i have as best i could used in this novel the weights measures and coinages my characters would have used and encountered in their journey here are some approximate equivalents precise values would have varied from city to city further complicating things digit inch digits palm palms cubit cubit feet plethron feet stadion feet khalkoi obolos oboloi drakhma drakhmai mina about pound of silver minai talent as noted these are all approximate as a measure of how widely they could vary the talent in athens was about pounds while that of aigina less than thirty miles away was about pounds something between drizzle and light rain pattered down out of the sky onto the city of rhodes every time a raindrop struck the flame of the torch sostratos was carrying the drop hissed out of existence hymen i—Ñ hymen sostratos called as he and his father led his sisters wedding procession through the streets toward the house of damonax son of polydoros erinnas new husband lysistratos waved his torch too hymen he called as sostratos called then in a lower voice he grumbled miserable weather for a wedding winters the most auspicious time sostratos said but its the rainy season too chance we take he was a tall gangling fellow in his midtwenties who unlike most men of his generation let his beard grow rather than shaving in imitation of alexander the great hed studied at the lykeion in athens and thought the beard lent him the appearance of a philosopher on a good day he was right relatives and friends capered in the procession there was his cousin menedemos only a few cubits away calling out to the god of marriage just as if he didnt enjoy adultery more menedemos was only a few months younger than sostratos the son of his fathers older brother philodemos sostratos was most of a head taller than his cousin but menedemos was handsomer and more graceful and people like him too sostratos thought with a mental sigh he knew he perplexed people himself he thought too much and felt too little he read herodotos and thoukydides and aspired to write history himself one day menedemos could quote long stretches of the iliad and odyssey and of aristophanes bawdy comedies sostratos sighed to himself again no wonder people like him he entertains them menedemos swaggering along with a wreath of ivy leaves and bright ribbons in his hair blew a kiss to a slave girl carrying a jar of water up the street she giggled and smiled back sostratos tried not to be jealous he didnt have much luck if hed done that odds were the girl would have laughed in his face may the marriage bring you grandchildren uncle menedemos told lysistratos i thank you sostratos father answered he gave menedemos more leeway than sostratos was in the habit of doing but then menedemos had been known to complain that his own father held sostratos up to him as an example of good behavior that made part of sostratosthe philosophical partproud it embarrassed the rest of him he looked back over his shoulder there was uncle philodemos not far from the ox cart that carried damonax and erinna like the rest of the men in the wedding procession menedemos father wore garlands in his hair and carried a torch somehow though he didnt look as if he was having a good time he seldom did no wonder he and menedemos have trouble getting along sostratos thought damonax dwelt in the southwestern pan of the city not far from the gymnasion since erinna after the death of her first husband had been living in her fathers house near the northern end of the city and the northernmost tip of the island of rhodes the parade went through most of the polis plenty of people had the chance to cheer and clap their hands and call lewd advice to the bride and groom knowing his sister sostratos was sure she blushed behind her veil with a final squeak from its ungreased axle the ox cart stopped in front of damonaxs home his mother should have received erinna into the household but she and his father were both dead so an aunt did the honors instead the men in the procession trooped into the courtyard his slaves had wine and olives and fried squid and barley cakes and honey waiting in the andron the mens chamber where the rain couldnt spoil them the wine was fine khian and mixed no weaker than onetoone with water people would get drunk in short order sostratos took a long pull at his cup the sweet wine slid down his throat and started fighting the chill of the day he wondered if the aphrodite or one of his familys other ships had brought it back to rhodes before long someone out in the courtyard called come on everybody theyre going into the bedchamber so soon someone else said would you wait on your wedding day a third man asked by the gods did you wait on your wedding day raucous laughter rose chewing on a tender little fried squid and carrying his winecup sostratos left the andron sure enough damonax had opened a door and was urging erinna through when she went inside her new groom turned back to the feasters and grinned and now my dears ill see you later he told them much later people laughed some more and cheered and clapped their hands damonax closed the door the bar thudded into place inside along with everyone else sostratos began to sing the epithalamion presently he heard the bedframe creaking through the words of the wedding song as was proper at such times he shouted obscene advice when he turned to go back to the andron for more wine he almost bumped into his father i hope shes happy he said lysistratos smile was wide and a little silly hed already drunk a good deal if shes not happy now when will she be he said sostratos dipped his head in agreement he certainly didnt want to spoil the day by speaking words of ill omen behind him somebody said will he show the bloody cloth no fool someone else answered its her second marriage so thatd be hard to do unless her first husband was no man at all inside the bedchamber the creaking grew louder and quicker then suddenly stopped a moment later damonax called thats one out through the door everyone whooped and applauded before too long the noise of lovemaking started again a couple of people made bets about how many rounds hed manage all the numbers they argued about struck sostratos as improbably high he looked around for menedemos to say as much of course his cousin was as likely as not to boast that such numbers were too low not too high and menedemos was as likely as anyone to make such a boast good but menedemos didnt seem to be in the courtyard sostratos wandered into the andron looking for him his cousin wasnt there either shrugging sostratos dipped out more wine and picked up another squid with the thumb and first two fingers of his right hand maybe that creaking bed had inspired menedemos to go looking for some fun of his own as menedemos made his way up rhodes grid of streets a ribbon on the garland he was wearing fell down in front of his face it tickled his nose and made his eyes cross and reminded him he still had the garland on his head he took it off and dropped it in a puddle his feet were muddy he didnt care like any sailor he went barefoot in all weather and never wore anything but a chiton an older man with a big thick wool himation wrapped around himself gave him an odd look as they passed each other on the street as if to say arent you freezing menedemos did feel the chill but not enough to do anything about it hed drunk enough wine at his cousins wedding feast to want to get rid of it and paused to piss against the blank whitewashed wall of a housefront then he hurried on daylight hours were short at this season of the year while those of the nighttime stretched like tar on a hot day he wouldnt have cared to be on the streets after sunset not without the torch hed carried in the wedding procession and not without some friends along too even in a peaceful orderly polis like rhodes footpads prowled under cover of darkness he hoped damonax would make a worthwhile addition to the family hed liked erinnas first husband well enough but the man had seemed old to him thats because i wasnt much more than a youth myself when she was wed then he realized in some surprise her first husband would have been about thirty the same age as damonax is now time did strange things half a dozen years had got behind him when he wasnt looking his fathers house and uncle lysistratos stood side by side not far from the temple to demeter at the north end of town when he knocked on the door one of the house slaves inside called who is it memenedemos the door opened almost at once did the feast break up so soon young master the slave asked in surprise we didnt expect you back for awhile yet that almost certainly meant the slaves had grabbed the chance to sit around on their backsides and do as little as they could nothing was what slaves did whenever they got the chance menedemos answered i decided to come home a little early thats all you sir from a feast sir the expression on the slaves face said everything that needed saying wheres your father sir hes still back there menedemos said the slave looked more astonished yet usually menedemos father was the one who came home early and he was the one who stayed out late he walked through the entry hall and into the courtyard angry shouts came from the kitchen menedemos sighed his stepmother and sikon the cook were wrangling again baukis who wanted to be a good household manager was convinced sikon spent too much the cook was equally convinced she wanted him to pass the rest of his life fixing nothing but barley porridge and salted fish baukis stalked out of the kitchen with a thoroughly grim expression on her face it crumbled into surprise when she saw menedemos oh hail she said and then as the slave had i didnt expect you home so soon hail he replied and shrugged when he looked at her he had trouble thinking of his fathers second wife as his stepmother baukis was ten or eleven years younger than he she wasnt a striking beauty but she had a very nice shape a much nicer one now than shed had when she came into the house a couple of years before at the age of fourteen menedemos went on i didnt feel like staying around so i came back by myself while it was still light all right baukis said do you have any idea when philodemos will be along menedemos tossed his head to show he didnt if i had to guess though id say he and uncle lysistratos and sostratos will all come home together with some linkbearers to light the way for them that sounds sensible baukis agreed i really do want to talk to him about sikon the insolence that fellow has youd think he owned this place instead of being a slave here she frowned so hard a vertical line appeared between her eyebrows the expression fascinated menedemos all her expressions fascinated him they were part of the same household so she didnt veil herself against his eyes as respectable women usually did around men watching her bare face was almost as exciting as seeing her naked he had to remind himself to pay attention to what she was saying too hed given his father plenty of reasons to quarrel with himand had also got plenty of reasons to quarrel with his father he didnt want to putadultery with his fathers wife on the list that might be a killing matter and he knew it very well most of him at any rate didnt want to put adultery with baukis on the list one part did that part stirred he sternly willed it back to quiescence he didnt want baukis noticing such stirrings under his tunic sikon has his pride he said talking about quarrels in the kitchen might help keep his mind off other things maybe you would have done better right from the start if youd asked him to be more careful what he spent than marching in there and giving him orders that puts his back up you know hes a slave baukis repeated when his masters wife tells him what to do hed better pay attention or hell be sorry in theory she was right in practice slaves with special skills and special talentsand sikon had bothwere almost as free to do as they pleased as were citizens if baukis didnt know that shed lived a sheltered life before she was married or maybe her parents were among the folk who treated slaves like beasts of burden that happened to be able to talk there were some he said sikons been here a long time were still prosperous and we eat as well as a lot of people who have more silver baukis frown got deeper thats not the point the point is if i tell him to do it the way i want he should do it a philosophical discussionthats what this is menedemos realized imight as well be sostratos im having a philosophical discussion with my fathers wife when what i want to do is bend her forward and he tossed his head baukis glared thinking he disagreed with her in fact he did but at that moment hed been disagreeing with himself he said you ought to see you havent got anywhere by charging straight at him if you compromise maybe he will too maybe but philodemos wife didnt sound as if she believed it i think he just thinks im some fool of a girl trying to give him orders and he doesnt like that at all well too bad for him she might well have a point no hellene would have wanted to obey a womans commands sikon wasnt a hellene but he was a manand hellenes and barbarians agreed on some things ive talked with him before menedemos said would you like me to do it again with a little luck ill get him to see reason or if i cant do that maybe i can frighten him i havent had much luck with that but then im only a woman baukis said sourly after a moment though her face lit up with hope would you please try id be ever so grateful of course i will menedemos promised nobody wants to listen to quarrels all the time ill do the best i can maybe i can slip sikon silver on the side so well eat as well as always but baukis wont see the money coming out of the household accounts that might work thank you so much menedemos baukis exclaimed her eyes glowing she impulsively stepped forward and gave him a hug for a moment his arras tightened around her he held her just long enough for him to feel how sweet and ripe she wasand perhaps for her to feel him stirring to life then they sprang apart as if each found the other too hot to bear they werent alone in a prosperous household like philodemos no one could count on being alone slaves saw or might see everything that went on a brief friendly embrace could be innocent anything more menedemos tossed his head again baukis said do speak to him soon please was that all shed had in mind when she hugged him or was she too making sure the slaves would have nothing to tell philodemos menedemos could hardly ask he said i will and then deliberately turned away baukis footsteps went off toward the stairs that led up to the womens quarters her sandals clacked on the planks of the stairway menedemos didnt watch her go instead he walked off to the kitchen for what he knew would be one more futile talk with sikon good day my master sostratos said in aramaic he was a free hellene he would never have called any man master in greek but the tongue spoken in phoenicia and the nearby landsand in broad stretches of what had been the persian empire before alexanders great campaignswas far more flowery more formally polite good day to you himilkon the byblian replied in the same tongue the phoenician merchant had run a harborside warehouse in rhodes for as long as sostratos could remember silver was just beginning to streak his curly black beard gold hoops glittered in his ears he went on still in aramaic your accent is much better than it was when you started these lessons a few months ago you know many more words too your servant thanks you for your help sostratos said himilkons dark eyes sparkled as he nodded approval sostratos grinned hed recalled the formula correctly sailing season comes soon the phoenician said i know sostratos dipped his head he had as much trouble making himself nod as himilkon did with the hellenic gesture less than a month to go before the vernal equinox the last two words came out in greek he had no idea how to say them in aramaic himilkon didnt tell him either the merchants lessons were purely practical with a little luck sostratos would be able to make himself understood when the aphrodite got to phoenicia he had more doubts about whether he would be able to understand anyone else when he worried out loud himilkon laughed what do you say if you have trouble please speak slowly my master sostratos had learned that phrase early on good very good himilkon nodded again my people will want to take your money they will make sure you follow them so they can do it i believe that sostratos said in greek hed dealt with phoenician traders in a good many towns by the aegean sea they were singleminded in the pursuit of profit since he was too he had less trouble with them than some hellenes were wont to do sticking to greek he asked but what about the loudaioi oh them himilkons shrug was expressive in gutturally accented greek of his own he continued i still think youre daft to want anything to do with them why sostratos said the best balsam comes from engedi and you say engedi is in their land im sure i can get a better price from them than id get from phoenician middlemen youll likely pay less money himilkon admitted but youll have more aggravationi promise you that sostratos shrugged thats one of the things a merchant doesturns aggravation into silver i mean all right fair enough himilkon said ill remember that and remind myself of it when i run into a hellene whos particularly annoyingand there are plenty of them by the gods are there sostratos said and the phoenician nodded isnt that interesting sostratos thought we find barbarians annoying but who would have imagined they might feel the same about us truly custom is king of all herodotos had quoted pindaros to that effect himilkon said the gods keep you safe on your journey may the winds be good may the seas be calm and may the macedonian marshals not go to war anywhere too close to you and your ship may it be so sostratos agreed by all the signs antigonos has a pretty solid grip on phoenicia and its hinterland i dont think ptolemaios can hope to take it away from him no matter what they do to each other elsewhere along the shores of the inner sea that seems a good bet for your sake my master i hope you are right himilkon said falling back into aramaic whether the elephant tramples the lion or the lion pulls down the elephant the mouse who gets caught in their battle always loses shall we go on with the lesson or have you had enough may it please you my master i have had enough sostratos answered also in aramaic himilkon smiled and clapped his hands that is perfectpronunciation accent everything if i had another half a year to work with you i could turn you into a veritable man of byblos may a pestilence take me if i lie i thank you sostratos said knowing he meant it as a compliment the hellene tried to imagine himself a member of a folk that knew not philosophy what would i do how would i keep from going mad or would i see what i was missing a man blind from birth doesnt miss the beauty of a sunset he got to his feet and left the phoenicians ramshackle warehouse hyssaldomos himilkons karian slave stood just outside chewing on some brown bread hail o best one he said in greek hail sostratos answered he switched to aramaic do you understand this language hyssaldomos little bit the slave said also in aramaic himilkon use sometimes greek easier that probably meant greek was more like hyssaldomos native karian sostratos didnt know for certain though rhodes lay off the coast of karia and rhodians had been dealing with karians for centuries even so only a handful of karian words had entered the local greek dialect few rhodians spoke the tongue of their nearest barbarian neighbors and he wasnt one of them but more and more karians used greek these days either alongside their own language or instead of it now that alexander s conquered the persian empire the whole world will have to learn greek sostratos thought in a few generations wouldnt his language replace not only local tongues like karian and lykian but also more widely spoken ones like aramaic and persian he couldnt see why not the aphrodite lay drawn up on the beach perhaps a plethron from himilkons warehouse the merchant galleys planking would be good and dry when she put to sea till it got waterlogged again that would give her a better turn of speed a gull swooped down by the aphrodite and flew away with a mouse struggling in its beak one little pest that wont make it on to the ship sostratos thought as he walked toward the merchant galley he was a neat man and didnt like dealing with vermin at sea a couple of years before hed sailed with peafowl aboard the akatos theyd done a fine job of eating roaches and centipedes and scorpions and micebut theyd also proved that large pests aboard ship were worse than small ones sostratos laid a more or less affectionate hand on the aphrodite s flank thin lead sheets nailed to the timbers below the waterline helped shield the vessel from shipworms and kept barnacles and seaweed from fouling her bottom rhodian carpenters had been over the repairs theyd had done in kos the summer before after a collision with a round ship that came wallowing out of a rainstorm the workmen on kos had also been repairing ptolemaios naval vessels at the time so they should have known their business even so sostratos was glad the work met rhodians approval his own polis in his biased opinion held the best and boldest sailors among the hellenes these days one of the harborside loungersa fellow who would do a little work now and then when he needed a few oboloi for wine or perhaps for breadcame up to sostratos and said hail you sail aboard this one dont you ive been known to every now and again sostratos said dryly why oh nothing the other man replied i was just wondering what she might be carrying when she goes into the sea thats all she might be carrying almost anything shes taken everything from peafowl and lion skins and a gryphons skullsostratos heart still ached when he thought about losing the gryphons skull to pirates the summer before when he was on his way to show it off in athensto something as ordinary as sacks of wheat the lounger clucked reproachfully he tried again what will she have in her when she goes to sea this and that sostratos said his voice bland the lounger gave him an exasperated look his answering smile said as little as he had his father and uncles trading firm was far from the only one in the city of rhodes some of their rivals might have paid a drakhma or two to find out what theyd be up to this sailing season men who hung around the harbor could make their money without getting calluses on their hands they couldwith a little help from others sostratos had no intention of giving that kind of help this fellow if nothing else was persistent you know where youll be sailing he asked oh yes sostratos said the lounger waited sostratos said no more the other man took longer than he should have to realize he wasnt going to say any more muttering unpleasant ties under his breath he turned away i should have answered him in aramaic sostratos thought id have got rid of him quicker then he shrugged hed done what needed doing another man called out to him hail sostratos how are you hail khremes sostratos had known the carpenter for years and liked him he wouldnt have to play games with him as he had with the lounger im fine thanks how are you couldnt be better khremes told him your cousin hes a pretty clever chap isnt he menedemos im sure hed be the first to agree with you sostratos said a little more sharply than hed intended a goodnatured soul khremes missed the edge to sostratos voice he was also in the grip of enthusiasm that notion he had for the war galley made special to be a pirate hunterthat was wonderful he burbled a trihemioliaa ship that can fight like an ordinary trireme and stay up with a pirate crews hemiolia fabulous why didnt somebody think of it years ago sostratos had hated pirates with a clear cold loathing even before they attacked the aphrodite and stole the gryphons skull now now he wanted to see every sea robber ever born nailed to a cross and dying slowly and horribly if someone praised menedemos for coming up with a ship type that would make life harder for those whoresons he wouldnt complain he said when something matters to my cousin he goes after it as often as not menedemos ingenuity was aimed at other mens wives but he did hate pirates as much as sostratos said sostratos had never heard of an honest sailor who didnt hate them good for him said khremes who didnt have to worry about the results of some of menedemos escapades well yes said sostratos who did he went on were really going to start building trihemioliai are we the carpenter dipped his head we sure are the admirals spent all winter talking about ithe opened and closed his thumb against his four bunched fingers to simulate a gabbling mouthand now its really going to happen theyll make three to begin with and more if they turn out to be as good as everybody hopes may it be so sostratos said thinking of menedemos as someone whod done something important for rhodes didnt come easy more than a little bemusedly sostratos continued to tell you the truth i wouldnt mind putting to sea in one of those new trihemioliai instead of our akatos here were going east this year so well have to sail past the lykian coast and the lykians are pirates at sea and bandits on land isnt that the truth miserable barbarians khremes paused do you suppose you could use a trihemiolia for a merchant galley no sostratos answered without hesitation and tossed his head to emphasize the word however much id like to theres not a chance itd work why not the carpenter said youd be the fastest trader on the sea yes and also the most expensive sostratos pointed out the aphrodite sails with forty rowers plus enough extra men to handle the sail with all the rowing benches filled they all make at least a drakhma a day most of them make a drakhma and a half thats two minai of silver every three days in wages more or less but a trihemiolia would carry more than three times as many men to pull the oars thatd belet me see zeus thatd be about two minai every single day wed have to carry nothing but gold and rubies to have any chance of breaking even with expenses like that ah khremes dipped his head no doubt youre right best one i hadnt thought about costs only about the ship sostratos was toikharkhos aboard the aphrodite everything that had to do with the cargo fell to him he thought of costs first last and always but because he liked khremes he let him down easy well my dear fellow i wouldnt know where to begin when it comes to putting a ship together you begin at the beginningwhere else the carpenter said you make your shell of planks and you fasten them all together with mortises and tenons so the shells good and strong and then you nail some ribs to the inside for a little extra stiffness well everyone knows that much sostratos agreed but knowing just how to do itthats your mystery no mystery to it at all khremes insisted anybody who works around the harbor could make a proper job of it sostratos didnt want to argue with him as far as the carpenter could see the harbor was the whole world khremes never thought about tanners and potters and farmers for whom the shipwrights craft was altogether strangeand whose trades were as strange to him his friends were other carpenters or men who worked in related trades that all helped make him better at what he did but did nothing to prove his judgment on matters unrelated to shipbuilding was particularly keen of course he might not agree when you do sail off to phoenicia i expect youll slicker those barbarians right out of their sandals khremes said i hope so sostratos said and his opinion of the carpenters judgment improved remarkably menedemos was furious and made only the slightest effort to hide it olive oil he threw his hands in the air by the dog of egypt why are we taking olive oil to phoenicia they grow olives there too dont they yes sostratos sounded embarrassed which didnt happen very often were taking olive oil because dont tell me menedemos broke in let me guess were taking k because its what your new brotherinlaws family makes am i right or am i wrong youre right his cousin said unhappily damonax used erinnas dowry to get some of the crop out of hock and and now he expects us to sell the oil and make him a nice profit menedemos interrupted once more we might even do it if we were going to alexandria since they dont grow olives there but thats not where were going did you tell him as much of course i did sostratos said he doesnt understand how these things work thoughnot really anyhow hes no trading man andplague take it he is my new brotherinlaw so i cant just tell him to the crows with you the way i would with somebody who isnt part of the family so we have to do our best thats all id like to do my best to boot him right into the harbor menedemos growled but then reluctantly he subsided family ties he rolled his eyes my fathers disgusted too but he didnt tell damonax no either he has more trouble saying no to your brotherinlaw than he ever did to me ill tell you that the trouble his father had telling damonax no rankled like so many of the things his father did believe me it could have been worse sostratos said when damonax first came up with this scheme he wanted to load the aphrodite with oil to her gunwales not leave a digits worth of space for any other cargo he had the oil so why shouldnt we carry it why menedemos exclaimed ill tell you now sostratos cut him off my father and i have spent the past ten days arguing him down we wont be drowning in oil anyhow even if we do have trouble unloading it well carry other things we know we can sell cant go far wrong with good rhodian perfume well no menedemos said and we still have some of the silk from kos we got this past summer all sorts of strange things come out of the east but i think the phoenicians will have a hard time matching that i should say so sostratos dipped his head and who knows what well pick up along the way we didnt expect the gryphons skull last year or the lion skins or the tiger hide and we got real money for the hides menedemos said the skull hed twitted sostratos about it ever since he spotted it in the market square in kaunos ill bet the pirate who stole it from the aphrodite hasnt lived it down with his pals yet too bad his cousin growled i still say we could have got something for it in athens after all damonax tried to buy it for six minai right here in rhodes and if that doesnt prove he has no idea what to do with his money gods only know what would menedemos said oh go howl sostratos eyed menedemos are you as eager to set sail as you were a year ago you couldnt wait to get out of rhodes then i wont be sorry to see it drop below the horizon this sailing season either menedemos allowed he had tried to make that less obvious this past winter evidently hed succeeded his cousin frowned and scratched his head i never did understand why youve got no outraged husbands sniffing after you here or none i know of anyway he studied menedemos as if menedemos were the same sort of interesting specimen as the gryphons skull sostratos had an itch to know and he wouldnt be satisfied till he scratched it all menedemos said was no no outraged husbands here what is it then sostratos picked at what puzzled him as if it were a scab my arent we nosy today menedemos murmured and his cousin turned red menedemos brought the conversation back to the cargo the aphrodite would be carrying that was important to sostratos too so he turned most of his formidable intelligence on the question most but not allmenedemos could see him casting about for a chance to start probing again well my dear im not going to give you one menedemos thought talk about outraged husbandswhat would happen if i outraged my own father with my stepmother i dont want to find out and so i wont find out but oh by the gods i fear she might want to go to bed with me too what would philodemos do no menedemos didnt want to find out his father had never stopped mocking him hounding him for his love affairs if the older man were to discover himself the butt of one sure enough it might not stop at words menedemos feared it wouldnt it was all too likely to end in blood and so i wont sleep with baukis no matter how much i want toand no matter how much she might want me to and o cousin of mine i dont care how curious you are either some secrets are going to stay secret thats all can we get more papyrus before we set sail sostratos asked papyrus menedemos echoed in some surprise im sure we can the egyptian grain ships that put in here often carry the stuff but why should we bother phoenicias a lot closer to egypt than we are his cousin didnt say you thickskull or anything of the sort but the look he got made him wish sostratos had come right out and called him an idiot it wasnt that sostratos was right so often though he was in fact that made him very useful but when he stared at you with pity in his eyes because you were too stupid to see what was obvious to him ihavent wrung his neck yet menedemos thought i dont know why i havent but i havent ptolemaios and antigonos are at war again sostratos said ships from egypt wont be going up to the phoenician ports these days not when antigonos is holding those ports if we can bring papyrus there it ought to fetch a good price and he was right again menedemos couldnt have denied it if he tried all right fine he said well get some papyrus then might as well get some ink to take with it weve done pretty well with ink before ill see to it sostratos said im not sure what the market will be though its not like papyrus the phoenicians know how to make their own ink theyre clever about such things they copy everything their neighbors do menedemos said with more than a little scorn they dont do anything of their own himilkon wouldnt care to hear you say such things sostratos remarked so what menedemos said are you telling me im wrong sostratos tossed his head no from what ive seen id say youre right but that doesnt mean himilkon would menedemos laughed anyone hearing you would guess youve studied under the philosophers no one who hasnt could split hairs so fine thank you so much my dear sostratos said and menedemos laughed again his cousin went on when do you plan on sailing if it were up to meand if we had all our cargo aboardwe could leave tomorrow menedemos answered i dont think my father will let me take the aphrodite out quite so early though he sniffed he went out right at the start of the sailing season when he was a captainive heard him talk about it but he doesnt think i can do the same our grandfather probably complained that he was a reckless brat sostratos said i suppose so menedemos grinned he liked the idea of his father as a young man having to take orders instead of arrogantly snapping them out i suppose its been like that since the beginning of time sostratos said well be proper tyrants ourselves too when our beards go gray i wont have a gray beard menedemos rubbed his shaven chin and you accused me of splitting hairsyou do it literally sostratos said menedemos groaned sostratos continued more seriously i wonder how youd find out about something like that what if old men were always the same menedemos said i can tell you howlook at nestor in the iliad he paused for a moment then recited from the epic he thinking well of them spoke and addressed them come nowgreat mourning has reached akhaian land priamos and the sons of priamos and the other trojans would be delighted and would rejoice in spirit if they learned of all this quarreling that you best of the danaoi in council were fighting but hearkenyou are both younger than i for i kept company with better men than you and never did they think little of me i dont see such men as i saw then such as perithoos and dryas shepherd of the people and kaineus and exadios and godlike polyphemos and theseus son of aigeus like the immortals his cousin laughed and held up a hand all right all rightyouve persuaded me old men are old men and they always have been a good thing you stopped me menedemos said nestor goes on blathering for a lot longer hes a dear fellow if he doesnt make you want to kick him most of the time with me he does and why is that sostratos asked menedemos didnt answer but they both knew why menedemos father put him in mind of nestor sostratos said if you and uncle philodemos got on better youd like nestor more maybe menedemos didnt want to admit more than he had to so he tried a thrust of his own if you and uncle lysistratos didnt get on youd like nestor less oh i think nestor blathers toodont get me wrong about that sostratos started to say something else probably something that had to do with the iliad but then stopped and snapped his fingers by the gods i know what else we can take to phoenicia books books menedemos echoed and sostratos dipped his head menedemos tossed his are you witstruck all of a sudden most phoenicians dont even speak greek let alone read it i wasnt thinking about the phoenicians his cousin answered i was thinking about the garrisons of hellenes in those towns they ought to be goodsized antigonos builds most of his fleet along the coast there and they wont be able to buy books from any of the local scribes because youre rightthose scribes dont write greek the ones who can read would probably pay plenty for some new scrolls to help them pass the time menedemos rubbed his chin as he considered do you know that might not be a bad notion after all he said at last then he gave sostratos a suspicious look you werent going to take along philosophy and history were you no no no now sostratos tossed his head i like such things but how many soldiers are likely to no i was thinking of some of the more exciting books from the iliad and the odyssey anyone who has his alphabeta can read those so wed have more people wanting to buy its a nice notion its a clever notion by zeus menedemos gave credit where it was due and books are light and they dont take up much space and we can get a good price for them he dipped his headin fact he almost bowed to sostratos well do it go talk to the scribes buy what theyve got written out and see how much they can copy before we sail ill take care of it sostratos said menedemos laughed ill bet you will if i sounded that eager id be going off to visit a fancy hetaira not some nearsighted fellow with ink stains on his fingers his cousin didnt even splutter which proved his point im always glad for an excuse to visit the scribes sostratos said you never can tell when something new and interesting will have come into rhodes happy hunting menedemos said he wondered if sostratos even heard him his cousins eyes were far away as if he were thinking about his beloved even a polis as large and prosperous as rhodes boasted no more than a handful of men who made their living by copying out books sostratos knew them all the best without a doubt was glaukias son of kallimedon he was fast accurate and legible all at the same time none of the others came close naturally sostratos visited him first however good glaukias was he wasnt rich his shop occupied a couple of downstairs rooms in a small house on a street near the great harbor he and his family lived above them the shop did face south which gave glaukias the best light for copying a skinny angrylooking man was dictating a letter to him when sostratos came up to the shop the fellow sent him such a suspicious glare he hastily withdrew out of earshot only after the man paid glaukias and went on his way did sostratos approach again hail best one glaukias said he was about forty with big ears buck teeth and sure enough a nearsighted stare and inky fingers thanks for withdrawing there he went on theokles the fellow who was here is certain a samian merchant is cheating him and that the samian has hired people here in rhodes to keep an eye on him and make sure he doesnt get whats his by right by the dog of egypt sostratos exclaimed is that true glaukias rolled his eyes last year he got into the same sort of mess with a trader from ephesos and the year before that with somebody from halikarnassos i think it was halikarnassos he quarrels with people the way some men go to a cockfight if he had his letters he wouldnt have anything to do with mehalf the time he thinks im part of these schemes to defraud him he sounds daft to me why do you keep writing letters for him why glaukias smiled a sweet sad smile ill tell you why he pays me and i need the silver speaking of which what can i do for you sostratos explained his idea finishing so ill gladly buy whatever copies youve made of the quarrel of akhilleus and agamemnon or of akhilleus fight with shining hektor or of odysseus adventure with the cyclops or of his return and his revenge on the suitorsthat sort of thing i see glaukias said you want all the high points from the epics thats right sostratos said people dont have to buy booksi want the parts that would make them spend their money on homer when they could be buying khian wine or a night with a courtesan instead people dont have to buy books the scribe echoed mournfully well the gods know ive seen the truth of that but youre right when they do buy thats usually the sort of thing theyre after and so when i dont have someones order in front of me i copy out books like that from the epics lets see what ive got he disappeared into a back room returning a little later with ten or twelve rolls of papyrus oh very good sostratos exclaimed thats more than id hoped for i do stay busy glaukias said id better stay busy if im not busy im starving personally i wish i didnt have so many rolls to sell you that would mean other people had bought em what all have we got here sostratos asked the high spots as you said the scribe answered most are the ones you talked about but i also made a couple of copies of the nexttolast book of the iliad you know patroklos funeral games oh yes thats a good one too sostratos unrolled one of the books and eyed the writing in admiration i wish i could be so neat with a pen your script looks as though it ought to be carved in marble not set down on papyrus believe me its only because i have so much practice but glaukias couldnt help sounding pleased ill buy them all sostratos said the scribes face broke into a delighted grin sostratos went on ill buy them all if your price is anywhere near reasonable that is well best one you know what these things cost glaukias answered if you were just walking in off the street to buy one book id try to get eight or ten drakhmai out of you people like that a lot of the time they dont have any notion of whats what and you want to make a little extra but ill sell you these for five drakhmai eachsix for the two copies of those funeral games because thats an especially long book and takes more time and more papyrus youve got a bargain my friend sostratos did indeed know what books were supposed to cost he laughed i dont remember the last time i made a deal without haggling its been a while for me too glaukias sounded almost giddy what sostratos paid him would keep him and his family eating for a couple of months sostratos wondered how long it had been since anyone last bought a book from him and how desperate he was getting when glaukias went into the back room again returning with a couple of cups of wine to celebrate sostratos suspected he wasnt getting desperate but had got there some little while ago the wine was just this side of undrinkable the cheapest he could buy sostratos thought aloud he said im always glad to bring you business glaukias without the people who make hooks what would we be nothing but savages thats what thank you so much the scribes voice was thick with unshed tears muttering he ran the back of his hand across his eyes thats a plain fact you know but does anybody think about it not likely no what i get is youve got your nerve asking so much to write things if i starve if people like me starve where do books come from they dont grow on trees you know of course not sostratos said glaukias talked right through him maybe that was the wine maybe sostratos remark had struck a chord either way sostratos was glad to escape his shop but that didnt mean he was done with scribes nikandros son of nikon had a place of business only a few blocks away from glaukias sostratos didnt like his work as well as the other scribes he wrote quickly he could copy out a book faster than glaukias could with his speed though came sloppy handwriting and more mistakes than glaukias would have made sostratos didnt like nikandros himself as well as he liked glaukias either nikandros had a face like a ferrets a whining voice and an exaggerated sense of his own worth i couldnt possibly part with a book for less than nine drakhmai he said farewell sostratos turned to go if you come to your senses before we sail send a messenger to the aphrodite he wondered if nikandros would call him back hed almost decided the scribe wouldnt when nikandros did say wait after all after some considerable hagglingnikandros did not offer him winehe got the books for the same price hed paid glaukias this shouldnt have taken so long he grumbled we both know what these are worth what i know is youre flaying me nikandros was not however too badly wounded to scoop up the silver coins and put them in his cash box im not paying you any less than i paid glaukias sostratos said but to the crows with me if i can see why i ought to pay you more oh glaukias nikandros sniffed i see im paying the price because hes not a better bargainer thats fair it certainly is your ordinary book is five drakhmai in athens sostratos said you know that as well as i do o marvelous one why should it be any different here in rhodes and the athenian scribes are just as scrawny and starving as glaukias is nikandros said i want something better for myself i deserve more customers i want all sorts of things just because i want them doesnt mean im going to get them or even that i should have them sostratos said nikandros sniffed again good day he said coldly now that the bargaining was done he had trouble even staying polite how will you get those customers you think you deserve when you do your best to drive people away polykles son of apollonios also copied books for a living but when sostratos went to his shop he found it closed the carpenter next door looked up from a stool to which he was adding a leg if you want him he told sostratos youll find him in the tavern down the street oh sostratos said the word seemed to hang in the air will he be worth anything when i do find him never can tell the carpenter answered and picked up a small file the tavern smelled of stale wine and of the hot grease in which the proprietor would fry snacks customers bought elsewhere the mug in front of polykles was almost as deep as the sea the scribea pale man with a withered left arm that probably made him unfit for any more strenuous tradelooked up so blearily sostratos was sure hed already emptied it several times too hail sostratos said hail tyou too polykles voice was thick and blurry sostratos could hardly understand him the scribe blinked trying to focus i sheen you shomewheresh before havent i he gulped from that formidable mug yes sostratos said without much hope he gave his name polykles dipped his head and almost fell over as he straightened up he said oh yesh i know you youre that trader fellowone of thoshe trader fellowsh watcha want books sostratos answered exciting books from the iliad and the odyssey have you got any copied out ill buy them if you do booksh polykles might never have heard the word before then slowly he dipped his head again this time he managed to stay upright oh yesh he said once more i member thoshe good congratulations he was so fuddled sostratos was amazed he remembered anything have you got any have i got any what youd do better to ask him questions when hes sobered up pal the taverner said does he ever sober up sostratos asked the man only shrugged sostratos gave his attention back to polykles come on lets go back to your house if youve got the books i want ill give you money for them money that idea seemed to take the scribe by surprise too money sostratos repeated and then as if speaking to an idiot drunken child he explained you can use it to buy more wine he knew shame a moment later wasnt he encouraging polykles to ruin himself whatever he was doing it worked the scribe drained the mug and lurched toward him letsh go go back to the houshe dont quite know what i got there we can shee he tried to walk through the wall instead of the doorway sostratos caught him and got him turned in the right direction just before he mashed his nose against the mud brick come on friend we can get you there sostratos said wondering if he told the truth steering polykles down the street was like steering a sailing ship through a choppy sea and shifting contrary winds the scribe jibbed and staggered and all but capsized in a fountain maybe i should let him get good and soaked sostratos thought as he grabbed him again it might sober him a little he tossed his head if he goes into the fountain hes liable to drown the carpenter who lived next door to polykles looked up from that stool euge he told sostratos i never thought youd pry him out of the wineshop as a matter of fact neither did i sostratos wasnt proud of how hed done it now lets see if it was worth doing once they went inside polykles pawed through rolls of papyrus heresh one he thrust it at sostratos that what you want sostratos undid the ribbon holding the scroll closed when he unrolled the scroll so he could read what was on it he let out a long sigh of sorrow and pain he turned the scroll so the scribe could see it it was blank oh apeshtilensh polykles said ill end you another one here without much hope sostratos took the new scroll he opened it it wasnt homer either it was a poem of sorts by a writer sostratos had never heard of it was also as the first few lines showed him one of the most remarkably obscene things hed ever read aristophanes would have blushed he started to give it back to polykles then he hesitated if i were a bored hellenic soldier in phoenicia would i want to read this he asked himself he dipped his head that seemed true without a doubt in fact he read a few more lines himself just to make sure its all of the same sort he thought and it was ill take this one he told the scribe what else have you got i dont know polykles said as if he hadnt the slightest idea of what hed been doing lately and drunk as he was maybe he didnt he gave sostratos yet another scroll here thish onesh new sostratos began to read the book it was part of xenophon s treatise on horsemanship something else a soldier might find interesting or at least useful it began very well in a hand as neat and precise as glaukias but sostratos didnt have to go far before he found the quality sinking polykles must have been working while he was drunk he thought sadly the script grew scraggly lines wandered now one way now another errors in grammar appeared errors that would have earned a switching for a boy just learning his alphabeta words were scratched out other inkblots seemed to be only thatblots and a little more than halfway through the scroll words petered out altogether i wish i could keep this one but it wont do he said why not by the godsh polykles demanded sostratos showed him the defects in the scroll the scribe waved them away wholl know wholl care the man who buys it from me sostratos suggested dryly sho what polykles said by the time he findsh that shtuff youre long gone long gone he repeated and made flapping motions as if he were a bird flying away that struck him funny he laughed hoarsely sorry but no im not a thief sostratos said you fush about every little thing polykles told him had the scribe sold a couple of books like the xenophon if he had and especially if hed sold them to rhodians he wouldnt get much business after that if he didnt have much business hed worry more if he worried more hed drink more if he drank more hed turn out more books like the xenophon if he turned out anything at all more than a little sorrowfully sostratos held up the lewd poem and said ill give you five drakhmai for this one if anything that was generous for the scroll wasnt very long polykles just stared at him five drakhmai do you hear me yesh the scribe said five drakhmai im shorry besht one i wish there were more but maybe he tried to explain if he did he had no words but then he didnt really need any either sostratos set the five silver coins where polykles couldnt help but see them farewell he said and walkedalmost ranout of the scribes place of business would those five drakhmai make polykles fare well would they even help him fare well or would he as was much more likely just use them to buy more wine to pour down his throat he would think that was faring well but sostratos tossed his head how much did what polykles drunkenly thought was faring well resemble what would in fact be well for him not much sostratos feared and hed helped the scribe continue on his drunken path he sighed and hurried away from polykles hurried back toward the comfortable life he led he hurried away from what hed just done too while polykles didnt follow himwas indeed likely to be as grateful to him as his sodden state allowedhis own conscience did farewell menedemos father said standing on the quay farewell uncle lysistratos echoed adding safe journey there safe journey home thank you father thank you uncle menedemos called from the aphrodites poop deck she was ready to sail only a couple of ropes still bound her to rhodes her cargo was aboard her crew likewise soon she would nose out across the winedark sea to find out what profit if any lay in the east farewell himilkon the phoenician called the bright spring sun glinted from the heavy gold rings he wore in his ears a couple of the aphrodites rowers though hellenes wore their wealth the same way another had a torn shrunken earlobe that said some of his portable wealth had been forcibly detached from him once upon a time himilkon added something else not in greek but in a language full of hissing and gutturals sostratos who stood only a couple of cubits from menedemos haltingly replied in the same tongue what did he say menedemos asked what did you say he said almost the same thing father did his cousin answered he wished us good fortune on the journey i thanked him ah menedemos dipped his head you really have learned some of that barbarous babbling havent you some sostratos said i can count i can haggle i can get food or ask for a room in an inn i can be polite that should be plenty menedemos pointed to the base of the quay here comes your brotherinlaw farewell damonax called panting a little gods give you good weather and plenty of profit you know youve got splendid oil there to sell yes my dear sostratos said proving he could be polite in greek as well as aramaic menedemos curtly dipped his head he still wished they werent carrying olive oil to phoenicia he turned away from damonax and toward diokles are we set to go he asked the keleustes as soon as we cast off we are skipper diokles answered the oarmaster was getting close to fortyfive his short beard grizzled he was the best sailor menedemos had ever known whatever he couldnt get out of a crew and ship wasnt there to be had a couple of the men on the pier took care of the last detail tossing into the aphrodite the lines that moored her fore and aft sailors coiled the ropes and secured them for the departure rowers sat at all twenty benches on each side of the merchant galley they looked expectantly back toward diokles who stood not far from menedemos on the raised poop whenever youre ready menedemos murmured right diokles said he took out a square of bronze hung from a chain and a little mallet he used to beat out the stroke raising his voice so it would carry all the way to the bow he called all right you lazy lugs i know you havent pulled on anything but your own pricks all winter long but weve got people watching us and i dont want us looking like a pack of idiots eh so even if you dont know what youre doing pretend like you do all right hell make them sorry if they dont sostratos said of course he will menedemos answered thats his job diokles poised the mallet menedemos settled his hands on the steeringoar tillers they werent so smooth as he would have liked not polished by long intimate contact with his callused flesh the aphrodite had lost both steering oars in separate accidents the year before and the replacements still had a rough feel to them he didnt care for time will fix it he thought clang diokles smote the square at the same time he called out rhyppapai to help give the rowers the stroke clang rhyppapai clang rhyppapai the men at the oars did him proud they pulled as if they were serving on a trireme or a five in the rhodian navy indeed a lot of them had pulled an oar in the rhodian navy at one time or another slowly at first then with building momentum the aphrodite glided away from the pier farewell menedemos father called one last time menedemos lifted a hand from the tiller to wave to him but didnt look back good luck uncle lysistratos said good fortune go with you damonax added with his olive oil aboard the akatos he had reason to worry about good fortune artificial moles protected the great harbor of rhodes from wind and wave the water inside the harbor was as smooth as the finest glazed pottery a tower at the base of the eastern mole mounted dart and stonethrowing catapults to hold enemy warships at bay a soldier on the tower tiny as a doll in the distance waved toward the aphrodite menedemos returned the greeting more soldiers in gleaming bronze corselets and helms marched along the mole toward the tip the earlymorning sun glinted from the iron heads of their spears thin across the water came the voice of the underofficer in charge of them step it up you sorry sleepy bastards you can sleep when youre dead he sounds like diokles sostratos said in a low voice so he does menedemos agreed his jobs not much different is it little fishing boats were sculling out of the harbor too they couldnt move nearly so fast as the aphrodite and made haste to get out of her way none of their captains wanted the akatos seagreened bronze ram crunching into his boats flank or stern the fishermen and menedemos waved to one another as the merchant galley slid toward the great harbors narrow outlet also making for the outlet was a big beamy round ship deeply laden with wheat or wine or some other bulk commodity like any round ship this one was made to travel by sail her handful of crewmen strained at the sweeps but the fat ship only waddled along expecting her to move aside for the aphrodite would have been absurd menedemos pulled in on one steeringoar tiller and pushed the other one away from him graceful as a dancer the merchant galley swung to port as she passed the round ship menedemos called out to the other captain whats the name of your wallowing scow the sea snail id sooner be aboard her than poseidons centipede there the other fellow retorted they traded friendly insults till the aphrodites greater speed took her out of hailing range another round ship this one with her enormous square sail lowered from the yard and full of the breeze from out of the north was just entering the harbor as the aphrodite left again his ship being far more maneuverable than the other menedemos gave her as wide a berth as he could though the harbor mouth was only a couple of plethra across as soon as the akatos got out onto the open sea her motion changed that breeze pushed swells ahead of it the merchant galley began to pitch and roll menedemos kept his balance without conscious thought sostratos gripped the rail to help steady himself he gripped it till his knuckles whitened as a matter of fact for he needed a while at the start of each trading run to regain his sea legsand his sea stomach some of the rowers also looked a trifle green maybe that meant theyd done too much drinking the night before but maybe they also had trouble with the ships motion most of them like sostratos would soon master it as for the ones who couldnt what business did they have going to sea menedemos said i think we can take most of the men off the oars now right you are skipper diokles answered he called out o—Üp the rowers rested at their oars menedemos kept the merchant galleys bow pointing into the swells with the steering oars diokles asked him eight men on a side suit you that should be fine menedemos dipped his head we dont want to wear them out the akatos used its full complement of rowers for swank as when setting out at the start of each new trading run and for emergency speed as when escaping from pirates or turning to fight them otherwise the crewmen took turns at the oars while the sailors being relieved brought their oars inboard and stowed them menedemos peered north toward the karian coast were off again he thought and the familiar excitement at being on his own coursed through him and im away from rhodes and from my father and from baukis that wasnt excitement exactly but it would do coming into kaunos on the karian coast sostratos knew a certain surge of hope so might a man coming back to a polis where hed lived twenty years before have hoped a hetaira hed kept company with then was still beautiful and stillas glad to see him as she had been once upon a time hed been to kaunos only the year before but all the same do you suppose he said to menedemos three words were plenty to let his cousin know what he was talking about no my dear im afraid i dont suppose menedemos answered what are the odds sostratos prided himself on being a rational man he knew what the odds wereknew all too well in fact yet like someone hoping a longdead love affair might miraculously revive he did his best to look away from them rather than in their direction we found one gryphons skull in the market square here he said why not another youd do better to ask why we found one wouldnt you when none was ever seen in these parts before menedemos said i suppose t would sostratos heaved a melodramatic sigh after all the evils hope came out of pandoras box and ill cling to it as long as i can however you like of course his cousin answered guiding the aphrodite alongside a quay with fussy precision and minute adjustments of the steering oars satisfied at last menedemos dipped his head that ought to do it back oars diokles called to the rowers after theyd used a couple of strokes to kill the merchant galleys forward motion the oarmaster held up his hand and said o—Üp the rowers rested some of them rubbed olive oil into their palms their hands had softened over the winter and the first couple of days aboard ship had left them sore and blistered and theyd rowed all the way up from rhodes theyd had no other choice not with the wind dead in their faces all the way north a couple of soldiers strode up the pier toward the aphrodite this seems just like last year sostratos said are you trying to make an omen of it menedemos asked suddenly shamefaced sostratos dipped his head menedemos laughed omens are often where you find them i admit but do remember that last year the men who questioned us served antigonos old oneeyes hoplites arc gone ptolemaios men threw em out im not likely to forget that sostratos said tartly antigonos soldiers almost caught us here in the harbor hush menedemos told him you dont want to say such things where these boys might hear you that no doubt was good advice what ship are you called the soldier with the fancier plume in his helmet where are you from whats your cargo were the aphrodite best one out of rhodes sostratos answered rhodes tried to stay on good terms with all the squabbling macedonian marshals but was especially friendly to ptolemaios of egypt who shipped enormous amounts of wheat through her harbor weve got perfume fine oil koan silk books let me see a book the soldier said what would you like we have some of the best parts of the iliad and the odyssey or a poem thats as ah spicy as anything youve ever read ptolemaios trooper tossed his head ive never read anything at all on account of i havent got my letters he seemed proud of his illiteracy too but if youve really got books i know youre traders and not some godsdetested spies maybe that was logic maybe it was just stupidity sostratos couldnt quite decide which would spies be clever enough to bring books along in case some officious junior officer decided he wanted to have a look at them who could guess sostratos stooped under a rowers bench opened an oiledleather sack and took out a roll of papyrus he worked the wooden spindles to show the soldier the roll did indeed have words written on it all right all right i believe you the fellow motioned for him to stop put the silly thing away by zeus you are what you say you are he turned on his heel and tramped back down the pier the other soldier whod never said a word followed him that was easier than ive seen it a good many places menedemos remarked i know sostratos looked up to the forts atop the hills west of kaunos antigonos soldiers had held out for a while in one of them even after the city fell to ptolemaios men i wonder if the rhodian proxenos ever came back here if you really care we can ask menedemos said with a shrug a year before the aphrodite had taken the kaunian who looked after rhodian interests in his city to rhodes itself hed feared arrest from antigonos men when word came that ptolemaios soldiers were sweeping west along the southern coast of anatolia hed had reason to fear too soldiers whod come to arrest him had got to his house just too late and theyd come down to the harbor just too late to keep the aphrodite from sailing sostratos went back behind the steering oars picked up the gangplank and stretched it from the poop deck to the wharf normally that was work for an ordinary seaman not the merchant galleys toikharkhos sostratos didnt care he was too eager to care he gave menedemos an inviting wave come on my dear lets see what there is to see youre not going to find another gryphons skull his cousin told him if i dont look for one i certainly wont sostratos replied with dignity are you coming oh yes menedemos said if you think ill pass up a chance to see you act foolish you can think again i dont see how seeking something i want is foolish sostratos said more dignified than ever when you seek what you want it usually wears a transparent chiton and perfume well id rather have a live girl than a dead gryphon if that makes me a fool ill answer to the name kaunos was an old town its streets ambled every which way instead of sticking to a neat rectangular grid like those of rhodes all the inscriptions used greek letters but not all were in greek a few were in the karian tongue for kaunos had been a karian town before hellenes settled there and it remained a place where folk of both bloods lived pointing to an inscription he couldnt read sostratos said i wonder what that means some barbarous blather or other menedemos said indifferently if it were anything important theydve written it in greek you say that on your way to phoenicia sostratos said hardly anyone knows greek there if more people did would i have been wrestling with aramaic all winter long if you want to wrestle go to the palaistra menedemos answered misunderstanding him on purpose as for the phoenicians well there havent been many hellenes in their towns till lately the kaunians have no excuse always ready to see things to your own advantage arent you sostratos said to whose better his cousin returned despite the towns twisting roads sostratos led both of them to the agora here we are he said as the street opened out onto the market square yes here we are menedemos scratched his head and how did you lead us here me idve had to take an obolos out of my mouth and give it to somebody to get him to tell us the way why sostratos said in surprise we were here last year dont you remember the way if i did would i be saying i didnt menedemos replied my dear there are times when you forget ordinary mortals havent got your memory im not sure allpowerful zeus has your memory of course nothe has his own sostratos said menedemos praise displeased him not at all pointing across the agora he went on the fellow who sold us the gryphons skull had his stall there well so he did menedemos started across the square picking his way between a farmer hawking dried figs and a fellow whod gathered a great basketload of mushrooms out in the meadows and woods in back of kaunos lets get this over with he brightened a little maybe hell have more hides to sell us anyhow sostratos heart pounded with excitement as he hurried after his cousin for a moment hope outran reason there was the stall there was the fellow whod sold them the gryphons skull there was a lion skin on display no gryphons skull sostratos sighed he did his best to remind himself he really shouldnt have expected to see another one not when the first had come from far to the east beyond the edge of the known world his best wasnt good enough to mask disappointment why its the rhodians the local exclaimed hail o best ones can we do business again i hope we can of course he does menedemos muttered behind his hand he played us for fools once unloading that skull on us oh go howl sostratos told him he asked the kaunian have you by any chance seen another gryphons skull sorry my friend but no the fellow tossed his head dashing sostratos hopes once and for all menedemos didnt say itold you so which was just as well sostratos thought he might have picked up a rock and brained his cousin for a crack like that right then then menedemos asked the kaunian have you seen another tigers hide the local tossed his head again no not one of those either you fellows want all the strange things dont you ive got this fine lion skin here you see he pointed to it oh yes menedemos said though he sounded anything but impressed i suppose well buy it from you but wed make more money with the stranger things especially in phoenicia sostratos added were sailing east this year and they have lions of their own there how much would they care about one more hide in say byblos i dont know about that but if youre going to phoenicia youll be going by way of cyprus the local merchant said they may have lions in phoenicia but they dont on the island you could get a good price selling it there he was right neither sostratos nor menedemos had any intention of admitting as much that would only have driven the price higher grudgingly menedemos said i suppose i might give you as much for this hide as i paid for the ones last year dont do me any favors by the gods the kaunian exclaimed this is a bigger hide than either of the ones i sold you then and look at that mane herakles didnt fight a fiercer beast at nemea its a lion skin menedemos said in dismissive tones i wont be able to charge any more for it and youre mad if you think im going to pay any more for it we wasted our time coming here sostratos said lets go back to the ship words like those were part of every dicker more often than not they were insincere more often than not both sides knew as much too here sostratos meant what he said when he saw the merchant had no gryphons skull he stopped caring about what the fellow did have the sooner he got away from kaunos and from the memory of what the local had had the happieror at least the less unhappyhe would be and the kaunian heard that in his voice dont get yourselves in an uproar best ones he said dont do anything hasty that youd regret later you made a good bargain last year and it would still be a good bargain at the same price this year is it not so it might be tolerable at the same price sostratos said it might mind you but a moment ago you were talking about wanting more for this hide than you did for those look at that mane he mimicked the kaunian to wicked effect all right the fellow threw his hands in the air you haggle your way i haggle mine when you do it youre wonderful when i do it itsa crime thats how you make it seem anyhow menedemos grinned at him thats our job my friend the same as your job is to sneer at every offer we make but we do have a bargain here dont we yes the kaunian didnt sound delighted but he dipped his head and stuck out his hand sostratos and menedemos clasped it in turn menedemos went back to the ship to get the moneyand to bring along a couple of sailors to make sure he wasnt robbed of it before returning to the agora sostratos wandered through the market square till his cousin came back he didnt think maybe someone will have a gryphons skull he knew how unlikely that was whenever the notion tried to climb up to the top part of his mind he suppressed it but he couldnt help hoping just a little whatever he hoped he was disappointed the agora held fewer interesting things of any note than it had the year before he spent an obolos for a handful of dried figs and ate them as he walked around had they been especially good he might have thought about getting more to put aboard the aphrodite but they were ordinary rhodes grew far better he finished the ones hed bought and didnt go back to the man who was selling them after menedemos handed the kaunian with the lion skin a sack of silver coins sostratos was glad to go back with him to the akatos this hide is better cured than the ones we got last year he remarked you cant smell it halfway across a room i know i noticed that too its one reason i wanted to pick it up menedemos cocked his head to one side i am sorry you didnt sniff out a gryphons skull my dear sostratos sighed so am i but i cant do anything about it ill keep looking i suppose maybe one of these days ill get lucky again maybe he thought but maybe i wont too rhyppapai diokles called as the aphrodite sailed east and south out of kaunos rhyppapai the merchant galleys oars rose and fell rose and fell before long the keleustes stopped calling the stroke and contented himself with beating it out with his hammer and bronze square that let him ask menedemos skipper are you going to serve out weapons to the men i should hope so menedemos exclaimed wed look like fools wouldnt we going into lykian waters without weapons to hand the lykian coast harbored pirates as a filthy man harbored lice it was rocky and jagged full of headlands and little inlets in which a pentekonter or a hemiolia might hide and from which the pirate ship might rush out against a passing merchantman and the lykians themselves seemed to take the attitude that anyone not of their blood was fair game not that lykians are the only ones manning these pirate ships menedemos thought some of the sea raiders in these parts came from other anatolian folk lydians karians pamphylians kappadokians and the like and sometoo manywere hellenes like kaunos the towns on the lykian coast were half maybe more than half hellenized but greek pirates came to these parts no less than honest settlers sailors passed out swords and hatchets and pikes and bronze helmets menedemos called aristeidas yes skipper replied a young man at one of the oars get somebody to take your place there and go on up to the foredeck menedemos told him youve got the best eyes of anybody on this ship i want you seeing where were going not where weve been all right aristeidas said agreeably come on moskhion will you pull for me a lot of sailors would have been angry to be bidden to hard work moskhion only dipped his head and sat down on the rowers bench as aristeidas rose why not he answered id sooner be doing this than diving for sponges any day up on the foredeck aristeidas took hold of the stempost with one hand and shielded his eyes with the other as he peered first dead ahead then to port and then to starboard sostratos chuckled not only are his eyes better than ours hes showing us how much better they are he ought to be a lookout in a playsay in aiskhylos agamemnon i dont care how showy he is menedemos said as long as he spots trouble soon enough for us to do something about it thats what matters oh certainly his cousin said i wasnt complaining about the job he does only saying hes got a fancier way of doing it than he did a couple of years ago not a thing wrong with that menedemos said again sostratos looked at him are we both speaking greek now whats that supposed to mean menedemos asked sostratos didnt answer annoying him further he knew his cousin didnt think he was as bright as he might have been more often than not that amused him for he thought sostratos got less pleasure from life than he might have every so often though supercilious sostratos struck a nerve and this was one of those times whats that supposed to mean menedemos repeated more sharply than before if you cant figure it out for yourself i dont see much point to explaining it sostratos retorted menedemos fumed an ordinary sailor who spoke to him so insolently might have found himself paid off and let go at their next stop he couldnt do that to his cousin however tempting it was before he could snarl at sostratos aristeidas sang out sail ho sail ho to starboard along with everyone elses menedemos eyes swung to the right he needed a moment to spy the little pale rectangle aristeidas did have sharper eyes than the usual run of men having spotted it menedemos struggled to make out the hull to which it was attached did it belong to a plodding round ship or to a wolf of the sea on the prowl for prey sostratos said i dont think thats a pirate oh how can you be so sure menedemos snapped your eyes arent even as good as mine i know that but i also pay attention to what i see his cousin replied most pirates dye their sails and paint their hulls to look like sky and sea so theyre as hard to spot as possible that ship has a sail of plain undyed linen and so she probably isnt a pirate he spoke as if to a halfwitted child what really stung was that he was right menedemos hadnt thought of that and it was true furies take me if ill admit it though he thought a couple of minutes later aristeidas said looks like shes turning awaymaybe she thinks were pirates and doesnt want any part of us we see that every year menedemos said we see it every year even though were still close to rhodes sostratos said thats what really makes me sad because our navy does everything it can to put pirates down ptolemaios captains seem to go after them pretty hard too menedemos said thats one reason to like him better than antigonos they say old oneeye hires pirates to eke out his own warships to the crows with that as far as im concerned sostratos dipped his head there the two cousins agreed completely its all one to antigonos sostratos said to him pirate fleets on the sea are the same as mercenary regiments on land menedemos shuddered any trader would have done the same mercenary regiments can turn banditeverybody knows thats so but pirates are bandits right from the beginning they live by robbery and plunder and kidnapping for ransom robbery plunder sostratos spoke the words as if they were even viler than was in fact the case a heartbeat later he explained why the gryphons skull yes the gryphons skull menedemos said impatiently but you seem to forget if those godsdetested polluted whoresons had had their way they wouldnt just have taken your precious skull theyd have gone off with everything the aphrodite carried and theyve have murdered us or held us for a ransom that would have ruined the family or else sold us into slavery thats true sostratos said in thoughtful tones youre righti dont usually remember it as well as i ought to more readily than anyone else menedemos knew his cousin was willing to admit he was wrong he went on all the more reason to crucify every pirate ever born id nail em to the cross myself that carried more weight from him than it would have from another man for he normally had little taste for blood diokles said begging your pardon young sir but id have to ask you to wait your turn there ive been going to sea longer than you have and so ive got first claim sostratos bowed just as you say most noble one i yield to you as the heroes of the iliad yielded to ancient nestor now wait a bit diokles exclaimed im not so old as that are you sure menedemos asked slyly the keleustes who was grayingbut no more than grayinggave him a sour look the rowers close enough to the stern to hear the chatter grinned back toward diokles youre making for patara sostratos asked as the aphrodite sailed southeast thats right menedemos said i dont want to put in anywhere along this coast except at a town thatd be asking for trouble id sooner spend a night at sea we were talking about bandits a little while ago this hill country swarms with em and there might be bands big enough to beat our whole crew why take chances with the ship no reason at all his cousin said if you were as careful with your own life as you are with the akatos here menedemos glowered weve been over this ground before you know it does grow tedious very well best one ill not say another word sostratos replied then of course he said several more words helping to keep you out of harms way after you debauch some other mans wife grows tedious too not to me menedemos retorted and i dont usually need help this time sostratos said nothing his silence proved more embarrassing to menedemos than speech might have for his own comment wasnt strictly true sometimes he got away with his adulteries as smoothly as odysseus had escaped from kirke in the odyssey intaras a couple of years before though he had needed help and in halikarnassos the year before that he didnt want to think about halikarnassos he still couldnt set foot there for fear of his life and hed been lucky to escape with that life some husbands had no sense of humor at all gulls and terns wheeled overhead a blackcapped tern plunged into the sea only a few cubits from the aphrodites hull it emerged with a fine fat fish in its beak but it didnt enjoy its dainty for long a gull started chasing it and buffeting it with its wings and pecking at it at last the tern had to drop the fish and flee the gull caught the food before it fell back into the water a gulp and it was gone sostratos had watched the tern and gull as with people so with birds he said the uninvited guest gets the choice morsel funny menedemos said grinning but his cousin tossed his head i dont think so and neither did the tern havent you ever got drunk at one symposion and then gone on to another one menedemos asked talking your way insometimes shouting your way inis half the fun the other half is seeing what sort of wine and treats the other fellow has once you do get inside if you say so i seldom do such things sostratos answered primly thinking back on it menedemos realized his cousin was telling the truth sostratos always had been a bit of a prig menedemos said you miss a good deal of the fun in life you know you may call it that sostratos said what about the fellow whose drinking party you invade why would he throw a symposion in the first place if he didnt want to have fun menedemos said besides ive been to some that turned out jollier on account of people who came in already garlanded off the street he suspected he sounded like bad logic in aristophanes clouds and he waited for sostratos to say as much menedemos liked aristophanes bawdy foolery much more than his cousin did but sostratos knewand disapproved ofthe clouds because it lampooned sokrates to his surprise though sostratos brought up the athenian in a different way you may be right you know platons symposion dont you or know about it thats the one where alkibiades comes in off the street as you say and talks about the times when he tried to seduce sokrates wasnt sokrates supposed to be ugly as a satyr menedemos asked and wasnt alkibiades the handsomest fellow in athens back whenever that was about a hundred years ago sostratos said yes sokrates was ugly and yes alkibiades was anything but why did alkibiades try to seduce him then menedemos asked if he was as handsome as that he could have had anybody he chose thats how things work i know sostratos said a certain edge to his voice menedemos feared hed stuck his foot in it hed been an exceptionally handsome youth and enjoyed the luxury of picking and choosing among his suitors nobodyd paid court to sostratos whod beenand who still wastall and gawky and plain after a moment sostratos went on if alkibiades could have chosen anyone he wanted but set out to seduce sokrates what does that tell you that he was very nearsighted menedemos suggested oh go howl sostratos exclaimed diokles laughed out loud he wasnt beating out the stroke now with a good breeze from out of the north the aphrodite made for patara by sail alone sostratos visibly gathered himself he knew sokrates was ugly everybody knew sokrates was ugly so what did he see in him if not the beauty of his soul but it wasnt his soul alkibiades was after menedemos pointed out it was his go howl his cousin said again thats the point of the symposion how love of the beautiful body leads to love of the beautiful soul and how love of the soul is a higher thing a better thing than love of the body menedemos lifted a hand from a steeringoar tiller to scratch his head love of the beautiful body yes but you just got done admitting sokrates body wasnt beautiful or anything close to it youre being difficult on purpose arent you sostratos said not this time menedemos tossed his head a likely story sostratos said darkly well look at it like this sokrates soul was so beautiful alkibiades wanted to take him to bed even though his body was ugly thats quite something dont you think i suppose so menedemos said sostratos looked as if he would have brained him with an amphora of olive oil had he said anything else of course he looks that way menedemos thought if somebody handsome could fall in love with ugly sokrates for the sake of his beautiful soul why couldnt someone do the same with plain sostratos for the sake of his soul no wonder he takes that story to heart he wasnt used to such insights it was as if for a moment a god had let him look out from sostratos eyes instead of into them he also realized he couldnt say anything to his cousin about what hed seen or thought hed seen the sun set sailors ate barley bread and olives and onions and cheese menedemos washed his frugal supper down with a rough red rhodian wine good enough to drink but not to sell anywhere off the island he stepped to the rail and pissed into the sea some of the sailors settled down on rowers benches and went straight to sleep menedemos couldnt he sat down on the planks of the poop deckhed been standing all day and watched the stars come out the moon a waxing crescent hung low in the west it wasnt big enough to shed much light though its reflection danced on the sea behind the aphrodite ares wandering star red as blood but not so bright as it sometimes got stood high in the southeast sostratos pointed east theres zeus wandering star just coming up over the horizon yes i see it menedemos said brightest star in the sky with ares fading and aphrodite s too close to the sun to spy for a while i wonder why a few stars wander like the moon but most of them stay in one place in the sky forever sostratos said how can you hope to know that menedemos said they do what they do thats all and theres an end to it oh i can hope to know why his cousin answered i dont expect to mind you but i can hope knowing why something happens is even more important than knowing what happens if you know why you really understand sokrates and herodotos and thoukydides all say the same thing there and that must make it so menedemos gave his voice a fine sardonic edge but sostratos refused to rise to the bait all he said was homer says the same thing too you know what menedemos sat up straighter so abruptly that something in his back crackled unlike his cousin he had no great use for philosophers and historians they breathed too rarefied an atmosphere for him homer was another matter like most hellenes he looked to the iliad and odyssey first everywhere else only afterwards how do you mean he demanded think about how the iliad starts sostratos said the aphrodite bobbed up and down in light chop the motion just enough to remind men they werent on land any more sostratos went on whats the poet talking about there why the anger of akhilleus thats what causes the akhaioi so much trouble homer s not just talking about the siege of troy dont you see hes talking about why it turned out the way it did menedemos did think about that famous opening after a moment he dipped his head well my dear when youre right youre right and youre right this time do try not to let it go to your head why dont you go to the crows sostratos said but he was laughing ive got a better idea im going to bed menedemos got to his feet pulled his chiton off over his head wadded up the tunic and laid it on the planks for a pillow then he wrapped himself in his himation like most sailors he made do with chiton alone in almost any weather but the thick wool mantle though he didnt wear it over his tunic made a perfect blanket good night sostratos lay down beside him also snug in his himation see you in the morning he said around a yawn yes menedemos voice was blurry too he stretched wriggled slept patara stood near the mouth of the xanthos river the hills above the city put sostratos in mind of those above kaunos which the aphrodite had just left red and yellow pine cedar and storax grew in those hills plenty of good timber there sostratos remarked hurrah menedemos said sourly more for the polluted lykians to turn into pirate ships a couple of fives patrolled outside pataras harbor the big war galleys had two rowers on each oar on the thranite and zeugite banks only the bottom or thalamite oars were pulled by a single man all those rowers made the ships speedy despite their heavy decking and the planks of the oarbox that protected the rowers from flying arrows one of them displaying ptolemaios eagle on mainsail and small foresail made for the aphrodite i dont mind ptolemaios drawing timber from this country sostratos said better him than the lykians thats for sure menedemos agreed and the trees he turns into triremes and fours and fives they cant use forhemioliai and pentekonters ahoy the call from ptolemaios war galley wafted across the water what ship are you menedemos chuckle had barbs in it sometimes its funny when round ships and fishing boats think were a pirate its not so funny when a five does this bastard can sink us by mistake lets make sure she doesnt eh sostratos cupped his hands in front of his mouth and shouted back were the aphrodite out of rhodes a rhodian are you the officer at the how of the war galley said you dont sound like a rhodian to me sostratos cursed under his breath hed grown up using the same doric drawl as anyone else from rhodes but hed cultivated an attic accent ever since studying at the lykeion more often than not that marked him as an educated sophisticate every once in a while though it proved a nuisance well i am a rhodian by athana he said deliberately pronouncing the goddess name in the doric style and this is a rhodian merchant galley whats your cargo the officer demanded his ship came up alongside the aphrodite he scowled down at sostratos the five had twice as much freeboard as the akatos and its deck had to rise six or seven cubits above the water weve got fine olive oil the best rhodian perfume silk from kos books and a lion skin we just picked up in kaunos sostratos answered books is it ptolemaios officer said can you read em i should hope so sostratos drew himself up very straight the picture of affronted dignity shall i start the man on the war galley laughed and tossed his head the crimson horsehair plume on his bronze helm nodded above him never mind pass on to patara no pirate would get so pissy when i asked him a question like that the five went back to its patrol big oars smoothly rising and falling as it glided away pissy sostratos said indignantly he turned to menedemos and spread his hands im not pissy am i once the words were out of his mouth he realized hed asked the wrong man menedemos smiled his sweetest smile of course not o marvelous one not after you stood by the rail just a little while ago he could have done worse having expected him to do worse sostratos took that with hardly a wince patara had two harbors an outer and an inner menedemos took the aphrodite into the inner harbor but clucked distressfully when he saw how shallow the water was he ordered a man up to the bow to cast the lead to make sure the merchant galley didnt run aground on the way to a quay here we are he said with a sigh of relief as sailors tossed lines to longshoremen standing on the wharf some of the longshoremen were hellenes others lykians who wore hats with bright feathers sticking up from them and goatskin capes over their shoulders most of the hellenes were cleanshaven the lykians wore beards this is a good harbornow sostratos said looking around the lagoon i wonder how long before it silts up too much to use though well it wont be before we sail out of here menedemos answered nothing else matters right now you have no curiosity sostratos said reproachfully i wonder why not menedemos saidcuriously sostratos started to reply then gave his cousin a sharp look menedemos favored him with another of those sweet smiles he would sooner not have had one of ptolemaios officers came up the quay to ask questions of the new arrival patience fraying sostratos said i just told an officer aboard one of your fives everything youre asking now the soldier shrugged maybe youre lying maybe he wont bother telling what you said in any report he makes maybe he wont come back here for a day or two or maybe his ship will get called away you never can tell eh and so he went right on with the same old questions sostratos sighed and gave the same old answers when the grilling ended the officer dipped his head all right id say you are what you claim to be thats what i needed to know i hope the trading is good for you without waiting for a reply he turned and went back down the quay what can we get here menedemos said as he and sostratos headed into patara lykian hams are supposed to be very good sostratos said yes ive heard that too his cousin replied maybe we can take a few to phoenicia why not sostratos agreed a moment later he snapped his fingers what is it menedemos said we can take hams to phoenicia yes sostratos answered but not inland to the country of the loudaioi their religion doesnt let them eat pork himilkon told me good thing i remembered so it is menedemos said why cant they eat it i dont knowhimilkon didnt explain it sostratos wagged a ringer at his cousin you see my dear why is always the interesting question maybe menedemos said and then maybe its for the same sort of reason that pythagoreans cant eat beans ive never heard that ham makes you windy sostratos said youre already windy seems to me menedemos said youre ready to quibble about almost anything too but that isnt news to the crows with you sostratos said but he and his cousin both laughed and he knew menedemos hadnt been wrong either me ready to quibble about anything now why would he say that lykian houses looked little different from their equivalents back in hellas they presented blank fronts to the street some were whitewashed some of unadorned mud brick some of stone they all had red tile roofs whatever beauty and valuables they held lay on the inside behind tiny windows and stout doors they gave robbers no clues about who had money and who didnt pataras streets also seemed much like those of an older polis back in hellas that is to say they were narrow and smelly and wandered every which way more often than not at random dogs and pigs chased rooks and jackdaws away from piles of garbage the stench was overwhelming you forget how bad a city smells till you get out to sea for a while sostratos said youre right menedemos looked more nearly green than he ever did on the ocean here in town sostratos couldnt always tell whether the people walking along the streets were hellenes or lykians a fair number of lykians affected hellenic styles wearing chiton and himation shaving their faces and even speaking greek their tongues betrayed them more readily than their outward seeming though they couldnt shed the accent of their native tongueand lykian to sostratos ear sounded like a series of sneezes strung together into a language menedemos noticed something else look how many women are out and aboutand not just slaves and poor ones who cant help coming out either that lady who just passed us had gold earrings and a gold necklace that had to be worth plenty but she didnt even bother wearing a veil she was pretty too yes she was sostratos wasnt blind to a goodlooking woman either he went on im not surprised the lykians give their women more leave to go out and about than we do why because theyre barbarians who dont know any better do you mean no because they reckon their descent through the female line if you ask a hellene who he is hell give you his name his fathers name his fathers fathers and so on but if you ask a lykian hell tell you his name his mothers her mothers why do they do that menedemos asked i dont know sostratos answered he poked his cousin in the ribs with an elbow you see another why question all right another why question id like to know so would i sostratos said just as a guess a mans always sure who his mother is theres room for doubt about his father ah i see youre saying the lykians figure that way because they know their women are sluts i dont think thats what i said sostratos answered and i dont know for a fact whether lykian women are sluts or not ive never had anything to do with them by the gleam in menedemos eye he was about to impart much more information on that topic than sostratos wanted to hear but he fell silent when a couple of squads of soldiers tramped by on a cross street holding up traffic on the way to the market square some of the men were hellenes with pikes in their hands and shortswords on their hips the rest were lykians many of them in their feathered hats and goatskin cloaks in place of spears some carried iron rippinghooks others were archers with bows bigger than hellenes usually used and with long unfletched arrows in their quivers once the soldiers had turned a corner sostratos remarked well best one you were probably wise not to talk about their women where they could hear you his cousin gave him a reproachful look but kept quiet the street sostratos had hoped would lead to the agora abruptly ended in a blank wall he and menedemos went back to the nearest intersection as soon as he found someone who spoke greek he took an obolos from his cheek and gave the little silver coin in exchange for directions that would work the lykian turned out not to speak much greek and sostratos made him repeat himself several times before letting him go even then he wasnt sure he was heading the right way till he walked into the market square by menedemos pleased murmur he was taken aback too i only understood about one word in three from that barbarian he said i had the advantage of you then sostratos said doing his best not to show how relieved he was im sure i understood one word in two now lets see if that obolos was silver well spent it wasnt much silver but he hated wasting money menedemos pointed theres a fellow with hams for sale shall we go over and see what he wants for them why not sostratos said again he and his cousin pushed their way through the crowded market square he heard both greek and lykian sometimes in the same sentence from the same man a fellow shoved a tray of plucked songbirds toward him urging him to buy no thank you he said i cant cook them up properly the vendor gave back a spate of incomprehensible lykian sostratos tossed his head and went on the fellow understood that one of ptolemaios soldiers was haggling with the man who sold hams come on menedemos said out of the side of his mouth lets look at something else for a little while right you are sostratos agreed if they started bidding for a ham too the bearded lykian could use them and the soldier against each other and bump up the price here menedemos took a lykianstyle hat and set it on his own head how do i look like an idiot sostratos told him his cousin bowed thank you so very much my dear the lykians who wear our clothes dont look idiotic thats because we dont wear such funnylooking things sostratos said i should hope not menedemos put back the hat and all those goatskin cloaks look like theyve got the mange they sure do but then instead of going on and mocking the lykians even more sostratos checked himself feeling foolish its only custom that makes our clothes seem right to us and theirs seem strange but custom is king of all that last bit sounds like poetry menedemos said who said it first what you dont think i could have sostratos said his cousin impatiently tossed his head sostratos laughed well youre right its from pindaros quoted by herodotos in his history i might have known you would have found it in a historyand i did know it was too good for you menedemos peered around the agora do you see anything else you want around here one of the women who was buying dried figs but i dont suppose shed be for sale sostratos answered menedemos snorted thats the sort of thing im supposed to say and youre supposed to roll your eyes and look at me as if i were a comic actor whos just shit himself on stage my only question is how do you know shes not for sale unless you try to find out im not going to worry about it sostratos said unlike some people i could name i know there are other things in the world oh i know that too menedemos replied but none of the others is half as much fun he checked himself well i suppose boys are half as much fun theyd be just as much fun if they enjoyed it the way women do i wont quarrel with you sostratos said a lot of men dont care whether boys enjoy it or not though theyre the same sort of men who dont care if their women take pleasure either menedemos lip curled in contempt and when a man like that beds a woman she doesnt take pleasure you wonder why they even bother that soldiers gone sostratos said lets go find out what the lykian wants for his hams the merchants price for one ham didnt seem too high menedemos asked him how many have you got twentyeight no twentyseven i just sell one in a low voice menedemos asked how much is twenty times his price my dear sostratos stood there in a lipmoving trance of concentration part of him resented being used as an animate abacus much more of him though enjoyed showing off he gave menedemos the answer menedemos gave it back to the lykian saying well give you that for all of them together all the fellow stared yes all well take them east for that not an obolos more yes no all the lykian said dazedly he wasnt used to doing business on that scale he made mental calculations of his own wondering whether a low price for one ham was worth getting a big sack of silver for the lot of them and not having to worry about when or whether theyd sell suddenly he thrust out a hand all menedemos clasped it sostratos said lets head back to the ship well see how lost we get he didnt expect to hed made it from the aphrodite to the agora and with his good head for directions thought hed be able to retrace his steps without much trouble but hed reckoned without pataras streets which doubled back on each other even more enthusiastically than those of a hellenic polis built before hippodamos popularized the idea of a rectangular grid he came upon a carved stone column inscribed in lykian planted in front of a potters shop give the potter an obolos menedemos said hell tell us how to get out of this maze wait sostratos said he found a word on the column he recognized mithradata put this up i think whos mithradata menedemos asked he was satrap here about the time our grandfather was born sostratos replied he was one of the very first people to use his own portrait on his coins everybody does that nowadays menedemos said all the macedonian marshals do anyhow no not all of them sostratos said precise as usual antigonos silver still has alexander s head on it fine menedemos sounded exasperated so old oneeye puts somebody elses portrait on his money its still a portrait i wonder how much the portraits on coins and statues really look like alexander sostratos remained relentlessly curious hes fifteen years dead after all they arent images of him any more theyre copies of copies of copies of images of him you could have asked that of ptolemaios when we were in kos last year his cousin said you could ask any macedonian veteran as a matter of fact or any hellene who went east with the macedonians youre right i could thanks best one next time i think of it i will sostratos beamed nice to run across a question that has an answer ah but has it got one answer or many what do you mean well if you ask one veteran hell give you an answer but if you ask ten veterans will they all give you the same answer or will some say the coins look like alexander while others tell you they dont i dont know sostratos plucked at his beard finding out would be interesting though once past the potters they turned a corner and saw blue water ahead theres the godscursed harbor menedemos said he threw his arms wide thalassa thalassa he called and burst out laughing sostratos laughed too you didnt march through all of asia to find the sea the way xenophon s men did no but i came through all of patarathrough some of it two or three times tooand that seems even farther menedemos retorted and i tell you something else too after i go back with some men to get the hams and pay off that lykian ill be just about as glad to get on the sea again as xenophons men were have you ever found a place thats harder to get around in than this not lately sostratos said i hope some of the other lykian towns will be better they could hardly be worse menedemos said o—Üp diokles called and the aphrodites rowers rested at their oars the keleustes went on bring em inboard boys were running nicely before the wind the rowers did ship their oars and stow them as the oarmaster had said a brisk wind from out of the north filled the merchant galleys sails the aphrodite sped southward bounding over the waves as nimbly as a dolphin no sailing better than this menedemos said before long he would swing the akatos east to follow the lykian coastline for now though he just stood at the steering oars and let her run even sostratos dipped his head he was getting his sea legs faster this year than he had on the ships last couple of trading runs its pitching didnt seem to bother him at all he said a pirate ship would have trouble catching us today dont count on it menedemos said they sail at least as fast as we do and when they sprint with all their rowers going flat out theres nothing in anybodys navy can keep up with em the wind continued to rise it thrummed in the merchant galleys rigging the akatos creamy white wake streamed out behind it menedemos turned to look back over his shoulder trying to gauge just how fast they were going skipper i think maybe you ought to diokles began take in some canvas menedemos finished and the oarmaster dipped his head menedemos raised his voice to tall out to the sailors come on boysbrail it up a couple of squares worth we dont want anything to tear loose strengthening lines crossed the sail horizontally the brails ran vertically giving it a pattern of squares hauling on the brails the sailors could if they chose shorten part of the sail and leave the rest fully lowered from the yard so as to take best advantage of the wind now with that wind blowing out of the north at their backs they shortened the whole sail evenly thats better menedemos said but it still wasnt good enough to suit him he ordered the yard lowered on the mast again that helped again it didnt seem quite enough quietly diokles said dont mean to bother you skipper but he pointed toward the north menedemos looked back over his shoulder again oh a pestilence he said also quietly well that spills the perfume into the soup doesnt it the line of dark angry clouds hadnt come over the horizon the last time hed looked they swelled rapidly no matter how fast the aphrodite was going they outpaced her with ease squall sostratos said menedemos started to spit into the bosom of his tunic to turn aside the omen but didnt bother completing the gesture sostratos hadnt really made a prediction hed simply stated a fact brail up the sail the rest of the way menedemos ordered and the men leaped to obey he had to call louder than he had only a few minutes before the wind was rising fast and starting to howl rowers to the oars he added and swung one steeringoar tiller in and the other away from him im going to put her into the wind a storm like this one usually blows out as fast as it blows up we can get through it quicker heading into it than running away oars bit into the sea the aphrodites steady pitching motion changed to a roll as she turned and presented her flank to the waves sostratos gulped and turned green as a leek he didnt like that so well the rowers handled it with untroubled aplomb in one ship or another theyd done such things before diokles began calling out the stroke as well as using his bronze square and little mallet rhyppapai he boomed rhyppapai steady boys you can do it rhyppapai pushed on by the wind blowing the squall line toward the ship the waves got bigger they crashed against the aphrodites ram throwing up plumes of spray as the akatos turned into the wind she began pitching again but harder menedemos felt as if he were aboard a halfbroken horse that was doing its best to throw him off the ship groaned as she rode up over one of those waves being long and lean helped her slide swiftly across the sea but in a storm like this it left her vulnerable in heavy waves part of her was supported by nothing but air for long heartbeats till she rode down into the next trough if she broke her back everyone aboard would drown in short order one of those waves threw water into her bow everyone aboard her might drown even if she held together here comes the squall sostratos shouted as if menedemos couldnt see that only too well for himself black roiling clouds blotted out blue sky overhead the sun vanished rain poured down in buckets zeus hurled a thunderbolt not far away the noise even through the pounding of the rain and the winds shrill furious shriek seemed like the end of the world if one of those thunderbolts struck the aphrodite that would take her down to the bottom of poseidons watery realm too and all the men aboard her down to the house of hades howling like a bloodthirsty wild beast the wind tore at menedemos he clung to the steeringoar tillers with all his strength to keep from being picked up and flung into the aegean the steering oars fought in his hands the ferocious sea giving them a life of their own a stay parted with a twang like that of an enormous lyre string the mast sagged if another stay went the mast would likely go with it in its fall it might capsize the merchant galley fix that line menedemos screamed he didnt think the sailors could hear him he could hardly hear himself but they knew what needed doing without being told they rushed to seize the flapping stay to bind it to another line and to secure it to a belaying pin more men stood by with hatchets ready to try to chop the mast and yard free if they did come down and then as suddenly as the squall line had engulfed the aphrodite it was past the wind eased the rain slackened then stopped the sea remained high but the waves became less furious without that gale to drive them a few minutes later as the clouds roared off toward the south the sun came out again water dripped from sostratos beard it was dripping from the end of menedemos nose too and from the point of his chin now he wiped his face with his forearm hed seen no point in bothering before just another day sostratos remarked just as if that were true menedemos tried on a grin it felt good being alive felt good knowing hed probably stay alive a while longer felt best of all he dipped his head admiring his cousins coolness and doing his best to match it yes he said just another day a sailor at an oar near the stern grinned too he took a hand off the oar to wave to menedemos one thing about a storm like that he said if you piss yourself wholl know not a soul menedemos laughed out loud the harried little men who filled aristophanes comedies might have said something like that came through pretty well diokles said is everyone hale sostratos asked one of the men at the oars was groaning and clutching his left shoulder did you break it naukrates menedemos called i dont know skipper the man answered through clenched teeth when the sea started going crazy there it gave my oar a wrench i wasnt expecting and i got yanked pretty good ill have a look at it if you like sostratos sounded eager he wasnt a physician but hed read something about the art of medicine sometimes that made him useful sometimes as far as menedemos was concerned it made him a menace but then sometimes physicians were menaces too naukrates dipped his head sure come on if you can do anything at all i wont be sorry you hope you wont be sorry menedemos thought as his cousin made his way forward sostratos felt of the rowers shoulder its not broken he said its out of its socket i can put it back in i think but it will hurt go ahead naukrates told him it hurts now before beginning sostratos had the sense to get a couple of other men to hold on to naukrates then he took hold of the injured mans arm and twisted it at an angle that made menedemos queasy to see naukrates howled like a wolf menedemos started to ask his cousin if he was sure he knew what he was doing it seemed more like torture than therapy but then the joint went back into place with a click menedemos heard all the way back at the poop naukrates let out a sigh of relief thank you kindly young sir its easier now good sostratos sounded relieved too how much confidence bad he had in what he was doing less than hed shown menedemos suspected here leave it like this his cousin said to naukrates setting his left hand on his right shoulder im going to put it in a sling for a while to make sure it stays where it belongs and heals he haggled off some sailcloth with a knife and bound up the rowers arm like everything else aboard the aphrodite the cloth was soaking wet naukrates didnt seem to care that is better he said it still hurts but i can bear it now ive got some egyptian poppy juice mixed into wine sostratos said ill give you a draught of it it will do you some goodi dont know how much illtry it naukrates said without hesitation now that sostratos had helped him once he seemed to think menedemos cousin could do no wrong menedemos had a different opinion but kept it to himself when naukrates drank the poppy juice he made a horrible face by the gods thats nasty stuff he exclaimed before long though a dreamy smile spread across his face he murmured it does help good sostratos started to slap him on the back then visibly thought better of it he came back up onto the poop deck nice job menedemos said thanks sostratos looked pleased with himself first time i ever actually tried that well dont tell naukrates he thinks it was skill not luck there was some skill involved you know oh dont get stuffy with me my dear menedemos said there was some luck involved too and you know that he looked a challenge at his cousin or are you going to try to tell me otherwise he was ready to call sostratos a liar if his cousin tried any such thing but sostratos only gave him a sheepish smile by no means o best one and i suppose youre righti wont tell naukrates wont tell me what naukrates had sharp ears but his voice was as blurry as if hed drunk too much wine never mind menedemos and sostratos said together normally that would have made the sailor want to dig more as it would have with anyone now though naukrates just dipped his head and smiled that drugged smile how much poppy juice did you give him menedemos asked enough to take away his pain i hope sostratos answered i wouldnt be surprised if he goes to sleep in a while i wouldnt be surprised if he sleeps for the next ten days menedemos paused to pull his soaked chiton off over his head and stand naked in the sunshine that had returned after a moment sostratos followed his example most ordinary sailors went naked all the time at sea the few who usually wore loincloths had already shed them that reminds mewhen we get to phoenicia well make people upset if we take off our clothes whenever we happen to feel like it sostratos said catering to the foolish prejudices of barbarians goes against my grain menedemos said does making a profit go against your grain sostratos asked if we offend our customers will they want to trade with us menedemos grunted that made more sense than he wanted to admit himilkon always wore long flowing robes no matter how hot the weather got the same held true for other phoenician merchants hed seen in hellenic poleis very well he said as long as i dont have to put on shoes himilkon didnt say anything about bare feet sostratos told him i dont want to wear shoes either sailors always went barefoot aboard ship and they kept up the habit on land too peering south menedemos clicked his tongue between his teeth that squall lines already out of sight it could have been a lot worse for us a ship that isnt quick or lucky could go to the bottom lets hope a couple of pirates did sostratos said yes menedemos dipped his head if navies dont care about keeping pirates down maybe the gods will take care of it for us maybe but sostratos didnt sound convinced i wish the gods had done a better job up till now oh go howl menedemos said you always have reasons not to believe in anything thats not true and its not fair either his cousin answered im trying to find the truth and to live by it if you want to follow the first story you happen to hear go right ahead i cant stop you they glared at each other their own squall seemed as bad as the one that had blown out to sea for the next couple of hours they said not a word to each other sostratos watched birds and flying fish and leaping dolphins menedemos steered the aphrodite toward myra where hed been heading before the storm hit there were plenty of other places to anchor if he didnt make myra by nightfall the lykian coastline might have had fewer long projecting fingers of land than did that of karia but it was full of little inlets and harbors and coastal villages the only trouble with them was menedemos wanted nothing to do with them every other village kept a pirate ship or two ready to sally forth against any quarry that looked catchable menedemos was usually sad and sorry when fishing boats fled from the akatos in these waters he was just as well pleased the aphrodite so closely resembled a pirate ship herself when myra came into sight diokles let out a sigh of relief this place is big enough for ptolemaios men to garrison same as patara was he said they wouldnt bother with all those little hamlets in between patara and here the lykians in them have got to be as wild as they were in sarpedons day sarpedon was the son of zeus or thats what the iliad says menedemos answered if you ask me the lykians nowadays are mostly sons of whores the oarmaster laughed if you think im going to quarrel with you skipper youd better think again myra itself lay about twenty stadia inlandfar enough menedemos thought uneasily to make an attack from the sea harder than it would be if the place were right there by the shore a couple of war galleys flying ptolemaios eagle and several round ships lay at anchor in the bay in front of the town they all hailed the aphrodite when she came into the harbor her sleek lines once more created some alarm but menedemos did manage to convince the officers aboard the triremes he was a rhodian not a pirate with more nerve than was good for him he was eating barley rolls for sitos with an uninspiring opson of salt fish when a coughing roar came from the mainland even though his ship bobbed a couple of plethra offshore his hand froze halfway to his mouth the hair at the back of his neck tried to stand up whats that he said his voice high and shrill he felt foolish as soon as he spoke he knew what that was all right a lion sostratos answered it is an aweinspiring noise isnt it i should say so only then did menedemos remember hed quarreled with his cousin he shrugged how could a mere quarrel survive in the face of that sostratos might have been thinking along with him well my dear he said we arent eaten yet by lions or by sea jackals no not yet menedemos agreed do you suppose myra has anything worth buying or shall we press on id go on sostratos said how many lion skins can we carry menedemos thought it over then dipped his head myra had struck sostratos as nothing out of the ordinary phaselis on the other handthe last lykian city to the east impressed him a good deal more it was large enough to boast three harbors the locals fished not only on the sea but also in a nearby lake the population was a mixture of lykians and hellenes as the aphrodite tied up at a quay menedemos said i wish we had a letter or a friendship token from that euxenides we carried last year he was about the best carpenter ive ever seenand if he still has kin here in phaselis theyd probably feast us for taking him out of danger well they might sostratos answered but even if they did would we want them to euxenides was one of antigonos officers remember and ptolemaios is lord of phaselisfor the time being anyhow his cousin grunted i hadnt thought of that but youre right no doubt about it if euxenides relatives are all for old oneeye ptolemaios men wont be very happy about them or about us for dealing with them thats what i meant sostratos said this whole business of trading is hard enough without getting soldiers angry at you and speaking of trading what do they sell here hides i suppose and timber which weve got no real use for menedemos smile was almost a leer it said i know something you dont know sostratos hated being on the receiving end of a smile like that he hated having other people know things he didnt too menedemos who knew him as well as anyone undoubtedly also knew that you were studying phoenicia and aramaic so hard you forgot to pay attention to how we would get there sostratos said something in aramaic not only was it splendidly vulgar in its own right it sounded like a man ripping a thick piece of cloth in half best of all menedemos didnt understand a word of it returning to greek sostratos said what do they have here then why smoked fish menedemos answered the fearsome noises sostratos had just made kept him from rubbing it in this place is supposed to have some of the best smoked fish in the world papai sostratos said whats the matter his cousin asked i actually knew that but it had gone clean out of my head im not surprised my dear youve got so many useless facts jostling and crowding each other in there its no wonder some of them fall out now and again but they shouldnt sostratos hated forgetting things a man who prided himself on his wits naturally worried about any failure he changed the subject as much for his own sake as for menedemos if its good enough we can carry smoked fish to phoenicia better than the dried and salted stuff that usually travels the horrible face menedemos made showed his opinion of that though the aphrodite carried some to feed its crew we ought to be able to charge enough to make it profitable too thats your job of course of course sostratos agreed it wasnt that his cousin was wrong menedemos was right but if they couldnt make a profit on smoked fish menedemos wouldnt get the blame sostratos would that was what being toikharkhos meant with a small sigh sostratos said lets go into town and see what theyve got one thing phaselis hadas patara had had and myra toowas plenty of soldiers some were hellenes and swaggering macedonians ptolemaios garrison troops others were lykians who sounded as if they were sneezing whenever they opened their mouths looks like ptolemaios thinks his men are on this coast to stay sostratos remarked hes training up plenty of local barbarians to give them a hand if he does hes liable to be an optimist menedemos answered antigonos is going to have more than a little to say about who rules lykia i know im not saying youre wrong im just telling you what it looks like to me sostratos said they walked past a statue whose base had an inscription written in greek letters that spelled out nonsense words must be lykian like that stele in patara menedemos said no doubt though it could be anything at all for the sense it makes to me sostratos said karian and lykian both even if i did figure out a name on the stele if they want anybody to care about what they say theyd better use greek menedemos said well yes of course sostratos agreed phaselis stood on a long spine of land projecting out into the sea the market square lay in the center of town not far from the theater pointing to the bowl scooped out of the gray local stone menedemos said that looks hellenic enough so it does sostratos said there are hellenes here there have been for hundreds of years lakios of argos paid kylabras the shepherd a tribute of smoked fish in exchange for the land on which to build the city and that was back in the days we know only from myth and legend i think id heard that once but id forgotten it menedemos said unlike sostratos he didnt seem worried about forgetting something he went on with his own thought theyve been smoking fish here for a long time too then ive heard they still offer it to kylabras sostratos said they reckon him a hero if i were a hero id want a fat bullock or maybe a boar menedemos said fish is for ordinary mortals and their opson custom sostratos said as he had not long before smoked tunny shouted a fellow in the agora another chimed in with smoked eels who wants some fine smoked eels nice and fat smoked tunny smoked eels menedemos ears seemed to prick up like a foxs i thought theyd smoke any old thing but those are some of the best fish there are i wonder how they taste smoked shall we go find out sostratos said if they wont give us samples weve got no reason to buy do we not a bit menedemos said not a bit by heraklesand hed have a taste too if he were here sostratos dipped his head if there was food around food of any sort herakles would eat it the fellow crying his eels was a bald hellene with a freckled scalp and startling green eyes hail my friends he said as sostratos and menedemos came up youre new in phaselis arent you thats right sostratos answered were from the aphrodite an akatos out of rhodes smoked eels eh he gave his name and his cousins pleased to meet you both im epianax son of kleitomenes yes smoked eels we give em to the gods and you cant say that about fish very often weve heard stories about that sostratos said your heros name is kylabras isnt it epianax dipped his head thats right i wouldnt have expected a man from as far away as rhodes to know it but thats just right and whats good enough for kylabras is more than good enough for mortal men menedemos grinned at him i hope youre going to give us a chance to eat your words o best one give you a chance to eat my epianax frowned then laughed when he got it say youre a clever fellow arent you thats a neat way to put things to the crows with me if it isnt ill use it myself if you dont mind be my guest menedemos told him after all well only hear it the once that made the eelseller laugh again sostratos and menedemos shared a look the people in phaselis agora were liable to be hearing the same line thirty years from now if epianax lived so long menedemos went on you will let us try a sample wont you oh yes epianax had a formidable knife on his hip another few digits and it could have been a hoplites shortsword he used it to hack off a couple of lengths of smoked eel then handed one to each rhodian here you are most noble ones take a taste and then well talk sostratos popped his piece of eel into his mouth with the thumb and forefinger of his right hand it wasnt sitos which he would have eaten with his left and it wasnt fresh fish for which he would have used two fingers and his thumb not just one he chewed savoring both the smoke and the fatty richness of the eel he had to work hard not to show how delicious he thought it was not bad menedemos said after swallowing a certain tension in his expression said he was having the same problem as sostratos maybe epianax who didnt know him wouldnt notice his voice sounded casual enough what do you want for it if the price is decent we might take some along with uswere bound for the east and it could do well there you talking about cash or do you want to trade for it epianaxasked what are you carrying weve got prime olive oil fine rhodian perfume koan silk hams from patara papyrus and ink and some books sostratos said didnt expect youd have oil epianax remarked most places can make that for themselves this time sostratos didnt meet menedemos eye his cousin muttered something he couldnt make out which was probably just as well damonax he thought unkindly he hadnt imagined that acquiring a brotherinlaw would hurt his business but it had as loyally as he could he said its excellent oil from the very first of the harvest must be epianax said and let it go at that menedemos snicker wasnt very loud but a snicker it unquestionably was sostratos wished the vulture that tore at prometheus liver would give the titan a holiday and torment menedemos for a while but then epianax surprised him by asking what sort of books have you got you know your letters sostratos said blinking wouldnt be much point to the question if i didnt would there the eelseller answered yes i know em dont have a whole lot of cause to use em but i can fight my way through homer say we have some of the most exciting books of the iliad andthe odyssey with us menedemos said the look he gave sostratos added that it was only because of him that they had those books which wasnt true at all sostratos felt hampered constricted he didnt want to start an argument in front of a stranger to help remind his cousin hed been the one who actually bought the books from the scribes whod copied them he said and we also have a ah spicy poem from a modern writer a fellow named periandros of knidos spicy eh epianaxs eyes lit up he knew what that meant or hoped he did whats it about you know the statue of aphrodite that praxiteles put up at knidos the one that shows the goddess bare sostratos said i should hope i do epianax answered everybody knows about that statue he was right of course the image of aphrodite had roused enormous interest and excitement when it went into her shrine a generation before roused and excitement were words literally true too hellas was a land where respectable women veiled themselves on the rare occasions when they appeared in public not long after the astonishing shocking statue went up a man ejaculated on its marble crotch for him aphrodite proved truly the goddess of love sostratos said its about that fellowyoull have heard the story about him menedemos would have given the details sostratos didnt and didnt need to the eelseller dipped his head sostratos continued its about what would have happened if the statue turned to flesh and blood just then and epianax asked hoarsely and youll have to buy the poem to find out what periandros has to say about that sostratos told him well what do you want for it epianax demanded how often does anyone sell books in phaselis sostratos wondered not very unless i miss my guess in which case normally id ask twenty drakhmai but ill make it eighteen for you he said and waited to see if the eelseller would go right through the cloth roof of his stall when epianax didnt sostratos knew he would make a good profit you mean eighteen drakhmais worth of my eels right epianax asked yes certainly sostratos said i suppose you sell them for a drakhma apiece the same as they do in rhodes nobody in rhodes sold smoked eels like these but epianax didnt need to know that either he dipped his head now idve asked a little more if you didnt know what you were doing but a drakhmas fair still and all i think eighteen drakhmais a little on the steep side for a book what do you say to fourteen they settled on sixteen after a short haggle that left sostratos feeling happy at his profit and vaguely guilty at the same time he and menedemos chose their eels epianax threw in a beatup leather sack in which they could carry the smoked fish back to the aphrodite sostratos got the book of poetry from the ship and gave it to the eelseller thanks best one epianax looked as if he could hardly keep from unrolling the scroll and plunging right in ill read this myself and ill read it to my pals in taverns and sucha books always better in company sostratos didnt think so but knew he held a minority opinion until only a few generations before hardly anyone had owned books of his own and they were always read in public with a shrug the rhodian said however you like of course ill do you a good turn if i can epianax said do you know the place called dinos whirlpool sostratos echoed no where is it to a sailor a whirlpools a good thing to stay away from do you fish for your eels as well as smoke them is that how you know about the place no no not at all the eelseller said you misunderstand its an oraclea grove sacred to apollo by the sea a few stadia north of here theres one particular pool thats always full of eddies the person who wants to know the gods mind takes two skewers each with ten pieces of roasted meat on it some say you can use boiled too but i think theyre wrong an oracle sostratos murmured he prided himself on his rationality but how could you deny there were ways of knowing the future intrigued in spite of himself he asked how does the priest divine the gods will he sits at the edge of the grove while the man offering the sacrifice looks into the pool and tells him what kinds of fish come and eat the different pieces of meat epianax answered that would be a fine oracle for fishermen sostratos said but suppose a farmer who eats cheese and olives for his opson every day comes to the sacred grove how would he know what to tell the priest if he cant figure out which fish is a mackerel and which ones a shark the eelseller scratched his head good question my friend i dont know the answer but i suppose the priest does and im sure the god does an oracle wouldnt hardly be an oracle if just anybody could see how it worked now would it in a way that made sense in another way it annoyed sostratos he had a restless itch to know to find an explanation epianax had a point divine things didnt lend themselves to explanation but werent things that didnt lend themselves to explanation likely to be unreal part of sostratos was tempted to think so the rest resisted the impulse if youre going that way you can see for yourself epianax said they would be going up the lykian coast toward pamphylia then east to kilikia and the shortest crossing to cyprus sostratos hedged i dont know whether well stop or not my cousins the skipper itll depend on how much of a hurry hes in to get to phoenicia is that where youre headed the eelseller started to giggle whats so funny sostratos asked only that you may have a harder time selling those smoked eels than you think epianax answered a lot of syrians and other folk like that dont eat fish their gods wont let em or some such oimoi sostratos clapped a hand to his forehead i knew the ioudaioi wont eat pork but id never heard that any of those people wouldnt eat fish what do they do for opson not my worry epianax said no its mine sostratos agreed why didnt himilkon tell me did he think i already knew or has he lived among hellenes long enough to get over his silly superstition no way to tell not without sailing back to rhodes to ask the phoenician after a moment sostratos brightened well therell be plenty of hellenes in the coastal towns if the barbarians dont catch fish the men who serve antigonos will be all the gladder to see us mm thats so epianax looked down at the roll of papyrus in his hands i still think i got the better of the bargain when those eels are gone theyre gone for good but ill be reading this book twenty years from now if i can keep the mice from nibbling at it the best sort of bargain is one where both sides go away happy sostratos said diplomatically im heading back to the harbor now farewell and enjoy the poem if its got aphrodite in it without her clothes i expect ill like it just fine epianax sounded very sure of himself when sostratos came aboard the merchant galley he told menedemos what hed learned from epianax his cousin shrugged id thought wed sell the eels to the hellenes in antigonos army anyhow he said i know were all opsophagoi when we get the chance who wouldnt rather stuff himself with turbot or tunny or cuttlefish or lobster than with barley cakes or wheat bread sokrates wouldnt for one opson is fine hed say but its the relish its what you eat with the staple with the sitos if you do it the other way round then your bread turns into the relish doesnt it so what menedemos said cheerfully and smacked his lips if i had the silver for it id eat fish till i grew fins gods be praised you dont then sostratos said but how could you argue with somebody who not only admitted he was an opsophagos but sounded proud of it seeing no way sostratos didnt try instead he passed on what epianax had said about the oracle at dinos that is interesting menedemos said but what did he tell you its only a few stadia north of phaselis i dont see much point in stopping you surprise me sostratos said dont you want to learn what the god has to say about our voyage menedemos tossed his head not me my dear ill know in a few months any which way why are you that curious he answered his own question of course you are you always are do you really care about what the god says or are you interested in watching how this particular oracle works sostratos ears heated you know me too well he mumbled only your mother and father have known you longer menedemos said and they have to love you for they bore you me i see you as you areand somehow or other i put up with you anyway thank you so much sostratos told him his cousin ignored the sarcasm my pleasuremost of the time anyhow but listenive got news while you were talking with the eelseller i chatted up some of the sailors here in port things are stirring sure enough what sorts of things now sostratos sounded interested if anything could distract him from his own gloom it was news of the outside world well do you know kleopatra philip of macedons daughter and alexanders sister personally sostratos said no menedemos gave him the exasperated stare hed hoped for no not personally you thickhead do you know of her who doesnt sostratos replied when she married alexandras of epeiros philip was murdered at their wedding feast that put alexander the great on the throne it made him great in fact because who knows what he would have been if philip ruled another twentyfive years as he could have after alexandros died she married alexanders marshal perdikkas and after he died some other officeri forget whom shes in one of antigonos anatolian towns these days isnt she yes in sardisfor the moment menedemos said portentously ahsostratos said for the moment is it tell me more well what one of my chattering friends told me was that she doesnt want to stay in sardis or under old oneeyes muscular thumb anymore menedemos replied the story is she wants to go over to ptolemaios hes got that base over there on kos right across from the anatolian mainland sostratos said and menedemos dipped his head sostratos thought quickly the conclusion he reached didnt take much in the way of complicated calculation kleopatra will never get to his men alive you sound sure of that menedemos said ill bet a mina of silver on it if youre in the mood sostratos told him a hundred drakhmai by the dog of egypt you are sure arent you will you take the bet now menedemos thought it over he didnt need long either no thanks antigonos cant afford to let her get to ptolemaios hed lose too much face and hes ruthless enough to kill her if she tries in other words youre likely right whether i am or im not were both reasoning the same way anyhow sostratos said all right then we wont bet and we wont stop at the oracle either he did his best to sound woefully disappointed not if its that close to phaselis menedemos answered dont you want to get to phoenicia and ioudaia and practice your aramaic the question was good enough to keep sostratos from complaining as the aphrodites rowers took her out of the harbor of phaselis he wondered whether kleopatra had already fled sardis poor woman he thought if shes tried it shes probably already dead whos left from philips dynasty then no one no one at all as the aphrodite slid past the sacred grove at dinos menedemos eyed the pines and oaks the grove looked like any other unhallowed anatolian forest to him as epianax the eelseller had told sostratos though it did come right down to the sea its holiness had let it survive in the lowlands where most timber had been cut away to make room for farms the only trees close by were cultivated groves of olives and almonds but the hills rose steeply from the sea a man wouldnt have to go many stadia inland to find himself in the woods once more rhyppapai diokles called rhyppapai the breeze was fitful when it did blow it came mostly from the north if the akatos was going to get anywhere it had to travel by oar power dolphins leaped and frolicked alongside the ship theyre a good omen menedemos remarked to his cousin sostratos dipped his head so says the part of me that goes to sea every sailing season the part of me that went to the lykeion in athens has its doubts why take chances menedemos asked if you take omens but they arent real you dont hurt yourself but if you ignore them and they are you can end up in all sorts of trouble you can end up in trouble following omens that arent real sostratos said suppose you believe some lying fool of a soothsayer and do what he tells you and it turns out to be the worst thing you could have done or what about the prophecy the pythia at delphi gave to king kroisos of lydia if kroisos oer the halys river go he will a mighty kingdom overthrow what about that oh no my dear menedemos tossed his head you wont get me with that one thats not the oracles fault its kroisos fault for not asking whether hed overthrow the persian kingdomor his own sostratos gave him an impudent grin i cant fault your logic i doubt whether sokrates himself could fault your logic but logic remember lies at the heart of philosophy and youre a man who sneers at philosophy so where o marvelous one is the logic in that in your proktos menedemos suggested aristophanes and his jokes arc funny in their place when they get out of their place sostratos sniffed menedemos started to point out that aristophanes had had a good deal to say about philosophy and especially about philosophers at the last instant he held his tongue he knew what would happen if he sailed down that channel he and sostratos would get into a row about how big a role aristophanes and clouds had played in sokrates death how many times had they had that argument too many for menedemos to want to go through it again by now the steps were almost as formal as a dance sail ho aristeidas shouted as menedemos was casting about for something different to say sail ho off the starboard bow a sail was more important than any argument menedemos peered out to sea after a moment he spotted the sail too looks like a round ship and isnt that another sail behind it yes skipper it ismore than one in fact the lookout answered by the gods youre right menedemos said after another look three four five six i make k eight sail altogether is that right aristeidas shaded his eyes with his hand i see ten skipper i think a couple of them are well out to sea there and look to the crows with me if the lead ship hasnt got ptolemaios eagle on its sail they must be grain ships keeping his garrisons in lykia supplied sostratos said hes got nerve sending round ships along this coast without any war galleys escorting them menedemos said two or three pirates could put paid to that whole fleet ptolemaios has garrisons in all the goodsized towns around here sostratos reminded him that has to make a difference some difference menedemos allowed how much i dont know most pirate ships dont operate out of those towns they skulk behind headlands or at the mouths of little streams and then leap out at whatever passes by you make them sound like ferrets or other little vicious animals sostratos said thats how i feel about them menedemos replied dont you i feel that way about pirates not about pirate ships sostratos said ships are justships its the whoresons inside em who make the trouble youre too subtle for me if i see a pentekonter or a hemiolia i want to sink it right there on the spot menedemos said i dont care whos in it whoevers in a ship like that is bound to be up to no good because you cant do good in a ship like that if it werent for pirates there wouldnt be ships like that thats why theyre going to build that trihemiolia you were talking about last fall sostratos said shell be a piratehunters dream ship if she sails the way everybody thinks she will and thats why you build a new ship to see if she sails the way everybody thinks she will i mean menedemos answered i wouldnt mind being her skipper thoughill tell you that if anyones earned the right you have his cousin said if not for you there wouldnt be a trihemiolia menedemos shrugged thats true but ill tell you something else every bit as true my dear im out here on the inner sea bound for phoenicia to make a living for my family and there are plenty of captains back in rhodes who want to command a trihemiolia every bit as much as ida thats not fair sostratos said the worlds not fair menedemos replied with another shrug anybody who goes out in it a little bit will tell you the same sooner or later i expect ill get a chance and when i do ill show people what kind of officer i am that seemed enough of that he pointed toward ptolemaios approaching merchantmen those are big ships arent they i think theyre bigger than the ones that brought grain into syracuse for agathokles sailing season before last sostratos plucked at his beard it makes sense they should be i suppose agathokles had to take what he could get ptolemaios can pick and choose and ptolemaios has more money than agathokles ever dreamt of menedemos added i said something about kroisos a little while ago ptolemaios has more money than kroisos ever dreamt of sostratos said ptolemaios has more money than anybody ever dreamt of except maybe the great kings of persiaand they held egypt too egypts the richest country in the world its so rich it hardly seems fair menedemos said not only was the land rich in gold and emeralds as he had reason to know but the nile floods renewed the soil every year they let the peasants raise enormous crops some small part of which lay in the holds of those approaching round ships and let whoever ruled egypt collect even more enormous amounts of taxes ahoy the shout came thin across the sea from a sailor at the bow of the leading merchantman ahoy the galley what ship are you are you a pirate if you are a pirate will you admit it that was what the fellow meant menedemos shouted back were the aphrodite out of rhodes out of rhodes eh the sailor on the round ship sounded suspicious he had reason to with rhodes a leading trading partner for egypt a pirate would do well to disguise himself as coming from that island what trading house are you from philodemos and lysistratos menedemos replied philodemos is my father lysistratos is my toikharkhos father maybe ptolemaios man knew a bit about rhodes or maybe he was just seeing if pirates would stumble trying to invent something plausible either way menedemos was not the sort of man to let him get by with cheek unchallenged he shouted a question of his own what ship are you and he got an answer this is the isidora out of alexandria answered the sailor on the round ship then the fellow realized he didnt have to tell menedemos anything he shook his fist at the aphrodite its none of your business who we are and what were doing no eh but its your business who we are and what were up to menedemos returned well you can go howl pal were free hellenes just the same as you are and weve got as much right to ask you questions as you do with us euge sostratos and diokles said together a couple of sailors clapped their hands menedemos grinned at the praise the arrogance of the soldiers and sailors who served under macedonian marshals could surpass belief the man on the isidora had it in full measure too he threw back his head and laughed as the two ships passed closest to each other go ahead and bark little dog he said when a big dog decides he wants your house youll run away yelping with your tail between your legs rage ripped through menedemos i ought to sink that son of a whore who does he think he is to talk to me that way again sostratos and diokles spoke together this time they both said no menedemos knew they were right but he still steamed like a sealed pot forgotten in a fire he felt as if he could burst and scatter shards everywhere one after another the grain ships glided past the aphrodite the men aboard them no doubt thought them majestic to menedemos wallowing seemed a better word they sailed well enough with the wind right behind them as it was now trying to tack against it though they were so slow as to be nearly helpless a sailor on the aphrodite shouted i hope real pirates get you you figsuckers that went too far by the dog teleutas keep quiet menedemos hissed they arent our enemies no but theyre acting like a bunch of widearsed little pricks teleutas answered menedemos snorted out an exasperated breath hed had teleutas aboard for three sailing seasons in a row now and he kept wondering why the man did as little as he could to get by he wasnt particularly brave he wasnt even an entertaining sort to make up for his other lacks if he keeps on like this id do better to leave him behind next year menedemos thought let him drive some other captain crazy hed certainly hit a nerve aboard ptolemaios transports mention of pirates did with honest sailors the sailors who heard him screamed abuse at the aphrodite they made obscene gestures they shook their fists one of them even threw something at the merchant galley whatever it was it splashed into the inner sea far short of its goal teleutas laughed a mocking laugh which only inflamed the men from alexandria more they know who we are sostratos said unhappily they wont forget theyll blacken our name in every port ptolemaios holdsand he holds a lot of them i know menedemos said what can i do about it now except maybe pitch teleutas over the side nothing his cousin scuffed a bare foot across the planks of the poop deck im the one who took him on a couple of years ago there right before we sailed ive been sorry at least half a dozen times since i had the same thought menedemos answered he doesnt really pull his weight and he does get into troubleand get us into trouble but hes never made me quite angry enough at him to sail off without him and i did bark at the alexandrians before he did curse it i guess im likely not the first captain hes aggravated thats all well there goes the last grain ship sostratos said many goodbyes to thembut i wouldnt wish pirates on anybody no neither would i menedemos said and then well hardly anybody he couldnt tell by the coastline where lykia stopped and pamphylia beganthe difference lay in the people not the landscape but olbia a strong fortress on the far side of the kataraktes river unquestionably belonged to pamphylia the kataraktes lived up to its name rushing down from the mountains in back of olbia toward the sea and booming over the rocks as it came menedemos used to the little rhodian streams that dried up in the summertime eyed the river with no small wonder sostratos smiled at him and asked if you think this is such a marvel what will you make of the nile if we go to alexandria one day i havent the faintest idea my dear menedemos replied but the nile im sure doesnt make such a racket as it flows into the inner sea no indeed youre right about that his cousin agreed the cataracts of the nile are thousands of stadia up the stream herodotos talks about them herodotos talks about everything doesnt he he was curious he traveled all over the known world to find out what really happened and how it happened and most important of all why it happened if it werent for him there might not be any such thing as history today and would we be any worse off if there werent menedemos murmured that horrified sostratos no less than teleutas had horrified ptolemaios sailors menedemos had hoped it would but then sostratos gave him a sour smile youre trying to poke me again im sorry best one but i dont feel like being poked no eh menedemos used a finger to poke his cousin in the ribs sostratos yelped then he snapped at the finger as if he were a dog menedemos jerked it back in a hurry they both laughed menedemos said if you think i look tasty you havent been taking enough opson with your sitos you need to eat better if i wanted to eat well all the time i wouldnt go to sea sostratos answered stale bread cheese olives dried fish not your opsophagos feast and what you can get in a portside tavern isnt much better you cant catch enough fish from an akatos to make for much in the way of fancy opson and even if you could you couldnt cook it in any particularly interesting ways nothing wrong with grilling a fish on a brazier menedemos said these fancy chefs who want to smother everything in cheese arent half so smart as they think they are dont let your sikon hear that sostratos warned him hell throw you out of his kitchen on your ear oh no menedemos tossed his head sikons a good cook but that doesnt mean hes always fancy he says sometimes cooks use those complicated spicy sauces because they dont want you to know theyve botched the cooking of the fish itself i wouldnt want to argue with him neither would i by zeus menedemos said nobody in his right mind would want to pick a quarrel with sikon hes one of those slaves whove been there forever and think the place is really theirs and thats part of the trouble hes having with baukis she thinks he has to watch every obolos partly that and partly shes my fathers second wife so she doesnt think she gets the respect she deserves menedemos laughed he could talk about even think about baukis as long as he did so impersonally he went on and of course sikon doesnt give anybody any more respect than he has to and not as much as he should thats why they squabble all the time what does your father say as little as he can he doesnt want to make baukis angry but he doesnt want to make sikon angry either menedemos rolled his eyes if he were as mild with me as he is with them wed get along a lot better if he wont do anything to end the bickering isnt ending the bickering your place sostratos asked well it might be if i werent at sea half the year and i dont want to get stuck in the middle of the quarrel either sikons a jewel i dont want him mad at me and i dont want to get my stepmotherhe chuckled at that the idea still struck him as absurdupset either that might make my father give me an even harder time than he does already what he wanted to do with baukis to baukis would make his father give him something worse than a hard time so far here as in few other places his will had ruled his desires that was what a man was supposed to do having desires was one thing acting on them when they were foolish something else again in the iliad both agamemnon and akhilleus had put their individual desires above what was good for the stronggreaved akhaioi and both had suffered because of it you do make sense sostratos said you make more sense than usual as a matter of fact he reached out and set a hand on menedemos forehead are you feeling all right my dear i was till you started bothering me menedemos shook the hand away his cousin laughed that sounds more like you are you enough like yourself to answer a question depends on what it is menedemos replied more than once sostratos had asked why he seemed quieter and gloomier than usual hed given either evasive replies or none he didnt intend to tell sostratos or anyone else what he thought about his fathers second wife what he wanted to do with her but sostratos had something else in mind from where along the coast do you want to sail for cyprus ah menedemos beamed at his cousin that was a completely legitimate question and one hed been thinking about himself id like to go a good deal farther east before i swing the ship south across the inner sea the shortest passage between the mainland and the island i think is about four hundred stadia yes i believe thats about right sostratos agreed my only reservation is this whole southern coast of anatolialykia pamphylia kilikiacrawls with pirates i was just wondering if youd weighed the risk of a longer voyage over the open sea against that of an attack as we make our way east not easy to do menedemos said slowly there are always risks when you cross the open sea you cant avoid them thats why you stay within sight of land whenever you canunless youre going somewhere downhill so to speak the way alexandria is from cyprus where you can really count on the wind wafting you along during the sailing season pirates now pirates are different they might not bother us at all and theres no risk to sailing east if they dont of course theres a risk sostratos said they might attack thats what makes a risk if we knew they would attack it wouldnt be a risk any more it would be a certainty have it your way then i think were saying the same thing in different words but i dont know how to weigh the one risk against the other since its easier to gauge the risk of sailing across the open sea thats the one i want to cut out as far as i can all right sostratos said im not sure i agree with you but im not sure i dont either youre the captain would k make you happier if i talk to diokles before i finally make up my mind menedemos asked sostratos dipped his head im always happy when you talk to diokles hes forgotten more in the way of seamanship than most people ever learn im not interested in what hes forgotten im interested in what he remembers but the oarmaster proved less helpful than menedemos had hoped he scratched his chin as he thought it over at last he said ive seen skippers do both matter of fact six oboloi to the drakhma either way well in that case im going to keep sailing along the coast here as id planned menedemos said even if a pirate does look us over we arent likely to have to fight him most of them want easy pickingsa round ship with only a few sailors aboard thats too slow to run away and too weak to fight back they can see that wed give em a good battle even if they did manage to catch us most of them can diokles agreed of course theres always the odd bastard you cant count on like that fellow in the strait between andros and euboia last season menedemos relayed most of diokles opinion to sostratos he didnt mention the pirate whod attacked them the previous sailing season he knew what his cousin would do on hearing about that pirate and his crew he would start cursing them for stealing the gryphons skull menedemos had heard those curses too many times to want to listen to them again sostratos said its your choice to make i hope it turns out well youre not going to make doleful comments like that till we get to cyprus are you menedemos asked they dont make the crew very happy you know oh yes ill keep my mouth shut i do know the difference between what i can say to you and what i can say when the sailors are listening believe me i hope so but menedemos didnt press it his cousin had always been good about keeping his opinions to himself when they might damage morale to change the subject menedemos asked shall we find the market square here you never can tell what they might have yes we might as well because you never can by sostratos expression he hoped for another gryphon s skull but he also remembered the practical side a merchant needed for he went on and ill bring some perfume along you never can tell what we might sell either no indeed menedemos said if we sold a book in phaselis by the gods we can sell anything anywhere but olbias agora close by the harbor proved a disappointment it wasnt that the market square had nothing for sale only that it had nothing to warm the heart of an akatos captain the olbians bought and sold grain and olives and local wine and dried and fresh fish and plain pots all useful stuff but none of it worth menedemos while there was also a separate timber market next to the main agora but that didnt interest him either round ships would do splendid business here he said as for us he put a hand in front of his mouth as if hiding a yawn i know sostratos sounded gloomy too you couldnt imagine a more ordinary place if you tried for a year he raised his voice nevertheless perfume fine perfume from rhodian roses people walked by without even looking i wonder if they have noses here menedemos grumbled by the way some of them smell i doubt it fine rhodian perfume sostratos called again before going on in a lower voice you never can tell that hetaira in miletos last summer oh you lucky dog menedemos said that she wanted silk was one thing that she wanted you too such things happened to him now and again he hadnt expected them to happen to his staid cousin thinking along with him sostratos answered you cant have all the luck all the time you know some of it has to stick to other people too oh why menedemos asked thats an argument for another day my dear sostratos said as he held out a jar of perfume to a passerby from rhodes the finest the passerby kept walking sostratos shoulders slumped this is the hardest part of the business for me telling strangers they ought to buy something from me i mean well how will they know if you dont tell them menedemos asked reasonably i keep telling myself the same thing sostratos said it helps but only so much then i remember how it annoys me when im walking through the agora at rhodes to have some loudmouthed quicktalking fellow from another polis stick something under my nose and tell me i cant hope to live another day without it whatever it is but you buy every once in a while dont you menedemos said i know i do yes but i always feel like a fool afterwards sostratos said thats not the point menedemos said the point is every so often somebody will part with his silver and who cares how he feels afterwards as if to prove the point they did make some sales the first was to a hellene a few years older than they were who said i just got married a couple of months ago i think my wife would like this dont you would you expect us to say no sostratos asked pay no attention to him best one menedemos told the prospective customer hes too honest for his own good he laughed so did the newly wed hellene after a moment halfheartedly so did sostratos the local himself smelled powerfully of fish fish scales glinted on his arms and legs and on his chiton probably in the driedfish trade menedemos judged whatever trade he was in he made good money at it for he paid the rhodians price with little haggling menedemos didnt doubt the trade of the next fellow who stopped before them the sword on his belt and the scars on his face and right arm proclaimed him a soldier so did his macedonian accent which was so thick as to be almost unintelligible little by little menedemos gathered that he wanted the perfume for a hetaira named gnathaina ah she calls herself after her jaw eh menedemos had to tap his own jawgnatbos in greekto get the macedonian to understand what he meant aye so she do the soldier said at last well friend is she good with that jaw of hers menedemos asked with a wink the macedonian didnt follow that at all he did buy the perfume though which was what really mattered they made their biggest sale of the day as the sun sank in the direction of lykia the fellow who bought several jars was plump and prosperous as smoothly shaven a man as menedemos had ever seen he couldnt decide if the local was hellene or pamphylian most of the people hereabouts spoke greek with the same slightly nasal accent whatever he was the olbian already smelled sweet he also haggled with great enthusiasm and persistence and he got a better price for his perfume than either the newlywed or the macedonian after hed clasped hands on the bargain he said my girls will be happy to daub this stuff on your girls a lamp went on in menedemos head you keep a brothel thats right the sleek fellow answered ill do plenty of extra business on account of this too men want their girls smelling good not all sweaty and nasty he hesitated a moment later when he asked you and your friend here feel like one on the house menedemos understood why generosity warring with a brothelkeepers usual stinginess for a wonder generosity won what do you think menedemos asked expecting his cousin to toss his head but sostratos said why not been awhile since i had a little fun he turned to the brothelkeeper the sun will probably have set by the time we have to go back to the harbor will you give us a torchbearer to light the way certainly best one the man said youll be a paying customer if you come for another go tomorrow or i may want to buy something else from you either way i cant afford to have you knocked over the head he sounded perfectly serious as if he wouldnt have cared what happened to the rhodians if it werent for the off chance he might do business with them again one day and he probably wouldnt traveling all over the inner sea menedemos had got to know a fair number of brothelkeepers their trade made them hard and remorselessly practical well come on the fellow said now he sounded resigned he might be regretting his impulse of a moment before but without any good way to go back on it no point to bringing more than a drakhma or so along menedemos said pointedly sostratos got the hint and dipped his head they both took leather pouches from their belts and stowed them on the aphrodite the brothelkeeper watched attentively menedemos wanted him to this way he wouldnt decide robbery made good business the brothel lay only a few blocks from the harbor and the agora menedemos thought he could have found his way back on his own still though a torchbearer who knew olbia would be welcome navigating in a strange town by moon and starlight wasnt something menedemos wanted to try unless he had to and that would be all the light there was if he and sostratos came back by themselves no one wasted torches or lamp oil to light the streets after sunset inside the brothel some of the dozen or so women were spinning wool into thread which made the brothelkeeper money even when they werent lying with men three or four others played dice for khalkoi or oboloi a couple of others ate bread and olive oil and drank watered wine they werent nakedthey hadnt been expecting business but none of them veiled her face as a respectable woman or even perhaps or especially a highclass hetaira would have done as far as menedemos was concerned that was exciting enough by itself take your pick friends the brothelkeeper told the rhodians he held up the perfume jars to the women i got this essence of roses for you from these fellows i want whichever of you they pick to give em a good time menedemos pointed to one of the women playing knucklebones come on sweetheart yes you all right i come she answered resignedly in accented greek she was about his age swarthy with a prominent nose and hair so black it was almost blue she wasnt beautifulas well hope to find a ruby the size of a mans thumb as a beautiful girl in a harborside whorehousebut she wasnt ugly either as she got to her feet sostratos picked a woman too one of those whod been spinning menedemos hadnt given her a second glance and had other things on his mind now the whore hed chosen took him to a little room that held a bed a stool and not much else as menedemos shut the door behind them he asked what do i call you she looked at him in surprise most men do not bother to ask you can call me armene it is not my name but hellenes cannot say my name that means youre from armenia doesnt it he said he had a vague idea where the place was somewhere in eastern anatolia or the caucasus he didnt think hed ever met anyone from that land before armene nodded which by itself would have proved her no hellene yes my valley had no rain two years in a row my father sold me to a slave trader to keep me alive and let him and my mother buy food so they could live too the slave trader sold me to kritias here and so she shrugged once and then shrugging again pulled her long chiton off over her head her body was stocky but still curved her breasts large and heavy and tipped with dark nipples though a barbarian shed taken up the hellenic custom of singeing away the hair between her legs menedemos took off his tunic too and sat down on the edge of the bed i am a gift for you yes armene said tell me what you want then she couldnt keep a certain apprehension from her voice hed heard that in other brothels the women had no choice and knew it too well menedemos stretched out on the bed come here lie down beside me she did the bed was narrow for two side by side her breasts brushed his chest her legs bumped his she gave him a worried look i am sorry its all right he squeezed her breasts then lowered his head to them surprisingly often even a slave in a brothel would take pleasure if a man worked a little to give it to her menedemos caressed her he stroked her between her legs as a rhodian hetaira had taught him to do a long time before after a while though armene set her hand on his you are a kind man she said but i do not kindle i do this but i do not enjoy it all right i thought id try he said and she nodded again he rolled onto his back why dont you ride me like a racehorse if the brothelkeeperkritias armene had called himwas going to give him a present hed take the most expensive one he could get if he were paying for it having the girl climb on top would have cost him more than bending her forward or bending her back she nodded as she swung herself over him i thought you would ask this why because i am doing the work she answered she took him in hand and guided him into her then slowly began to move her breasts hung just above his face like sweet ripe fruit he leaned up a little and teased her nipples with his tongue she kept methodically moving up and down up and down before long menedemos was moving too driving his spear home with every thrust his hands clutched her meaty buttocks the bed squeaked under the two of them as his delight peaked he went into her as deeply as he could holding her against him till the spasm of pleasure passed then laughing he said you see you didnt do all the work no not all armene agreed as she slid off him some of his seed dribbled down onto his hipbone good she said the more out the less in to make a baby that wasnt menedemos worry he rubbed the stuff off of him and onto the mattress cover while armene squatted over a chamber pot she pulled out from under the bed hed seen more than a few women whores and bored wives alike assume that position after making love hed heard more than a few of them say the same thing too he and armene both dressed with a conspiratorial grin he gave her a couple of oboloi whispering dont tell kritias she popped the little silver coins into her mouth she and menedemos went out into the waiting room sostratos and the woman hed chosen emerged from her chamber a few minutes later menedemos still thought her plain by the way she smiled now though sostratos had made her enjoy their time together menedemos laughed to himself he tried to please women because when they took pleasure it added to his own sostratos he suspected did it for its own sake he hadnt asked his cousin about that but sostratos also looked pretty contented now the whores had lit lamps in the waiting room boy kritias the brothelkeeper shouted no one appeared kritias muttered to himself boy he shouted again get your lazy worthless carcass in here before i sell you to a silver miner i know that brought the slavea scrawny youth of about fourteenon the run maybe kritias was joking the boy didnt care to take the chance slaves sent to the mines seldom lasted long what you need boss he asked light a torch and take these fellows back to the harbor then hurry back here i know how long you need to get there and back if you dont hurry ill make you sorry ill hurry ill hurry under his breath the slave added something that wasnt greek the torch hissed and popped and crackled as it caught from a lamp the boy nodded to menedemos and sostratos lets go have a good time diokles asked when they got back to the aphrodite hard to have a bad time with a woman wouldnt you say sostratos answered he handed the slave an obolos the youth stuck the coin in his cheek and went back into olbia sostratos continued she said her mother sold her into slavery to keep them both from starving did she menedemos said the girl i was with said her father sold her for the same reason he shrugged they both might have been telling the truth yes but they both might have been lying to make us feel sorry for them and give them a little something sostratos said you have to be foolish to believe much of what you hear from a whore in a brothel i suppose but from now on ill believe even less menedemos took off his chiton crumpled it into a ball and laid it on the poop deck he wrapped himself in his mantle and lay down for the night sostratos imitated him the timbers were hard but menedemos didnt mind he slept aboard the merchant galley often enough during the sailing season to be used to the way they felt he yawned twisted a couple of times said good night to his cousin and slept the aphrodite crawled east along the southern coast of anatolia from pamphylia into kilikia every so often when she went farther from shore than usual sostratos got glimpses of cyprus lying low on the southern horizon hed never come so far east but the island didnt excite him as it would have had it been the merchant galleys destination as things were he looked forward to visiting it for a little while and then pressing on toward phoenicia some of the towns on cyprus are phoenician you know menedemos reminded him they planted colonies there at the same time we hellenes did yes yes of course sostratos said impatientlyeveryone knew that but we probably wont stop at any of them before we go farther east will we menedemos tossed his head i hadnt planned to no i was going to round that eastern peninsula the island has and then sail down to salamis and thats a hellenic city from salamis you go straight across the inner sea to phoenicia all right sostratos sighed id have liked a chance to practice my aramaic before we got there though well when you were picking a girl in that brothel in olbia you should have asked if any of them could make those funny noises menedemos said sostratos stared at his cousin in astonishment by the dog of egypt youre right i should have slaves come from all over the place one of them probably did speak it i never would have thought of that to be fair my dear you didnt go there to talk menedemos said diokles laughed he sent menedemos a reproachful look confound it skipper you made me mess up the rowers stroke too bad menedemos said with a grin why didnt that occur to me though sostratos asked himself ignoring both of them we could have screwed and talked and talked and talked menedemos said if youd found a woman who spoke aramaic you probably wouldnt have bothered getting her clothes off not likely sostratos said what he had to say though menedemos might have been right would he have been too interested in talking with a woman to bother bedding her it wasnt certain but he knew it wasnt impossible either while sostratos pondered that his cousin pulled one of the aphrodites steeringoar tillers in toward him and pushed the other away the akatos swung toward the south away from the kilikian coast and toward the island ahead the yard had run from the port bow back toward the stern on the starboard side to take best advantage of the northerly breeze as the aphrodite sailed east now with the ship running before the wind the sailors hurried to straighten the yard even before menedemos gave orders we have a good crew sostratos thought they know their business he looked back past the akatos sternpost the stretch of sea between the ship and the mainland grew wider and wider in most circumstances that would have filled him with foreboding not here not when every stadion farther from kilikia meant a stadion closer to cyprus the sun shone brightly from a blue sky dotted by only a handful of puffy white clouds a storm seemed unimaginable sostratos resolutely refused to imagine one and tried not to remember the squall off the lykian coast instead he turned to menedemos and said we ought to make the island by nightfall tomorrow yes that seems about right his cousin said if id turned south earlier today id sail on after nightfall tonight steering by the stars but well be at sea all night either way so i dont see much point to it one night at sea shouldnt be bad sostratos pointed down to the blue blue water look isnt that a turtle i didnt see it menedemos answered but ive heard they lay eggs on that eastern promontory hardly anybody lives there though so i dont know for sure heretake the tillers for a minute will you ive got to piss when sostratos did take hold of the tillers he felt rather like herakles taking the weight of the world so atlas could go after the golden apples of the hesperides menedemos handled the steering oars from dawn till dusk every day the only difference was atlas had intended to walk away from the job for good menedemos would take it back in a moment sostratos felt the aphrodite motion much more intimately through the tillers than he did with the soles of his feet the slightest swing of the steering oars made the ship change direction they were strong enough to control the akatos course despite the best efforts of the rowers she could have got along perfectly well with only one though the second did make her easier to handle no rain today sostratos said to menedemos back as his cousin eased himself over the side no godsdetested round ships coming out of the rain either thered better not be menedemos said with a laugh that wasnt my fault sostratos exclaimed hed been steering a year before when a merchantman loomed out of the rain and struck the aphrodite a glancing blow carrying away one steering oar and staving in some portside timbers shed had to limp back to kos and wait for repairs which took much longer than anyone had expected menedemos shook himself off and let his chiton fall well so it wasnt he said had he tried to say anything else sostratos would have given him all the argument he wanted and then a little more besides as things were sostratos just said may i steer a little while longer he scanned the sea theres nothing for me to run intoi dont even see any dolphins right now all right go ahead menedemos made as if to bow ill stand around being useless if youre saying thats what i do when im not steering ill have something to say to you too sostratos replied menedemos only laughed a tern flew out from the direction of the mainland and perched on the yard the blackcapped bird cocked its head now this way now that as it peered down into the sea laughing still menedemos said all right o best of toikharkhoiwhat fare do we charge for taking him to cyprus if he pays us a sprat were ahead of the game sostratos answered if he shits in a sailors hair were behind and we tell him well never take him anywhere else after perhaps a quarter of an hour the tern took off and plunged headfirst into the water of the inner sea it emerged a moment later with a fish just above sprat size in its beak instead of returning to the yard it flew over the aphrodite and away it must have clamped down on the stillwiggling fish for the last couple of digits width of the tail fell at sostratos feet there you see he told menedemos i wish some of the people we deal with would pay us so promptly well thats the truth and i cant tell you otherwise his cousin said menedemos let him steer for about an hour then took back the tillers as sostratos stepped away from them he did feel useless most of what you do on a trading run you do ashore he reminded himself he knew that was true but it made him feel no more useful at this moment he looked back past the stern again hack past the ships boat that followed the aphrodite almost as the great dog and the little dog followed orion through the night sky of winter not long after menedemos took the tillers aristeidas spotted a sail off to starboard sostratos peered east himself he might have got a glimpse of a pale sail right at the edge of the horizon or he might have imagined it he couldnt tell did he really see it or did he imagine he saw it because sharpsighted aristeidas said it was there plenty of men believed things for no better reason than that someone they respected whether rightly or wronglysaid it was so am i one of the herd maybe i am then the lynxeyed lookout said gone nowunder the horizon must have seen us and not wanted to find out what we were if we were pirates they wouldnt get free of us so easy menedemos said wed be after them like a hound after a hare and wed catch them too no place to hide on the seathey couldnt duck into a hole or under a thorn bush the way a hare can cyprus was visibly closer than the anatolian mainland when with the setting of the sun the aphrodites anchors splashed into the inner sea sostratos washed down barley rolls cheese onions and briny olives with watered wine i should have kept the fish tail the tern dropped he said it would be the fanciest opson ive got an opsophagos who goes to sea for the fish is going to be disappointed most of the time menedemos answered yes hes right above all those beauties but how often does he ever see them somebody caught a lovely mullet last yearremember sostratos said yesone mullet for one sailor out of the whole crew menedemos said those arent good odds you know too true sostratos agreed but i do wonder what sort of interesting fish they catch off cyprus and phoenicia we found out some of the people thereabouts dont eat fish at all and you say your ioudaioi wont eat pork isnt that right menedemos said sostratos dipped his head his cousin laughed who can guess why barbarians have the strange customs they do if they didnt theyd be hellenes once more sostratos quoted herodotos quoting pindaros custom is king of all thats true wherever one goes im sure with hellenes as well as barbarians by the next afternoon he could clearly see the forested hills of cyprus eastern spike of land hawks wheeled above the woods now and then one would swoop down after prey it could see and sostratos couldnt a gull that was resting contentedly on the masthead took off all at once with a harsh squawk of fear and a mad flapping of wings the falcon that flew past paid it no heed but went on its way straight and swift as an arrow splendid bird sostratos murmured the gull didnt think so menedemos said yes the gull hared out of there sostratos replied and his cousin made a face at the pun on laros and lagos sostratos smiled as far as he was concerned that pun welcomed him to cyprus menedemos looked ahead to the port approaching on his right hand thanks to favorable winds theyd reached it on the second afternoon after coming to cyprus he pointed toward the narrow mouth of the harbor theres a place with a famous name salamis sostratos answered yes my dear i should hope so its a name that means liberty for all hellenes a name that means xerxes the persian king watching from the shore as his ships were beaten he laughed the only trouble is its the wrong salamis for that yes i know menedemos said wondering if his cousin thought him so ignorant as not to know i wonder how a town in cyprus got the same name as an island off the coast of attica then he snapped his fingers no i dont wonder i know tell me sostratos said teukros founded this salamis didnt he menedemos said so they say sostratos answered well then teukros was telamons bastard right menedemos waited for his cousin to dip his head then continued and whos telamons legitimate son youre the one who knows the iliad backwards and forwards sostratos said oh come on menedemos said everybody knows this one telamons son is aias sostratos supplied the right answer menedemos clapped his hands sostratos went on i see i have it now because there are two hellenic heroes named aias in the iliad there must be two places named salamis by the sea no no no menedemos exclaimed only then did he notice the wicked gleam in his cousins eye youyou cacodaemon he burst out sostratos laughed out loud menedemos glared at him now youre going to hear the right answer curse it you scoffer you sostratos bowed as if at a compliment menedemos doggedly plowed ahead teukros founded this salamisand alas his half brother was lord of the salamis in attica he quoted the iliad and aias from salamis led twoandten ships and having led them placed them where the athenians formations stood so you see this salamis is named for the other onein spite of your dreadful jokes some people say the athenians put those two lines into the catalogue of ships themselves to justify their claim to the island of salamis sostratos said that rocked menedemos to him homer s poems were perfect and unchanging as they passed from one generation to the next adding lines for political reasons seemed as vile as adulterating barley for the sake of profit but if people did the latterand they didwhy not the former too his cousin added cant fault your argument though if aias was lord of salamis and if teukros founded this salamis this one is named after the other you can think logically when you want to if only youd want to more often menedemos hardly noticed the gibe he was thinking about the rest of the iliad aias wasnt associated with menestheus of athens anywhere but in the catalogue of ships as best he could remember his ships were sometimes mentioned as lying alongside those protesilaosfirst to land at troy and first to die therehad brought from phylake up in thessalia he sometimes fought in the company of the other smaller aias except in that one passage he had nothing to do with the athenians filthy menedemos muttered whats that sostratos asked perverting the iliad for the sake of politics sostratos smile looked anything but pleasant shall i really disgust you how menedemos asked do i want to know i dont know do you sostratos returned heres how there are a couple of lines in place of the ones you quoted lines that tie salamis to megara which also claimed it in the old days but those lines dont say how many ships aias led to troy the way the catalogue of ships does for all the other places and heroes so they probably arent genuine either well what did homer truly say then menedemos asked he cant have left aias out of the picture altogetheraias is too great a warrior hes the only one among the stronggreaved akhaioi who keeps fighting back when hektor goes on his rampage the poet wouldntcouldnt have just forgotten him in the catalogue of ships his cousin shrugged i agree with you that doesnt seem likely and both the athenian lines and the ones from megara are suspect i dont think theres any way now to find out what homer first sang that bothered menedemos too he wanted to think homer s words had passed inviolate from generation to generation so much of what being a hellene meant was contained in the iliad and odyssey of course one of the things being a hellene meant was carefully examining the world in which you lived homer s poems were part of the world in which all hellenes lived and so menedemos still wished people had kept their hands and minds off them musing thus he almost took the aphrodite right past the opening to salamis harbor it was even narrower than that leading into the great harbor at rhodes with room for no more than ten or twelve ships abreast if hed daydreamed any longer he would have had to double back to go in in the akatos that would have drawn jeers from sostratos and silent scornwhich might have hurt morefrom diokles in a round ship that had to beat back against the wind it would have been worse than merely embarrassing when the aphrodite did enter the harbor it was full of ships big war galleys displaying ptolemaios eagle a few on lowered sails all on banners at stern and bow little fishing boats some of them no more than oneman rowboats and everything in between same sort of jumble as we saw at kos last year diokles remarked even worse i do believe sostratos said about one merchantman in three looks like a phoenician ive never seen so many foreignlooking ships all in one place i think youre right menedemos said telling phoenician ships from those sailed by hellenes wasnt usually a matter of lines both folk built their vessels in much the same way but a thousand things from the choice of paints to the shape of the eyes the ships carried at their prows to the way the lines were coiled to the fact that phoenician sailors stayed fully clothed even in warm weather shouted that those vessels belonged to barbarians i wonder if we seem as strange to them as they do to us sostratos said if we do too bad by the gods menedemos said they fought for the great king against alexander and they lost and theyd better get used to it diokles pointed theres a mooring space skipper menedemos wished a phoenician ship were making for it too he could get there first and score his own triumph over the barbarians as things were he had no competition the aphrodite slid into the space the rowers backed oars for a few strokes to stop her in the water then rested on the oars and shipped them bringing them inboard sailors tossed lines to longshoremen who made the merchant galley fast to the quay one of the salaminians asked what ship have we here whence come ye smiling a little at the oldfashioned cypriot dialect menedemos answered were the aphrodite out of rhodes he named himself and sostratos gods give ye good day o best ones the local said and what cargo bring ye hither sostratos spoke up we have ink and papyrus koan silk rhodian perfume the finest olive oil from our native land books to make the time pass by lykian hams and smoked eels from phaselisthey melt in your mouth and melt silver from you too i doubt not the salaminian said with a longing sigh he glanced down toward the base of the quay and now meseems you shall answer these same questions over again and more besides sure enough a soldier strode importantly toward the aphrodite at almost every port the past couple of years menedemos thought sourly soldiers had had questions for him and sostratos sometimes they belonged to antigonos sometimes as now to ptolemaios who paid them didnt matter with so many of them mercenaries it often didnt matter even to them their attitude was always the same that a mere merchant skipper ought to go to the closest temple to offer sacrifice in thanks that they didnt take everything he had this one was an exceptionally big man with fair skin weathered bronze and with piercing gray eyes when he barked who are you he proved to have his own accent very different from that of the longshoreman if he wasnt a macedonian menedemos had never heard one were the aphrodite out of rhodes menedemos answered as he had before then because he couldnt resist he added and who are you im kleob the macedonian probably kleoboulos caught himself i ask the questions he roared have you got that its none of your godsdetested business who i am have you got that sostratos clucked reproachfully as menedemos had been sure he would he had a point too getting smart with macedonians wasnt the wisest thing menedemos might have done have you got that the officer shouted again yes o marvelous one menedemos said sostratos clucked again but the macedonian as menedemos had hoped took irony for frightened politeness thats better he growled now tell me your cargo and no more back talk menedemos let sostratos do that after his cousin had gone down the list the officer ran a hand through his graystreaked auburn hair books whos going to buy books people who like to read sostratos suggested the macedonian tossed his head plainly the idea was alien to him he shrugged and found another question where are you bound phoenicia menedemos answered unwillingly were going to trade for scarlet dye and balsam and whatever else we can find are you those gray eyes went hard and predatory or are you here spying for antigonos the cyclops by the gods menedemos exclaimed last year we did a service for ptolemaios and now his servant calls us spies i like that a service what sort of service his laundry did you fetch him a clean chiton or two the officer jeered or did you bend over and give him a different kind of service youre pretty enough he mightve enjoyed that and so might you accusing a free adult male hellene of playing the boy for another man was one of the nastier insults someone could hurl menedemos steamed his hands balled into fists easy sostratos murmured easy ill tell him to but menedemos caught himself in rhodes he could have told the macedonian anything he pleased not here cyprian salamis was ptolemaios city one of the lord of egypts officers carried far more weight than a merchant skipper from a distant polis mastering himself wasnt easy but menedemos did it no sir he told the macedonian in the iciest tones he could summon last year he brought polemaios son of polemaios from khalkis on the island of euboia to ptolemaios who was then staying at the city of kos on the island of the same name the officer gaped whatever answer hed expected that wasnt it he tried to rally a likely story what did he pay you for it one talent of silver of his own weight sostratos answered i have it listed in the accounts here would you care to examine them no the macedonian growled he spun on his heel and clumped back up the pier scarlet cape billowing around him euge menedemos said but tell me why on earth have you brought last years accounts along his cousin was mad for keeping every little detail straight but that seemed excessive even for him sostratos grinned oh i havent but by the way he laughed at the idea that anyone might want to buy a book i guessed he probably didnt have his letters and that turned out to be right thats sly young sir diokles said admiringly thats mighty sly it seemed reasonable sostratos answered shrugging but i want to say euge to my cousin when that macedonian oaf reviled him he didnt lose his temper he stayed calm and the macedonian ended up playing the fool menedemos wasntemphatically wasntused to praise from sostratos his cousin was more apt to call him things like a thickskulled bonehead who thought with his prick he was used to that this though thank you very much my dear he said are you sure youre well quite sure thanks sostratos answered and i thinkthough i cant be so sureyou may be starting to grow up at last me menedemos tossed his head its not likely let me tell you i dont know sostratos said my guess is a couple of years ago you would have called him something filthy you got out of aristophanes and that would have spilled the perfume into the soup menedemos thought it over much as he would have liked to he couldnt deny it now he shrugged i didnt and thats all there is to it now maybe these cisternarsed tittygropers will leave us alone and let us get some business done eryes sostratos said more aristophanes of course my dear menedemos answered only the best when sostratos and menedemos walked into salamis market square the next morning sostratos stopped stared in delight and pointed look he exclaimed phoenicians lots of phoenicians sure enough many of the men in the agora were swarthy and hooknosed and wore long robes despite what promised to be a warm day the harsh gutturals of their language mixed with the rhythmic rise and fall of greek sostratos cousin laughed at him well of course there are lots of phoenicians here my dear menedemos said were close to the phoenician coast there are phoenician towns on cyprus and all those phoenician ships in the harbor didnt get here without sailors and merchants in em no of course not sostratos said but now i get to find out if they understand my aramaicand i understand theirs i thought wed run into more of them in lykia and pamphylia and kilikia buthe shruggedwe didnt its the war menedemos said antigonos rules phoenicia but ptolemaios just took the southern coast of anatolia away from him the phoenicians are probably nervous about going there maybebut maybe not too sostratos said ptolemaios also holds cyprus so why dont the phoenicians stay away from salamis for one thing like i said kition and some other phoenician cities are here on cyprus and ptolemaios holds them too menedemos answered for another hes held cyprus longer so things here have settled down and for a third if phoenicians dont come here they dont come anywhere since he was manifestly right sostratos didnt argue with him instead he went up to the closest phoenician merchant a fellow whod set up a stand with jars of crimson dye good day my master sostratos said in aramaic his heart thumping nervously would you tell your servant what city you are from speaking greek he wouldnt have cared to sound so submissive even to a macedonian marshal but aramaic as hed discovered to his frequent dismay did things differently the phoenician blinked then showed white white teeth in an enormous grin an ionian who speaks my language he said in aramaic all hellenes were ionians and may i go through the fire if you didnt learn it from a man of byblos am i right my master or am i wrong from a man of byblos yes sostratos had all he could do not to dance with delight this fellow had followed his aramaic and hed understood the reply that grin got wider yet your servant is from sidon the phoenician said bowing i am called abibaal son of eshmunhillek and how does my master call himself sostratos gave his own name and that of his father he also introduced menedemos adding he speaks no aramaic that is only a small thing abibaal replied he bowed to menedemos as he had to sostratos and said hail my master in good greek hail menedemos replied he chuckled and poked sostratos in the ribs with an elbow see he knows greek yes he does sostratos said patiently but before long well be getting to places where people dont would you rather go on in greek abibaal asked in that language no sostratos said in aramaic and tossed his head i want to use your speech please abibaal gave him another bow it shall be as you desire in all ways of course would your heart be gladdened to think on the many fine qualities of the crimson dye i have here he patted one of the jars on his little display i do not know sostratos answered a useful phrase he paused to think then went on how much more charge you here than in sidon that made abibaal blink and then laugh eshmun smite me if my master is not a merchant himself yes sostratos dipped his head then he remembered to nod instead it felt most unnatural please answer your servants question if you would be so generous surely sir you know a man must make a profit to live and yes yes sostratos said impatiently you must make a profit but i must make a profit too he pointed first to the sidonian then to himself to make sure he was understood some of abibaals patience began to wear thin i charge only a twelfth part more here in salamis than in my own city sostratos returned to greek to speak to menedemos come on lets go whats the matter his cousin asked you sounded like you had something stuck in your throat and couldnt get it out as the two rhodians started on their way abibaal called after them in greek what is the trouble best ones whatever it is i can make it right no you lied to me sostratos told him sticking to greek himself now no man would take such a small extra charge after shipping his goods across the sea how can i trust you when you will not tell me the truth you will find no finer dye anywhere in phoenicia abibaal said that may be or it may not because you lied to me before i have a harder time believing you now sostratos answered but whether its so or not im sure i can find cheaper dye there and i intend to you told him menedemos said as the dye merchant from sidon stared after them i dont like being taken for a fool sostratos could in fact think of few things he liked less after muttering darkly to himself he went on actually my dear youll be the one buying dye and such in the coastal cities i aim to go to that engedi place and buy balsam straight from the source i know what you aim to do menedemos didnt sound happy one hellene wandering through a country full of barbarians where he barely speaks the language i did well enough with abibaal and maybe you would again but maybe you wouldnt too his cousin said besides a lone traveler is asking to be robbed and murdered i would like to see you again would you i didnt know you cared sostratos batted his eyelashes menedemos laughed but sostratos wasnt about to be deflected from his purpose weve been talking about this since the end of last summer you knew i was going to do it yes but the more i think about what it means the less i like it menedemos replied sostratos started to get angry before he could say anything though menedemos continued why dont you take four or five sailors with you bandits would think twice before they bothered a band of armed men i dont want sostratos checked himself it wasnt the worst idea hed ever heard he still saw difficulties with it though they speak nothing but greek id have to translate for them all the time and sailors being what they are ashore theyd want to spend their time pouring down wine and bedding women not traveling and bargaining oh i think that if one of them found a pretty girl hed want to dicker menedemos said innocently sostratos made a horrible face grinning his cousin went on id sooner see you come back safe even if you did have to keep an eye on your guards while you were away wed need to pay them a bonus too to tempt them away from the taverns and brothels of whatever cities we go through sostratos said maybe we could make it payable afterwards for good behavior menedemos said maybe sostratos wasnt convinced and maybe none of them would want to go for the sake of a bonus he might not earn besides who says i want to play nursemaid to a squad of men who dont want to be with me and how could i learn anything about the countryside and its history if i am playing nursemaid menedemos pointed an accusing finger at him theres your real reason he exclaimed youre not making this jaunt just for the sake of the balsam you want to spy out these ioudaioi and see what you can find out about their funny customs well what if i do sostratos said herodotos had managed to travel for the sake of travel or so it seemed from his history sostratos wished he could do the same but no such luck as long as i bring back the balsam how can you complain about what else i do how easy as you please you never miss a chance to complain when i find some bored pretty wife whose husbands not giving her enough of what she craves the unfairness of that almost choked sostratos lying with other mens wivesespecially with our customers wivesis bad for business and its liable to get you killed remember halikarnassos remember taras getting robbed and murdered because youre stupid enough to travel by yourself is bad for business too menedemos retorted and its also liable to get you killed and its not nearly so much fun as getting laid either you take an escort or you dont go to engedi sostratos glared ill make a bargain with you ill take an escort along if you swear not to commit adultery this sailing season if your spear gets too stiff to bear go to a brothel and buy your relief its not the same at a brothel and you know it menedemos said the girls there have to give you what you ask for whether they want to or notand mostly they dont but theres nothing randier than a wife whos done without for too long and you know its more fun when the woman enjoys herself too id have more fun going to engedi alone sostratos answered till the first arrow got you in the ribs you would thats the chance you take in your games too you ask me to give up something but you wont do the same wheres the justice in that by zeus im the captain menedemos said but youre not zeus yourself even if you swear by him and youre not a tyrant either sostratos replied have we got a bargain or havent we maybe ill just stay along the coast myself and to the crows with getting the best price for the balsam at engedi what thats mutiny menedemos squawked we set off to the east to buy balsam you learned that horrible language they speak so we could buy balsam and now you say you wont go where they have it not with a squad of clumping gallumphing sailors not unless you give me something in return sostratos said thats not mutiny my dearthats haggling are you saying you cant keep away from other mens wives till i get back from engedi what kind of weakling are you if thats so oh all right menedemos kicked at the ground sending a pebble spinning all right youll go with guards and ill fight shy of adultery till youre back what oath would you have me swear he held up a hand wait i know we need some wine first though in salamis bustling agora buying some was a matter of a moment all right here these things fulfilling may i drink from this source he sipped the wine and passed it to sostratos who did likewise menedemos finished but if i should break it may the cup be full of water now you repeat it after me sostratos did then he said thats a good oath but why did you use a feminine participle therethese things fulfilling i mean his cousin grinned thats the end of the oath lysistrate and the other women swore in aristophanes comedythe oath not to let their husbands have them till they ended the peloponnesian war it fits here doesnt it laughing sostratos dipped his head it could hardly fit better my dear shall we finish that wine now they did and gave the cup back to the skinny little hellene whod sold the wine to them by the time theyd gone through the market square sostratos had got a lot of practice saying no thank you not today and other such phrases in aramaic the phoeniciansand the hellenesin the agora were slaveringly eager to sell to the rhodians sostratos could easily have spent every obolos he had whether he could sell what he bought for enough to turn a profit was a different question though he had a hard time convincing the merchants at salamis of that he also discovered that damonaxs olive oil was going to be even harder to move than hed feared whenever he mentioned it to a trader whether a hellene or a phoenician the fellow would roll his eyes and say something like we make plenty at home wearily sostratos would offer a protest but this is the finest oil from the very first picking from the very first pressing the gods couldnt make better oil than this let it be as you say my master a phoenician told him let everything be just as you say i will pay a premium for fine oil certainly but i will not pay a big premium because the difference between the finest oil and an ordinary oil is so much less than the difference between the finest wine and an ordinary wine it is there you will find a few people who seek it out but you will find only a few my heart is full of grief to have to tell you this my master but it is so sostratos would have been more irate had he not heard variations on the theme from merchants along the southern coast of anatolia he went on his way wondering if urging his father to let damonax marry into the family had been such a good idea after all what are we going to do with that oil menedemos said morosely after hed translated burn it in lamps for all i care sostratos answered rub it all over yourself if my brotherinlaw were here id give him an enema with it as much as he could hold menedemos let out a startled laugh and i thought i was the one who liked aristophanes i wont say anything about aristophanes one way or the other sostratos told him what i will say is i dont much like my brotherinlaw right now we could have carried quite a few things wed have had an easier time selling menedemos agreed wed probably have made more money from them too i know i know sostratos had been thinking about that even before damonaxs slaves stowed amphora after amphora of olive oil aboard the aphrodite at least we have some room for other cargo he wanted us to fill her to the gunwales remember i did manage to talk my father out of letting him get away with that a good thing too menedemos said otherwise wed have come home from our trading run without having sold anything thatd be a first and ill tell you something else too one way or another my father would manage to blame me for everything that went wrong he often complained about his father sostratos had never had any particular trouble with uncle philodemos but he wasnt philodemos son either and from everything hed seen menedemos had cause for his complaints too what is it between the two of you anyhow sostratos asked whatever it is cant you find some way to cure it i dont know i doubt it menedemos sounded surprisingly bleak he also sounded as if he was lying or at least not telling all of the truth sostratos thought about calling him on it menedemos had frozen up a couple of times before when sostratos asked him questions like that it was as if he knew the answer but didnt want to air it to anyone perhaps evenperhaps especiallyto himself what could it be sostratos everlively curiosity sniffed at that like a molossian hound sniffing for the scent of a hare but found nothing that being so changing the subject looked like a good idea sostratos said the king of salamis and all these little cypriot kings have to pay tribute to ptolemaios nowadays i wonder how they like it not much unless i miss my guess and i dont think i do menedemos answered sostratos dipped his head in agreement his cousin went on in musing tones i wonder why towns full of hellenes here on cyprus have kings where most poleis back in hellas itself and over in great hellas are democracies or oligarchies or what have you theres sparta sostratos said i said most poleis i didnt say all poleis and macedonia isnt a polls but its got a king too at the moment it hasnt got a king which is why all the marshals are hitting one another over the head with anything they can lay their hands on sostratos pointed out he thought for a little while thats an interesting question you know give me an interesting answer then menedemos said hmm one thing cyprus and macedonia have in common is that theyre right at the edge of the hellenic world oldfashioned things stick around in places like this listen to the dialect the cypriots use and macedonians even worse i should say so menedemos agreed im not even sure its properly greek at all but tell me then o best one are kings oldfashioned what about alexander certainly not sostratos said as if he were responding to a question from sokrates in a platonic dialogue in those dialogues though sokrates got all the best lines here sostratos had some hope of having some himself he went on but even if alexander was something special kingship isnt it is archaic in most of hellas spartas the most conservative polls around add that to kings hanging on in backwoods places like this and macedonia and to other evidence what other evidence menedemos broke in look at athens for instance sostratos said athens hasnt had a king since the days of myth and legend since king kodros went out to fight knowing he would get killed but would bring his city victory doing it why talk about athens then if youll let me talk my dear ill tell you athens doesnt have a king hasnt had one for ages but it still has an arkhon called the king who takes the place of the king it used to have in some religious ceremonies so athens is a place that once had a king that shows it once had a king by keeping an official with the name but none of the power but that doesnt need him any more than a bird needs the eggshell it hatched out of you see evidence well if you went to trial with it i dont know if youd convince enough jurors to win a conviction but youve convinced me i will say that menedemos clapped his hands together sostratos grinned he didnt win an argument with menedemosor rather menedemos didnt admit hed won oneevery day but his cousin added no matter how oldfashioned kinging it is the macedonian marshals have all of the job except for the name and they seem to like it pretty well of course they do sostratos said theyre all rich as you please ptolemaios especiallyand nobody dares tell them no how can you not like that but do the people in their realms like it thats liable to be a different question except in macedonia itself most of those people are just barbarians they dont know what freedom isthey lived under the great kings of persia before the macedonians came menedemos answered and from everything ive ever heard egyptians dont like anything foreign yes ive heard the same sostratos agreed from what himilkon says it sounds as if the ioudaioi dont fancy foreigners either all the more reason for you to have some guards along then menedemos said if the people youre going to do business with want to kill you because youre foreign nobody said they wanted to kill me sostratos broke in and ive agreed to bring along some sailors remember youd better remember and youd better remember what you agreed to too do you yes o best one menedemos answered glumly menedemos was in a sulky mood as he and sostratos made their way back to the harbor from salamis market square no adultery no chance for adultery for the rest of the sailing season he came close to wishing hed let his fool of a cousin go off alone and get himself killed it would serve him right wouldnt it after contemplating that menedemos reluctantlyvery reluctantly tossed his head he did like sostratos in an almost avuncular way and they would be able to make a lot of money on engedi balsam if they could bring it back to hellas without having to pay any phoenician middlemen all the same the sacrifices i make he muttered whats that sostratos asked never mind menedemos told him id have to explain to my fatherand to yourshow i happened to lose you to bandits and thats more trouble than its worth just as well then youre going with guards and if i happen to have to pay a price for it i pay a price for it thats all then sostratos pointed to a peculiar structure off to the left and asked whats that in an altogether different tone of voice why are you asking me menedemos asked in turn i dont know its sure funnylooking though whatever its supposed to be isnt it the more he looked at it the stranger it seemed too some sort of shrine beats me sostratos was staring too the base of the structure was of mud brick with a mound of what looked like charcoal raised above it statues of a man a woman and three children surrounded the strange erection sostratos was normally a shy man but curiosity could make him bold he stepped in front of a passing salaminian and asked i beg your pardon but could you tell me what this building is know you not the local said in surprise but when menedemos and sostratos both tossed their heads he said why tis the cenotaph of king nikokreon of course oh a pestilence menedemos snapped his fingers annoyed at himself i should have thought of that ptolemaios made him kill himself when he took over cyprus didnt he so there isnt any king of salamis any more sostratos two or three years ago it would have been i heard about it in rhodes aye you havet the salaminian said twas not nikokreon alone made to slay himself but wife and offspring as well the monument you see here raised commemorates them all farewell he walked on ptolemaios doesnt like murdering people menedemos remarked maybe to his way of thinking theres no blood guilt if he makes them kill themselves polemaios last yearin kos and niknkrcon here too i daresay polemaios had it coming though i never would have trusted him at my back anyhow by the dog of egypt nikokreon had it coming too sostratos said his voice suddenly savage id forgotten what ptolemaios made him do but it wasnt half what he deserved why menedemos asked id never even heard of him till word got to rhodes that hed slain himself lifes too short to keep track of every little cypriot kinglet who comes along lifes never too short to keep track of anything sostratos said menedemos would have bet his cousin would come out with something like that he retorted youre the one who forgot nikokreons dead back there earlier today sostratos turned red well i shouldnt have what he did deserves remembering whether you usually keep track of such things or not now youve got me curious menedemos said what did he do my dear hes the abandoned rogue who tortured anaxarkhos of abdera to death sostratos answered menedemos must have looked blank for sostratos continued anaxarkhos was a philosopher from the school of demokritos oh ive heard of him menedemos replied with some relief the fellow who says everythings made up of tiny particles too small to cut up any moreatoms right to his relief sostratos dipped his head menedemos said all right anaxarkhos followed him what then he was a man who spoke his mind anaxarkhos was once when alexander got hurt anaxarkhos pointed to the wound and said that is the blood of a man not a god but alexander liked him and didnt take offense nikokreon was different youre a tease do you know that if you were a hetaira youd have more customers than you knew what to do with the way you promise and promise without actually giving very much menedemos poked his cousin in the ribs if i were a hetaira all the men would run screaming and i dont mean on account of my beard sostratos replied i know what my looks are menedemos had been a muchcourted youth before his beard sprouted no one had paid the least attention to his tall gawky horsefaced cousin at the time and since sostratos had made a good game show of not caring but down deep it must have rankled here ten years later menedemos saw it coming out he made a point of not overtly noticing nikokreon was different you say how what did this anaxagorasdo anaxarkhos sostratos corrected anaxagoras was a philosopher too but a long time ago in the days of perikles all right anaxarkhos menedemos said agreeably glad hed steered his cousin away from thinking about himself what did he do to get dear nikokreon angry at him that i dont know not exactly but it must have been something special because nikokreon thought up a special death for him sostratos replied he threw him into a big stone mortar and had him pounded to death with iron hammers pheu menedemos said thats a nasty way to go did the philosopher die well anaxarkhos i should say so sostratos said he told the salaminian go ahead and pound my body for you cant pound my soul that made nikokreon so furious he ordered anaxarkhos tongue torn out but anaxarkhos bit it off before the torturer could get to him and he spat it in nikokreons face and so you see my dear nikokreon might have got off better than he deserved when ptolemaios told him to slay himself if id been the one giving the orders you sound as bloodthirsty as any of the macedonians menedemos said eyeing sostratos with unwonted wariness more often than not youre as gentle as any man ive ever known every once in a while though he tossed his head someone who tries to kill knowledge to kill wisdom deserves whatever happens to him sostratos said that polluted whoreson pirate who stole the gryphons skull for instance if i got my hands on him id send for a torturer from persia and another one from carthage and let them see who could do worse to him id pay them both and gladly menedemos started to laugh but stopped before the sound escaped when he looked at sostratos his cousins expression said he hadnt been joking that pirate was lucky hed managed to get off the aphrodite and hed stay lucky if he never complained in a tavern about the old bones hed taken in lieu of other loot more worth having if word of such grumbling ever got back to sostratos that pirate would have to look to his life when they returned to the merchant galley diokles proved to have done some scouting of his own the oarmaster said theyve got a fine kitharist from corinth playing at one of the inns here they say hes the first kitharist to play in salamis since nikokreon flung the one named stratonikos into the sea now that the kings dead they dare show their faces here again oh by zeus menedemos exclaimed another one nikokreon put to death another one diokles asked but you have to remember too it wasnt a king who killed sokrates democracy isnt perfect eitherthe gods know thats so sostratos said if we didnt live in a democracy we wouldnt have to listen to xanthos blather on and on whenever the assembly meets for instance youre right menedemos said one more reason to be glad we can get out of rhodes half the year on trading runs pity we cant hear stratonikos though sostratos said whos the kitharist who is in town diokles areios his name is the keleustes answered menedemos nudged sostratos what did old stratonikos have to say about him eh best one he told him to go to the crows once sostratos answered thats all i know sounds like stratonikos told everybody to go to the crows menedemos said that doesnt make this areios out to be anybody special i wonder if we should bother seeing him what else is there to do in salamis of nights sostratos asked get drunk get laid menedemos named the two obvious choices in any harbor town they were when he thought about it the two obvious choices in towns that didnt lie by the coast too we can drink and listen to areios at the same time his cousin said and if you decide you want a woman or a boy you can probably find one not far away hes right skipper diokles said well so he is menedemos agreed hes right a lot of the time he nudged sostratos in the ribs if youre so smart why arent you rich because i sail with you sostratos asked innocently before menedemos could get angry his cousin went on a couple of hundred years ago people asked thales of miletos that same question till he got sick of hearing it he cornered the oliveoil market in those parts one year and after that he was rich good for him i dont suppose theres any law that says philosophers cant enjoy silver just like anybody else menedemos said and i dont suppose he got rich by trying to sell his oil to all the neighboring poleis that already had plenty of their own sostratos grimaced no i dont suppose so either we just have to do the best we can with it thats all together menedemos and sostratos told him about anaxarkhos then menedemos asked what happened to stratonikos why he spoke freer about nikokreons family than he should have the keleustes answered thats why the king drowned him this has a familiar ring doesnt it sostratos said and menedemos dipped his head sostratos went on i believe it about stratonikos too i saw him in athens years ago marvelous kitharist but he would say the first thing that popped into his mind and he didnt care where he was or to whom he said it tell me more menedemos urged he was the fellow who called byzantion the armpit of hellas sostratos said and menedemos guffawed his cousin added when he was coming out of herakleia he looked around carefully this way and that somebody asked him why im ashamed oi being seen he answered its like coming out of a brothel oh dear menedemos said no i dont think hed have got on well with nikokreon he didnt get on well with anybody sostratos said when he was playing in corinth an old woman kept staring and staring at him finally he asked her why she said its a wonder your mother bore you for ten months when we cant bear you for even a day but by apollo menedemos he played the kithara like no man since orpheus he must have or somebody would have drowned him sooner menedemos turned to diokles how did he fall foul of the king of salamis i know he insulted nikokreons two sons but i dont know how the oarmaster answered but once when the kings wifeaxiothea her name wascame in for supper she happened to fart and then later on she stepped on an almond while she was wearing a slipper from sikyon and stratonikos sang out thats not the same sound oimoil menedemos exclaimed if he said that to anyone from my family id probably pop him in the chops myself ah but would you kill him sostratos asked thats whats wrong with what nikokreon didnobody could stop him if he set his mind on killing or torturing someone thats whats wrong with kings generally if you ask me im as good a democrat as you are my dear menedemos answered the answer was soft enough to keep menedemos from going any further with his complaints and he knew sostratos didnt want to have the oil aboard the aphrodite either even if it had come from his brotherinlaws groves with a sigh he turned to diokles whereabouts is this areios playing its not far the oarmaster answered i was going to go over there myself listen for a while and see how overpriced the wine is you gents coming why not menedemos said and sostratos dipped his head too diokles led them to the tavern where the kitharist was performing when menedemos saw where it was he started to laugh so did sostratos who said call it stratonikos revenge nikokreons cenotaph stood only fifteen or twenty cubits away with the statue of the late king of salamis looking back toward the tavern play loud areios menedemos said lets hope nikokreons shade is listening the place was crowded when menedemos his cousin and the keleustes went inside he heard the archaic cypriot dialect macedonian several less unusual varieties of greek and assorted retching gutturals from a table full of phoenicians by the dog of egypt menedemos exclaimed isnt that ptolemaios he pointed to a bluntfeatured middleaged man sitting at the best table in the place it cant be sostratos answered he went back to alexandria from kos this past fall with his new baby he snapped his fingers this must be menelaos his brother he commands here on cyprus mm i suppose youre right menedemos said after a second glance sure does look like him though doesnt it perhaps sensing their eyes on him menelaos looked their way he smiled and waved menedemos found himself waving back ptolemaios brother seemed friendlier than the lord of egypt he has less on his shoulders than ptolemaios does sostratos said when menedemos remarked on that menedemos thought it over then dipped his head i wouldnt be surprised if you were right where menelaos and his officers got the best seats in the house a rhodian merchant skipper and a couple of his officers had to take whatever they could get sostratos of all people was the one who spotted a table in the back of the tavern all three rhodians rushed to claim it they got there just ahead of somebody who by the gold rings on his fingers and his crimsonbordered himation might have bought and sold them the fellow gave them a sour stare before looking for somewhere else to sit once his own fundament was on a stool menedemos discovered he could barely see the raised platform where areios would perform hes not a flutegirl at a symposion sostratos said when he complained we came to listen to him not to watch him dance or take his clothes off i know but i would like to have some idea what he looks like menedemos answered before he could do any more grumbling a serving woman came up and asked what are ye fain to drink gentles menedemos hid a smile he enjoyed listening to cypriots talk it was almost like hearing homer and his contemporaries come to life what have you got he asked weve wine from khios and kos and lesbos and thasos and naxos and the woman went on to name almost every island in the aegean and every part of the mainland adjacent to it she finished and of course weve the local and also wine of dates in the which the phoenicians take much pleasure a cup of the local will suit me fine menedemos said same for me diokles said the serving womans eyes called them both cheapskates menedemos didnt care a place like this was liable to pad its profits by claiming a cheap wine was really something more and charging three times as much for it as would have been right with the local at least he knew what he was getting and what of you most noble the woman asked when sostratos didnt answer right away let me have a cup of date wine if you please sostratos said with a shrug the serving woman went away why do you want to drink that horrid nasty stuff young sir diokles said were going to phoenicia i might as well find out what the phoenicians like dont you think sostratos said if it is nasty i wont drink it again after longer than she should have taken the serving woman brought them their drinks menedemos tasted the local and made a face he hadnt expected much and he hadnt got it either diokles drank without a word of complaint menedemos took another sip he shrugged it wasnt that much worse than the wine the aphrodite carried for the crew what about yours sostratos he asked his cousin held out the cheap earthenware cup have a taste yourself if you care to why not menedemos said though that was a question with an obvious answer he sipped cautiously then handed the cup back to sostratos too sweet for my taste and thick as glue the phoenicians are welcome to it as far as im concerned i wouldnt drink it every day either sostratos said but i dont think its as nasty as diokles made it out to be better than drinking water thats certain i should hope so menedemos said after all what isnt theres that sour stuff the egyptians and thracians and kelts brew from barley sostratos said by all accounts beers pretty bad this tastes as though it wants to be wine anyhow he drank some more then thoughtfully smacked his lips yes it could be worse thracians use butter instead of olive oil so its plain they have no taste menedemos said sostratos and diokles both dipped their heads for good measure the oarmaster also made a disgusted face a fat bejeweled manmenedemos guessed he was the fellow who owned the taverncame up onto the platform and spoke in throaty phoenicianaccented greek hail best ones hail also to the lovely ladies we have with us this evening that made menedemos look around it also made sostratos cough sharply you stop that menedemos told him hetairai arent wives sostratos spread his hands admitting as much menedemos did spot a couple of women they wore veils as if they were respectable but they wouldnt have come to a tavern if they had been one sat with a big macedonian a couple of tables away from menelaos and his comrades the other accompanied a man with the sleek look of a rich landowner menedemos had missed some of what the tavernkeeper had to say here direct from appearances in athens and corinth and alexandria the man went on my friends i give you the famous areios he clapped his hands holding them above his head to signal everyone else to applaud too menedemos clapped a few times so did diokles sostratos menedemos noted sat quietly waiting to find out whether the kitharist would be worth hearing sometimes sostratos was too sensible for his own good thank you very much areios waved to the crowd as he came out onto the platform lean and spare he spoke a polished attic greek hed probably been a striking youth even now though the gray in his hair argued that he had to be close to fifty he shaved his face to make himself look younger by lamp and torchlight the illusion worked remarkably well im very pleased to be here he went on with a grin by the gods im very pleased to be anywhere that isnt apt to get sacked in the next hour he got his laugh menelaos called that wont happen in cyprus cyprus belongs to my brother and hell keep it as long as he keeps it till after ive sailed away thats fine with me areios replied and won a louder laugh another kitharist who thinks he can make fun of powerful men menedemos said doesnt he remember what happened to stratonikos here he paused menelaos does seem a more cheerful sort than nikokreon wasi will say that i wonder how he feels about being the second most important man in ptolemaios realm sostratos said does he ever wonder what things would have been like if hed been born before his brother why ask me menedemos said why not go over there and ask him for a bad moment he thought sostratos would get up and do just that but his cousin was only shifting on the stool sostratos pointed to the kithara areios cradled in his arms have you ever seen a finer instrument menedemos had to crane his neck to see it at all but answered i dont believe i have large and heavy the kithara was the instrument of choice of professional musicians it had seven strings and an enormous sound box that amplified the tones the kitharist struck from them areios kithara was of pale oak and gleamed as if rubbed with beeswax it had inlays of ivory and of some dark wood perhaps walnut perhaps something more exoticand more expensive from supporting the instrument he played areios arms were as muscular as a pankratiasts but then areios ran his fingers over the strings and menedemos stopped noticing anything but the music not only was his one of the most beautiful kitharas menedemos had ever seen it was also one of the most perfectly tuned hed ever heard tuning the kitharaor its relatives the lyre the barbitos and the phorminxwas anything but easy like anyone whod been to school menedemos had learned to play the lyre after a fashion the stringsfour in a lyre more in the other instrumentswere attached to the sound box at the bottom by a string bar and bridge things were more complicated at the other end the strings were wound around the crosspiece and held in place by a piece of hide cut from the neck of a cow or goat and rubbed with sticky grease to make them adhere to it menedemos remembered endless plucking endless adjustments and the schoolmasters stick coming down on his back when he couldnt get the tone right no matter what and even when he managed to persuade the strings to yield notes somewhere close to what they should have been a little playing would put them out again it was enoughmore than enoughto drive anybody mad here though the tones werent close to what they should have been they were exactly right and seemed to pierce menedemos very soul pure as water from a mountain spring sostratos whispered menedemos dipped his head and then waved his cousin to silence he didnt want to hear anything but the music areios played a little bit of everything from the lyric poetry of the generations following homer to the latest love songs out of alexandria everything he did play had a slight sardonic edge to it he chose arkhilokhos old poem about throwing away his shield and leaving it for some thracian to find and the alexandrian song was about a woman trying to bewitch her lover away from her rivala boy at last the kitharist struck one more perfect chord bowed very low said i thank you most noble ones and left the stage menedemos clapped till his palms were sore he wasnt the only one either a tremendous din of applause filled the tavern enough to make his head ring cries of euge rang out from all sides how is he next to stratonikos menedemos asked as they left the building its been a while since i heard stratonikos sostratos replied judicious as usual i think areios is at least as good with the kithara itselfand ive never heard one better tuned yes i thought the same thing myself menedemos said diokles dipped his head me too but stratonikos if i remember rightly had a better voice sostratos finished im glad we went menedemos said he clapped the keleustes on the back good thing you heard he was playing dioklesand i hope nikokreons shade got himself an earful tonight sostratos wasnt sorry to see cyprus recede behind the aphrodites gooseheaded sternpost and the boat the akatos towed in her wake he also was not eager to face phoenicia or the land of the ioudaioi what he was was coldly furious at his brotherinlaw when we get back to rhodes he said im going to pour melted cheese and garlic over damonax and fry him in his own olive oil well have plenty left to do the job with some left over for the barley rolls well serve with his polluted carcass you must be angry if youve got the whole menu planned menedemos said herodotos puts the androphagoi far to the north of the skythian plains beyond a great desert sostratos replied i wonder what he would have thought if hed heard a rhodian wanted to become a maneater hed probably wonder what wine went best with brotherinlaw menedemos said something sweet and thick id say gods bless you my dear sostratos said for youre the best man ive ever known when it comes to helping someone along with his mood whatever it happens to be im not surprised men often choose you symposiarch when they throw a drinking partyyoure the one to take them where they want to go well thank you best one menedemos answered raising his right hand from the steeringoar tiller to give sostratos a salute i dont know that anyones ever said anything kinder of me now that i think about it sostratos went on in musing tones thats probably the same sort of knack that gets you so many girls isnt it i hadnt really thought about it menedemos said papai sostratos exclaimed now dismayed he stared at his cousin hardly believing what hed heard why not dont you know what sokrates saidthe unexamined life is not worth living hes right i dont know about that menedemos said im usually too busy living my life to step back and take a look at it then how do you know if youre living well or not menedemos frowned if we go down this road im going to get all tangled up i can see that coming already he wagged a finger at sostratos i can see you looking forward to it too who me sostratos said not quite innocently enough answer my question if you please how do i know if im living well menedemos echoed sostratos dipped his head his cousin frowned in thought by whether im happy or not i suppose amazing o marvelous one sostratos said menedemos shot him a dirty look sostratos went on could a dog or a goat speak it would give the same answer for a dog or a goat it would be good enough too but for a man no artaxerxes okhos the great king of persia was happiest when he was killing people and he killed a lot of them does that mean he lived well no but killing people doesnt make me happy menedemos fixed sostratos with a mild and speculative stare for certain people i might make an exception youre still talking around the question sostratos said just think too if you knew why you were so charming you might get more women yet that made menedemos look sharply at him sostratos had thought it might do you think so his cousin asked i dont see why it wouldnt sostratos replied an archer who knows what hes doing is more likely to hit the target than one who just picks up the bow and lets fly isnt he well yes i suppose so but menedemos sounded suspicious a moment later he explained why i still think youre trying to turn me into a philosopher behind my back would i do such a thing again sostratos sounded as innocent as he could he sounded so very innocent in fact that both menedemos and diokles burst out laughing oh no my dear not you menedemos said no indeed never you the thought wouldnt cross your mind he laughed some more louder than ever what id like to know sostratos said with more than a little heat is whats so dreadful about the notion that one man should want to persuade another to love wisdom and look for it instead of just stumbling over it when he chances upon it or turning his back on it altogether can you tell me that philosophys too much like work menedemos said ive got real work to do and i havent got the time to worry about becomingness or essences or any of that other philosophical nonsense that makes my head ache do you have time to think about whether youre doing the right thing and why sostratos asked is anything more important than that getting the aphrodite to phoenicia and not sinking on the way his cousin suggested youre being troublesome on purpose sostratos said menedemos grinned at him sostratos went on yes you want to survive any living thing wants to survive but when you get to phoenicia will you do good or evil good to my friends evil to my enemies menedemos replied at once any hellene who answered without thinking was likely to say something much like that sostratos tossed his head im sorry my dear but what was good enough for homer s heroes isnt any more and why not menedemos demanded if anybody does me a bad turn ill give him a knee in the balls first chance i get what happens then hell give you one back or his friends will and then ill get my own back or ill have a friend help me against his friend menedemos said and your faction fight will go on for years maybe for generations sostratos said how many poleis have been ruined by feuds like that how many wars between poleis have started through feuds like that by the gods if the poleis of hellas hadnt spent their time fighting amongst themselves could the macedonians have beaten them he thought that was an invincible argument but menedemos said ha now ive got you you do not i do so his cousin leered at him for one thing the macedonians fight amongst themselves too even worse than regular hellenes go aheadtell me im wrong i dare you he waited sostratos stood silent he couldnt disagree ha menedemos said again and for another if philip of macedon hadnt whipped the hellenes into line and if alexander hadnt come along right afterwards whod be running phoenicia now the great king of persia thats who so i say hurrah for feuds i do sostratos stared at him then started to laugh huge he exclaimed thats the best bit of bad argument i think ive ever heard some people learn to argue from platon and what he says of sokrates you took your model from aristophanes clouds bad logic there you mean menedemos asked and sostratos dipped his head not a bit abashed menedemos made as if to bow bad logic won remember good logic gave up and went over to the other side and it looks like ive outargued you he waited to see whether sostratos would challenge that sostratos didnt but gave back the same sort of bow hed got every once in a while i surprise you when we wrestle in the gymnasion he towered over his cousin but menedemos was quicker and stronger and more agile every once in a while i suppose you can surprise me when we aim winged words at each other winged words menedemos echoed you knew the aristophanes and now youre quoting homer by the dog which of us is which oh no you dont you wont get away with that you rascal if you say youre me and im you you get out of the oath you gave me in salamis they both laughed menedemos said well it wouldnt be hard for you to keep you dont go looking to sleep with other mens wives anyhow i should hope not sostratos answered but you cant be me because you didnt spend all that time over the winter learning aramaic im glad i didnt too you sound like youre choking to death every time you speak it menedemos put on a horrible phoenician accent dis iz vat joo zound lige i hope not sostratos said go ahead and hope you still do they kept on chaffing each other as menedemos sailed the aphrodite southeast going due east from salamis would have shortened their journey across the inner sea but then they would have had to crawl south along the phoenician coast to get to sidon the city from which sostratos wanted to set out and explore the interior at this season of the year with the sun hot and bright and the sea calm the risk seemed worth taking sostratos looked back toward salamis already the coast of cyprus was no more than a low line on the horizon the akatos would be out of sight of land for three days maybe four on the way to phoenicia except for the journey south from hellas and the islands of the aegean to alexandria it was the longest journey over the open sea a ship was likely to have to make i wouldnt want to do this in a round ship sostratos said suppose you got halfway across and the wind died sitting out there bobbing in the middle of nothing hoping you wouldnt run out of water and wine he tossed his head no thanks that wouldnt be much fun menedemos agreed i dont like the idea of riding out a storm out of sight of land either when that happened on the way west from hellas to italy a couple of years ago we were lucky to make as good a landfall as we did there ought to be a better way to navigate out on the open sea sostratos said sun and stars wind and waves just arent enough ships that set out for alexandria can end up almost anywhere along the egyptian coast in the delta or in the desert to the west and then have to beat their way back i wont say youre wrong because youre right menedemos replied but how would you do such a thing what else is there but sun and stars wind and waves i dont know sostratos said fretfully hed feared menedemos would ask him that for he had no answer to give maybe theres something though after all t dont suppose the very first sailors knew enough to cast a line down to the seabed so the leads hollow bottom full of tallow would bring up sand or marl that helped tell them where they were thats probably true menedemos said i dont remember homer talking about sounding leads in the iliad or the odyssey and resourceful odysseus would surely have used one if hed known about it herodotos does mention them so theyve been known for more than a hundred years sostratos said sometime between the trojan war and the persian wars some clever fellow figured that out i wonder who i wonder when i wish i knew thats a man whose name deserves to live i wonder if he was a hellene or a phoenician or a godsdetested lykian pirate i dont suppose anyone will ever know for certain his cousin gave him an odd look it hadnt even occurred to me that the fellow who came up with the lead could have been anything but a hellene weve borrowed all sorts of things sostratos said the phoenicians gave us the alphabeta theirs is older than ours and you should have heard himilkon go on and on about how theyre happy with it just the way it is the lydians were the first ones to mint real coins or so herodotos saysbefore that everybody had to weigh out scrap gold and silver and even dionysos is supposed to come from out of the distant east so maybe we learned to make wine from barbarians too wherever we learned it its a good thing we did menedemos said i wouldnt want to spend my whole life drinking water or it could be even worse than that we could drink milk the way the thracians and the skythians do he made a revolted face sticking out his tongue like a gorgon painted on the facing of a hoplites shield that would be dreadful sostratos made a nasty face of his own cheese is all very wellcheese is better than all very well as a matter of factbut milk he tossed his head no thanks we found out the syrians dont fancy seafood remember menedemos said now thats ignorance nothing else but of course it is sostratos said and that strange god the ioudaioi worship wont let them eat pork he sent his cousin a warning look youre going to start talking about pythagoreans and beans and farting again arent you dont i wasnt going to do any such thing menedemos insisted sostratos didnt believe him for a moment but then his cousin went on what i was going to do was tell you theres a little tiny island between lesbos and the anatolian mainland thats called pordoselene what fartmoon sostratos exclaimed i dont believe it apollo smite me if i lie menedemos said solemnly it even has a polls of the same name and theres another island even smaller also called pordoselene in front of the polis and that island has a temple to apollo on it fartmoon sostratos said again and shrugged in bemusement were not even out of sight of land yet but were already getting peculiar by the time we spy the phoenician coast i expect well all be raving mad he sounded as if he was looking forward to it ship ho aristeidas called from the aphrodites smallforedeck he pointed ship off the starboard bow menedemos peered in that direction i dont see a sail he said but swung the merchant galley a little to the south anyway over the past couple of years hed come to rely on aristeidas eyesight no sail skipper the lookout said theres the hulldo you see it fishing boat id guess ah menedemos had been looking for the wrong thing as soon as aristeidas told him what he ought to see he spotted it well come up to him and he can tell us just where we are the coastline of phoenicia had come into view a little while before a low dark smudge of land rising up out of the endless blue flatness of the waters of the inner sea had menedemos sighted land in hellas he wouldnt have needed to figure out where he was but neither he nor anyone else aboard the akatos had ever come so far east before the silhouettes of the hills against the sky didnt tell him where the ship was as they would have in lands hed already visited hes making sail skipper aristeidas called and menedemos dipped his headhe saw the pale square of linen coming down from the yard too the lookout added he must think weve got a pirate ship a lot of these little boats do well well keep after him anyhow menedemos said wed make a pretty sorry excuse for a pirate if we couldnt catch up with a tubby scow like that now wouldnt we he raised his voice sostratos his cousin as far as he could tell might not have noticed the boat at allhe was watching dolphins leaping and cavorting off to port he started at the sound of his name and looked around wildly as if wondering what had been going on while his mind was elsewhere what is it he asked apprehensively see that fishing boat menedemos said by sostratos expression he might never have heard of fishing boats let alone seen one before when he thought about other things he thought hard patiently menedemos pointed it out he was relieved to see the light of intelligence appear on his cousins face and went on how would you like to practice your aramaic with whoevers aboard her i can do that i suppose sostratos said what do you want me to say maybe that hadnt been the light of intelligence after all menedemos drummed his fingers on the steeringoar tiller do you know where we are my dear he asked sweetly do you have any idea which phoenician city were closest to of course not sostratos sounded affronted how could i know that well one good way might be to ask the people on the boat there dont you think oh sostratos said this time it really was the light of intelligence or something like it anyhow still sounding slightly peevish sostratos asked why didnt you tell me to do that before menedemos drummed his fingers on the tiller again never mind he said he didnt feel like arguing with his cousin just take care of it when we catch up with them all right certainly o best one sostratos replied with such dignity as he could muster and it goes to show some people in these parts do catch fish doesnt it menedemos supposed it did he hadnt thought of that the fishermen in that boat were good sailors they got the sail down with commendable haste and wrung every digit of speed they could from their little craft that made the aphrodite take longer to catch up to them but never gave them the slightest chance of escaping her they were much too far out to sea to get to shore before she came up alongside them even then they were ready to fight a couple of them brandished what were either gutting knives or shortswords a third shot an arrow that splashed into the sea fifteen or twenty cubits short of the merchant galley tell them were friendly tell them we dont want to murder them or sell them into slavery menedemos said the fisherman with the bow let fly again this arrow came closer menedemos scowled i get more tempted every minute though his cousin shouted something in aramaic the fishermen shouted back menedemos raised a questioning eyebrow sostratos coughed then he said theyre telling me to do things to my mother sophokles never thought of in oidipoustyrannos barbarians curse that way dont they menedemos said theyre not paying me compliments my dear sostratos answered heh menedemos said all right find out what we need to know and tell them that if they dont learn manners we cursed well will ram them and sink them just to teach them to respect their betters i dont think i can say all that in aramaic sostratos warned try sostratos dipped his head he made what to menedemos sounded like horrible choking noises the phoenicians in the fishing boat shouted back this time they seemed less impassioned so did sostratos when he replied to them after a bit he turned to menedemos and said euge my dear sidon is a couple of hours sail to the south a very nice bit of navigating euge is right skipper diokles agreed all that water to cross and then to make it to the coast almost right where we wanted to be he raised his voice calling out to the sailors give the captain a cheer boys he put us right where he wanted to euge the men called menedemos grinned and waved somebody added the skipper always puts it right where he wants to menedemos laughed at that after a moment though he felt like scowling again thanks to his bargain with his cousin he might not have the chance to put it where he wanted to shall i send them on their way sostratos asked yes go ahead menedemos answered weve found out what we needed to know if theyre telling the truth that is not much point to lying about something like that sostratos said wed find the truth soon enough and their lie wouldnt do us any harm no matter how much they might wish it would he shouted once more in incomprehensible aramaic the fishermen understood it well enough though whether menedemos did or not they steered away from the aphrodite and were no doubt delighted when the akatos which dwarfed their little boat did not match their course sidon once the merchant galley reached it proved to lie on a small promontory behind a line of islets running parallel to the coast its not a very big place is it menedemos said none too happilyhe wanted a good market for the aphrodites wares but look at the buildings sostratos said ive heard the phoenicians build tall and now i see its true they go up and up and up he was right few buildings in a polis full of hellenes rose more than two stories above the street so that the temples and other public structures stood out sidon was different every other building seemed to tower four or five stories high menedemos said the sidonians must have strong legs from going up and down all those stairs so often i wouldnt be surprised if youre right his cousin answered they have to get their exercise somewhere i suppose there certainly doesnt look to be room in the town for a gymnasion he paused then laughed in fact the very idea of a gymnasion in a place like sidon is absurd why menedemos asked they could squeeze one in if they wanted to badly enough sostratos gave him the sort of look he hated the look that said hed been so blatantly stupid he should have been ashamed of himself menedemos scratched his head he couldnt see why which only made things worse holding on to patience with both handsand making a point of doing sosostratos said what is a gymnasion literally that iswhat does the word mean a place to go nak menedemos stopped oh phoenicians dont go naked do they he could see they didnt for himself the day was warm warmer than it was likely to have been in rhodes at this season of the year it was more than warm enough for a lot of male hellenes to have stripped off their chitons and gone through the streets bare without a second thought they took nudity in stride and took it for granted but almost all the people he could see in sidon covered themselves in cloth all the way down to their feet the only exceptions were men probably slavesbearing heavy burdens and even they wore loincloths those were the only exceptions menedemos spotted at any rate sostratos pointed to a knot of men on a quay and said look theyre hellenes or maybe macedonians he was right he usually was some of the men hed spotted wore short tunics like the ones he and menedemos had on a couple of others were in linen corselets and bronze helms with tall horsehair crests menedemos couldnt imagine why they wanted to show they were soldiers in a town unlikely to be attacked all it would do was make them sweat more than they had to but that was their worry not his sostratos did some more pointing this time at some of the ships and more important at the large ship sheds by the waters edge look at all the war galleys antigonos has here he said do you suppose menelaos knows about that over in salamis menedemos laughed no matter how much sostratos knew he could be naive as a child my dear think about how many ships go back and forth between here and salamis menedemos said if i were menelaos i wouldnt just know how many ships old oneeye has here id know the name of every rower on every one of them and id know the name of every rowers father too and you can bet your last obolos that menelaos does now it was his cousins turn to say oh in a gratifyingly small voice yes that is reasonable isnt it menedemos guided the aphrodite to a mooring place at the end of a quay the longshoremen who caught the lines to make the ship fast stared at the scantily clad hellenes aboard her they shouted questions in their harsh language sostratos gave halting answers menedemos caught the merchant galleys name those of his father and uncle and that of rhodes but for the handful of names he understood not a word his cousin was saying a big round ship was tied up next to the akatos more longshoremen carried sacks of grain off her down the quay and into the city as they worked they chanted hilni hiya hollaouahillok holya what does that mean menedemos asked sostratos what does what mean his cousin answered menedemos pointed to the men unloading the round ship sostratos cocked his head to one side menedemos got the idea he hadnt even noticed the chant till it was pointed out to him after a bit sostratos shrugged i dont know i dont think it means anything at all though i wouldnt swear to that if i had to guess id say it was something rhythmic they sing to help the time pass while they work could be menedemos said we have chants like that i just wondered if this one made any sense not to me sostratos pointed toward the far end of the wharf and here comes an officer to ask us questions oh hurrah menedemos said meaning anything but godsdetested arrogant snoops the lot of them i dont care if they work for antigonos or ptolemaios or one of the other macedonian marshals to the crows with em all antigonos man was quite tallseveral digits taller than sostratos and close to twice as wide through the shoulders he had blue eyes blondish hair and a oncefiery beard now streaked with gray menedemos wondered for a moment if he was a keltic mercenary but he proved to be a macedonian who are you and where are you from he asked not bothering to sharpen his slurred accent dont see many strange hellenes here and thats a fact this is the aphrodite out of rhodes menedemos told him rhodes eh the macedonian didnt seem to know what to make of that your little island built some ships for antigonos but you do a lot of business with ptolemaios too yes were neutral menedemos said wondering if there were any such thing with the world as it was these days we have no quarrel with anybody ah but what happens when somebody has a quarrel with you the macedonian asked then he shrugged what are you carrying weve got papyrus and ink koan silk fine rhodian perfume some of the best olive oil youll ever see lykian ham smoked eels from phaselis and a nice stock of books to help pass the time antigonos officer didnt laugh at the olive oil the way things had gone menedemos took that as good news the macedonian said books eh why would you bring books didnt alexander himself travel with them menedemos replied if they were good enough for him why not for you on account of he had his letters and i dont the macedonians expression sharpened coming from the west youdve stopped in salamis wouldnt you thats right menedemos said well what did you see there the officer demanded how many war galleys in the harbor are they building more is menelaos in town or is he somewhere else on cyprus whats he up to before answering menedemos sent sostratos a significant look if antigonos men were so interested in learning what was happening on cyprus how could his cousin doubt that ptolemaios forces on the island also closely questioned sailors coming from phoenicia didnt pay much attention to the harbor menedemos said oh yeslikely tell antigonos officer curled his lip in what he no doubt thought to be an aristocratic sneer by the gods its true menedemos said i dont care about war galleys theyve got nothing to do with me if thered been a couple of other akatoi in the harbor you can bet idve noticed them we did see menelaos though hes there ah thats something the macedonian eagerly snatched the bone menedemos tossed him whered you see him what was he doing he was at a tavern not far from the harbor menedemos answered what was he doing was he getting drunk yes the officer was eager all right do you know if he gets drunk a lot given the macedonian reputation for pouring down cup after cup of neat wine the questions werent so surprising if cyprus commander were drunk all the time the place would be easier for antigonos men to attack but menedemos and sostratos both tossed their heads sostratos said he didnt seem drunk at all he came to the place for the same reason we did to hear areios the kitharist play and sing that drew the macedonians interest too but not in the way menedemos would have expected really he said how was he ive heard of him but ive never seen him perform i saw stratonikos a few times when i was back in hellas hes the best i knowbut the tongue on that man if a viper had it he wouldnt need to bite youhed just stick out that tongue and youd fall over dead thats the truth sostratos said and he and the macedonian spent the next quarter hour chattingsometimes arguingabout the virtues of various kitharists and swapping stories about stratonikos for all his uncouth accent the officer plainly knew what he was talking about menedemos listened in growing bemusement he would no more have expected the fellow to care about the kithara than he would have thought a phoenician might set up as a philosopher you never can tell he thought at last with obvious reluctance antigonos officer tore himself away sostratos had succeeded in charming him he said i enjoyed the talk o best one gods give you profit here in sidon he went back into the city whistling the tune to one of areios alexandrian love songs which sostratos had taught him he wasnt a donkey after all menedemos said no but he brayed like one macedonians sostratos answered when he got excited there i was missing about one word in four that doesnt matter menedemos said what matters is he liked you and so hell give us a good character well done my dear thanks sostratos said and tomorrow well see what we can find here in sidon yes normally one of the things menedemos would have looked for in a new city was the bored wife of a merchant or an officer because of his oath he wasnt supposed to do that harlots all summer he thought and sighed then he shrugged it wasnt as if sostratos had asked him to stay away from women altogether his cousin knew him better than that walking through the narrow streets of sidon sostratos kept craning his neck up and up he didnt particularly want to do it but he couldnt help himself when he glanced over at menedemos he was relieved to find his cousin doing the same thing menedemos gave him a sheepish look i know the buildings wont fall down on us but i cant stop thinking they might he said yes i know i feel like that too sostratos said i wonder why they build so tall and what happens when theres an earthquake things fall down i suppose menedemos spat into the bosom of his tunic to turn aside the evil omen after another couple of paces sostratos imitated him logically he saw no connection between the act of spitting and an earthquake that might come in the next instant or might not come for the next hundred years or more how the one could keep the other from happening was beyond him he spat anyhow the training in logic and analysis hed had at the lykeion in athens warred with the superstitions hed picked up at sea at least as often as not superstition won for one thing he spent his time these days around sailors not around philosophers for another he didnt see how spitting could hurt and so why not he muttered whats that menedemos asked nothing sostratos said embarrassed menedemos had heard him the sidonians took their towering buildings as much for granted as sostratos took the shorter ones of rhodes and other hellenic poleis they swarmed around the two rhodians sometimes grumbling at the slowmoving gawking foreigners all the men wore beards though shaving was popular among hellenes especially of the younger generation it hadnt caught on here some of their robesoften boldly striped in deep blue or rusty redhad fancy fringes on the hem they used one hand to keep those fringes from trailing in the dust they wore tall cylindrical caps or lengths of clothagain often brightly coloredwrapped around their hair more women went out in public than would have in a polis full of hellenes some of them were veiled against the gaze of strange men but many werent quite a few stared in frank curiosity at the rhodians sostratos needed a little while to figure out why were a novelty here he said hellenes i mean well of course menedemos answered i havent seen many phoenician women till now theyre not bad are they no sostratos admitted hed noticed bright eyes and red lips and white teeth himself they put on more paint than our women do except for hetairai of course theyre more used to being seen than our women are menedemos said they aim to take advantage of it i think youre right sostratos dipped his head then he paused and sniffed sidon doesnt smell the way i thought it would it smells like a citysmoke and people and animals and shit menedemos said maybe it smells a little worse than a lot of placesall those rotting shellfish they use to get their crimson dye but what did you expect i dont know but sostratos did know and at last sheepishly he owned up to it i thought it might smell like spices and incenses because so many of them come through here on their way to hellas pepper and cinnamon and myrrh and frankincense and i dont know what all else buthe sniffedyoud never know it by your nose no you wouldnt menedemos agreed sidon smells like the garbage on a hot day after sikon did up seafood the night before youre rightit does sostratos said thats just what it smells like as a matter of fact your family has a good cook there father would buy him in a heartbeat if uncle philodemos ever decided to sell him not likely i didnt think it was sostratos replied i wouldnt even have mentioned it if he werent going around rhodes with his face like a thundercloud father and i have both noticed it if sikons having trouble with your father no no no menedemos tossed his head its not father father wants to keep him and wants to keep him happy too like i told you before baukis is the one who thinks sikon spends too much silver on our opson and so they fight yes i understand that sostratos said i can see how it would be a problem but i still think your father ought to come between his wife and his cook so they dont fight any more why doesnt he why menedemos laughed i told you that before too my dear for the same reason nobody comes between antigonos and ptolemaios thats why theyd squash him between them and then theyd go right on fighting hes smart enough to know it too he sometimes thinks he can just lay down the lawby the way menedemos mouth twisted uncle philodemos often thought that around himbut he hasnt tried it there he could use you as his gobetween sostratos remarked he wasnt ready for what happened next his cousins face slammed shut as if it were a door slammed in the face of an unwelcome guest no menedemos said in a voice like a thracian winter he couldnt do that he couldnt do that at all why not sostratos asked it would seem to make good logical sense and still in that gelid voice menedemos broke in a lot of things that seem to make good logical sense are amazingly stupid when you try them out in the real world you never have figured that out have you but believe me this is one of them well excuse me for existing sostratos said not only affronted but also confused for he didnt know how hed managed to irk his cousin this time ill think about it my dear menedemos replied had he stayed coldly angry they would have had a real row this time though something of the old sardonic glint returned to his voice and to his eye sostratos didnt ask him for any more family details but he didnt feel like hauling off and kicking him anymore either they walked past a temple with its colonnaded front at first glance it put sostratos in mind of a shrine in a hellenic polis of no particular account but the terracotta figurines decorating the pediment were done in a style different from any he would have seen where hellenes lived and the reliefs on the frieze were not only stiff and square and blockyplainly the product of a sculptural tradition different from his ownbut also acting out a mythological scene about which he knew nothing menedemos noticed something else about the temple pointing he asked what does all the funny writing say sostratos tried to decipher it but then tossed his head give me time and i can probably puzzle it out he said but i cant just sound it out and read it the way i could if it were greek sorry when someone asked him something he hated not being able to give a precise detailed answer that after all was one of the things he was best at but menedemos said well dont worry about it my dear i wondered thats all as he had in patara he added if its not in greek it cant be very important can it what would himilkon have said had he heard that something memorable sostratos suspected the phoenician trader mocked hellenes for their ignorance of languages other than their own back on rhodes sostratos hadnt taken him seriously why should he have in a polis where greek naturally ruled but here in sidon the purring coughing choking rhythms of aramaic surrounded him who spoke greek here antigonos soldiers and clerks along with a handful of phoenicians who dealt with hellenes drifting on this sea of strange words was intimidating almost frightening it will be even worse in the country of the loudaioi sostratos thought glumly nobody there deals with hellenes and from everything ive heard antigonos doesnt bother sending many soldiers into the interior do i really want to try this without an interpreter i do he answered himself more than a little surprised why did i spend all that time and money with himilkon if not to do it myself he smiled the truth was he remained young enough to crave adventure hed been too young to go off to the ends of the earth with alexander the great the men of the older generation the ones who had gone conquering had to look down their noses at him and his contemporaries had to reckon them stayathomes whod never measured themselves against the worst the world could do i cant conquer persia or go fight along the indus river sostratos thought thats been done but i can do a little exploring of my own i can and i will when you go to ioudaia will you ride a horse or a donkey menedemos asked as a donkey with several amphorai lashed to its back squeezed past the rhodians a donkey i think sostratos said im no cavalryman and never will be besides bandits are less likely to want to steal a donkey than a horse bandits steal and thats all you need to say about that menedemos answered youd have a better chance to get away on horseback not unless all the sailors who come with me are on horseback too sostratos said or do you think id save my gore and let them perish menedemos shrugged such things have been known to happenbut let it go if the idea bothers you next questionwill you hire your beast or buy it outright both probably sostratos said ill want one to carry things and one to ride im thinking now of buying them and then selling them again before we sail with luck thatll be cheaper than hiring them if the dealers try to gouge me thats when ill think about doing it the other way of course theyll try to gouge you menedemos said thats why theyre in business oh i know but theres a difference between gouging and gouging if you know what i mean sostratos said making a profit is one thing cheating a foreigner is something else again and i dont intend to put up with it his cousin dipped his head you make good sense the only thing you have to be sure to do is get back several days before we sail so you dont have to sell in a hurry and take the first offer you get whatever it happens to be if i can certainly sostratos said i dont want to lose money on the dealor as little as i can anyhowbut i cant promise what ill be doing in the country of the ioudaioi either whatever youre doing there dont get so interested that you forget the season till its wintertime menedemos said if you think well wait around for you and then risk sailing in bad weather youre daft youre the daft one if you think id do anything like that sostratos retorted menedemos only laughed and sostratos realized his cousin had been teasing him before he could say anything or even begin to plot a revenge a skinny phoenician of about his own age spoke to him and menedemos in bad greek you two you hellenes yes no of course not menedemos said straightfaced were sakai from the plains beyond persia the phoenician looked confused sostratos gave menedemos a dirty look pay no attention to my cousin he told the fellow yes were hellenes what can we do for you you trader men the phoenician asked you want to trade yes were traders sostratos said cautiously i dont know if we want to trade with you or not what have you got and what do you want i got cinnamon masters you know cinnamon you want cinnamon sostratos and menedemos looked at each other how likely was this scrawny obviously poor man to have anything worth buying a silent answer passed between them not very still sostratos said show us what youve got i do the fellow reached inside his robe and took out a folded cloth hold out hands i show sostratos did the phoenician poured some dried plants into his palm saying smell quality number one yes sure enough the sharp tangy odor of cinnamon tickled sostratos nose but he shifted from greek to aramaic to say you dog you son of a dog you thief you sell trash and say quality number one you liar himilkon had taught him plenty of scornful expressions these are weeds with powdered cinnamon for smell this is what they are worth he threw them down and ground them under his foot he hadnt really expected to embarrass the phoenician and he didnt the young man only grinned not a bit abashed ah my master you do know something of this business he said in his own language we could work together make much money off stupid ionians go away sostratos said in aramaic that didnt convey much of what he wanted to get across so he switched to greek go howl to the crows with you what was that all about menedemos asked once the phoenician still unabashed had gone his way i gather he was trying to trick us but you were speaking his language so i dont know how didnt you see what he gave me he tried to pass off some worthless leaves and stems as cinnamon he might have done it too if i didnt know what a quill of cinnamon was supposed to look like and then when i showed i did he tried to get us to go into business with him and gull other hellenes menedemos laughed you almost have to admire such a thorough thief maybe you do sostratos said i dont i just wish hed jump off a cliff hell end up cheating some poor trusting soul out of a lot of silver as long as its not me menedemos said sostratos started to dip his head then checked himself no he said thats not right you shouldnt want him to cheat anybody why not his cousin asked if someone else is dumb enough to let that phoenician take advantage of him why should i worry its the fools lookout not mine cheats shouldnt be allowed to do business sostratos said as a matter of fact they arent allowed to do business every polis has laws against people who sell one thing and say its another the same as every polis has laws against people who use false weights and measures that still doesnt mean you arent supposed to keep your eyes open menedemos replied if somebody you run into on the street tells you hes got all the treasure alexander took and hell sell it to you for two minai dont you deserve to lose your money if youre stupid and greedy enough to believe him of course you do sostratos answered you deserve to be a laughingstock too but that doesnt mean the other fellow shouldnt be punished for cheating you spoilsport i admire a clever thief how much would you admire one who was clever enough to cheat you menedemos didnt answer not in words but by the way he strutted a little more than he had been doing he clearly suggested such a thief was yet to be born sostratos also kept his mouth shut doubting his cousin too loudly would only start a fight and he didnt want that when he and menedemos came to the main market square in sidon they both stopped at the edge and stared before plunging in everything seemed much more tightly crowded than in an agora in a hellenic polis stalls and tents and stands were everywhere with only narrow lanes through them for customersand for hawkers who walked about selling things like dates and cheap jewelry from trays they either carried or secured to their waists with harnesses of leather or rope when sostratos did step into the maelstrom he felt overwhelmed everywhere people haggled and argued in guttural aramaic they gesticulated frantically to bolster whatever points they were making he snapped his fingers heureka he exclaimed thats nice menedemos said what have you found why this place isnt like one of our agorai and the answer is his cousin asked theyre just talking business here sostratos said business and nothing else how much this costs or how much of that they can buy for so many sigloishekels they say in aramaic and thats all menedemos yawned thats boring is what it is business is all very welldont get me wrongbut there are other things in life too i should hope so sostratos said in a polis full of hellenes the agora wasnt only the place where people bought and sold goods it was also the beating heart of a citys life men gathered there to talk politics to gossip to show off new clothes to meet friends and to do all the other things that made life worthwhile where did the phoenicians do those things did the phoenicians do those things if they did the market square gave no sign of it looking around menedemos said it may not be a polis but theres sure a lot for sale isnt there oh yes without a doubt nobody ever said the phoenicians werent formidable merchants thats why were here after all sostratos said but the place feels empty if youre a hellene i think part of its that everybodys speaking a foreign language menedemos said i noticed that in a couple of the italian towns we visited and aramaic sounds a lot less like greek than oscan does thats part of it sostratos admitted but only part the italians knew what an agora was for well yes his cousin said even so though with us likely being here all summer long i think im going to have to rent a room in the town i dont see how i can do my business off the aphrodite i wont argue with you my dear sostratos said do what you have to do me im going to look for a donkey tomorrow he eyed menedemos in a thoughtful way one i can ride that is ha menedemos said ha ha ha ha ha if you were half as funny as you think you are youd be twice as funny as you really are sostratos had to think that over before deciding his cousin had scored a point as menedemos haggled with an innkeeper he wished hed gone with sostratos to learn a little aramaic from himilkon the innkeeper spoke a rudimentary sort of greek he knew numbers and yes and no and a startling collection of obscenities even so menedemos was sure the fellow missed all the fine points of his argument no the phoenician said now too low pay more or he pointed toward the doorway the wretch had no style no subtlety menedemos lost patience hail he said and walked away he was almost to the doorway when the phoenician said wait why menedemos asked the innkeeper looked blank maybe nobodyd ever asked him such a philosophical question before menedemos tried again why should i wait for what how much less do you say id have to pay that finally got through to the fellow he named a price halfway between what menedemos had offered and what he himself had insisted on up till now menedemos tossed his head the gesture meant nothing to the phoenician remembering he was in a country full of barbarians menedemos shook his head no matter how unnatural the motion seemed to him for good measure he started toward the door again thief the innkeeper said menedemos found it interesting that he should know the word when his greek was so limited the rhodian bowed as if at a compliment the phoenician said something in his own language by his tone menedemos doubted it was a compliment he bowed again the phoenician added another string of harsh gutturals but then cut the difference between his price and menedemos in half again there you see you can be reasonable menedemos said odds were the words went straight past the innkeeper menedemos raised his own price very slightly the phoenician made a wounded noise and clutched at his chest with both hands as if menedemos had shot him with an arrow when that bit of theater failed to impress menedemos the barbarian nodded brusquely and stuck out his hand deal he said clasping it menedemos wondered if hed made a good bargain or a bad one in rhodes he would have been pleased to rent a room for this price but were prices here generally higher or lower than those back home he didnt know figuring it out wasnt easy either working back and forth between drakhmai and sigloi made his head ache the local silver coins were worth just over two rhodian drakhmai each sostratos seemed to have little trouble shifting from one to the other but sostratos had been born with a counting board between the ears menedemos mathematical accomplishments were much more modest the room itself was about what hed expected it was small and close furnished with a bed a couple of rickety stools and a chamber pot whod been in the bed before what bugs waited there for the next arrival just thinking of the question was enough to make menedemos start scratching he knew he dared not leave anything in the room unguarded he sighed that would mean paying a sailor something extra to keep an eye on things while he went out to sell the expense would make sostratos grumble any expense made sostratos grumble but the expense of missing trade goods would be worse when menedemos walked back from the room to the front of the inn he found the phoenician arguing with his wife menedemos had to fight to hold back a laugh here was one woman who wouldnt tempt him into adultery she was fat and grayhaired with a sickle of a nose dominating her face she had a harsh voice that did nothing to soften the rough aramaic language but when she saw menedemos she broke off berating her husband and absurdly batted her eyelashes at the rhodian good days she said in greek even worse than the innkeepers how you is well thank you menedemos answered politely he added and you good she smiled at him and turning her face away from her husband ran her tongue over her lips then she batted her eyelashes again oh by the gods menedemos thought in alarm sostratos doesnt want me seducing anybody and i dont want this harridan seducing me he wondered if he ought to find another inn but he didnt feel like wasting his time in another dicker over another unappealing little chamber the less im here the less ill have to deal with her he told himself she said something in aramaic to her husband whatever it was it started the argument once more menedemos didnt want to get stuck in the middle he was about to retreat to his room when a man came in carrying a chunk of pork menedemos remembered sostratos saying ioudaioi didnt eat swines flesh that plainly didnt hold for phoenicians the newcomer gave the innkeeper a bronze coin the innkeeper took the meat and threw it into hot oil the oil bubbled and sizzled a savory aroma filled the chamber but it wasnt so savory as it might have been the meat couldnt have smelled better the oil could have it wasnt very fresh and hadnt been very good to start with menedemos wrinkled his nose so did the fellow whod brought in the pork he said something in aramaic menedemos didnt know how the innkeeper replied but he sounded defensive the way he spread his hands also made that likely menedemos had an inspiration as the innkeeper turned the meat with a pair of wooden tongs the rhodian asked him do you want to buy some better olive oil what you say the fellows greek was horrible olive oil good olive oil you buy menedemos spoke as if to an idiot childnot that an idiot child would have been interested in buying olive oil of course he wasnt sure the innkeeper understood the greek for olive oil and wished sostratos were here to translate for him but he had to do the best he could he pointed into the pan and held his nose the man whose pork was frying did the same thing olive oil you how much the innkeeper asked yes olive oil me menedemos started to dip his head then remembered to nod instead he named his price the sidonian stared at him he said something in aramaic menedemos guessed it was the price translated into his own language the innkeepers wife and the customer both exclaimed in what certainly sounded like horror the innkeeper then doled out one word of greek no that wasnt an invitation to haggle it was rejection plain and simple as the innkeeper took the fried pork out of the pan wiped oil off it with a bit of rag and handed it to the man whod brought it in menedemos asked him well what do you usually pay for olive oil he had to simplify that before the innkeeper understood him when the fellow told him he let out a wistful sigh the innkeeper bought oil as cheap as he could get he wouldnt have been interested in damonaxs fine oil at any price that let menedemos break even let alone turn a profit so much for inspiration he thought the man with the fried pork walked out gnawing on it the innkeeper and his wife didnt start quarreling again but the woman did send menedemos a wink and a leer he retreated faster than the persian king had after each battle against alexander the phoenician woman let out a sigh doubtless intended to be alluring it only made menedemos retreat faster still when he told sostratos about it on the aphrodite his cousin said yes now give me another story youre trying to back out of your oath is what youre doing by the gods i am not menedemos said with a shudder come to the inn with me and youll see for yourself i tell you i wouldnt have this woman on a bet and to the crows with me if i can understand why the barbarian married her maybe she brought a large dowry sostratos suggested maybe menedemos said that makes more sense than anything else i can think of but even so he shuddered again then went halfway toward changing the subject i tried to sell the innkeeper some of your brotherinlaws olive oil did you well thanks sostratos said let me guessno luck im afraid not my dear he was using some dreadful nasty stuff to fry meat and i hoped he might want something better but no he used the nasty oil because it was cheap and he turned green when i told him what i wanted for oursas green as if he were seasick or as if hed been tasting his own oil i did try though sostratos sighed i already said thank you ill say it again gods only know how were going to unload that stuff it is good oil but even so he clicked his tongue between his teeth i wouldnt mind breaking an amphora of it over damonaxs head have you got your donkey yet menedemos asked besides your brotherinlaw i mean heh sostratos said and then tossed his head no not yet prices for beasts of burden are higher than i want to pay because antigonos soldiers have bought upor maybe stolen for all i knowso many of them but theres onea mule actually not a donkeyi have my eye on if i can get the man who owns it down to something like a reasonable price i wished i had you along today so you could have told the innkeeper just how vile his olive oil was menedemos said maybe i should have learned some aramaic after all i could say i told you so sostratos remarked but then he surprised menedemos by continuing but i wont ive been speaking it all day and my head feels pounded flat i believe you menedemos didnt really want to speak aramaic he wanted all the barbarians he dealt with to speak greek doing things the other way round was in his mind a poor second best a big round ship made her slow stately way into sidons harbor her entrance had to be slow and stately the wind had brought her south past the promontory on which the phoenician town sat but that same wind blew dead against her when she tried to come about and sail in that failing the crew worked their sweeps and rowed the round ship into port her performance under oars was to the aphrodites as a spavined ass was to that of a persian stallion when at last she tied up at a quay perhaps a plethron from the aphrodite she started disgorging soldiers some of them wore their corselets and crested bronze helms more carried them in this warm weather menedemos reckoned that sensible he wouldnt have wanted to wear any more than he had to either sostratos lips were moving after the last trooper came off the merchantman he said i counted two hundred and eight men there the next interesting question is whether theyll stay here or go on to someplace elsesomeplace farther south say if they stay here antigonos or his general probably intends to use them against cyprus menedemos said and his cousin dipped his head in agreement menedemos went on if they move south where will they be going against egypt do you think that seems likely sostratos said the next question is how long will ptolemaios or his brother menelaos need to hear those men are here and theyve done whatever they end up doing only a few days sail from here to cyprus menedemos observed not much more to alexandriamaybe no more because youre likely to have the wind with you all the way down to the nile if someone doesnt leave with the news before the sun sets tomorrow id be astonished so would i sostratos dipped his head once more he went on i can hardly wait to start down toward the land of the ioudaioi i wonder how many hellenes have ever gone there not many unless i miss my guess you could write a book menedemos said he didnt like the glow that lit his cousins eyes youre right sostratos murmured i could couldnt i every hellene who ever set foot in india seems to have written down what he saw and heard there maybe i could do the same for this place thats fine menedemos told him or its fine as long as you remember youre there first to buy balsam and whatever else you find if you take care of that whatever else you do is your own affair if you dont though youll have to explain to me and to your fatherand to minewhy you didnt yes my dear i do understand that i really do sostratos said patiently menedemos wondered whether to believe him having bought his mule sostratos wished he could leave sidon without an escort the more he thought about having several sailors with him the less he liked it but hed made the bargain with menedemos and he had a merchants horror of broken bargains then after the first two men he asked to come with him to the land of the ioudaioi turned him down flat he began to wonder if he could keep this one what will i do if they all say no he wondered nervously ill have to hire guards here in sidon i suppose his mouth twisted he didnt like that trusting himself to the company of strangers seemed more dangerous than going alone he wondered whether his cousin would agree he doubted it he walked up to aristeidas the sharpeyed young sailor smiled and said hail hail sostratos answered how would you like to come to engedi with me to serve as a bodyguard along the way that depends aristeidas answered how much extra will you pay me if i do a drakhma a day on top of the drakhma and a half you already make sostratos said the other two sailors had asked the same question the extra money hadnt been enough to interest them they were happier staying in sidon and spending their silver on wine and women but aristeidas after a momentary hesitation dipped his head ill come he said and smiled again like most though not all men of his generation he shaved his face which made him look even younger than he was hed probably made a striking youth though that might have gone unnoticed in someone growing up without wealth in any case a youths beauty did less for sostratos than did a womans oh very good he said ill be glad to have you along he meant it and explained why its not just that youve got good eyes youve got good sense too thank you very much aristeidas said i dont exactly know that thats true but i like to hear you say it the next sailor sostratos asked was moskhion he wasnt particularly young or particularly smart but he had been smart enough to see that while pulling an oar wasnt an easy life it beat the whey out of his former career of sponge diving and he was big enough and strong enough to be worth more than a little in case of a brawl sure ill come he said when sostratos put the question to him why not with a little luck all well have to do is go there and come back right yes with a little luck sostratos answered but what will you do if our luck isnt so good what will you do if we have to fight i expect ill fight what else moskhion didnt sound worried sostratos supposed that if youd got used to jumping out of a boat with a trident in one hand and with a rock held against your chest in the other to make you sink faster nothing that might happen on dry land was likely to faze you he said im glad to have you along youre a host all by yourself maybe maybe not too moskhion said but people think so when they look at me every once in a while that gets me into fights more often though it keeps me out of them thats what i want it to do here sostratos said im not looking to get into fights with the barbarians good moskhion said some people fight for sport but im not one of them i wouldnt want you along if you were sostratos said the next three men he asked all told him no annoyed at them annoyed at the need to bring guards along he went to menedemos and asked if two would do his cousin annoyed him all over again by tossing his head get somebody else menedemos said the idea is to have enough men along to keep from giving bandits nasty ideas i might take the whole crew and not manage that sostratos protested im not asking you to take the whole crew menedemos said i am asking you to take one more man since he was the captain sostratos had to pay attention to him sostratos liked getting orders no more than any other free hellene indeed he liked it less than a lot of other hellenes might have here though he had to obey as he came down from the aphrodites poop deck with a storm cloud on his face one of the sailors said excuse me but if youre looking for somebody to go with you when you head inland ill do it you teleutas sostratos said in surpriseand not necessarily pleased surprise either why do you want to come well id be lying if i said i couldnt use the extra silver a drakhma a day over and above the usual thats not bad not half bad matter of fact and it ought to be pretty easy money so long as everything goes well yes but what if it doesnt sostratos asked teleutas took his time thinking about that he was perhaps ten years older than sostratosin his mid to late thirties rowing under the fierce summer sun had made his lean face dark and leathery with lines like gullies so that at first glance he seemed older than he was his eyes though retained what was either a childlike innocence or a chameleonlike gift for hiding his true nature he always did enough to get by but only just and had a habit of grumbling even about that more than two years after first bringing him aboard the aphrodite sostratos kept wondering if hed made a mistake at last the sailor said whatever happens i expect i can handle it can you sostratos meant the question once in italy teleutas might have left him and menedemos in the lurch hed quickly returned to the agora in that town in great hellas with other sailors from the merchant galley maybe hed only gone to get help maybe i expect i can he said now was his grin as open and friendly as it seemed or an actors mask to hide cowardice try as sostratos would he couldnt tell teleutas went on in reasonable rational tones as if arguing a point at the lykeion im not likely to light out am i not in a countryside full of barbarians you may like making those funny noises in the back of your throat but i dont isnt that interesting sostratos thought he knows i dont trust him and hes giving me a reason why i should this time it was a good reason too sure enough why would teleutas want to do anything but what he was paid to do when he spoke no aramaic he couldnt easily disappear among strangers here as he could in a polis full of hellenes sostratos plucked at his beard considering teleutas added i know a thing or two that might come in handy too the sort of thing you probably wouldnt oh such as sostratos asked this and that the sailor answered you never can tell when itd be useful but it just might plainly he didnt want to give details sostratos wondered what that meant had he been a bandit at one time or another he spoke like a rhodian and few rhodians needed to turn to brigandage to survive but if say hed been a mercenary and seen things go sour who could guess what hed had to do to keep eating he didnt have a soldiers scars but maybe hed been lucky with sudden decision sostratos dipped his head all right teleutas ill take you on well see what comes of it teleutas gave him that charming grin again i thank you kindly you wont be sorry id better not be sostratos said if you make me sorry ill make you sorry too i promise you that do you believe me yes teleutas said but what would he say more than a few people took sostratos lightly because he used his wits more readily than his fists hed made some of them regret it he hoped he wouldnt have to worry about that with teleutas when he told menedemos hed chosen his third escort his cousin looked pained by the dog of egypt i wish youd picked almost anybody else menedemos said can you trust teleutas when your back is turned i wouldnt want toill tell you that i wouldnt want to in hellas id be lying if i said anything else sostratos replied but here yes i think i can hes not going to make friends with bandits when he cant speak their language and he doesnt know any aramaic he should be safe enough i hope so menedemos didnt sound convinced since sostratos wasnt altogether convinced either he couldnt get angry at his cousin he said i think everything will be all right i hope so menedemos said again even more dubiously than before what harm can he do me sostratos asked i asked myself again and again and i couldnt see any i cant see any either menedemos admitted but that doesnt mean there isnt any were on dry land now my dear sostratos said with a smile we dont have to pay any attention to all our seagoing superstitions menedemos had the grace to laugh he at least knew he was superstitious many sailors would have indignantly denied it at the same time spitting into the bosom of their chitons to take away the bad luck in the accusation all right all right menedemos said ive got no real reason not to trust teleutas but i dont remember he was about the last one we took on a couple of years ago and hes still the first one id leave behind if i ever had to maybe youll have a different idea when we come back from the land of the ioudaioi sostratos said maybe i hope i will menedemos answered but maybe i wont too thats what worries me sostratos judged it a good time to change the subject at least a little when i leave sidon may i borrow your bow and arrows oh yes of course menedemos dipped his head youll get better use out of them there than i will here im sure of that just try to bring the bow back in one piece if youd be so kind what do you think id do to it sostratos asked with as much indignation as he could muster i dont know i dont want to find out all i know is things sometimes go wrong when you handle weapons thats not fair sostratos said havent i shot pirates havent you compared me to alexandros in the iliad when i did his cousin dipped his head once more you have i have all true every word of it but ive seen you at the gymnasion in rhodes too and there are times when youve looked like you hadnt the faintest idea what to do with a bow that hurt it hurt all the more because sostratos knew it was true he would never make a really fine archer he would never be anything that required large amounts of grace and strength try as he would he didnt have them in him not in large supply ive got my wits he told himself sometimes that brought him considerable consolation for it let him look down his nose at people who were merely strong and athletic other times such as today he tried not to think about it menedemos set a hand on his shoulder as if to say he shouldnt make too much of it if the gods are kind you wont have to worry about any of this the only time youll shoot the bow is for the pot yes if the gods are kind sostratos agreed but teleutas wouldnt have any worries or any work to do if the gods were kind either sostratos gaze slid to menedemos in a way his cousin reminded him of teleutas though menedemos would have been anything but pleased to hear him say so they both wanted things to be easy and convenient there the resemblance ended if things werent easy or convenient teleutas a man of no particular drive would either withdraw or get through the difficulty or the inconvenience as best he could menedemos was much more likely to try to reshape whatever was going on around him so that it suited him betterand had both the energy and the charm to get what he wanted most of the time with a laugh menedemos went on of course if we could be sure the gods would be kind you wouldnt need to take guards alongor the bow either for that matter youd like that wouldnt you sostratos said then you could forget about your half of our bargain his cousin wagged a finger at him that knife has two edges and you know it you dont want to travel with the sailors because theyll keep you from poking your nose into everything under the sun its not your nose you want to poke into everything under the sun sostratos retorted menedemos laughed again this time with a booming guffaw that made several sailors turn their heads to try to find out what was so funny he waved them back to whatever they were doing then said ah my dear anyone would think you knew me id better after all these years of living side by side in rhodes and even closer than that when we go to sea sostratos answered but how much does it matter not so much id say as whether you know yourself thats one of your philosophers menedemos said accusingly i know you tooyou always try to sneak them in you think you have to improve me whether i feel like being improved or not since that held no small amount of truth sostratos didnt waste time denying it he said its from one of the seven sages sure enough but its also the inscription at delphi if its good enough for the oracle there shouldnt it be good enough for you too hmm maybe menedemos said i thought it would be platon or sokratestheyre the ones you usually trot out why shouldnt i sostratos knew his cousin wanted to get his goat and also knew menedemos was succeeding he couldnt keep the irritation from his voice as he continued or do you think sokrates was wrong when he said the unexamined life wasnt worth living here we go again i dont know about that menedemos said sostratos showed his teeth in a triumphant grin even his cousin wouldnt have the nerve to quarrel there but menedemos did i do know that if you spend too much time examining your life you wont have time to live it sostratos opened his mouth then closed it again he hoped he would never hear a better argument against philosophy he made the best comeback he could answering one of the seven sages also said nothing too much i think weve had too much of this argument for now menedemos said sostratos dipped his head glad to escape so easily but then menedemos added i also think weve got too much of your brotherinlaws olive oil so do i sostratos said but sometimes you have to make allowances for family he looked menedemos in the eye think of all the allowances ive made for you i havent the faintest idea what youre talking about menedemos said here i thought i was the one making allowances for you didnt i let you wander over the italian countryside when we were docked at pompaia a couple of years ago even though i was afraid somebody would knock you over the head didnt i let you lug that gryphons skull all around the aegean last summer even though i was sure we wouldnt make back what we paid for it i dont know why you were so sure of that when damonax offered me enough silver to let me turn a big profit sostratos said tartly you turned him down which proves youre a fool menedemos said and he offered it which proves hes a fool if hes not a fool why have we got so cursed much olive oil aboard the aphrodite see what i mean about making allowances for family what i see is sostratos stopped and spluttered laughter he wagged a finger at menedemos here youre not going to like this but ill tell you what i see i see a man who knows how to use logic but says hes got no use for philosophy i see a man whod like to love wisdom but would sooner love pretty girls and good wine instead menedemos broke in sostratos tossed his head oh no my dear youre not going to get away with a joke this time youre going to let me finish what i see is a man whod like to love wisdom but cant bring himself to take anything seriously and that if you ask me is a shame and a waste of a good mind out in the harbor a tern dove into the water a moment later it came out with a writhing fish in its beak it swallowed the fish as it flew away menedemos pointed to it that bird has no philosophy but it still gets its opson it does not sostratos said what are you blind did it catch a fish or didnt it certainly it did but what does a tern live on fish of coursefish is its sitos its staple if you gave it a barley roll that would be its opson its relish because it has to have fish but it could do without the roll menedemos scratched his head in thought then he scratched again this time in earnest i hope that miserable inn hasnt left me lousy all right youre rightfish for a tern is sitos not opson i suppose youll tell me thats philosophy too i wont tell you anything of the sort ill just ask a question if there was anything sostratos enjoyed it was the chance to play sokrates if caring enough to use the right word isnt part of loving wisdom what is it i dont suppose youd put up with anything so ordinary as just trying to say the right thing would you is that all homer was doingjust trying to say the right thing i mean homer always said the right thing menedemos sounded very sure and he never heard of philosophy sostratos wanted to argue that but soon decided he couldnt he doesnt use the word for wisdom at all does he sophie let me think after a moment menedemos said no thats not true he uses it once in the fifteenthi thinkbook of the iliad and he who thanks to the inspiration of athene knows well every skill but hes not talking about a philosopherhes talking about a carpenter and sophie in the iliad doesnt mean abstract knowledge the way it does with us it means knowing how to do the things a carpenter does you can still use it that way sostratos said but not i admit if youre going to talk about philosophy no menedemos said homer s a very downtoearth poet even his gods on olympos are downtoearth if you know what i mean they certainly arethey behave like a bunch of badtempered macedonians sostratos said which made menedemos laugh more seriously sostratos went on theyre so downtoearth in fact that some people who love wisdom have trouble believing in them his cousins expression curdled like sour milk sostratos hadnt included himself in that group but he hadnt excluded himself from it he suspected he knew why homer said nothing about philosophy the poet had lived a long time ago before any hellenes began seriously asking questions of the world around them and following logic wherever it took them we were as ignorant as any barbarians he thought bemused and some of us still are and dont want to be any different menedemos said some people say they love wisdom when all they really love is making their neighbors uncomfortable he gave sostratos a pointed stare sostratos returned it some people think that just because their greatgrandfathers believed something was so it has to be so if we all had that attitude we wouldnt use ironor even bronze come to thatand we would have thrown back the alphabeta like a worthless fish that nobody eats they glared at each other then menedemos asked what do you suppose would happen if you made that argument to the phoenicians or the ioudaioi nothing pretty nothing pleasant but theyre barbarians and they dont know any better were hellenes whats the point of being a hellene if not to use the wits the godswhatever they may begave us you think you have an answer for everything dont you no not at all sostratos tossed his head i think we should use our wits though to try to find answers and not rely on whatever our forefathers said they might have been wrong a lot of the time they were wrong if id managed to get that gryphons skull to athens for instance it would have shown people how wrong they were about the beasts yes but how important are gryphons menedemos asked gryphons arent important not by themselves sostratos said but the men of the lykeion and the academy would have looked at the evidence and changed their views to fit they wouldnt have said no we wont believe what the skull tells us because our greatgrandfathers told us something else and thats important dont you see he sounded as if he was pleading and he sadly wondered whether menedemos understood at all menedemos clapped sostratos on the back then cupped his hands and interlaced his fingers to give his cousin a legup with his help sostratos swung up onto the back of the mule hed bought sostratos looked around with a grin saying im not used to being so far off the ground well o best one youd better get used to it menedemos answered youre going to be on that mule for a while thats right aristeidas agreed with a grin youll come back to sidon all bowlegged he stumped around with his legs splayed wide apart go howl sostratos said laughing no aristeidas is right or he should be i like that menedemos said laughing too your legsll look like an omega thus he wrote the letterin the dust of the street with his right big toe then he also imitated a bowlegged man and when you get back you wont be any taller than i am in your dreams sostratos retorted that held more truth than he might have guessed for menedemos especially when they were both growing up had dreamt of matching his gangling cousins height sostratos went on youd burst like a squashed melon if prokroustes tried stretching you on his rack till you were my size ha menedemos said prokroustesd be cutting you down to size if he ever got you to sleep in his bed and hed start with your tongue sostratos stuck out the organ in question menedemos made as if to grab for his belt knife sostratos looked from him to aristeidas teleutas and moskhion the former sponge diver carried a pike as tall as he was while the other two men wore swords on their hips some bodyguards sostratos said he had a sword himself a leather bowcase held menedemos bow several spare bowstrings and twenty arrows all four men wore cheap bellshaped bronze helmets that would keep a club from knocking their brains out the helms offered no protection for the face but were far lighter and cooler than the allenclosing ones hoplites used i think were ready sostratos said as if to agree with him aristeidas picked up the lead rope of the donkey that carried their trade goods and money the donkey brayed in protest a moment later the mule joined in its voice louder and deeper wingfoot hermes keep you safe menedemos said he set his hand on sostratos leg for a moment his cousin covered it with his own hand then sostratos flicked the reins and squeezed the mules barrel with his knees and calves the beast brayed again for a moment menedemos thought it would do no more but ears twitching resentfully it began to walk aristeidas had to yank on the ass lead line to get it to follow the four hellenes and two animals left the harbor and disappeared into sidon before long theyd be off in the wilds of the land of the ioudaioi keep an eye on him all of you menedemos muttered he wondered if he was talking to the sailors from the aphrodite who accompanied sostratos or to the gods high above by then the sailors were too far away to hear him he hoped the gods werent sighing he walked back up the pier to the aphrodite diokles said hope everything goes good for him skipper yes so do i menedemos replied hes a clever fellow your cousin the oarmaster said doing his best to sound reassuring hell be fine menedemos remained unreassured oh yes sostratos is very clever he said but has he got any common sense there are times when i dont think hes got as much as the gods gave a gecko hes got more than you think diokles said the two of you youre kin so of course you cant see each other straight maybe youre right i hope youre right menedemos said still and all though i wish he werent wandering around among the barbarians when he goes and does something strange hellenes know how to make allowances almost everybodys seen someone whos more cut out to be a philosopher than to live in the real world but what do these silly ioudaioi know about philosophy not a thing not a single solitary thing how could they theyre just barbarians theyll think hes crazy is what theyll think your cousin doesnt do that stuff all the time or even very often diokles said i hope youre right menedemos repeated if the keleustes was right sostratos would or at least might come back with balsam and with profit if on the other hand he was wrong menedemos didnt want to dwell on that but couldnt help it he said if sostratos has all this common sense why did he take teleutas for one of his guards why not anybody else i wish i hadnt let him diokles put the best face on it he could nobodys ever been able to prove anything bad about teleutas everything he does theres always a good reason for it or there always could be one anyway otherwise you wouldnt have let him ship with us last year let alone this year it could be menedemos admitted yes it could be but when hes one of fortyodd men aboard the aphrodite thats one thing when hes one of four hellenes in the middle of nowhere thats something elseor its liable to be something else anyhow diokles didnt argue with him he wished the keleustes would have he wanted to think he was wrong not that he was right what diokles did say was while your cousins traveling what will you do the best i can menedemos answered gods only know how im going to unload the olive oil were carrying but well see about that i do have hopes for the rest of the food and the perfume and the silk and especially the books sostratos was clever there i wouldnt have thought of them by myself and well make a fine profit from themor i hope we will thatd be nice the oarmaster said agreeably how do you propose to go about selling em though you cant just take em to the market square well i suppose you could but how much good would it do you mostly phoenicians there and they wont care anything about our books i know ive been thinking about that menedemos said what i have in mind doing is he explained what do you think of that not bad skipper diokles grinned and dipped his head matter of fact not half bad id love to see you when you bring it off i would well why dont you come along menedemos said and whod keep an eye on the ship if i did diokles asked if your cousin were here if aristeidas were here even thatd be different but the way things are i think id better stick around when youre away menedemos clapped him on the back youre the best keleustes ive ever known you ought to have a ship of your own im sorry things havent broken the way they might have for you with a shrug diokles said one of these days maybe ive had the same thought id like to be a captain i wont say any different but things could be a lot worse too if i hadnt been lucky id still be pulling an oar somewhere he held out his hands palms up to show the thick rowers calluses they still bore in a way menedemos admired the oarmasters patience and willingness to make the best of things in another way he tossed his head when he was unhappy about how life treated him everybody around him knew he was unhappy sometimes that only succeeded in annoying everybody more often though he thought it was more often anyhow letting people know what he wanted and that he wouldnt be satisfied till he got it helped him get it he wondered whether he ought to tell diokles as much after a moment he tossed his head he doubted diokles was one who could profit from the advice later that day he put several books in a wicker basket with a lid which he took care to fasten down securely then he made his way through sidons narrow brawling streetscanyons they seemed to him on account of the tall buildings to either sidelooking for the barracks housing the macedonians and hellenes of the garrison he got lost hed known he would hed got lost before in plenty of towns it didnt usually worry him here it did most places if he got lost he could ask for directions here people stared at him as if he was speaking a foreign language when he asked do you speak greekand so to them he was he couldnt even steer by the sun in sidon the tall buildings mostly kept him from seeing it he was beginning to wonder if hed ever manage to find his way to the barracks or back to the harbor when he ran into a macedonian that was literally what he didthe fellow was coming out of an armorers shop a stout mace in hand when menedemos bumped him im sorry please excuse me menedemos said automatically in greek its all right no harm done the fellow answered he certainly stood out from the locals his skin was ruddy rather than olive his face freckled his eyes green and his hair halfway between brown and blond his nose was short and bluntand leaned to the right the result of a longago encounter with something hard and blunt oh gods be praised someone i can understand menedemos said now the macedonian laughed hellenes dont always say that about the likes of me when i start talking the way i did back home on the farm i he drifted into macedonian dialect which sure enough menedemos couldnt follow he waved that aside doesnt matter o best one you can speak greek if you want to but these phoenicians dont come close can you tell me where your barracks are ill do better than that im on my way back and ill take you there the macedonian said im philippos son of iolaos he waited for menedemos to give his own name his fathers name and his birthplace then asked why do you want to find the barracks rhodian menedemos held up the basket im a merchant and ive got things to sell in here things what kind of things books menedemos answered books philippos echoed in surprise menedemos dipped his head whod want to buy a book the macedonian asked him can you read and write menedemos asked in return not me philippos spoke with a certain stubborn pride menedemos had heard before letters are just a bunch of scratches and squiggles far as im concerned even in rhodes far more men would have answered that way than not menedemos said well in that case you wouldnt know what i was talking about even if i explained so im not going to waste my time i might as well try explaining music to a deaf man but a lot of men who have got their letters do enjoy reading ive heard that but to the crows with me if i know whether to believe it or not philippos said tell you what palwere almost to the barracks bet you a drakhma you dont sell any of your silly scribbles done menedemos said and he clasped hands with the macedonian to seal the wager they rounded a corner like so many buildings in cramped sidon the barracks towered five stories into the air sentries in hellenic armor stood guard outside the entrance soldiers and hucksters went in and out menedemos heard the sweet rising and falling cadences of greek and those of macedonian which sounded the same at a distance but to his ear didnt resolve into meaning when he drew closer philippos said im going to stand right here beside you friend by the gods i wont jog your elbow but if you can sell books youre going to do it where i can see you thats fair menedemos agreed he planted himself a couple of cubits in front of the sentries and launched into the iliad ragesing goddess of akhilleus he wasnt a rhapsode one of the traveling men whod memorized the whole poem or sometimes the odyssey and made their living by going from polis to polis and reciting in the agora for a few khalkoi here an obolos there but he knew the first book well and he was livelier than most rhapsodes theyd repeated the epics endless times and squeezed all the juice from them menedemos was really fond of the poet and that showed as hexameter after hexameter flowed from him a soldier going into the barracks stopped to listen a moment later so did another one somebody stuck his head out a thirdstory window to hear menedemos after a bit the fellow pulled it back in again he came downstairs to hear better by the time a quarter of an hour passed menedemos had drawn a fair crowd two or three soldiers had even tossed coins at his feet he didnt bother to pick them up but kept on reciting youre not selling books philippos said youre doing the poem yourself shut up menedemos hissed you told me you wouldnt queer my pitch the macedonian subsided menedemos went on with the iliad thus he spoke peleus son grew troubled his spirit pondering divided in his shaggy breast whether to draw his keen sword from beside his thigh break up the assembled men and slay the son of atreus or to contain his anger and curb his spirit he stopped here go on one of the soldiers exclaimed youre just getting into the good stuff a couple of other men dipped their heads but menedemos tossed his im no rhapsode not really im just a man who loves his homer the same as youre men who love your homer and why not how many of you learned to read and write from the iliad and the odyssey several soldiers raised their hands philippos the macedonian let out a low admiring whistle crows take you rhodiani think youre going to cost me money hush menedemos told him and went on with his sales pitch dont you want the poet always with you so you can enjoy his words whenever you please the divine alexander did he took a complete iliad all twentyfour books with him when he went on campaign in the east thats what people say anyhow its the truth one of the soldiers an older man said i saw his iliad with my own eyes i did he wanted to be as great a hero as akhilleus me id say he did the job too i wouldnt want to argue with you my friend menedemos said of course a complete iliads an expensive proposition what ive got here thoughhe hefted the basketare copies of some of the best books in the iliad and in the odyssey too so you can read about the anger of akhilleus or his fight with hektor or about odysseus and the way he tricked polyphemos the cyclops as often as you like the finest scribes in rhodes wrote em out you can be sure youve got the words just as homer sang them all those years ago he knew he was stretching things he wasnt sure himself any more just what homer had sung and rhodes had so few scribes that speaking of them in the plural necessarily lumped in just about all of them but he didnt intend to mention to the soldiers the hopeless hapless drunk sostratos had dealt with they didnt need to know such thingsand after all poor polykles hadnt copied any of these books besides though rhodes had only a handful of scribes it surely boasted more than any other cities except athens and ptolemaios bumptious upstart of a capital alexandria how much do you want for one of your books asked the soldier whod seen alexander s iliad menedemos smiled his smoothest smile twenty drakhmai he replied thats bloody robbery buddy thats what that is another man squawked by his accent he sprang from athens where i come from five drakhmais a fair price for a book but youre not where you come from are you menedemos said still smoothly i had to get these books copied in rhodes then dodge pirates all the way from there to here to bring them to sidon if you want a book here i dont think youll go to a phoenician scribe to get one written out the phoenicians letters dont even run the same way ours do they read from right to left if his cousin hadnt complained about that he never would have known it but he happily used it as part of his argument besides he added what else would you rather spend your silver on wine said the mercenary from athens pussy you drink wine and an hour later you piss it out you lay a woman and a day later your spear stands stiff again menedemos said but a books different a book is a possession for all time hed heard that phrase from sostratos too he supposed sostratos had got it from one of the historians he liked so much a couple of the men whod listened to him looked thoughtful the athenian said thats still an awful lot of money dickering started there not even the athenian had the gall to offer only five drakhmai the soldiers started at ten menedemos tossed his headnot derisively but with the air of a man who didnt intend to sell for that price one of them went up to twelve with no more prodding than that menedemos had to fight to keep a smile off his face it wasnt supposed to be so easy he didnt have to come down very far at all only to seventeen drakhmai three oboloi for each book youll sell for that the athenian asked to nail it down with the air of a man making a great concession menedemos dipped his head eight or nine soldiers hurried into the barracks even before they came back philippos son of iolaos handed menedemos a drakhma well rhodian you taught me a lesson he said oh what lesson is that menedemos asked my cousin collects them dont bet against a man who knows his own business especially dont push the bet yourself like a godsdetested fool ah menedemos considered i think sostratos already knows that one i hope he does anyhow sostratos had never wanted to be a leader of men in the generation following alexander the great when every fisherman dreamt of becoming an admiral and every dekarkhos imagined he would use the ten men he commanded to conquer a kingdom full of barbarians and set a crown on his head that made the rhodian something of a prodigy of course hardly any of the men with big dreams would fulfill them sostratos with no ambitions along those lines found himself in a role he didnt want to play trust me to get too much of what i dont want he muttered from atop his mule he didnt like the animal either whats that aristeidas asked nothing sostratos said embarrassed at being overheard he liked aristeidas and got on fine with him aboard the aphrodite not least because he hardly ever had to give him orders there here on dry land though almost everything he said took on the nature of a command the mules and donkeys hooves and the feet of the sailors accompanying him raised dust from the road the sun blazed down the weather warmer than it would have been in hellas at the same season of the year sostratos was glad for the broadbrimmed travelers hat he wore in place of his helmet without it he thought his brains might have cooked apart from the heat though the countryside could easily have been inhabited by hellenes the grain fields lay quiet they would be planted in the fall when the rains came for harvesting at the beginning of spring olive groves with their silvergreen leaves and gnarled twisted tree trunks looked much the same as they would have on rhodes or in attica so did the vineyards even the sharp silhouettes of mountains on the horizon could have come straight from a land where hellenes dwelt but the farmers tending the olive trees and grapevines stared at the men from the aphrodite like the sidonians the men in the interior wore robes that reached down to their ankles most of them just draped a cloth over their heads to hold the sun at bay the hellenes tunics which left their arms bare and didnt reach their knees marked them as strangers even sostratos hat seemed out of place teleutas didnt want to bother with his chiton why cant i shed it and go naked he said this weathers too stinking hot for clothes these people pitch fits if you run around bare and its their country sostratos said so no its not their countryits antigonos country now teleutas said do you think old oneeye cares a fart whether i wear my chiton or not sostratos wondered why hed let teleutas talk his way into coming along on this journey here they were only a day out of sidon and the sailor was already starting to whine and fuss sostratos said what i think is antigonos is back in anatolia keeping an eye on ptolemaios the phoenicians though the phoenicians are here they dont like people going naked i dont want them throwing rocks at us or whatever else they decide to do how do you know theyd do that teleutas demanded how do you i dont know theyd do that sostratos said what i do know o marvelous one is that youre about a digits breadth away from going back to sidon and explaining to my cousin that i couldnt use you here after all if youre going to come along youll do what i tell you the same as you do what menedemos tells you when were at sea have you got that he was breathing hard by the time he finished he didnt like launching into a tirade like that hed hoped he wouldnt have to and maybe i wouldnt he thought resentfully if id picked somebody besides teleutas but he had picked teleutas and so he was stuck with him the sailor looked resentful too he plainly had not the faintest notion why sostratos had come down on him so hard had he understood such things he wouldnt have annoyed sostratos in the first place now glaring he said what he had to say all right all right ill keep my chiton on are you happy delighted sostratos answered aristeidas snickered even moskhion smiled and he was hardly a man to notice subtleties but teleutas just went on glaring either he couldnt recognize sarcasm when he heard it or he was more comprehensively armored against it than anyone sostratos had ever met aristeidas pointed and asked whats that up ahead as usual hed seen something before anyone else did after riding on for a little way sostratos said i think its a little roadside shrine like a herm at a crossroads back in hellas the sandstone stele stood about half as tall as a man it had the image of a god now much weathered carved in low relief on each of its four sides there had been letters beneath the gods images but they were too worn to make out at least for someone as little familiar with phoenician writing as sostratos a couple of bundles of dried flowers and a loaf of bread now half eaten by animals lay by the base of the stele lets leave some bread of our own moskhion said we ought to get the gods here on our side if we can sostratos doubted an offering would do anything of the sort but he didnt suppose it could hurt if it made moskhion and the other sailors feel better it might even do some good go ahead he told the former sponge diver moskhion took a barley roll from a leather sack on the pack donkeys back he set it by the old loaf i dont know what prayers youre used to he told the god whose image adorned the stele but i hope youll look kindly on the hellenes passing through your land he bobbed his head up and down uh thank you it wasnt the worst prayer sostratos had heard may it be so he added shall we press on now no one said no before long a phoenician leading a donkey came up the road toward the hellenes he stared at them plainly hed seldom seen men who looked like them or dressed like them but they were four to his one so he kept to himself whatever opinions he might have had peace be unto you sostratos said in aramaicthe phrase most often used as a greeting or farewell in that language the phoenician blinked he must not have expected a foreigner to use his tongue and to you also peace he replied what manner of men are you we are hellenes sostratos said that was what it meant anyway as always in aramaic the literal meaning was we are lonians who are you my master what does your beast carry maybe we can trade hellenes the phoenicians dark eyebrows rose i have seen soldiers who called themselves by that name but never traders till now i thought all hellenes were soldiers and robbers it does my heart good to learn i am wrong that told sostratos more than he might have wanted to hear about the way his countrymen behaved hereabouts the phoenician bowed and went on your servant is bodashtart son of tabnit and you sir i am called sostratos son of lysistratos sostratos answered i come from the island of rhodes he pointed westward and you come here from this island to trade bodashtart asked sostratos started to dip his head then remembered to nod as a barbarian would have done bodashtart pointed to the pack donkey what do you carry there among other things fine perfume rhodes is famous for it sostratos told him the name of the islandand the name of the city on the islandmeans rose ah perfume the phoenician nodded again if it is not too expensive i might want some for my concubine and maybe for my wife too a man who could afford to keep both a concubine and a wife could probably afford perfume sostratos gave him another bow asking would you buy for silver my master or would you trade bodashtart hadnt told him what his donkey was carrying my lord i have with me beeswax and fine embroidered linen from the east the man said now he had to pause and explain what beeswax was sostratos hadnt heard the word before that done he went on i was taking them to sidon to sell them for what they might bring truly shamash shines on the hour of our meeting shamash sostratos remembered was the phoenician name for apollo the god of the sun truly he echoed i can use beeswax i think you buy perfume for yourself only or you want some to sell later i may want some to sell indeed my master i may bodashtart replied but it depends on price and quality eh and what does not that earned sostratos the first smile hed got from the phoenician he slid down off his mule the muscles in his inner thighs werent sorry to escape the beast trying not to show how sore he was he walked over to the pack donkey whats going on aristeidas asked we cant understand a word youre saying remember he has beeswax and embroidered linen sostratos answered hes interested in perfume well see what we can work out ah thats fine sir thats very fine the sharpeyed young sailor said but remember that youll want to have some perfume left when we get to that engedi place so you can trade it for balsam ill remember sostratos promised he hesitated aristeidas deserved better than getting brushed off like that its good you remembered too sostratos said if you can keep such things in mind maybe youll make a trader yourself one day me aristeidas looked surprised then he shrugged dont know that id want to i like going to sea the way i do all right i didnt say you had to make a trader i said you might sostratos fumbled with the lengths of rope lashing the pack donkeys burden to its back bodashtart watched with growing amusement which only made sostratos fumble worse he was about to pull out his knife and solve the problem the way alexander had solved the gordian knot when moskhion stepped up and helped undo the knots thanks sostratos muttered half grateful half mortified one large leather sack held the jars of perfume which lay nestled in wool and straw to keep them from smashing together and breaking sostratos pulled out a jar and held it up bodashtart frowned it isnt very big is it my lord the perfume is strong sostratos wanted to say concentrated but had no idea how to do so in aramaic or even if the word existed in that language it wasnt the first time hed had to try to talk his way around holes in his vocabulary he pulled the stopper out of the jar heresmell for yourself thank you bodashtart held the jar under his nose which was long and thin and hooked in spite of himself he smiled at the fragrance that is very sweet yes and the odor stays sostratos said perfume is in olive oil not water not wash off easily that is good that is clever bodashtart said i have heard you hellenes are full of clever notions now i see it is so here let me show you the beeswax i have please sostratos said the phoenician had no trouble with the ropes securing his ass load sostratos sighed hed thought he was used to the idea that most people were more graceful and dexterous than he every once in a while though it upped and bit him this was one of those times here you are my master bodashtart held up a lump of wax bigger than sostratos head have you ever seen any so fine and white white as the breasts of a virgin maid is it not so he had to eke out his words with gestures that wasnt vocabulary himilkon had taught sostratos when the rhodian understood he chuckled he didnt think a hellene would have tried to sell him wax with that particular sales pitch from his point of view phoenicians were even worse than bad tragedians for overblown comparisons and figures of speech of course they probably found most hellenes bland and boring custom is king of all sostratos reminded himself once more to bodashtart he said let me see that wax if you please i am your slave the phoenician replied and handed him the lump he sniffed it it had the distinctive slightly sweetish odor of good wax bodashtart hadnt cheapened it with tallow as some unscrupulous hellenes were known to do sostratos took his belt knife from its sheath and plunged it deep into the mass of wax again and again i am no cheat bodashtart said i have not hidden rocks or anything else in the middle of the beeswax so i see sostratos agreed you have not but i do not know you i meet you on the road i have to be sure shall i open every jar of perfume i get from you to make sure you have not given me one that is half empty bodashtart asked yes my master if you like sostratos answered fair is fair how can i say do not make yourself safe i cannot fair is fair bodashtart echoed he bowed to sostratos i had heard that all hellenes were liars and cheats i see this is not so i am glad sostratos politely returned the bow you too seem honest i want this beeswax how many jars of perfume for it he had a good notion of the price he might get for about ten minai of beeswax back in rhodes sculptors and jewelers and others who cast metal used as much of the stuff as they could lay their hands on and paid well for it bodashtart said ten jars seems right ten sostratos tossed his head then shook it back and forth in barbarian style you are no cheat my master you are a thief you think so do you the phoenician said well how many jars would you give me for my wax three sostratos answered three bodashtart laughed scornfully and you call me a thief you are trying to steal from me and i will not have it he drew himself up to his full height but was still more than a palm shorter than sostratos maybe we have no deal sostratos said if no deal i am pleased to meet you even so he waited to see what would happen next if bodashtart didnt want to trade he would take back the beeswax and go on his way toward sidon if he did he would make another offer the phoenician bared his teeth in what was anything but a friendly grin you are a bandit a robber a brigand he said but to show that i am just that i uphold fair dealing i will take only nine jars of perfume for this splendid precious wax now bodashtart waited to see if the rhodian would move i maybe give four jars sostratos said reluctantly they shouted at each other again and accused each other of larcenous habits bodashtart sat down on a boulder by the side of the road sostratos sat down on another one a couple of cubits away the sailors escorting him started throwing knucklebones for oboloi while he haggled his mule and ass and bodashtarts donkey began to graze after a fair number of insults sostratos got up to six jars of perfume and bodashtart got down to seven there they stuck sostratos suspected six and a half would have made a decent bargain but perfume except to cheaters didnt come in halfjars bodashtart showed no inclination to accept only six and sostratos didnt want to part with seven the market for beeswax wasnt enormous and did fluctuate if someone close to home came up with a lot of it hed lose money even paying only six jars of perfume for this lump he and bodashtart glared at each other both of them frustrated then the phoenician said look at the cloth i have to sell if i give you a bolt of thatits about three cubits longwith the wax will you give me seven jars of your perfume i know not sostratos answered let me see it bodashtart got up and opened a leather sack on the ass back sostratos would have carried fine cloth inside an oiledleather sack too to make sure water didnt damage it rain at this season of the year would have been unlikely in hellas and he judged was even more so here but bodashtarts donkey might have to ford several streams between here and sidon when the phoenician held out the length of cloth all three of sostratos escorts inhaled sharply in greek sostratos snapped keep quiet you godsdetested fools do you want to mess this up for me turn your backs pretend youre looking out to the hills for bandits if you cant keep your faces straight to his relief they obeyed bodashtart asked what did you say to them and will the cloth do i said they should watch for bandits in the hills sostratos feared hed made a hash of indirect discourse the aramaic construction was quite different from the accusative and infinitive greek used to show it but bodashtart nodded so he must have made himself understood he went on let me have a better look please as you say my master so shall it be bodashtart replied and brought it up to him the closer the phoenician came the more splendid the cloth appeared sostratos didnt think hed ever seen finer embroidery the hunting scene might have come straight from real life the frightened hares the thorn bushes beneath which they crouched the spotted hounds with red tongues lolling out the men in the distance with their bows and javelins the detail was astonishing so were the colors which were brighter and more vivid than those in use back in hellas hed managed to keep his men from exclaiming over the piece now he had to fight to keep from exclaiming over it himself to him it had to be worth more than the beeswax doing his best to keep his voice casual he asked where did it come from from the east from the land between the rivers bodashtart told him between which rivers sostratos asked but then the greek equivalent of what the phoenician had said formed in his mind oh he said from mesopotamia that of course meant nothing to bodashtart sostratos knew mesopotamia lay too far east for him to go there himself he would have to get this work from middlemen like the fellow with whom he was haggling will it do bodashtart asked anxiously to him the embroidery seemed nothing out of the ordinary just a small extra he could throw in to sweeten the price for perfume he really wanted i suppose so sostratos had trouble sounding as reluctant as he knew he should he wanted the embroidered cloth at least as much as the wax only later did he realize he might have asked for two cloths menedemos would have thought of that right away and would have done it too menedemos automatically thought like a trader where sostratos had to force himself to do so bodashtart fortunately noticed nothing amiss in sostratos answer he smiled we have a bargain thenthe cloth and the wax for seven jars of perfume he thrust out his hand sostratos took it yes a bargain he agreed seven jars of perfume for the wax and the cloth they exchanged the goods the phoenician put the perfume into a leather sack and led his ass on toward sidon you cheated him good and proper teleutas said as sostratos loaded the beeswax and the embroidered cloth onto his pack donkey i think i got the better of him yes sostratos answered but if he makes a profit with the perfume then no one cheated anybody thats the way i hope this trade works out why the sailor asked why not hope you diddled him good and proper he had a simple selfish rapacity that wouldnt have been out of place on a pirate patiently sostratos answered if both sides profit theyll both want to deal again and trade will go on if one cheats the other the side that gets cheated wont want to deal with the other the second time around teleutas only shrugged he didnt care he had no eye for the long term only for quick gain some merchants were like that too they didnt usually stay in business long and they fouled the nest for everyone else sostratos was glad he had more sense than that even menedemos had more sense than that sostratos hoped his cousin had more sense than that anyhow he walked over to the mule someone give me a legup he said we can get some more travel in before the sun goes down menedemos was beginning to feel at home in and around the barracks that housed antigonos garrison in sidon he preferred working the barracks to going into the market square not enough people in sidon spoke greek to make selling in the agora worthwhile for him around the barracks he was dealing with his own kind he was even starting to understand bits of macedonian it wasnt so big an accomplishment as sostratos learning aramaic but it made menedemos proud when he came up to the barracks one morning a guard whod seen him before said havent you sold all your books yet ive still got a couple left menedemos answered want to buy one the soldier tossed his head not me only use id have for papyrus is wiping my arse on account of i cant read you wouldnt want it for that its scratchy menedemos said and the sentry laughed carefully keeping his voice casual menedemos asked whats the name of your quartermaster here eh what do you want to talk with andronikos for the soldier replied with his shriveledup little turd of a soul he wont want to buy your books well maybe youre right and maybe youre not menedemos said easily id still like to find out for myself all right rhodian the sentry stood aside to let him into the building hes got an office on the second floor but dont say i didnt warn you menedemos had to be content with that less than ringing endorsement he paused inside the barracks to let his eyes adjust to the gloom someone on the first floor was reading aloud the story of akhilleus fight with hektor menedemos dared hope it was from a copy of the relevant book of the iliad hedsold he didnt stop to find out though he made his way to the stairs and went up them im looking for andronikos office he told the first hellene he saw when he came out onto the second floor the man jerked his thumb to the right thanks menedemos said and went down the hallway leading in that direction four or five people were in front of him he waited for perhaps half an hour as the quartermaster dealt with them one by one they didnt emerge from andronikos office looking happy though andronikos seldom if ever bothered raising his voice in due course it was menedemos turn by then a couple of more hellenes had joined the line behind him when andronikos called next he hurried into the office a broad friendly smile on his face that smile survived his first glimpse of the quartermaster but barely andronikos was in his late forties with a permanent fussy frown on his pinched features who are you he asked havent seen you before what do you want whatever it is make it snappy i havent got time to waste hail o best one im menedemos son of philodemos of rhodes menedemos said my bet is youre having more trouble keeping this garrison fed than you wish you did am i right or am i wrong youre the rhodian eh hail andronikos rewarded him with a dry grimace doubtless intended for a smile what do you care what the soldiers eat you cant sell them papyrus no indeed most noble though i can sell you papyrus and firstquality rhodian ink for recordkeeping if youre so inclined menedemos kept trying his best to be charming andronikos unwaveringly sour expression told him he was wasting his time he continued the reason im asking is that i also have some topnotch olive oil aboard my akatos oil fit for the highestranking officers in the garrison here and ive got fine pataran hams and a few smoked eels from phaselis too if the officers want fancy grub they buy most of it themselves as for youyou sailed an akatos here from rhodes and youre carrying oil surprise made the quartermaster sound amazingly lifelike you believe in taking chances dont you menedemos winced it wasnt as if he hadnt been telling himself the same thinghe had but having someone hed just met throw it in his face rankled im going to hit damonax over the head with a brick when we get home he thought aloud all he could say was its primequality oil believe you me it is i can get plenty of ordinary oil for not very much andronikos pointed out why should i spend silver when i dont have to tell me that and quick or else go away because this isnt ordinary oil menedemos answered its the best oil from rhodes some of the best oil anywhere you can give common soldiers ordinary oil to eat with their bread and theyll thank you for it but what about your officers dont they deserve better dont they ask you for better he hoped antigonos officers asked the quartermaster for better if they didnt he hadnt the faintest idea what hed do with all that oil andronikos muttered something under his breath menedemos couldnt make out all of it what he could hear was distinctly uncomplimentary to the officers in antigonos service mostly because they made him spend too much money at last with the air of a man whose stomach pained him andronikos said bring me an amphora of this wonderful oil well let a dozen soldiers dip bread in what theyre using now and in what you bring if they can tell the difference well talk some more if they canthe jerked a thumb toward the doorway through which menedemos had come many goodbyes to you what about the hams and the eels i already told you im not interested maybe some of the officers will bewith their own silver of course all right most noble one fair enough a chance to show how good my oil is is all i ask as usual menedemos spoke boldly he did his best to hide the alarm he felt inside just how good was the oil sostratos new brotherinlaw had foisted on the aphrodite good enough to let men tell the difference at a single taste he didnt know he was about to find out he did say since youll be buying the oil mostly for officers some of the men who try it should be officers too andronikos considered then dipped his head agreed he said go fetch your oil ill get the men together and some bread and some of our local oil and then rhodian we shall see what we shall see so we shall menedemos said in what he hoped wasnt too hollow a voice he hurried back to the harbor and freed a jar of olive oil from the rope harness and dunnage of twigs and branches that kept it from fetching up against other amphorai and smashing whats going on skipper diokles asked menedemos explained the keleustes whistled and said thats a roll of the dice isnt it any which way though you cant lug that jar back to the barracks yourself how would it look a captain doing stevedores work lapheides what is it said the sailor whod been paying no attention to the conversation between oarmaster and captain come get this amphora and carry it for the skipper diokles answered lapheides looked no more delighted at that prospect than anyone else would have but he came up and grabbed the jar by its handles where to he asked menedemos barracks menedemos told him just follow me youll do fine he hoped lapheides would do fine the sailor was a scrawny little man and the full amphora probably weighed half as much as he did by the time they got back to the barracks lapheides was bathed in sweat but hed done a good game job of carrying the amphora menedemos gave him three oboloi as a reward for his hard work thanks skipper he said and stuck the coins in his mouth one of the sentries plainly forewarned escorted menedemos and lapheides up to andronikos office in the next room the quartermaster had set up a table that held a loaf of bread and half a dozen shallow bowls heor more likely a slavehad poured yellow oil into three of the bowls the other three waited empty menedemos used his belt knife to chip away at the pitch around the clay stopped to the amphora hed had lapheides bring once the stopper was out he poured damonaxs oil into the empty bowls it was greener than the oil andronikos had got locally menedemos nostrils quivered at its odorfresh fruity almost spicy the rhodian breathed a silent sigh of relief by all the signs this was good oil he nodded to andronikos bring in your men o best one i intend to the quartermaster walked down the hall returning a moment later with what looked like a mix of ordinary soldiers and officers to them he said here my friends we have one oil in these bowls and another in these taste them both and tell me which is better please wait till youve all tasted both before speaking menedemos added we dont want one mans words coloring another mans thoughts a couple of soldiers scratched their heads but the men wasted no time in tearing the bread into chunks and dipping those chunks first into one olive oil then into the other they chewed solemnly and thoughtfully looking from one to another to see when theyd all sampled both oils by then only a few crumbs of the loaf were left a scarred veteran who wore a fat gold hoop in his right ear pointed to one of the bowls menedemos had filled that oil there is better he said tastes like its squeezed from the very first olives of the season when i was a lad i spent plenty of autumns whacking the olive trees with sticks to bring down the fruit i did reckon i know a firstrate early oil when i taste one another man dipped his head hippokles is right by zeus i havent tasted oil like that since i left my old mans farm to go soldier tastes like it came out of the press yesterday to the crows with me if it doesnt he smacked his lips then all the soldiers were talking at once and all of them praising menedemos oil no all of them but one the stubborn holdout said im used to this stuff herehe pointed to a bowl of the local oil this other oil tastes different thats the idea diodoros hippokles said the stuff weve been eating is tolerable i guess but if we can get this other oil what weve been using ought to go into lamps instead far as im concerned his comrades agreed some of them more heatedly diodoros tossed his head i dont think so i like this oil fine menedemos glanced toward andronikos the quartermaster didnt seem to want to meet his eye with his confidence restored menedemos didnt let that stop him he shooed the soldiers out of the testing room saying thank you most wise ones thank you very much im sure we can arrange for you to have some of this oil you likeand ive got smoked eels and hams to sell too back at my ship once they were gone he rounded on andronikos cant we arrange that depends on what you want for it the quartermaster said coolly if you think im going to throw silver at you like a young fool in love with his first hetaira youd better think again do you suppose your men there will keep quiet about what they just did menedemos asked can you afford not to buy will you wake up with a scorpion in your bed if you dont andronikos said ive squashed scorpions before and ill squash you too if you try to cheat me what do you want for your fancy rhodian oil just so you know im paying seven sigloi the amphora for what i buy hereabouts menedemos reminded himself that one sidonian siglos held about twice as much silver as two rhodian drakhmai sostratos was bound to know the exact conversion factor when menedemos tried to do anything but two for one he felt as if his brains would start leaking out of his ears youve seen for yourself that what i sell is better than what youre getting here he said and it comes from rhodes so what andronikos retorted you can bring it all that way by sea as cheaply as i can get oil from a days journey away by land that might be true on a round ship best one but im afraid its not on an akatos menedemos said i have to pay my rowers you know which gives you an excuse to gouge me the quartermaster growled no menedemos said thinking yes he went on all in all i think thirtyfive drakhmai the amphora is reasonable i wish this chamber were on a higher floor so i could throw you out the window and be sure i was rid of you once for all andronikos said you whipworthy rogue do you think id give you more than twenty he had no trouble shifting from sigloi back to drakhmai i certainly do think so because im not going to lose money by selling you my oil menedemos answered what will your menand especially your officerssay when they hear youre too cheap to buy them anything good my superiors will say im not wasting antigonos money andronikos told him thats my jobnot wasting his money he scowled at menedemos what will your principal say when you go back to rhodes with that olive oil still in the belly of your ship how will you pay your rowers on no money at all menedemos hoped his flinch didnt show andronikos was a quartermaster all right and a ruthless specimen of the breed despite all of menedemos persuasive powers he refused to go higher than twentyfour drakhmai i cant make any money on that menedemos said too bad here andronikos gave him three sigloi they showed the battlemented walls and towers of a citypresumably sidonon one side and a king slaying a lion on the other im not a thief this more than pays for the oil you used now close up your jar there and go but menedemos said the quartermaster tossed his head go i told you and i meant it you dont want my best price and i wont go higher good day rage threatened to choke menedemos he wanted to choke andronikos he didnt nor would he give the older man the satisfaction of seeing how badly he was wounded hed expected to sell the olive oil after his successful demonstration the quartermasters shot had been all too shrewd taking it back to rhodes was the last thing he wanted to do but all he said was seal up the jar lapheides were leaving he kept hoping andronikos would ask him to stop or call him back as he started out of the chamber andronikos didnt he stood silent as a stone menedemos slammed the door on the way out hard enough to rattle it on the pivoting pegs set into the floor and the lintel that made him feel better for a moment but it did nothing to bring back the business hed hoped to have lapheides was not a man he would have called particularly clever the sailor did have the sense to wait till theyd left the barracks before asking what do we do now skipper it was a good question it was in fact an excellent question menedemos wished he had an excellent answer for it or even a good one being without either he shrugged and said we go back to the aphrodite and see what happens next whatever it is i dont see how it can be much worse than this after a couple of heartbeats of thought lapheides dipped his head neither do i he said menedemos would sooner have had consolation since he could find none himself though he didnt see how he could blame lapheides for also being unable to come up with any sheep grazed and bleated around the little village nestled between hills and flatlands dogs barked at sostratos and his sailors as they walked into the place as often happened some of the bigger fiercer dogs made rushes at them teleutas scooped up an eggsized stone and flung it it caught the biggest meanest dog right in the nose the beasts snarls turned to yips of pain it turned tail and ran the rest of the dogs suddenly seemed to have second thoughts euge sostratos said now we wont have to beat them back with our spearshaft and swords i hope we wont anyhow people dont like it when they see us laying into their animals they dont care when they see the godsdetested dogs trying to bite us though teleutas said they think thats funny pestilence take em far as im concerned aside from the dogssome of which still barked and growled from a safe distance which argued theyd had more than a few rocks thrown at them beforethe hamlet was quiet no sooner had that crossed sostratos mind than he tossed his head it didnt just seem quiet it seemed more nearly dead but a dead village wouldnt have had flocks grazing around it its buildings wouldnt have been in such good repair smoke wouldnt have risen from the vent holes in several roofs on the other hand when strangers came to most villages the locals came tumbling out of their houses to stare and point and exclaim up till now that had seemed as much a truth in these parts as it would have back in hellas not here everything stayed quiet except for the dogs just before sostratos and the sailors got to the center of the hamlet an old man who wore a head scarf in place of a hat came out of one of the bigger houses and looked them over may the gods bless you and keep you my master sostratos said in his best aramaic please tell us the name of this place the old man stared back without a word for an unnervingly long time then he said stranger we do not speak of the gods here we speak of the one god the true god the god of abraham and isaac and jacob this village is called hadid excitement tingled through sostratos the one god you say he asked and the old man nodded sostratos went on then i have come to the land of ioudaia yes this is the land of ioudaia the old man said who are you stranger that you need to ask such a thing bowing sostratos answered peace be unto you my master i am sostratos son of lysistratos of rhodes i have come to trade in this land and to you also peace sostratos son of lysistratos the local tasted the unfamiliar syllables after another long pause he said you would be one of those ionians wouldnt you yes sostratos said resigned to being an ionian in these parts despite his doric roots what is your name my master if your slave may ask i am ezer son of shobal the old man replied is all well here sostratos asked no pestilence nothing like that ezer had formidable gray eyebrows and a beaky nose when he frowned he looked like a bird of prey no there is no pestilence may the one god forbid it why do you ask everything is very quiet here sostratos waved his arms to help show what he meant no one works works ezer son of shobal frowned again even more fiercely than before he shook his head of course no one works today today is the sabbath your slave prays pardon but he does not know that word sostratos said you did not learn this tongue from a man of ioudaia then ezer said once more sostratos had to remember to nod instead of dipping his head no i did not i learned from a phoenician truly you are very wise yes flattery seemed built into aramaic a phoenician i might have known by the way ezer said it he had as much scorn for phoenicians as himilkon had for ioudaioi the one god commands us to rest one day in seven that is the sabbath today is the seventh day and so we rest i see what sostratos saw was why these ioudaioi had never amounted to anything in the wider world and why they never would if they wasted one day in seven how could they keep up with their neighbors he marveled that they hadnt already been altogether swept away where can my men and i buy food he asked we have come a long way today we too are tired ezer son of shobal shook his head again you do not see ionian sostratos he carefully sounded out the name i told you this is the sabbath the one god decrees we may not work on this day selling food is work until the sun sets we may not do it i am sorry he sounded not the least bit sorry he sounded proud himilkon had warned that the ioudaioi had set ideas about their religion sostratos saw hed known what he was talking about will someone draw water from the well for us he asked you have a well i hope we have a well no one will draw water for you though not till after sunset that is also work may we draw water ourselves now ezer nodded yes you may do that you are no part of us no and i wouldnt want to be any part of you either sostratos thought he wondered how he would live in a land where religious law so closely hemmed in everything these people did his first thought was that he would simply go mad but then he wondered about that if hed been raised from childhood to find that law right and proper and necessary wouldnt he come to believe it was even in hellas thoughtless people blindly believed in the gods here in ioudaia it seemed everyone believed in their strange invisible deity if id been born a loudaian i suppose i would too the more sostratos thought about that the more it frightened him he bowed to ezer thank you for your kindness my master you are welcome the old man replied you cannot help it that you are not one of us and so cannot know and obey the sacred laws of the one god he means that sostratos realized in astonishment ezer son of shobal was as proud to belong to his narrow little backwoods tribe as sostratos was to be a hellene it would have been funny if it hadnt been so sad i wish i could show him how ignorant he is sostratos had had that same urge with hellenes too with his own folk he could act on it sometimes he managed to convince them of the error of their ways more often though even hellenes chose to cling to their own ignorance rather than accepting someone elses wisdom what are you and this bignosed old geezer going on about teleutas asked ezer didnt change expression no of course he doesnt speak greek sostratos told himself all the same you want to be careful how you talk about people here you never can tell when one of them may understand some of our tongue all right all right teleutas dipped his head with obvious impatience but what is going on we cant buy any food till after sundown sostratos answered they have a day of rest every seventh day and they take it seriously we can get water from the well though as long as we do it ourselves a day of rest thats pretty stupid teleutas said which was exactly sostratos opinion the sailor went on what happens if theyre in a war and they have to fight a battle on this special day of theirs do they let the enemy kill them because theyre not supposed to fight back i dont know that intrigued sostratos so he turned it into aramaic as best he could for ezer yes we would die the ioudaian answered better to die than to break the law of the one god sostratos didnt try to argue with him ezer sounded as passionate as a man who was busy wasting his inheritance on a hetaira and didnt care if he ruined himself on her behalf a man who wasted his inheritance on a hetaira at least had the pleasure of her embraces to recall what did a man who wasted his life on devotion to a foolish god have left nothing sostratos could see such mad devotion might even cost a worshiper life itself he didnt care to point that out to ezer son of shobal the ioudaian had made it plain he could see it for himself hed also made it plain he was willing to take the consequences how could a mans devotion to a god be greater than his devotion to life itself sostratos shrugged no it made no rational sense the rhodian did find a rational question to ask my master where is the well we are hot and thirsty go past this house hereezer pointedand you will see it thank you sostratos bowed ezer returned the gesture however mad he might be in matters pertaining to his god he was polite enough when dealing man to man sostratos went back to greek to tell the sailors with him where the well was id sooner have wine teleutas said that wasnt quite pure complaint or it might not have been pure complaint anyhow aristeidas dipped his head saying so would i drinking water in foreign parts can give you a flux of the bowels he was right of course but sostratos said sometimes it cant be helped we are in foreign parts and we have to drink water by itself now and again the country isnt swampy or marshy that makes the water likelier to be good i dont care how good it is i dont care if its water from the khoaspes the river the persian kings used to drink from teleutas said id still sooner have wine he hadnt cared about his health thenonly about his palate and the way wine would make him feel why am i not surprised sostratos thought as hellenes often did the ioudaioi had circled the well with rocks to the height of a cubit or so to keep animals and children from falling in theyd also put a wooden cover over the top of the well when the sailors took it off they found a stout branch lying across the opening with a rope attached to it lets haul up the pail sostratos said the men got to work taking turns at it teleutas groaned and grumbled as he hauled on the line he might almost have been sentenced to torture from everything sostratos had seen teleutas reckoned work the equivalent of torture then again hauling up a large full bucket wasnt easy sostratos wondered if there were some easier way to raise a bucket of water than yanking it up one pull at a time if so it didnt occur to him here we are aristeidas said at last moskhion reached out and grabbed the dripping wooden pail he raised it to his lips took a long blissful pull and then poured some over his head sostratos said not a word when teleutas and aristeidas took their turns before passing him the pail by bringing it up from the bottom of the deep well theyd earned the right water seems good enough aristeidas said its nice and cool and it tastes sweet i hope its all right it should be sostratos drank ahh as his men had he poured water over his head too ahh he said again it felt wonderful running down his face and dripping from his nose and the end of his beard every now and then he spied a face staring from the windows of the stone and mudbrick houses no one but ezer son of shobal came out though in fact sostratos waved the first time he saw one of those curious faces all that did was make it disappear in a hurry aristeidas noticed the same thing these people are funny he said if we came into a village full of hellenes theyd be all over us theyd want to know who we were and where we were from and where we were going next and what news wed heard lately the rich ones would want to trade with us and the poor ones would want to beg from us they wouldnt just leave us alone i should say not teleutas agreed theyd try to steal anything we hadnt nailed down too and theyd try to pry up the nails sostratos raised an eyebrow it wasnt that teleutas was wrong the sailor was without a doubt righthellenes would act like that but the notion of thievery seemed to occur to him very quickly not for the first time sostratos wondered what that meant he could have pushed on from hadid but he did want to buy food and ezer had made it very plain he couldnt do that till after sunset he and the sailors rested by the well after a while they refilled the bucket and hauled it up again they drank deep and poured the rest over themselves as he might have done in hellas teleutas started to pull off his tunic and go naked sostratos held up a hand i already told you once dont do that itd be cooler teleutas said people here dont like showing off their bodies so what so what ill tell you so what o marvelous one sostratos waved a hand there probably arent any other hellenes closer to this place than a days journey if we get people here up in arms against us what can we do if they start throwing rocks say what can we do i dont think we can do anything do you no i guess not teleutas said sulkily he left the chiton on after the sun went down the locals emerged from their houses sostratos bought wine and cheese and olives and bread and oil he tried not to think about all the oil damonax had made him carry on the aphrodite and he hoped menedemos was having some luck getting rid of it some people did ask questions about who he was where he was from and what he was doing in ioudaia he answered as best he could in his halting aramaic as twilight deepened mosquitoes began to whine through the air he slapped a couple of times but still got bitten a few of his questioners were women though they robed themselves from head to foot like the local men they didnt wear veils as respectable hellenes would have sostratos had noticed that back in sidon too to him seeing a womans naked face in public came close to being as indecent as seeing hisor teleutasnaked body would have been for the ioudaioi he wished he could ask them more about their customs and beliefs it wasnt so much that his aramaic wasnt up to the job but as he hadnt wanted teleutas to offend them he didnt want to do so himself he sighed and wondered how long it would be till his curiosity got the better of his common sense how you is the innkeeper asked when menedemos came out of his room one morning his name the rhodian had learned was sedekyathon good menedemos answered in greek then he said the same thing in aramaic of which hed picked up a few words sedekyathon grunted his wife who was called emashtart smiled at menedemos how clevers you am she said in her dreadful greek she rattled off a couple of sentences of aramaic much too fast for him to follow what menedemos said emashtart tried to explain it in greek but she lacked the vocabulary she turned to her husband sedekyathon was busy putting a new leg on a stool he showed no interest in translating his greek was bad too odds were he couldnt have done it if hed wanted to when he refused even to try emashtart started screeching at him hail menedemos said and left the inn in a hurry he spent as little time there as he could the innkeepers wife kept making unsubtle advances at him his oath to sostratos had nothing to do with anything he didnt want the woman whom he found repulsive and he didnt want sedekyathon thinking he did want her and trying to kill him as a result though the sun hadnt been up long the day promised brutal heat the breeze came not from the inner sea but from the hills east of sidon when it swept down off them menedemos had learned the heat got worse than anything hed ever known in hellas he stopped at a bakers and bought a small loaf of bread with a cup of wine from the first fellow he saw carrying a jug it made a good enough breakfast the cup fortunately was small unlike hellenes phoenicians didnt believe in watering their wine and always drank it neat a big mug of unmixed wine first thing in the morning would have set menedemos head spinning sidon was already bustling as he made his way through its narrow winding streets toward the harbor and the aphrodite on days like this the locals often tried to pack as much business as they could into the early morning and the late afternoon when the heat was at its worst they would close their shops and sleep or at least rest for a couple of hours menedemos wasnt used to doing that but he couldnt deny it made a certain amount of sense diokles waved to him when he came up the wharf hail the oarmaster called how are you glad to be here menedemos answered yourself im fine diokles said polykharmos came back to the ship last night shy a front tooth though tavern brawl he shrugged nobody pulled a knife so it wasnt a bad one he was pretty drunk but he kept going on about what he did to the other fellow oh menedemos raised an eyebrow didnt anybody ever tell him he shouldnt lead with his face the keleustes chuckled i guess not hasnt been too bad herei have to say that nobodys been stabbed nobodys been badly hurt any other way as often as not you lose a man or two on a trading run i know menedemos spat into the bosom of his tunic to turn aside the evil omen diokles did the same gods prevent it menedemos added heres hoping diokles agreed what are you going to do about damonaxs olive oil and the rest of the food now skipper to the crows with me if i know menedemos melodramatically threw his hands in the air i thought i had a bargain with that whipworthy rogue of an andronikos but the abandoned catamite wouldnt give me a decent price quartermasters are cheeseparers diokles said they always have been and i expect they always will be they dont care if they serve their soldiers slop if giving the men something better means costing them an extra obolos they wont do it they figure you can fight as well on stale moldy bread as on freshmaybe better because bad food makes you mean every word you say is true but theres more to it than that menedemos answered a lot of the time every obolos a quartermaster doesnt spend on his soldiers is an obolos he gets to keep for himself oh yes oh yes indeed the oarmaster dipped his head still though if i were in antigonos army id be careful about playing games like that if old oneeye caught me at em id end up on a cross like that he snapped his fingers may antigonos catch andronikos then may he menedemos broke off someone was coming up the pier toward the aphrodite a hellene surely for no phoenician would have worn a tunic that bared his arms to the shoulders and his legs to above the knee menedemos raised his voice hail friend do something for you youre the fellow who brought that good olive oil to the barracks the other day arent you the newcomer said before the rhodian could answer the man dipped his head and answered his own question yes of course you are thats right menedemos didnt bother hiding his bitterness your polluted quartermaster doesnt want anything to do with it though andronikos can take it up the arse like a slave in a boy brothel for all of me the hellene replied i know what he gives us and i was one of the people who tasted what youve got he may not want to buy any but i do how much do you want for a jar thirtyfive drakhmai menedemos answered as he had at the beginning of the failed dicker with andronikos he waited to see what counteroffer the hellene would make hippokles thats what his name is menedemos remembered hed liked the oil a lot when he tried it and now he didnt make any counteroffer he just dipped his head and said ill take two amphorai then thatd be thirtyfive sigloi near enough right right menedemos said doing his best to hide his surprise good hippokles turned on his heel dont go anywhere ill be back ive got to get the money and a couple of slaves to haul the jars away he went well well menedemos said thats better than nothing he laughed of course i wouldve sold andronikos a lot more than two jars less than an hour later hippokles returned with two scrawny men in tow he gave menedemos a jingling handful of sidonian coins here you are pal now ill put these lazy wretches to work menedemos counted the sigloi hippokles hadnt tried to cheat him some of the coins bore inscriptions in the angular aramaic script the letters meant nothing to menedemos that hippokles had plenty of silver did would you like to buy some smoked eels from phaselis too he asked two sigloi each that was four times what sostratos had paid for them in the lykian town and hippokles after tasting a tiny sample dipped his head and bought three he took care of them himself the slaves grunting picked up the jars of oil and carried them back down the quay after him into sidon not bad diokles said no i got premium prices there no doubt about it menedemos ducked under the poop deck and stowed his fat handful of silver in an oiledleather sack hed just made about a days wages for the crew of the merchant galley of course not all of it was profit the olive oil and eels hadnt come on board for nothing even so it was the best hed done since putting in at sidon and hippokles turned out not to be the only soldier who after trying damonaxs olive oil wanted some for himself the mercenary hadnt been gone long before another officer came up the pier to the aphrodite this fellow didnt need to go back and fetch a slave to take away his purchase hed brought a man along like hippokles he had only sidonian coins on him ive been here three years ever since we took this place back from ptolemaios he told menedemos whatever drakhmai i had once upon a time are long since spent dont you worry best one menedemos said smoothly ill figure out how many sigloi make thirtyfive drakhmai never fear sostratos would have done it in his head menedemos had to flick beads on a counting board with the board he got the answer about as quickly as his cousin would have seventeen and a half sounds about right the other hellene counted out sigloi one by one and gave them to menedemos sixteen seventeen he handed the rhodian a smaller coin and heres the halfsiglos to make it square thanks very much menedemos said ive got hams from patara too if youd be interested in one of those let me try a bit the officer said menedemos did the officer grinned oh by the gods yesthat pig died happy he made menedemos happy too with the price he paid turning to his slave the fellow added come on syros sling that ham over your shouldermay i scrounge a bit of rope from you rhodiangrab that amphora and get moving yes boss the slave replied in halting aramaicaccented greek sweat poured from him as he followed his master off the ship he was shorter and much skinnier than the hellene but it would have gone against his masters dignity to stoop to manual labor himself when he had a slave to do it for him menedemos and diokles watched the two men go how about that the oarmaster said if one soldier had come here idve said it was a nice happenstance and forgotten about it the next day but if two do it of a morning yes menedemos dipped his head he looked down at his new handful of silver i wonder how many more well get something else occurred to him and i wonder if the other oil andronikos had in that room was some of the best he serves out not the everyday stuff wouldnt surprise me even if it was it wasnt good enough hes the only one who knows for sure diokles answered one thing though at least now we know the olive oil weve got really is as good as weve been saying yes the same thing occurred to me menedemos sighed all the trouble weve had getting rid of it i was worrying about that myself harder to make sure you get top quality from inlaws but youd better otherwise whos going to trust you when you come back to a place in a year or two diokles laughed it might not matter here skipper if we come back to this place in a couple of years were liable to find ptolemaios garrison here not antigonos well i cant tell you youre wrong and i wont even try menedemos answered or of course we might find that ptolemaios men had been here and antigonos had run them out again that too the oarmaster agreed its like the pankration with those twotheyll keep pounding away till one of them cant pound any more and with lysimakhos and with kassandros menedemos added and if one of them does go down somebody else will probably rise up to take his placethat seleukos maybe out in the east somebody i dont think anyone can fill alexander s shoes but nobodys willing to leave them empty either the marshals dont care what they step on while theyre fighting diokles said theyll step on rhodes if they get the chance dont i know it menedemos said we really are a free and autonomous polis and even ptolemaios whos the best friend weve got among the macedonians even he thinks its funny we want to stay that way hell humor uswere the middlemen for his grain trade after all but he thinks its funny i saw that in kos last year instead of taking the political talk further diokles pointed down to the base of the quay furies take me if those dont look like more soldiers looking around for the aphrodite youre right menedemos murmured maybe that session at the barracks is going to pay off pretty well after all even if that abandoned rascal of an andronikos didnt do any buying himself up the pier came the hellenes they remained tentative till menedemos waved and called to them then they sped up one of them said youre the trader with the good oil thats me sure enough menedemos looked from one man to the next how do you know about it ive got a good memory for faces and i dont think any of you were at the quartermasters taste test no but we heard about it and we know what he feeds us replied the soldier whod spoken before he made a face to show what he thought of it we figured wed club together buy an amphora of the good stuff and share it amongst us isnt that right boys the other mercenaries dipped their heads to show it was fine with me menedemos said then he told them what a jar cost papai their spokesman said as the others flinched in dismay cant you give us a break on that its pretty steep for ordinary mortals ive already sold three jars for that price this morning menedemos answered if i sell it to you for less your pals will come by and say oh you gave it to good old whatshisname for twenty drakhmai so let us have it for twenty too there goes my profityou see what i mean he spread his hands to show he was sorry but he held firm the soldiers put their heads together menedemos ostentatiously didnt listen to their lowvoiced argument at last they separated again the fellow who did the talking for them said all right thirtyfive drakhmai it is this is supposed to be good stuff so well pay for it this once and i do thank you very much most noble ones menedemos said come aboard then and choose the amphora you want they were as near identical as one ear of barley to another but hed seen before that givingor rather seeming to givecustomers such choices made them happier as they picked their jar he added would you like to buy some ham or some smoked eels antigonos men put their heads together again and then spent some more money on eels menedemos ended up happy when they paid him too some of the coins they used were sidonian sigloi which he accepted as equaling two rhodian drakhmai but others were drakhmai and didrakhms and tetradrakhms from all over hellas athenian owls and turtles from aigina were considerably heavier than rhodian coins to the soldiers one drakhma was as good as another menedemos knew better and also knew better than to say anything about the extra profit he was making before long another party of soldiers came up the pier toward the aphrodite you may end up thanking that quartermaster for turning you down not cursing him diokles remarked menedemos thought about how very many amphorai of olive oil remained aboard the akatos but then he thought about how large antigonos garrison in sidon was if damonaxs oil became a fad by the dog of egypt he said slowly so i may as sostratos traveled father into ioudaia he began to see why hellenes knew so little about the land and its folk the people stuck together clinging to their own kind and having as little to do with outsiders as they could and the land worked with them it was broken and hilly and hot and poor as far as he could see the ioudaioi were welcome to it who in his right mind would want to take it away from them he knew he couldnt have been so very many stadia from the inner sea there it lay off to the west the broad highway that could swiftly waft him back to rhodes but the ioudaioi turned their backs on it they had their flocks of sheep and cattle their olive trees and their vineyards and they seemed content with thoseand with their strange god whose face no one ever saw in every village and town through which he passed sostratos had looked for a temple to this mysterious god he never found one at last hed asked a ioudaian whod proved friendly enough over a couple of cups of wine in a tavern the fellow had shaken his head and looked amused at the question amused and pitying as if sostratos couldnt be expected to know any better our god has only one temple where the priests offer prayer and sacrifice hed said that is in jerusalem our great city everywhere in ioudaia people spoke of jerusalem as hellenes spoke of athens or alexandria every other town they said was as nothing beside it and they spoke of their temple as athenians might have spoken of the parthenonas the most perfect and beautiful building in the world they were only barbarians and provincial barbarians at that so sostratos did discount a fair amount of what he heard even so he wasnt prepared for his first sight of jerusalem which he got from a rocky ridge a couple of hours travel north and west of the city he pointed ahead thats it he said that has to be it but is that all there is thats what all the ioudaioi weve met were swooning over doesnt look like so very much does it aristeidas said now that you mention it no sostratos answered the allegedly great city of the ioudaioi straggled along a rise between a sizable valley to the east and a smaller narrower ravine to the west it might have been half a dozen stadia long it was nowhere near half a dozen stadia wide some more homessuburbs though they hardly deserved the namedotted the rise west of the narrow ravine smoke hung above everything the unfailing mark of human habitation giving the place the benefit of the doubt sostratos said there are poleis that are smaller i cant think of any thatre uglier teleutas said sostratos didnt find that quite fair the walls around jerusalem and the bigger buildings he could see were built from the local stone which had a golden color his eye found pleasing he couldnt make out any details not at this range and doubted even lynxeyed aristeidas would be able to one of those big buildings will probably be the temple the ioudaioi talk about i dont see anything that looks like a proper temple with columns and all aristeidas said leaning forward to peer at the distant city on the hill theyre barbarians and peculiar barbarians at that moskhion said who knows if their temples look the way temples are supposed to and they worship this silly god nobody can see teleutas added slyly maybe theyve got a temple nobody can see too it could be sostratos said the kelts worship their gods in groves of trees ive heard he looked around i admit there are bound to be more trees in the land of the kelts than there are here after a little more thought he went on i take it back i do think one of those buildings is the temple for the ioudaioi wouldnt have talked about the place the way they have if it were only a sacred groveor for that matter if it werent there at all he stopped pleased by his logic but when he looked from one of his escorts to another to find out if it had impressed them too he caught teleutas muttering to aristeidas by the dog i cant even make a joke without getting a lecture back sostratos ears burned well you wanted to find out what they thought he told himself now you know he hadnt intended to lecture hed just been making a point or so hed thought anyhow he sighed ihave to watch that i really do need to be careful if im not ill end up boring people thats the last thing a merchant can afford to do because he broke off he did some muttering of his own some fairly pungent muttering hed started lecturing himself about not lecturing lets go he said aloud that was brief enough and enough to the point that not even teleutas could try to improve it the road to jerusalem meandered through olive trees and fields that would have been richer had they not gone uphill at such a steep slope the closer the hellenes got to the city the more impressive its fortifications looked the walls cunningly took advantage of the ground the northern part of the place had especially strong works even teleutas said i wouldnt want to try storming this place no indeed aristeidas dipped his head youd have to try to starve it out otherwise you could throw away an army in nothing flat on approaching the western gate sostratos found some of the guards to be hellenes and otherswho carried spears and shields and wore helmets but had no body armorswarthy hooknosed ioudaioi one of the hellenes stared at the short chitons sostratos and the sailors from the aphrodite had on he nudged his comrades they all pointed toward the newcomers the man whod first noticed them called out hellemzete malista sostratos dipped his head of course we speak greek poseidon s prick man what are you castaways doing in this godsforsaken place the gate guard asked him we have to be here to keep moneybags in egypt from taking this town away from antigonos again but why would anybody in his right mind come here if he didnt need to were here to trade sostratos said were bound for engedi to buy balsam there but well do business along the way too not much business to do in these parts another guard said which did nothing to gladden sostratos heart but then he went on what there is of it though youll do in jerusalem well thats good to hear sostratos said he gave the ioudaioi at the gate a polite nod aping barbarous manners as best he could and switched to aramaic peace be unto you my masters the ioudaioi exclaimed in surprise so did the hellenes listen to him make barbar noises one of them said he can talk with these polluted ioudaian maniacs he doesnt have to point and do dumb show and hope you can find one of them whos picked up a few words of greek whered you learn this language pal another hellene asked from a phoenician merchant on rhodes sostratos answered i dont speak all that much of it better than i can do and ive been out here a couple of years the guard told him i can ask for a womanthey dont like you to ask for a boy on account of they say their god doesnt go in for thatand for wine and bread and i can say hold still hands up and thats about it in aramaic sostratos asked the ioudaioi if they spoke greek they all shook their heads by the way a couple of them had looked back and forth when he and the guard were talking he suspected they understood more than they let on why do they share this duty with you he asked the hellenes because they shared it with the persians one of them answered thats the deal weve got herewhatever the ioudaioi had under the persians theyve still got under us they say alexander went through here and set that up himself bunch of drivel another hellene said like alexander would come to the middle of nowhere while he was on his way to egypt fat chance but we smile and play along it saves trouble you know what i mean as long as we dont mess with their god everythings fine you know about that you can get into a lot of trouble awful quick if youre not careful to be nice to their god oh yes sostratos said i do know about that my men and i did well enough coming down here from sidon anyhow all right then the guard said he and his friends stood aside welcome to jerusalem such as it is sostratos thought but he kept that thought to himself not knowing whether the ioudaioi with the hellenes had picked up any greek he was perfectly willing to insult ioudaia in general and jerusalem in particular but he didnt care to do it where the locals might understand that was bad business what he did say was thank you after a moment he added where is the market square in the city and can you recommend an inn not too far from it its not far from the temple in the north end of town the guard answered you know about the temple some sostratos dipped his head we were trying to spot it as we came up to the town id like to and to have a look around the place when i get the chance you can do that the guard whod spoken tossed his head i take it backyou can do some of that but only the outer parts are open to people who arent ioudaioi whatever you do dont try going where youre not supposed to for one thing the barbarians are liable to murder you for another if they dont were liable to poking your nose in where it doesnt belong is bound to start a riot and the ioudaioi get excited enough as things are all right sostratos hid his disappointment hed looked forward to poking his nose in wherever he could what about the inn he asked again ask these fellows the hellene pointed to the ioudaian guards you can make the funny noises they do and they know this miserable place better than we do good idea sostratos switched to aramaic my masters can you tell me where to find an inn near the market square that almost touched off a riot by itself every ioudaian seemed to have a cousin or a brotherinlaw who ran an inn each of them praised his relatives establishment and scorned all the others their snarling gutturals got louder every minute they began to shake fists and brandish weapons then one of them said my brotherinlaw already has an ionian staying at his inn what is your brotherinlaws name how can i find his inn sostratos asked the chance to speak his own language with someone else at the inn struck him as too good to pass up he is ithran son of akhbor the guard replied his inn is on the street of weavers near the street of coppersmiths i thank you sostratos said and gave him an obolos one of the hellenes said you paid him too much around here the governors coin these little tiny silver bits so small it takes ten or twelve of em to make a drakhma they dont even bother counting em most of the timethey just weigh em one of those would have been about right with a shrug sostratos said im not going to worry about an obolos he had some of those tiny silver coins but hadnt known whether giving the ioudaian guard so small a gift would have been reckoned an insult he waved to the sailors come on he told them and booted his mule into motion they passed into jerusalem in one way the place seemed more like a polis than sidon had unlike the phoenicians the ioudaioi didnt build so high as to seem to scrape the sky their homes and shops and other buildings had only one or two stories like those of the hellenes in another way though jerusalem was startlingly different from any hellenic city sostratos didnt notice that himself aristeidas did after the rhodians had got about halfway to ithrans innor so sostratos thought anyhowthe sharpeyed sailor said where are all the statues by the dog sostratos exclaimed in surprise youre right aristeidas i havent seen a onenot a herm not a carved face anywhere even the meanest poorest polis would have had hermscarved pillars with hermes face and genitalsin front of houses for luck it would have had images of the gods too and of figures from myth and legend and these days perhaps of prominent citizens as well sidon had been similar the statues had been of a different style and had commemorated different gods and different legends but theyd been there in ioudaia though slowly sostratos said i dont think weve seen a single statue since we came into this country do any of you boys remember one after some thought the three sailors tossed their heads moskhion said i wonder why that is pretty strange you ask me of course everything in this polluted land is pretty strange you ask me he used such comments to keep his curiosity from getting loose sostratos wanted his to run free when a plump prosperouslooking ioudaian came up the street toward him he spoke in aramaic excuse me my master but may your humble slave ask a question without causing offense you are a foreigner your being here causes offense i do not wish to speak with you the ioudaian answered and pushed on past him well to the crows with you friend sostratos muttered he and the sailors pressed on toward the inn a couple of blocks later he asked another man if he could ask this fellow also looked at him as if he was less than welcome in jerusalem but said ask if i do not like the question i will not answer it well enough my master sostratos said when he tried to ask what he wanted to know he discovered he had no idea how to say statue in aramaic he had to describe what he meant instead of simply naming it oh the ioudaian said after a little while you mean a graven image thank you sostratos told him why no graven images here in jerusalem why none in ioudaia because our god commands us not to make themits as simple as that the ioudaian answered i might have known sostratos thought but that didnt tell him all he wanted to know and so he asked another question why does your god command you not to make graven images again my master i mean no offense our god made mankind in his own image the ioudaian said sostratos dipped his head then remembered to nod instead hellenes believed the same thing the ioudaian went on we are forbidden to make graven images of our god so how can we make them of ourselves when we are made in his image his logic was as pure as any a hellenic philosopher might have used his opening premise on the other hand struck sostratos as absurd even so the rhodian said my thanks the ioudaian nodded and went on his way sostratos scratched his head the fellow had shown him a flaw in logic he hadnt thought enough about if the premise from which it began was flawed everything springing from that premise would be worthless too its a good thing we hellenes dont use such foolish premises otherwise we might make mistakes when we reason and never even notice ourselves doing it he thought he rode on for another half a block feeling pleased with himself for noticing the holes in the barbarians logic then abruptly he was much less happy suppose some of the premises from which we reason are flawed how would we know our logic would be only as good as that loudaians he spent some little while chewing on that and found no answer that satisfied him he might have kept right on chewing on it too had teleutas not asked are we getting close to this miserable inn ive been walking for a long long timefeels like foreverand id like to get off my feet for a while ill ask sostratos said with a sigh he didnt like asking such practical questions of strangers even in greek historical or philosophical queries were a different matterthere his curiosity overcame everything else but something as mundane as directions he wished he could get away without them here though he obviously couldnt taking a deep breath he made himself beard another ioudaian i crave pardon my master but could you direct your servant to the inn of ithran son of akhbor the fellow pointed the flood of words that followed flowed too swiftly for sostratos to understand slow slow he exclaimed more pointing more quick guttural aramaic sostratos threw his hands in the air more than any of his own words the despairing gesture got through to the ioudaian on his third goround the man really did slow down enough so that sostratos could actually figure out most of what he was saying four blocks up two to the right and then one more up is that right sostratos asked yes of course what did you think i said the ioudaian asked i was not sure sostratos answered truthfully he gave the man one of the tiny silver coins the local governors issued the loudaian put it in his mouth as a hellene might have it was so small sostratos wondered if he would swallow it without noticing ithrans inn proved to be a large noisy ramshackle place when sostratos and the sailors from the aphrodite got there the innkeeper was patching a crack in a mudbrick wall with what looked and smelled like a mixture of clay and cow dung he wiped his hands on his robe but still had second thoughts about clasping hands with sostratos instead bowing he said how may i serve you my master a room for me a room for my men sostratos replied and stalls for the animals ithran bowed again it shall be just as you require of course he said he was a few years older than sostratos tall and lean handsome in a swarthy way with a scar on one cheek that vanished into his bushy black beard sostratos snapped his fingers remembering something is it not true sir that another ionian is here when the innkeeper nodded sostratos switched to greek and asked do you speak the tongue of the hellenes then speak little bit ithran answered in the same language was soldier for antigonos before wound he touched his face to show what he meant learn greek from soldiers had he not told that to sostratos his accent would have it was one of the strangest the rhodian had ever met half guttural aramaic half broad macedonian if he hadnt already heard foreigners mangle greek a lot of different ways he wouldnt have been able to make head or tail of it how much for the lodgings he asked when ithran told him he thought hed misheard the ioudaian had replied in aramaic sostratos went over to greek again but the answer didnt change he did his best not to show how astonished he was he haggled a little for forms sake but he would have been content to take the first price the innkeeper quoted in rhodes or sidon he would have paid three times as much once he and the sailors from the aphrodite got to their rooms he remarked on that he all but chortled with glee as a matter of fact but teleutas put things in perspective of course rooms are cheap here he said you go to sidon or rhodes those are places people really want to visit but who in his right mind would want to come to this miserable sheep turd of a town sostratos considered what hed seen walking through jerusalems narrow winding smelly streets he heaved a sigh i hadnt thought of it like that he admitted but to the crows with me if i can tell you youre wrong a macedonian trooper too far down on the social scale to care about whether he did his own work lugged an amphora of olive oil and a lykian ham off the aphrodite down the pier and back into sidon as soon as he was off the ship menedemos stopped paying much attention to him instead the rhodian merchant looked down at the gleaming silver that filled his hands a mixture of sidonian silver and coins from all over hellas by the dog i really am almost starting to think that pimp of an andronikos did us a favor when he wouldnt buy our whole shipment of oil he said garrison troops just keep coming in and taking it away a jar at a time and paying a lot more per jar than he would have diokles said sure enough menedemos agreed we wont have to unload all the oil to come back to rhodes with a decent profit he laughed i never would have said anything like that half a month agoyoud best believe i wouldnt he wouldnt have laughed half a month before either hed been sure he would end up stuck with every last amphora of damonaxs olive oil hed unloaded much more of it by now than hed ever thought he would after antigonos quartermaster turned him down a phoenician came up the quay toward the akatos the man wore gold hoops in his ears and a massy gold ring on one thumb he carried a goldheaded walking stick hail this ship is from the island he said in accented but fluent greek thats right best one menedemos answered what can i do for you today you sell olive oil fine olive oil the phoenician asked menedemos dipped his head yes i do ah if you dont mind my asking how did you know the phoenician smiled a thin smile you hellenes can do many marvelous things you have astonished the world you have overthrown the persians who ruled their great kingdom for generation upon generation you have cast down the mighty city of tyre a city any man would have thought could stand secure forever but i say this and i say true there is one thing you hellenes cannot do try as you will you cannot keep your mouths shut he was probably right as a matter of fact from everything menedemos had seen he was almost certainly right the rhodian found no point to arguing with him would you care to come aboard and sample the oil ah he paused with a bow the phoenician said your servant is called zimrida son of luli and you are menedemos son of philodemos is it not so he walked up the gangplank his stick tapping against the timber at each step yes i am menedemos menedemos answered wondering what else zimrida knew about him and his business by the way the phoenician spoke by the amused glint in his black black eyes he was liable to have a better notion of how much silver was aboard the aphrodite than menedemos did himself trying to hide his unease menedemos drew the stopper from an alreadyopen jar of oil poured out a little dipped a chunk of barley roll in it and offered the roll and oil to zimrida i thank you my master the phoenician murmured something in his own language then took a bite what was that menedemos asked a prayer we use over bread zimrida answered chewing in your tongue it would be blessed be you gods who made the universe who make bread come forth from the earth in my speech you understand it is a poem i see thanks what do you think of the oil i will not lie to you zimrida said an opening that immediately made menedemos suspicious it is good olive oil it is very good in fact as if to underscore that he dipped the barley roll again and took another bite but it is not worth the price you are getting for it no menedemos said coolly as long as i am getting that price and i ami would have to tell you you are wrong zimrida waved that aside you are getting that price for an amphora here for two amphorai there how much oil will you have left when you must leave sidon more than a little is that not so then ill sell the rest somewhere else menedemos answered again trying to sound unworried sure enough zimrida was liable to know the last obolos lurking half forgotten between a sailors cheek and gum will you the phoenician said perhaps but perhaps not too such things are in the hands of the gods you will surely know that why should i sell to you for less than what im getting menedemos demanded once more for the sake of getting rid of all your cargo zimrida answered you would have sold it to andronikos for a good deal less than the seventeen and a half shekels you are getting excuse me i should say sigloi in greek eh you would have sold it to andronikos for less i tell you again and so if i buy a lot of what you have you should also sell to me for less it only stands to reason but i couldnt make a bargain with andronikos menedemos reminded him i know this hellene zimrida said i know you hellenes say we phoenicians are grasping and moneygrubbing and care for nothing in all the world except silver i tell you rhodian this quartermaster of antigonos is the meanest man i have met in all my days phoenician or helleneor persian come to that if he could save his fathers life with a drakhmas worth of medicine he would try to haggle the price down to three oboloiand woe betide the old man if he failed menedemos let out a startled bark of laughter that summed up andronikos pretty well all right how do i know youll do any better for me though he asked you might try finding out the phoenician said tartly instead of saying oh no ill never sell to you because im making too much money the way things are all right menedemos dipped his head all right by the gods if you buy in bulk how much the amphora will you give me fourteen sigloi zimrida said twenty eight drakhmai the jar menedemos made the translation into money more familiar to him zimrida nodded menedemos also translated that into its hellenic equivalent he said is that enough profit to satisfy you buying at twentyeight and selling at thirtyfive when you know you may not sell all of what you buy the phoenicians eyes were dark and distant and utterly opaque my master if i did not think so i would not make the offer is it not so i do not ask what you will do with my silver once you take it do not ask me what i will do with the oil i wont sell it all to you at that price menedemos said ill hold back fifty jars because i think i may move that many at my price the rest though twentyeight drakhmai is a fair price and i cant deny it ill be rid of damonaxs miserable oil by the gods i really will he thought trying to hide his growing delight and iii have plenty of silver to buy things that are cheap here but expensive back in rhodes have we a bargain then zimrida asked yes we have one menedemos thrust out his right hand zimrida clasped it his grip was hard and firm twentyeight drakhmai or fourteen sigloi the amphora menedemos said while they held each other leaving no room for misunderstanding twentyeight drakhmai or fourteen sigloi the phoenician agreed you say you will keep fifty jars i do not object to that and you will already have sold close to a hundred jars sure enough he knew menedemos affairs very well indeed the rhodian didnt even try to deny itwhat point zimrida went on then you will sell me two hundred fifty jars more or less about that yes do you want the exact count now o best one or will tomorrow do menedemos asked he suspected zimrida would have an exact count by tomorrow whether he gave it to the phoenician or not tomorrow will do well enough zimrida said i am glad we have made this bargain rhodian we will both profit from it you will be here at sunrise not long after anyhow menedemos answered ive taken a room at an inn he mimed scratching at bedbug bites zimrida smiled yes i know the place where you are staying he said which again surprised menedemos not at all tell me is emashtart trying to lure you into her bed hearing that menedemos began to wonder if there were anything at all about sidon that zimrida didnt know well yes as a matter of fact he answered who on earth would have told you that no one i did not know not for certain zimrida told him but i am not surprised you are not the first and i do not suppose you will be the last he started up the gangplank tapping with his stick at each step why doesnt her husband keep her happy menedemos asked then she wouldnt have to play the whore am i saying that he wondered how many wives have i lured away from their husbands beds he didnt know not exactly maybe sostratos could have given him a precise number he wouldnt have been surprised to learn his cousin had been keeping a tally but the difference here was simplicity itself he didnt want the innkeepers wife he couldnt remember the last time hed been pursued by a woman who interested him less why zimrida echoed you have seen her is it not so having seen her you can answer the question for yourself and i will tell you one thing more my master two doors down from the inn lives a potter with a friendly pretty young wife she is even friendlier than he thinks is she menedemos said zimrida son of luli nodded menedemos opinion was that she would have to be friendly to the point of madness to find sedekyathon attractive but women had peculiar taste good day zimrida told him i will be here tomorrow with the silver and with slaves and donkeys to take away the olive oil down the pier he went not bad skipper diokles said when the sidonian was out of earshot not bad at all tell you the truth no menedemos agreed this is better than i hoped for we really are rid of damonaxs oil i feel so glad to be out from under it tooas if sisyphos didnt have to roll his stone up the hill anymore i believe that the oarmaster said now the only worry is will he really pay us what he said he would did you see all the gold he was wearing menedemos said he can afford it im sure of that and he wasnt putting on the dog to try to impress us the way a cheat would his robe was fine wool and it was well worn too he hadnt just borrowed it to make himself look richer than he was oh no thats not what i meant youre rightim sure he can afford to pay but will he try to stiff us some kind of way you never can tell with barbarians or with hellenes either come to that i only wish i could say you were wrong menedemos told him well well find out diokles pointed toward the base of the pier now whos this fellow coming our way and whats he going to want besides our money i mean hes selling somethingsomething to eat i bet look at that big flat basket hes carrying you see hucksters with that kind of basket all the time back in hellas menedemos said there theyd have fried fish on it or songbirds or most likely fruit what do you want to bet hes got raisins or plums or figs or something like that they had to wait a little while to find out the peddler stopped at every ship tied up along the quay he called out the name of whatever he was selling in aramaic which did menedemos no good at all seeing hellenes aboard the akatos though the fellow switched to greek dates fresh dates dates menedemos echoed and the phoenician nodded fresh dates the peddler nodded again and invitingly held out the basket well well diokles said isnt that interesting it certainly is menedemos said sostratos would be fascinated i wonder if hes seen any a few date palms grew in rhodes menedemos had seen them on the islands of the kyklades too and had heard they were also found on crete but no date palm anywhere in hellas gave forth fruit the climate wasnt warm enough to let the trees come to full maturity all the dates that reached the land of the hellenes from phoenicia and egypt were sundried like raisins or often figs you want the peddler asked yes i want menedemos answered to diokles he went on we wouldnt be able to take em back to rhodes they wont keep for us any more than they do for anybody else but theyre still something to talk about sounds good to me skipper the keleustes answered im always game for something new an obolos bought a handful for each of them menedemos exclaimed in delight at the sweet taste of his hed had dried dates often enough they cost more than figs but that didnt always stop sikon from keeping them in the house menedemos tossed his head it hadnt always stopped sikon from keeping them in the house with baukis quarreling over every obolosno every khalkoswho could say whether the cook still dared buy them menedemos sighed hed mostly been too busy to think about his fathers second wife since sailing out of rhodes that was one of the reasons and not the least he was so glad when winter ended and good weather returned brooding about baukis could only lead to misery and to trouble to try to get her out of his mind he asked the huckster do you also sell dried dates the phoenician didnt speak a lot of greek menedemos had to repeat himself and point to the sun before the fellow got the idea when he did he nodded again sell sometimes he answered his expression was scornful though dried dates for servants for slaves fresh dates proper food good food did he say what i think he did diokles asked after the huckster went on to the next pier back in hellas we eat for a treat whats slave food here i like our kind of dates but for honey you cant find anything much sweeter dont know that ill want em any more though cant be helped menedemos said like i said fresh dates wont keep on a voyage back to hellas any more than fresh grapes would well maybe not the oarmaster said but it still galls me that the phoenicians send us their leavings and keep the best for themselves there was that miserable fellow with his cheap basket and hes selling something nobody in hellas can have it doesnt seem right maybe it doesnt but i dont know what to do about it either menedemos answered fresh is fresh in figs as in pretty boys and it wont keep in either one boys sprout hair and figs sprout mold and theres nothing anybody can do to it there ought to be diokles insisted menedemos laughed this was almost the sort of argument he and sostratos would have all the time the difference was sostratos knew enough in the way of logic to keep the discussion moving in one direction diokles didnt and neither did menedemos himself when hashing things out with his cousin it hadnt mattered now it did and he felt the lack he wondered how sostratos was doing among barbarians who not only didnt have much in the way of logic but whod probably never even heard of it poor wretch menedemos muttered if anything could be calculated to drive sostratos mad it was people who couldnt think straight sostratos sat in ithrans inn snacking on fresh dates and on chickpeas fried in cuminflavored oil and drinking wine the wine wasnt particularly good but it was strong like the phoenicians the ioudaioi drank it unmixed this was only his second cup but his head had already started to spin aristeidas and moskhion had taken some of their pay and gone to visit a brothel teleutas would take his turn when one of them got back the sailors from the aphrodite seemed to have decided menedemos would kill them if they left sostratos alone for even a minute hed tried to convince them that that was nonsense theyd paid no attention to his elegant logic ithrans wife was a handsome woman named zilpah she came up to sostratos and teleutas with a pitcher more wine my masters sheasked in aramaic she spoke no greek yes please sostratos replied in the same language when she poured his cup full teleutas also held out his and got it filled again the idea of drinking neat wine all the time didnt bother himon the contrary his eyes followed zilpah as she walked away what a slut she is to come and talk with us without even trying to cover her face sostratos tossed his head thats our custom not theirs she has no reason to follow it she seems a good enough woman to me better than good enough teleutas said shed be a piece and a half in bed i bet ithrans a lucky dog id sooner lay her than some bored whore who might as well be dead drag your mind out of the chamber pot if youd be so kind sostratos said have you seen her paying attention to anyone but her husband youll get us thrown outor worseif you treat her like a loose woman when she plainly isnt i havent done anything with her i havent done anything to her i dont intend to teleutas said but hed had enough wine to speak his mind im not the only one who keeps watching her all the time though and theres nobody can say i am he sent sostratos a significant glance me are you talking about me go howl you whipworthy rogue sostratos exclaimed so sharply that zilpah who usually paid no attention to talk in greek looked back in surprise to see what the matter was sostratos gave her a sickly smile she frowned back but when neither he nor teleutas pulled out a knife or started swinging a stool like a flail she relaxed and went back to what shed been doing ha teleutas sounded disgustingly sly i knew i put that arrow right in the middle of the target if you were your cousin now youd already know what shes like under those robes if she shows you her face shell show you the rest too easy as you please will you shut up instead of shouting as he wanted to do sostratos kept his voice to a furious whisper so as not to draw zilpahs notice again and i keep telling you going around unveiled doesnt mean the same thing here as it would back in hellas besides what would get me murdered faster than trying to seduce the innkeepers wife menedemos wouldnt worry about any of that teleutas said all he cares about is getting it in he was no doubt right he spoke with nothing but admiration but what he saw as praiseworthy seemed blameworthy to sostratos then the sailor added you only get in trouble if she doesnt like it if she does youre happy as a billy goat that only shows how muchor how littleyou know sostratos said the women menedemos seduced didnt complain and didnt betray him to their husbands he commonly betrayed himself by taking insane chances to get what he wanted he was lucky to have come out of halikarnassos and taras in one piece i give up teleutas said but tell me youd throw her out of bed if you found her in there go ontell me i dare you its not going to happen so theres no point talking about it hypothetical questions have their uses but that isnt one of them as hed hoped the formidable word gave teleutas pause before the sailor could start up again aristeidas walked into the inn a satisfied smirk on his face teleutas gulped down what was left of his wine then hurried away aristeidas sat down on the stool hed vacated hail he said to sostratos hail sostratos answered when teleutas came back from the brothel he would give a thrustbythrust description of what hed done aristeidas didnt have that vice he was content to sit there and keep an eye on sostratos to encourage him to do that and nothing more sostratos sipped at his wine and half turned away that meant his gaze swung toward zilpah what would she be like in bed he wondered it wasnt the first time the question had crossed his mind hed got angry at teleutas not least for noticing if the sailor had seen his curiosity that seemed a safer word than desire had zilpah seen it too worse had ithran he must know he has a goodlooking goodnatured wife the rhodian thought because they dont shut their women away from the world as we do he must know other men will get to know her too he shouldnt mind my admiring her so long as i do it with my eyes and nothing more sostratos dipped his head yes that made good logical sense the only trouble was logic was often the first thing out the window in dealings between men and women if ithran caught him staring at zilpah the ioudaian might prove as jealous as any hellene would have been on catching a man eyeing his wife and then again sostratos found himself ever more tempted to find out just how interested in straying zilpah might be maybe that was just because hed gone without a woman for a long time maybe a trip to a brothel would cure him of it but maybe such a visit wouldnt either he was beginning to understand the attractions the game of adultery held for menedemos one willing woman might be worth several who lay down for a man because they had no choice his cousin had always insisted such things were true sostratos had always mocked him scorned him now he discovered menedemos had at least to some degree known what he was talking about few discoveries could have alarmed him more his eyes slid toward zilpah again angrily he made himself look away did she know what he was thinking if she did what did she think was it oh dear heres another traveler whos liable to make a fool of himself or was it he wants me do i want him too how do i find out sostratos wondered he scowled and made a fist sure enough he was liable to be walking down menedemos road no he muttered what do you mean no aristeidas asked nothing nothing at all sostratos said quickly and sipped his wine his ears heated how can i find out whether she wants me without putting my head on the block he liked that version of the question much better i wont take any chances to find out not the way menedemos does that made him feel better but only for a little while if he hadnt been trained to root out selfdelusion it probably would have satisfied him longer as things were though he had to wonder how do i know what i want a man who wants a woman isnt likely to think straight aristeidas said maybe you ought to go get laid you dont mind my saying so the girls at this place around the corner are pretty friendlyor they act like they are anyhow if he hadnt added that last little bit he might have persuaded sostratos as things were he only reminded him of the difference between what was paid for and what was freely given another time sostratos said theyre funny there you know aristeidas went on our women always singe off the hair between their legs or else shave it off the way you shave your face sostratos plucked at his beard i dont shave my face he pointed out no the way you would if you did the sailor said confusingly the whores here dont shave their bushes or singe them or anything they just let em grow it looks funny if you ask me yes i guess it would sostratos agreed some men he supposed might find the difference exciting others might find it disgusting aristeidas seemed close to feeling that way at first sostratos thought it wouldnt matter to him one way or the other then he imagined zilpah with a hairy delta at the joining of her legs the thought roused him more than hed expected it to but was that because he imagined hairy private parts or zilpahs private parts he wasnt sure zilpah said greetings my master she wasnt talking to sostratos but to another lodger whod just walked into the inn hail the newcomer replied in greek he paused for a moment inside the doorway letting his eyes adjust to the gloom within seeing sostratos and aristeidas he waved hail rhodians he said and headed over to their table hail hekataios sostratos answered always good to talk to a fellow hellene aristeidas didnt seem to share his opinion the sailor got to his feet ill see you later young sir he said im sure youll still be around whenever i come back he left before hekataios perched on a stool perched sostratos thought was the operative word hekataios of abderaa polis on the southern coast of thracewas a birdlike man small thin sharpfeatured quickmoving how are you he asked sostratos speaking ionic greek with a strong attic overlay sostratos doric accent had that same overlay so the two of them sounded more like each other than less educated less traveled men from their home cities would have well thanks sostratos answered zilpah came up what would you like my master she asked hekataios wine bread oil he replied in extremely rudimentary aramaic i would also like bread and oil please sostratos told the innkeepers wife as zilpah went off hekataios returned to greek im jealous of you you really speak the language i didnt think id need to when i started traveling through ioudaia but hellenes are so thin on the ground here ive had to start learning ow to go barbarbar myself every once in a while but only every once in a while he would forget a rough breathing as ionians usually did im not fluent sostratos said i wish i knew more id have an easier time with my researches if i could make those funny grunting noises but i do seem to manage even without them zilpah came back with the food and drink as sostratos dipped a chunk of brown bread in olive oil he said jealous speaking of jealous best one you have no idea how jealous i am of you i have to buy and sell as i go i cant travel about the countryside for the sake of love of wisdom he was also jealous of the wealth that let hekataios of abdera do exactly that but kept quiet about that bit of envy to him the other was more important hekataios shrugged when i was in alexandria i got interested in the ioudaioi theyre such a peculiar people he rolled his eyes and so i decided to come here and find out about them for myself youre lucky antigonos men didnt decide you were spying for ptolemaios sostratos said not at all my dear fellow hekataios tossed his head i had written out for me a safeconduct stating that i was a lover of wisdom traveling for the sake of learning more about the world in which i live and so was not to be harassed by mere soldiers and it worked when you got to the frontier sostratos asked plainly not plainly i was seized and tortured and crucified hekataios answered sostratos coughed and flushed he could be sarcastic himself but hed met his match and then some in hekataios of abdera the older man relented as a matter of fact antigonos officers ave been more than a little helpful from everything ive heard and seen antigonos himself is a man of learning i suppose so sostratos said i know ptolemaios is but i wouldnt want to have either one of them angry at me and thats the truth there i cannot argue with you in the least hekataios agreed then again however the weak are always wise not to fall into the clutches of the strong so it has been since the godsif gods there bemade the world and so it shall remain as long as men stay men its a good thing you said that in greek and that ithran wasnt here to understand it sostratos observed let a ioudaian hear if gods there be and youve got more trouble for yourself than you really want they take their own invisible deity very very seriously i should say they do hekataios dipped his head they always have as best ive been able to determine tell me more if youd be so kind sostratos said this sort of thing is meat and drink to me i wish i had the chance to do what youre doing wish i didnt have to worry about making a living was what that boiled down to hekataios family had to own land out to the horizon up in abdera or to have got wealthy some other way to let him spend his life traveling and learning he smiled what struck sostratos as a superior smile but that half sneer didnt last what could be more attractive than somebody who was interested in what one was doing as i was telling you the last time we talked hekataios said these ioudaioi came here from out of egypt yes you did say that i remember sostratos answered you were telling me some sort of pestilence there made them flee the country thats right hekataios smiled again this time without a trace of superiority you were paying attention werent you of course i was best one did you doubt it as a matter of fact yes when you discover how few people have the least interest in the past and how it came to shape the present you eventually begin to believe no one but yourself has any interest in such things at all being proved wrong is always a pleasant surprise youve found me sostratos said please do go on id be glad to hekataios paused to sip his wine and gather his thoughts then he said when this plague arose in egypt the common people there believed some divinity had caused it thats not surprising sostratos said they wouldnt have known of anyone like hippokrates who might have offered a different explanation no indeed not hekataios of abdera dipped his head now egypt at this timeit would have been about the time of the trojan war i believewas full of all sorts of foreigners and excuse me most wise one but how do you know that sostratos broke in for one thing the egyptian priests say so hekataios answered for another the ioudaioi have a legend that they themselves came ere to this country from out of egypt does that satisfy you thank you yes it does but history is only as good as its sources and the questions you ask of them i did want to know fair enough you do understand the finer points dont you hekataios said and sostratos wanted to burst with pride the abderan went on all these foreigners naturally worshiped their own gods and had their own rites the native egyptians rituals were being ignored and forgotten the egyptiansi suspect that means their priests but i cant prove itfeared their gods would never have mercy on them in respect to the plague unless they expelled the foreigners from their land and so they did sostratos asked and so they did hekataios agreed the most outstanding foreigners banded together and went to places like hellas danaos and kadmos were some of their leaders ive also heard kadmos was a phoenician sostratos said yes so have i perhaps he stopped in phoenicia on his way up to hellas from egypt but most of the exiles ended up here in ioudaia this isnt far from egypt and in those days no one at all lived here or so they say i see sostratos said but how did the customs of the ioudaioi become so strange i am coming to that o best one hekataios answered their leader at this time was a man outstanding for courage and wisdom a certain mouses he refused to make any images of the gods because he did not think his god was of human form the ioudaioi have kept that custom ever since sostratos said ive seen it one could hardly help seeing itor not seeing itin this country hekataios said a little superciliously that is the reason the sacrifices this mouses established differ from those of other nations so does their way of living because of their expulsion from egypt he introduced a way of life that was rather antisocial and hostile to foreigners i dont know if theyre truly hostile to foreigners or if they simply want to be left alone sostratos said they havent treated me at all badly they just dont want me trying to tell them about the way we hellenes live well if that doesnt make them hostile to foreigners all by itself i dont know what would hekataios said sostratos frowned he thought he saw a logical flaw in the other mans argument but for once he let it go hekataios of abdera had studied the ioudaioi more thoroughly than he hadhad studied them as he wished he might have in fact now that youve learned all these things i hope you write them down so other hellenes can have the benefit of your inquiries sostratos said i intend to when i get back to alexandria hekataios answered i want my name to live forever i understand sostratos said and sighed you have to write one day too he told himself or who will remember you once youre gone he sighed again wondering if he would ever find the time hail emashtart said when menedemos came out of his bedchamber to start another day how you the innkeepers wife went on in her fragmentary greek you to sleep good yes thank you i slept well enough menedemos answered around a yawn he scratched beyond any doubt the room had bugs he saw no point to complaining about it what room at an inn didnt oh a clean one happened now and again but you had to be lucky emashtart was kneading dough on a countertop she looked up from the work with a sly smile you not alonely to sleep all lone im fine thanks menedemos said shed taken this tack before her attempts at seduction would have been funny if they hadnt been so sad and so annoying this is sostratos revenge on me menedemos thought heres a woman i dont want and never would and what does she care about adultery nothing else but she wasnt subtle about it either you to sleep better you having woman with you woman make you all tired no im plenty tired by the end of the day believe me menedemos replied once upon a time i famous beauty men to fight for me all over sidon the innkeepers wife said menedemos almost asked her whether that had been during alexander s reign or that of his father philip of macedon alexander had been dead for fifteen years now philip for almost thirty had menedemos been only a few years younger a few years cruder himself he would have done it but emashtart probably wouldnt have understood him and if she had she would have been insulted shes enough trouble the way things are the rhodian thought and kept quiet when as usual he refused to rise to her bait she sent him a venomous look after pounding the dough harder than she really needed to she asked is true what they to say of hellenes i dont know menedemos answered innocently though he had a pretty good idea what would come next what do they say about hellenes emashtart glared at him again maybe shed hoped he would help but when he didnt she wasnt shy about speaking her mind they say hellenes sooner to put up boys arse than womans pussy do they menedemos exclaimed as if hed never heard of such a thing before well if we did that all the time there wouldnt be any more hellenes after a little while now would there he waited to find out whether she understood when he saw she did he gave her his sweetest most charming smile good day he said and strolled out of the inn behind him the innkeepers wife said several things in aramaic menedemos understood not a word of them but they sounded pungent he wondered what sostratos would have made of them after a moment he tossed his head not knowing might be better miserable old whore he muttered why doesnt her husband take charge of her a moments thought gave him a couple of possible answers maybe sedekyathon feared his wife or maybe he didnt want her either and didnt care what she did well he can go howl menedemos thought he hurried off toward the aphrodite these days he wished hed stayed aboard the merchant galley instead of taking a room in sidon it would have been less comfortable but would have offered him more peace of mind hail diokles called as menedemos came up the quay the oarmaster was staying aboard the aphrodite every so often hed make a sally into sidon after wine or a friendly woman other than that he seemed content to do without a roof over his head and a mattress under him indeed he kept up his usual habit of sleeping sitting up on a rowers bench and leaning against the planking of the ship for support thinking about that menedemos didnt mind the innkeepers wife so much hail yourself he said how are things here tolerable skipper tolerable diokles answered youre out and about earlier than usual arent you work doesnt wait menedemos said he didnt always take that attitude but he would have needed a much more enjoyable distraction than the innkeepers wife to make work wait he went on one of the hellenes from antigonos garrison gave me the name of a merchant here who deals in fine cloth im going to take some of our koan silk over to him see what itll bring in this part of the world sounds good to me skipper the keleustes said were a long ways from kos thats for sure so silk wont come here every day especially when its not going through fourteen middlemen you ought to get a good price i hope so menedemos hid a smile on a rhodian ship everybody could speak knowledgeably of trade does this sidonian fellow know any greek diokles askedanother relevant consideration with sostratos on his way to engedi that soldier said he did menedemos answered said he does a fair amount of business with hellenes so hes had to learn all right the oarmaster dipped his head good fortune go with you then thanks menedemos poked through the cargo wishing hed made sostratos leave him a more complete manifest after a little while though he found the oiledleather sacks that protected bolts of silk from seawater they werent heavy of course he slung three of them over his shoulder and set off for the cloth merchants house the hellene in macedonian service had given him what sounded like good directions the street opposite the entrance to the temple of ashtart aphrodite s phoenician counterpart third house on the left but menedemos took a wrong turn somewhere in a town built by hellenes he would have had an easy time spotting a temple for it would have stood out above the roofs of houses and shops but the sidonians built tall how am i supposed to find this polluted temple if they go and hide it he thought irritably he tried asking people on the streets but they started at him in blank incomprehension and gave back streams of gibberish not for the first time since coming here he wished hed spent part of the winter learning aramaic too at last he found a couple of antigonos soldiers lurching out of a wineshop they were drunk but they understood greek the temple of ashtart is it one of them said you want a go at the temple prostitutes most of em are ugly no not the prostitutes menedemos tossed his head thinking maybe another time im trying to find a house near the temple ugly girls the soldier repeated his pal told menedemos how to find the temple and even declined the tip the rhodian tried to give him that to a hellene was a minor miracle menedemos followed his directions and found they worked that wasnt a minor miracle but came close third house on the left street opposite the entrance menedemos muttered when he got to the temple the street seemed more of an alley narrow and cramped menedemos planted his bare feet with care when he knocked on the door to the third house on the left a dog inside began to bark it sounded like a big fierce dog after a minute somebody on the other side of the door said something in aramaic in greek menedemos answered is this the house of zakerbaal son of tenes the cloth merchant a pause inside the dog kept barking then very suddenly it stopped with a yelp as if someone had kicked it one word came through the door in heavily accented greek wait menedemos waited after what seemed to him much too long the door opened a short wideshouldered muscular man looked out at him i am zakerbaal who are you and what do you want he asked his greek was considerably better than his slaves im menedemos son of philodemos of rhodes menedemos began ah the fellow from the merchant galley zakerbaal nodded his heavy features brightened into a smile youre at sedekyathons inn these days arent you tell me has his wife tried pulling you into bed yet zeus menedemos muttered gaping at the cloth merchant a moment later he realized he would have done better to swear by wingfooted hermes messenger of the gods and god of rumor he pulled himself together enough to dip his head in agreement and say yes thats right best one erhow did you know merchants hear about merchants my master the phoenician answered i wondered if you might call on me or did you mean about the innkeepers wife she is no secret in sidon believe me but come in drink wine with me eat dates and raisins show me your wares what have you there silk from kos the finest fabric in the world menedemos said proudly i know of it i will gladly look at it zakerbaal said the reaction was polite interested but less than menedemos had hoped for was zakerbaal so formidable a bargainer or was it that never having seen silk he didnt know how splendid a cloth it was menedemos hoped for the latter he followed the phoenician into the courtyard of his house a courtyard rather bare by hellenic standards for it had no garden the dog growled and lunged at menedemos but a chain brought it up short zakerbaal spoke in his own guttural language servants brought stools and took the dog away they fetched a basin of water in which zakerbaal ceremoniously washed his hands menedemos followed his hosts lead refreshments followed the wine was quite good where does this come from menedemos asked byblos my master zakerbaal replied as was the phoenician way he served the wine neat that concentrated its bouquet which measured up against that of any menedemos had ever known even the finest khian and thasian vintages very good he repeated its flavor didnt quite match that marvelous flowery bouquet but it was more than worth drinking good enough in fact to make menedemos wonder whether he could get some and bring it back to rhodes with the wine zakerbaals slave brought out figs and dates and raisins and balls of dried chickpeas fried in olive oil and dusted with cumin menedemos found those very tasty but spicy enough to raise his thirst he drank more wine to put it down zakerbaal chatted affably about matters of little importance while his guest ate and drank presently the cloth merchant said perhaps you would be so good my master as to show me some of this famous koan silk you have your servant has heard of it and would be glad to learn its quality id be happy to most noble one menedemos answered his hands were steady as he undid the rawhide lashing that held one of his leather sacks closed his wits were steady too or he thought they were he hadnt been silly enough to pour down a lot of unmixed wine not with a dicker ahead of him he took out a bolt of the finest filmiest silk he had and held it up against the sun so zakerbaal could see how nearly transparent it was imagine a beautiful woman wearingor almost wearingrobes of this he told the phoenician zakerbaal smiled whatever he was imagining he liked it he reached for the silk but politely stopped before touching it may i feel of it he asked of course menedemos handed him the fine fine cloth theres nothing like it in all the world perhaps was all zakerbaal said his fingers traveled the fabric as delicately as knowingly as if exploring that imaginary womans body he held the silk up to his face so he could peer through it even breathe through it when he lowered it he nodded to menedemos this is good this is very good i must tell you though my master and i mean no offense i have seen better what where menedemos yelped there is no better fabric than koan silk hed heard plenty of ploys for lowering prices this had to be another one if youve got better o marvelous onea bit of sarcasm zakerbaal might or might not noticeplease show it to me he confidently expected the phoenician to say hed just sold it or that hed seen it year before last in another town or to give some other excuse for not producing it instead zakerbaal called out to the slave again rattling off a string of aramaic gutturals and hisses the slave bowed and hurried away zakerbaal turned back to menedemos be so kind as to wait but one moment my master tubalu will fetch it all right cautiously menedemos sipped more wine did zakerbaal really believe he had cloth finer than koan silk menedemos tossed his head the barbarian couldnt possibly or if he did he had to be wrong tubalu took considerably longer than the promised moment menedemos began to wonder if he would come back at all but he did carrying in his arms a goodsized bolt of cloth he bore it as tenderly as if it were a baby even so menedemos turned to zakerbaal in perplexity and annoyance i mean no disrespect best one but that is only linen and not the finest linen either the phoenician nodded yes that is only linen but it is also only a cover for what lies within just as your leather sacks cover your koan silk and keep it safe he took the bolt of linen from tubalu as carefully as the slave had carried it unfolding it he drew from it the fabric it concealed and held that out to menedemos here behold with your own eyes with your own fingers ohhh menedemos soft exclamation was altogether involuntary for the first time he understood exactly how sostratos had felt the moment he set eyes on the gryphons skull here too something completely unexpected and at the same time completely marvelous came before a hellene for the first time menedemos hadnt cared so much about the gryphons skull one had to love wisdom for its own sake more than he did to get excited about ancient bones no matter how unusual they were this this was different hed shown zakerbaal the finest koan silk he had next to the fabric the phoenician merchant showed him that cloth might almost have been coarse wool by comparison here it was as if someone at a loom had managed to weave strands of air into cloth the delicate blue of the dye only made the resemblance stronger for it put him in mind of the color of the sky on a perfect spring day then ever so gently menedemos touched the cloth ohhh he said again even more softly than before under his hand the fabric was as soft as smooth as the fanciest courtesans skin to a lovers fingers zakerbaal didnt even gloat he only nodded again as if hed expected nothing else you see my friend he said i see menedemos didnt want to stop stroking the silk he supposed it had to be silk though it was far finer far smoother far more transparent than anything the koan weavers made he forced himself to stop staring at it and looked up to zakerbaal i see o marvelous one for once he meant that literallyi see yes but i dont understand i know clothwell i thought i knew clothbut i never dreamt there could be anything like this where does it come from i know cloth toowell i thought i knew cloth the phoenician answered he eyed the blue silk with as much wonder as menedemos showed and hed seen it before your koan fabric comes here now and again when i first sawthati thought it more of the same then i got a better look and i knew i had to have it he might have been a rich hellene speaking of a beautiful hetaira and menedemos could only dip his head in agreement where does it come from he asked again the koans would kill to be able to make cloth like this they never imagined anything so fine and neither did i as a trader he should have stayed blas–π uninterested he knew that here in the presence of what might as well have been a miracle he couldnt make himself do it zakerbaals slow smile said he understood it even said he might not take advantage which surely proved how miraculous that silk was it comes from out of the east he said where menedemos asked for the third time the east you say india no not india the cloth merchant shook his head somewhere beyond indiamaybe farther east maybe farther north maybe both the man from whom i bought it could tell me no more than that he did not know himself he had not brought it all the way you understandhe had bought it from another trader who had got it from another with who knows how many more since it left the land where it was made menedemos stroked the astonishing silk once more as his fingers slid across its amazing smoothness the gryphons skull came to mind again it too had entered the world hellenes knew from out of the trackless east alexander had conquered so much peopleespecially people who still dwelt by the inner seaoften thought hed taken all there was to take things like this were a reminder that the world was larger and stranger than even alexander had imagined like a man slowly emerging from a trance menedemos looked up from the silk to zakerbaal how much of this do you have the rhodian asked what price do you want zakerbaal sighed as if he too didnt much care to return to the mundane world of commerce i have twelve bolts in all each much like this in size some in different colors he answered i would have bought more but that was all the trader had price he smiled a sad smile i would say it is worth its weight in gold and now i have made you want to flee i doubt not no best one menedemos tossed his head if id heard about this without seeing it i would have laughed in your face now now i understand why you say what you say he did laugh then telling you something like that makes me a terrible trader one who deserves to be overcharged but here for this i cant help it its the truth you respect the cloth zakerbaal said seriously i respect you because of it with stuffs like this we throw out the ordinary rules he mimed tossing the contents of a chamber pot out the window and into the street below worth its weight in gold you say menedemos asked and the phoenician nodded menedemos didnt even try to argue with him considering how far the silk had come considering how fine it was that seemed fair but he didnt want to give up gold or silver for the silk not directly what would you say if i offered you half again its weight in my koan silk here i would say that is not enough zakerbaal replied at once koan silk is all very well i mean no insult rhodian but i say this is far better i say it is so much better if ever it comes here often and in large quantities the koans will go out of business for they cannot compete with it half an hour before menedemos would have laughed at him with the silk from the distant east in his lap under his fingers he suspected zakerbaal might be right even so he said all right koan silk is not so splendid how can i deny it but koan silk is still very fine cloth koan silk is still no common thing itself in phoenicia soone and a half times the weight is not enough you say what would be enough the phoenician looked up toward the sky his lips moved silently sostratos got the same faraway expression when he was calculating at last zakerbaal said three and a half times no thats too much menedemos tossed his head once more zakerbaal had indeed dealt with a good many hellenes for he showed he understood the gesture by a small nod of his own menedemos for his part knew that nod wasnt one of agreement only of acknowledgment he went on here in sidon youll be able to get just about as much for koan silk as you will for this cloth from out of the east because theyre both foreign and exotic in phoenicia there is perhaps some truth in what you say best one but only some the cloth merchant replied what i have is better than what you are trying to trade for it though and im offering you more koan silk than the eastern silk id get in return menedemos said in hellas koan silk wasnt exotic but it was expensive just how much he might get for twelve bolts of these new stuffs he didnt know just how much but he was ever so eager to find out three and a half times by weight leaves me no profit he doubted even that but zakerbaal didnt need to know his doubts three times then the phoenician said bolt for bolt koan silk is heavier than the fabric i have because yours is so much coarser and thicker they haggled for the next hour each calling the other a liar and a thief menedemos sometimes enjoyed taking on a skilled opponent even if that meant ending up with a little less than he would have otherwise by zakerbaals small smile he felt the same the closer they came to a bargain the harder they dickered over tiny fractions at last they settled on koan silk for two and seventeen thirtyseconds the weight of the eastern silk my master you should have been born a phoenician for you are wasted as a hellene zakerbaal said when they clasped hands youre a formidable fellow yourself most noble one menedemos replied truthfully he resolved to make sure that zakerbaal weighed both kinds of silk on the same pan of his scales so skillful a bargainer would surely find a way to make everything possible work for him but the cloth merchant didnt even try setting one kind in one pan and the other in the other maybe that was a compliment to menedemos maybe it meant zakerbaal had some other way to cheat if so menedemos didnt spot it the rhodians burden on the way back to the aphrodite was lighter than what hed taken from the ship but he didnt mind in fact he felt like kicking up his heels no he didnt mind at all i shouldnt be doing this sostratos told himself its wrong if menedemos knew how he would laugh then he laughed at himself he was enjoying himself too much to care whether his cousin would mock him keep going he said panting a little dont stop there i dont intend to my dear hekataios of abdera answered i was only getting a pebble out of my sandal the temple of the ioudaioi is just around this next corner here ishould be in the market square selling whatever i can sostratos thought but menedemos does know i aimed to learn about the loudaioi too of one thing he was certain his cousin wouldnt have minded if hed stayed away from the market square to bed the innkeepers pretty wife that was how menedemos would have entertained himself in jerusalem if i find my amusement in different places menedemos will just have to make the best of it along with hekataios sostratos rounded that last corner having done so he stopped in his tracks and pointed thats a temple he said unable to hide his disappointment im afraid so hekataios told him not very impressive is it in a word no sostratos said he was used to the colonnades the entablatures and carved and painted friezes that marked out a sacred place throughout the hellenic world where poleis were rich the shrines would be built of gleaming marble where they were not so rich or where no more suitable stone was close by limestone would serve hed even heard of temples where tree trunks did duty for columns the phoenicians worshiped their gods with rites different from the ones hellenes used and yet as sostratos had seen in sidon theyd come under the influence of hellenic architecture so that from the front their shrines looked much like those to be found anywhere in the hellenic world from syracuse to rhodes the same held true for other barbarians like the samnites and karians and lykians not here seeing this temple in the northern corner of jerusalem was almost like a blow in the face it reminded sostratos just how far from home he was a stone wall defended the perimeter of the temple precinct it wasnt the strongest work sostratos had ever seen but it was a long way from the weakest laughing he said i thought this was part of the citadel oh no best one hekataios of abdera tossed his head and pointed northwest up toward higher ground theres the citadel surrounding the governors palace sostratos craned his neck i see its well sited in any fight that breaks out between the governor and the ioudaioi the governor and his garrison here have the advantage of the ground eryes hekataios dipped his head i hadnt thought of it in quite those terms but youre perfectly correct the palace of course dates back to persian days so the great kings must have been nervous about trouble from the ioudaioi even then an interesting point it is isnt it sostratos said how old is the temple it was built in persian times too hekataios answered but its supposed to lie on the spot where an older temple stood before jerusalem was sacked he shrugged regretfully history in these parts is pretty much a blur before the days of the persians unless you want to believe all the mad fables about queen semiramis and the rest of those absurdities they are hard to swallow arent they sostratos agreed hard to make any real sense of history when youre trying to investigate times too distant to let you question the people who shaped events just so just so hekataios said you do understand how these things work dont you i try sostratos realized the older man took him for a merchant and nothing more with some asperity he said i may have to buy and sell for a living o marvelous one but im not an ignorant man on account of that i studied at the lykeion in athens under the great theophrastos i may not be lucky enough to study full timethe look he sent his companion was frankly jealousbut i do what i can in the time i have hekataios of abdera coughed a couple of times and turned as red as a modest youth hearing praise from his suitors for the first time i beg your pardon my dear please believe me when i tell you i meant no offense oh i believe you that wasnt the problem the problem was all the assumptions hekataios had been making sostratos didnt know what to do about those he doubted he could do anything about them hekataios was obviously a gentleman from a privileged family like anyone who didnt have to get his hands dirty he looked down his nose at men who did he was polite about it sostratos had met plenty of kaloi kagathoi who werent but the bias remained with a sigh sostratos said lets go on toward the temple shall we certainly thats a good idea hekataios sounded relieved by talking about the curious customs of the ioudaioi he could escape talking and thinkingabout the curious customs of the hellenes we can go into the lower court hereanyones allowed to do that but we cant go into the upper inner courtyard the one surrounding the temple itself only ioudaioi are allowed to do that what would happen if we tried sostratos askedhe wanted to get as close a look at the temple as he could unlike the shrines in sidon this one he could see even from a distance of several plethra had been built by men who knew nothing of hellenic architecture it was a plain rather dumpy rectangle of a building oriented eastwest its face adorned with sparkling gold ornaments a curtain over the entrance in front of the temple stood a large altarten cubits high and twenty broad sostratos guessedof unhewn white stones but hekataios of abdera was tossing his head in dismay what would happen if we tried first off they wouldnt let us the priests of the ioudaioi run things hereantigonos men dont second if we did manage to sneak into the inner court they would say we polluted it just by being there they take ritual cleanliness very seriously didnt you see that in your travels through ioudaia coming here well yes sostratos said but even so but me no buts the other hellene said what would happen after we tried to go into the inner court is that jerusalem would see rioting of a kind you wouldnt believe even if the ioudaioi didnt murder usand they probably wouldantigonos men would want to for causing so much trouble you have to be a dangerous madman to want to try to go up there do you understand me i suppose so sostratos said sulkily hekataios waited sostratos realized something more was expected of him the guard at the gate had warned him about the temple of the ioudaioi too so it really was a problem for hellenes more sulkily still he gave his word i promise good thank you you worried me there for a moment hekataios said now we can go on thank you so much sostratos said hekataios of abdera ignored his sarcasm they entered the outer courtyard looking around sostratos remarked its all cobblestones where are the bushes and saplings that mark off a holy precinct they dont use them hekataios said they think this is enough strange sostratos said very strange theyre strange people hadnt you noticed that oh you might say so sostratos voice was dry what i think is especially peculiar is the day of rest they take every seven they say their god created the world in six days and rested on the seventh and so they think they should imitate him i understand that sostratos said its not what bothers me i dont believe their god did what they say he did but never mind that if they spent that seventh day relaxing well and good but its more than that they wont light fires or cook or do anything much at all if soldiers attacked them i dont think they would fight back or try to save their own lives and thats crazy you know as a matter of fact yes i agree with you completely hekataios of abdera told him one thing quickly becomes plain when you start looking at the way the ioudaioi live their lives they have no sense of proportion whatsoever sense of proportion sostratos echoed he dipped his head yes thats exactly what theyre missing nicely put noble one why thank you my dear youre very kind hekataios looked suitably modest i was talking with my cousinhes back in sidon nowon the way here sostratos said one of the proverbs from the seven sages came up nothing too much i dont believe that one would appeal to the ioudaioi he didnt think it appealed to menedemos either but he didnt care to discuss that with a near stranger laughing hekataios dipped his head too youre right the loudaioi i think do everything to excess or sometimes as with their day of rest they even do nothing to excess sostratos said hekataios laughed again oh thats very nice i do like that he made as if to clap his hands sostratos went up as close to the terraced stairway leading up to the inner courtyard as he couldclose enough to make hekataios look nervous he stared at the temple how old is it he asked it was built i believe in the reign of the first dareios hekataios replied but as i said before this isnt the first temple there was another one before it but that one was destroyed when jerusalem was sacked i wish we could figure out exactly when that was sostratos said before the days of the persian empire as i said beforethats all i can tell you the other hellene said with a shrug then he snapped his fingers come to think of it though the ioudaioi do have a sort of a history that talks about such things but who knows whats in it its not in greek a history a written one sostratos asked hekataios dipped his head sostratos said i read aramaica little anyhow do you how strange hekataios raised an eyebrow but that wont help im afraid what why not because this book the ioudaioi have isnt in aramaic hekataios answered what well by the dog what language is it in egyptian i dont think so hekataios pondered then tossed his head no it cant be i know what egyptian looks likeall those little pictures of people and animals and plants running riot all over everywhere no ive seen this book and it looks as if it ought to be in aramaic more or less but it isnt its written in the language the ioudaioi used to speak before aramaic spread all over the countryside the language the priests use when they pray he pointed toward the men in fringed robes and fringed striped shawls who were sacrificing a sheep at the altar is that what it is sostratos said in relief i was listening to them before we started talking just now and i couldnt make heads or tails of what they were saying i thought it was just me whatever language that is it sounds a lot like aramaicit has the same set of noises at the back of the throatbut the words are different that sort of thing happens with us too hekataios observed ever try to make sense out of what macedonians say when they start talking among themselves you cant do it no matter how much the language sounds as though it ought to be proper greek some hellenes canthe ones from the northwest whose own dialect isnt too far away from what the macedonians speak sostratos said so its not quite the same maybe not i certainly dont care to have to try to figure out macedonian and i have to do it in alexandria every now and again hekataios made a wry face the men with the money and the power too often arent the ones with the culture no doubt o best one sostratos said politely he wanted to scream in hekataios face instead something like you stupid selfcentered twit you dont know when youre well off youve got patrons in alexandria and what do you do you complain about them and yet you have the leisure to travel around doing research and youll be able to sit down and write your book and have scribes make copies of it so that it has a chance to live forever how would you like to deal in perfume and beeswax and balsam and linen and silk instead do you think you would find the time to touch pen to papyrus then good luck he hoped none of that showed on his face if it did it was liable to look uncommonly like murder he hadnt known this sort of savage envy since hed had to go home from the lykeion for him a spell in athens had been the capstone on his education for others there it had been the first step toward a life lived loving wisdom he went back to the world of trade they went on to the world of knowledge as his ship sailed out of peiraieus bound for rhodes hed wanted to kill them simply because they got to do what he so desperately wanted to do over the years his resentment of scholars had faded it had till he met hekataios who complained of problems sostratos would have been delighted to have shall we go back sostratos said i dont think i want to see any more what he really didnt want to do was think about hekataios good fortune well why not hekataios spoke with obvious relief now sostratos hid a smile though it was a bitter one hekataios must have feared he would try to go up the terraced stairs to the second courtyard the one forbidden to all but the ioudaioi from everything hed seen of the locals though he knew how foolish that would have been no matter how curious he was he didnt want to touch off an insurrection or get himself killed he sent a last glance up to the governors residence above the temple of the ioudaioi that residence was a fortress in its own right a hellenic or macedonian soldier up on the walls peered out and recognized more hellenes in the lower courtyard below doubtless by the short chitons they wore and by hekataios cleanshaven face the sentry waved and called out hail hail sostratos replied hekataios waved back to the soldier to hekataios sostratos remarked always good to hear greek oh my dear i should say so hekataios replied and you at least speak some of this ghastly local language for me it might as well be the grunting of animals i shall be so very glad to return to alexandria where greek prevailsthough there are ioudaioi settling there too if you can believe it he rolled his eyes but then resumed i shall also be glad to have the spare time to gather all my notes and memories together and then to sit down and write sostratos did not bend down pry a cobblestone out of the ground and brain hekataios with it why he didnt he never knew then or afterwards the scholar walked on still breathing still talking intelligently still unaware of how much he took for granted and sostratos craved with a deep hopeless desperate yearning one of these days one of these years sostratos thought ill do as thales did and get so rich i can afford to do as i please i can gather all my notes and memories together and then sit down and write i can and i will back at the inn they found chaos teleutas for once hadnt caused it he was off at a brothel down the block the innkeeper was shouting at moskhion in bad greek and the former sponge diver was shouting right back moskhion turned to sostratos in obvious relief gods be praised youre here young sir this fellow reckons ive done something really dreadful and i never meant no harm not to nobody outrage insult ithran shouted he profanes the one god calm o best one calm please sostratos said in greek he switched to aramaic peace be unto you peace be unto us all tell your slave i will make it right if i can he profanes the one god the innkeeper repeated this time in aramaic but he didnt seem quite so ready to burst into flames as he had a moment before what happened sostratos asked moskhion trying to take advantage of the relative peace and quiet i got hungry young sir moskhion answered i craved a bit of meathavent had any for a long time wanted some pork but i couldnt make this silly barbarian here understand the word for it oh dear now sostratos knew what sort of trouble he was in what did you do then i asked the abandoned rogue for a potsherd sir so i could draw him a picture moskhion said he understood potsherd well enough furies take him why couldnt he understand pork he gave me the sherd and i drewthis he showed sostratos the piece of broken pot on it hed scraped with the tip of a sharp knife a commendable picture of a pig sostratos had had no idea he could draw so well maybe moskhion himself hadnt even known but the gift plainly was there sostratos said what happened next i gave it to him and he pitched a fit the sailor replied thats where we were when you walked in just now young sir they dont eat pork you know sostratos said they think a pigs a polluted animal we havent seen any more pigs than statues in ioudaia remember thats why he got angry he thought you were outraging him and his god both well calm the silly fool down moskhion said i didnt want any trouble all i wanted was some spare ribs or something like that ill try sostratos turned toward the innkeeper and switched to aramaic my master your slaves man meant no offense he does not know your laws he only wanted food we eat pork it is not against our laws its against ours ithran fumed pigs make everything ritually unclean that is why no pigs and no swines flesh are allowed in jerusalem even that image of a pig is liable to be a pollution the ioudaioi forbade graven images of men because men were made in the image of their god whose image was forbidden them by such reasoning sostratos could see how the picture of a beast reckoned unclean might itself be unclean but he said it is only an image and you fought for antigonos you know ionians eat pork moskhion meant no offense he will apologize in greek he hissed tell him youre sorry im hungry is what i am the sailor grumbled but he dipped his head to ithran sorry buddy i didnt mean to get you all upset zeus knows thats so all right ithran took a deep breath all right let it go no wait give me that image one of you sostratos handed him the potsherd he set it on the floor then stomped it with all his strength under his sandal it shattered into tiny pieces there gone for good sostratos hated to see such a fine sketch destroyed for the sake of peace though he kept quiet hekataios of abdera hadnt wanted him to cause a riot and he didnt want moskhion to cause one what was all that hekataios asked now parts of it were in aramaic so i couldnt follow sostratos explained when he was done hekataios said euge you were lucky therelucky and clever the ioudaioi can go mad when it comes to pigs yes i figured as much sostratos said but it was just a misunderstanding most of the time misunderstandings here dont get straightened out hekataios said they end up in blood a good thing master ithran knows at least something of hellenic customs or it would have been worse zilpah had come in while hekataios was talking as hekataios and sostratos went back and forth in greek ithran explained to his wife in aramaic what had been going on sostratos listened to them with perhaps a quarter of an ear the mere sound of aramaic reminded him of the truth of what hekataios had said this was not his country these were not his people disaster could so easily overwhelm him disaster springing from something as trivial as a sailor getting a yen for meat after going a long time without and if disaster did overwhelm him here on whom could he call for help no one no one at all we did get through it he told hekataios in the end thats all that really matters the other hellene said something in reply now sostratos hardly heard him he was watching zilpah listening to her husbands account of the affairwhich was for all sostratos knew quite different from the way it had looked to moskhion and him and hekataios of abdera shes as foreign as any of the other loudaioi sostratos told himself another undoubted truth but she was to his eyes a great deal more decorative than any of the others that shouldnt have made so much difference it shouldnt have but it did she happened to look his way at the same time as he was looking at her he knew he should have turned his gaze in a different direction staring at another mans wife could easily bring trouble down on his head if he hadnt been able to see that for himself traveling with menedemos should have pounded it home and yet he looked and could not look away the longer he stayed in jerusalem the more he understood menedemos madness the madness that had only infuriated him before the line of zilpahs jaw the way her lips opened just a little when she breathed the shine of her eyes her wavy midnight hair he knew what he was thinking as he looked at her but what was going through her mind while she looked back at him he was sure she could read his face as readily as he would have read an inscription in the agora at rhodes and if she could she had but to say a word to scarred and dangerous ithran there and hovering danger would hover no longer but strike she did not say the word sostratos wondered why moskhion stalked out of the inn muttering about getting mutton if he couldnt have pork hekataios of abdera said i am going to write up what i saw today so that i dont forget it hail off he went sostratos perched himself on a stool wine please he said in aramaic here ithran dipped it out of a jar he also poured a cup for himself before drinking from it he murmured a brief prayer he watched sostratos pour out a few drops onto the floor as a libation for the gods and let out a sigh had that sigh held words it would have meant something like you are only a hellene you know no better peace be unto you sostratos saidnot as the usual greeting but a real request we do not aim to offend you we have our own customs yes i know that ithran answered you cannot help being what you are and to you also peace would he have said that had he noticed sostratos eyeing zilpah not likely the next day was the sabbath of the ioudaioi no one lit the fire that morning that would have been reckoned work hekataios went up to the fortress overlooking the temple to talk with one of antigonos officers whose acquaintance he had made sostratos had intended to see what he might find in the market square but he knew the square would be quiet and empty on the day of rest he still thought the local custom a colossal waste of time but the loudaioi cared for his opinion not at all with nothing useful to do he stayed at the inn oil and yesterdays bread and wine made a tolerable breakfast aristeidas and moskhion went off to the brothel to find out if the women there were also taking a day of rest when the two sailors didnt come back right away teleutas began fidgeting on his stool after a bit he asked sostratos youre not going anywhere much today are you who me sostratos said i intended to be in macedonia this morning and carthage this afternoon why heh teleutas saidalmost but not quite a laugh well if you arent going anywhere i suppose i can head on over to the girls myself i mean to say youre not likely to get in trouble just hanging around here at the inn are you that depends sostratos answered gravely if the stymphalian birds and the hydra come by i may have to fight them because i havent seen herakles anywhere in these parts heh teleutas said again he hurried out of the inn perhaps as much to get away from sostratos as to choose a woman for himself sostratos hid a smile he no more wanted teleutas company than the sailor wanted his he held up a hand zilpah nodded to him and asked yes what is it may your slave have another cup of wine please he said in aramaic yes of course ill get it for you she hesitated then added you need not be so formal for such a small request better too formal than not enough sostratos answered she set the cup of wine on the little table in front of him he said thank you very much youre welcome zilpah said you speak more of our language than any other ionian i have known that was good yesterday you managed to show your man meant no harm with his picture of the unclean beast that could have caused trouble bad trouble her face clouded some ionians laugh at us because of what we believe we do not laugh at other folk for what they believe it is not for us but we do not laugh at it i know what i believe sostratos said sipping at the wine what is that zilpah asked gravely i believe you are beautiful sostratos hadnt known he was going to say that till the words were out of his mouth zilpah had started to turn away from him she turned back suddenly and sharply if she was angry sostratos knew hed found himself more trouble than hed helped moskhion escape but her voice was quiet even amused as she answered and i believe you have been away from your home too long maybe you should go down the block with your friends sostratos tossed his head he needed a heartbeat to remember to shake it instead i do not want that the body of a woman he shrugged trying to tell zilpah how he felt in a language he didnt speak at all well was one more problem one more frustration he wondered if even menedemos would have had any luck under such circumstances he did his best continuing the body of a woman matters not so much a woman i care about that matters if zilpah squawked and ran for her husband hed already said enough to get himself in deep trouble but she didnt she said i have had this happen before a traveling man happens to be kind enough to think i am pretty and then he thinks he is in love with me because of that it is only foolishness though how can you think you care about me when you do not even know me not in any way that matters that was the sort of question sostratos often asked his cousin when menedemos imagined hed fallen in love with some girl whod caught his eye having it come back at him would have been funny if hed looked at it the right way just then he was in no mood for that i know ways that matter sostratos said zilpah giggled he realized hed used the feminine verb form as she had i know he said again this time correctly i know you are kind i know you are patient i know you are generous i know these are good things for a woman to be he managed a wry grin i know my aramaic is bad she smiled at that but quickly became serious once more the other ionian here tried to give me money so i would give him my body she said i have had that happen before with us and with foreigners if i want a woman i can buy i will go down the block sostratos said yes i believe you you are a strange man do you know that you pay me these complimentsthey make me want to blush i am an innkeepers wife i do not blush very often i have seen too much heard too much but i think you mean what you say i do not think you say it to lure me into bed of course i mean it sostratos said menedemos might not have but he was a practiced seducer telling anything but what he saw as the truth hadnt occurred to sostratos zilpah smiled again how old are you ionian twentyseven he answered i would have guessed you younger she told him he wondered if that was praise or something else maybe she didnt know either she went on i have not had anyone say such things to me not even your husband sostratos asked he should no zilpahs voice was troubled when no one says these things you do not miss them but when someone does i am not going to take you into my bed here sostratos son of lysistratos but i think you have made my marriage a colder place even so i did not mean to do that sostratos said no you meant to lay me that would have been simpler than making me wonder why i have had no praise since i stood under the wedding canopy with my husband oimoi sostratos said that was greek but zilpah took the meaning from the sound as hed thought she could in aramaic he went on i did not mean to make you unhappy i am sorry i did i dont think you made me unhappy zilpah said i think i was unhappy i think i have been unhappy for years without even knowing it you made me see that i ought to thank you i am surprised you are not angry sostratos said when someone pointed out to him something he hadnt seen before he wasusually when he remembered to begrateful most people from everything hed seen got angry when anyone made them change their view of the way the world worked if anything did that marked the difference between those who aspired to philosophy and ordinary men angry no the innkeepers wife shook her head it is not your fault it is ithrans fault for taking me as much for granted as the bed he sleeps in and my fault for letting him do it for not even noticing he was doing it sudden tears glinted in her eyes maybe it would have been different if either of our children had lived im sorry sostratos said so many families had a lament like zilpahs infants died so readily burying them inside city walls brought no religious pollution as it did with the bodies of older people everything is as the one god wills zilpah said the priests say this and i believe them but i cannot understand why he willed that my babies died we ionians wonder about these same things sostratos said we do not know i do not think we can know he finished his wine and held out the cup to her may i have more please he was usually very moderate with the unmixed stuff knowing how strong it was but nerves made him want a refill of course you hardly drink at all zilpah said it didnt seem that way to sostratos but he let it go she poured his cup full and her own as well he spilled out a little libation onto the floor while she murmured the blessing the ioudaioi used over wine they both drank zilpah managed a small laugh here we are pouring down wine to drown our sorrow because neither of us got what we wanted that is funny is it not or it could be sostratos said the wine sweet and thick went down very smoothly sostratos hooked another stool with his ankle and slid it over to the table where he sat here no need to stand if you do nothing else you can sit by me i suppose so when zilpah did sit she perched on the edge of the stool like a nervous bird she gulped her wine got up to pour herself another cup and sat again i dont know why i drink she remarked looking down into the purple wine after i am done everything will still be the same yes said sostratos who felt the same way himself but while you drink he usually spoke as she did today he found himself praising wine for a little while yes zilpah said for a little while even things you know are foolish seem not so bad in greek sostratos would have answered thats why people use wine as an excuse for doing things they would never dream of doing sober he knew he couldnt say anything so complexand so far removed from the world of trade and bargainingin aramaic but a nod once he remembered to use the local gesture and not the one he was used to seemed to get his meaning across well enough more wine zilpah asked him her cup was already empty again his was still half full he took another sip from it and nodded again he would never have drunk so much neat wine in the morning back in rhodes but he wasnt in rhodes any more if he had a thick head later in the day then he did that was all zilpah got up and filled a pitcher with wine she stood beside sostratos to pour more into his cup people use wine as an excuse for doing things they would never dream of doing sober sostratos thought again before he could tell it not to his right arm slipped around zilpahs waist she could have screamed she could have broken the pitcher over his head she could have done any number of things that would have led to quick irrevocable catastrophe for him she didnt she didnt even try to twist free or to knock his hand away she just shook her head a little and murmured wine wine sostratos agreed wine and you you are lovely i would make you happy if i could if you let me foolishness zilpah said but was she talking to him or to herself sostratos couldnt tell not till she set the pitcher on the table and sat down on his lap his arms went round her in glad surprise he lifted his face as she lowered hers their lips met her mouth tasted of wine and of her own sweetness she sighed back deep in his throat the kiss went on and on sostratos had thought the wine was making him drunk this next to this the wine was as nothing he slipped one hand under her robes it slid up past her knee up the smooth flesh of her inner thigh toward the joining of her legs but that hand hurrying toward her secret place must have reminded her just what game theyd started playing with a little frightened moan she jerked away and sprang to her feet again no she said i told you i would not take you to my bed had she been a slave he might have pulled her down to the floor and had her by force such things even happened to free hellenic women of good family every now and again as when they were coming back at night from a religious procession comic poets wrote plays about the complications that rose from mischances like that but sostratos had never been one to think of force first and using it on a foreign woman in a town full of barbarians he tossed his head he couldnt help letting out a long angry breath if you did not mean to finish i wish you had not started he said the throbbing in his own crotch told him how much he wished that i am sorry zilpah replied i wanted a little sweetnessnot too much but a little i didnt think you she let that trail away i didnt think no you did not neither did i sostratos sighed he gulped down the rest of the wine in the cup maybe i should go down the block after all maybe you should zilpah said but now ionian now what am i supposed to do and for that no matter how much sostratos prided himself on his cleverness he had no answer at all menedemos had taken his time going over to the dyeworks on the outskirts of sidon he kept finding excuses for staying away the real reason was simple the dyeworks that made the phoenician cities famous stank too badly for him to want to get close to them that stench came into the city when the wind blew the wrong way but sidon like any town around the inner sea had plenty of other foul odors to dilute that one out by the dyeworks the smell of rotting shellfish was both overpowering and unalloyed how did anyone ever find out that murexes once crushed yielded a liquor which after it was properly treated became the marvelous phoenician crimson dye he wondered some inventions seemed natural to him anyone could see that sticks floated and all sorts of things caught the wind and were pushed along by it from there to rafts and boats could only be a small step but purple dye menedemos tossed his head it struck him as very unlikely he wished he had sostratos along seeing a phoenician smashing shells with a mallet he called out hail do you speak greek the fellow shook his head but he knew what menedemos was trying to ask for he said something in aramaic in which the rhodian caught the word ionian the phoenician pointed to a shack not far away he gave forth with another sentence full of coughing and hissing noises again menedemos heard the local word for a hellene maybe that meant someone who spoke his language was in there he hoped so anyhow thanks he said the phoenician waved and went back to smashing seashells after a moment he paused picked up a morsel of meat and popped it into his mouth cant get your op son any fresher than that menedemos thought when he opened the door to the shack a couple of phoenicians one stout the other lean looked up at him the stout one began to speak before he could say a word you must be the rhodian wondered when you were going to show up around here his greek was fluent colloquial and sounded as if hed learned it from someone right on the edge of the law yes thats right im menedemos son of philodemos menedemos said hail and you gentlemen are im tenashtart son of metena the stout phoenician answered this is my brother ithobaal miserable son of a whore doesnt speak any greek pleased to meet you you want to buy some dye right yes menedemos said uhwhere did you learn greek so well here and there pal here and there tenashtart answered ive done some knocking around in my time you bet i have there are towns in hellas but you didnt come here to listen to me bang my gums its all right menedemos told him more fascinated than anything else do you mind if i ask you a question sure tenashtart said expansively go right ahead in the name of the gods o best one how do you stand the stink menedemos blurted before answering tenashtart said something in aramaic to ithobaal both brothers laughed tenashtart went back to greek everybody asks us that doesnt matter who phoenicians helleneseven persians back when i was a kid they all say the same thing and do you give them the same answer menedemos asked tenashtart had spent a lot of time among hellenes he dipped his head instead of nodding as almost all barbarians would have done menedemos said well what is the answer you want to know the truth the dyemaker said the truth is we both spend so much time with the shells we dont even notice it any more only time i know its there is when ive been away for a bit then i smell it for a while when i get back but except for that its not even there for me any more than air is there for me you know what i mean i suppose so menedemos answered it seems hard to believe though tenashtart said something else in aramaic his brother nodded ithobaal pointed out toward the workman crushing murexes touched his formidable nose and shrugged he might have been saying he didnt notice the reek of rotting shellfish either even to menedemos it didnt seem quite so appalling as it had when he first got to the dyeworks all the same he remained a long way from not noticing it he wished he were as oblivious as the two phoenician brothers tenashtart said you come all this way to talk about nasty smells or do you want to do some business lets do business menedemos said agreeably what do you charge for a jar of your best dye when the sidonian told him he let out a yip thats outrageous tenashtart spread his hands thats the way it goes buddy ive got to make a living same as everybody else but menedemos wagged a finger at him oh no you dont my dear youre not going to get away with that not for a minute you wont and ill tell you why not ive seen phoenicians over in hellas selling crimson dye for the very same price and thats after their middlemans markup what do they pay you you must be talking about men from byblos or from arados tenashtart said easily theyve got lower quality dye so naturally they can charge less menedemos tossed his head oh no you dont he said again for one thing theyd say byblian or aradian dyes as good as sidonian with tyre wrecked nobody has a sure best any more and for another ive seen sidonians selling for the very same price tenashtarts engagingly ugly grin showed a missing bottom front tooth i like you rhodian to the crows with me if i dont youve got balls but tell me thiswhy should i give a hellene the same rate i give my own people he translated his words for ithobaal who nodded again why menedemos said ill tell you why because silver is silver thats why now kindly tell your brother that in aramaic too youve got your nerve tenashtart said but he sounded more admiring than otherwise he and ithobaal did go back and forth in their own language a crackle of sounds strange to greek ears when they finished tenashtart named another price this one only a little more than half as high as what hed suggested before well thats better menedemos said i dont know that its goodi still think you charge your own folk less than thatbut its better well talk more later first though do you want silver or are we working a trade you came here in an akatos tenashtart said that means youre bound to have goodies tucked away under the rowers benches what have you got and what do you want for it my cousin took perfume into the country of the ioudaioi but ive still got plenty left menedemos answered a merchant galley can carry a lot more than a pack donkeys able to you talking about the rose essence you rhodians make tenashtart asked menedemos dipped his head the sidonian said thats good stuff and it doesnt get over here all that often you sell it in those little tiny jars though dont you yes its concentrated so a little goes a long way menedemos said what do you want for one of those jars no wait tenashtart held up a dyestained hand lets settle on how many jars of perfume go into one jar of dye as long as were talking about jars and not sigloi or drakhmai it seems friendlier whether it really is or not it didnt seem friendly to menedemos for very long tenashtart mocked his initial offer he scorned tenashtarts each accused the other of being a brigand descended from a long line of pirates and thieves each claimed the other was thinking of his own profit at the expense of the deal as a whole each was undoubtedly right half a digits breadth at a time they got closer together the closer they got the more they railed at each other after a while menedemos grinned at tenashtart and said this is fun isnt it tenashtart got up from his stool and folded menedemos into a bear hug ah hellene if youd only stay in sidon for a year id make a phoenician out of you to the crows with me if i wouldnt then he made an offer hardly more reasonable than his previous one menedemos didnt want to be a phoenician coming out and saying so struck him as impolitic he made another offer of his own tenashtart rained curses down on him in greek and aramaic they both started laughing which didnt mean they stopped yelling at each other or trying to best each other in the bargain when at last they clasped hands they were both sweating whew menedemos said now were both going to say we got cheated and then were both going to make a pile of money on what we just did but if we see each other again in a couple of years neither one of us will admit it thats how it goes tenashtart agreed youre pretty good hellene furies take me if youre not youre pretty good yourself menedemos replied i skinned you he thought tenashtart no doubt thought the same it was a good bargain all the way around as sostratos and the sailors from the aphrodite left jerusalem teleutas heaved a sigh that wasnt such a bad town even if i couldnt speak the language he said the wine was pretty good and plenty strong moskhion broke in drinking it unmixed isnt so bad once you get used to it no not half bad teleutas agreed the girls were friendly too or they acted friendly enough once you gave em silver he eyed sostratos you ever get yourself laid while we were there young sir yes once or twice sostratos answered truthfully the girls in the brothel i went to were just girls in a brothel as far as im concerned they didnt seem special one way or another he couldnt say the same about zilpah but he didnt care to talk about the innkeepers wife with his escorts for one thing he hadnt actually done anything with her for another even if he had he tossed his head menedemos bragged about his adulteries sostratos sometimes thought his cousin committed them not least so he could brag about them if i ever seduce another mans wife i hope ill have the sense to keep my mouth shut about it aristeidas asked how long before we get to this engedi place shouldnt be more than a couple of days sostratos answered its supposed to lie by the edge of what they call the lake of asphalt or something like that they say all sorts of funny things about that lake they say it holds so much salt nothing can live in it and they say that if you walk out into it you cant even sinkits so salty you just float in it the way an egg will float in water if you put enough salt into it people say all sorts of silly things aristeidas observed do you believe any of that nonsense right now i dont know whether to believe or disbelieve sostratos said some strange things turn out to be true look at peafowl and look at the gryphons skull we had last year who would have thought gryphons were anything but legendary beasts till we came across that but im not going to worry about it now not when ill see for myself in a day or two all right i guess thats fair aristeidas said this place were going to thoughit cant be as big as jerusalem can it sostratos tossed his head i wouldnt think so anyhow by the way the ioudaioi talk jerusalem is the biggest city in their land its not much teleutas said he spoke slightingly as a matter of course even if things did impress him he didnt let on here though sostratos had to agree with him next to athens or rhodes or syracuse jerusalem wasnt much sidon with its tall buildings outdid this little local center too one day before too long he supposed people would forget all about it even the temple of the ioudaioi would probably lose its importance as people hereabouts took on more and more hellenic ways eventually he thought theyll sacrifice a pig on that altar and no one will care the world belongs to us hellenes nowadays the road from jerusalem toward engedi first ran south through the hilly country in which the main town of the ioudaioi sat and then east toward the lake of asphalt sostratos had asked several different people in jerusalem how far engedi was and had got several different answers no one had ever properly measured distances in this country as alexander s surveyors had done during his campaigns of conquest eventually too sostratos supposed whichever of antigonos or ptolemaios held on to ioudaia would do the job till then each mans opinion seemed as good as that of the nextand was certainly maintained with every bit as much passion though the precise distance remained loudly in doubt sostratos did think engedi lay about two days journey from jerusalem as hed told aristeidas he and his men paused to rest in the heat of the day at the little town of bethlehem they bought wine from a tavernkeeper and used it to wash down the loaves theyd brought from jerusalem the taverners daughter who was about ten stared and stared at them as she carried the wine to their table sostratos would have bet shed never seen a hellene before peace be unto you he said in aramaic she blinked and to you also peace she answered if it hadnt been a set phrase she might have been too startled to bring it out her dark eyes were enormous in a skinny none too clean face that still promised considerable beauty as she got older whats your name he asked maryam she whispered then obviously gathering her courage she asked whats yours im sostratos son of lysistratos he answered the funnysounding foreign syllables made her giggle she skipped away sostratos asked the taverner why did you give her a name that means bitter she seems a happy child yes so she does now the man answered but bearing her almost killed my wife for weeks i thought it would thats why stranger oh thank you sostratos said curiosity satisfied and then remembering his manners he added i am glad your wife did not die thank you again but the taverners face did not lighten she lived another three years then perished of the word was meaningless to sostratos he spread his hands to show as much the ioudaian arched his back threw back his head and clenched his jaw he was a good mime good enough to make sostratos shiver oh tetanus we call that in greek the rhodian said i am very sorry my friend that is a hard way to die i have seen it too with a shrug the tavernkeeper said our god willed it so and so it came to pass magnified and sanctified be the name of our god throughout the world he created according to his will the way he rattled off the words they had the sound of a prayer he knew by heart sostratos would have liked to ask him about that too but moskhion distracted him by asking what he was talking about so he didnt he didnt even think of it again till he and the sailors had already left bethlehem when he did he muttered to himself in annoyance then he rode the mule to the top of a little hill and peering east got a good look at the lake of asphalt what first struck him was how far down the water looked these hills werent very high but the lake seemed far below him teleutas looked in that direction too in the name of the gods he said thats some of the ugliestlooking country ive seen in all my days though teleutas liked to disparage everything he saw that didnt mean he was always wrong he wasnt wrong here sostratos thought it far and away the ugliestlooking country hed seen in his life too the hills through which he and his fellow rhodians were traveling descended to the lake of asphalt through a series of cliffs of reddish flint on which hardly anything grew below those cliffs were bluffs of buff limestone every bit as barren the plains between the high ground and the lake were dazzlingly white you know what that reminds me of moskhion said when they set out pans full of seawater to dry up and they do and theres all the salt left in the bottom to the crows with me if thats not what it looks like youre right sostratos said but salt pans werent very big these salt flats if that was what they were went on for stadion after stadion looks as though half the salt in the world is down there too bad its not worth bringing a donkeyload back with us aristeidas said its just lying there waiting for somebody to scoop it up you wouldnt have to bother with pans if so many hellenic poleis didnt lie by the sea we might make a profit on it sostratos said as things are he tossed his head under the sun the lake of asphalt itself shone golden beyond it to the east lay more hills these of a harsh purplish stone sostratos had hardly noticed them in the morning when hed set out from jerusalem but they grew ever more visible as the day wore along and the angle of the sunshine falling on them changed he saw no trees or even bushes on them either the lake of asphalt and almost everything surrounding it might as well have been dead pointing east across the lake to the rugged purple hills aristeidas asked are those still a part of ioudaia too or do they belong to some other country full of different barbarians i dont know though im sure a ioudaian would sostratos answered by the look of them though id say they arent likely to be full of anything except maybe scorpions the scorpions here are bigger and nastier than anything weve got back in hellas teleutas said back in jerusalem a couple of days ago i smashed one this big he stuck up his thumb and shuddered almost makes me wish id got into the habit of wearing shoes for the next quarter of an hour he and moskhion and aristeidas were skittish on the road shying away from rocks that might hide scorpions and from shadows or sticks they feared were the stinging vermin even sostratos who was on muleback and whose feet didnt touch the ground kept looking around nervously then a scorpion did skitter across the dirt and it vanished into a crevice in the rocks before anyone could kill it teleutas curses should have been plenty to do it in all by themselves after a while the track leading down to the salt flats got so steep sostratos dismounted and walked beside the mule the animal placed each foot with the greatest of care so did the pack donkey which aristeidas led slowly the rhodians and their beasts descended from the hills not quite halfway down teleutas stopped and pointed southeast look there furies take me if that isnt green down there right by the edge of the lake of asphalt i thought this whole place was just nothing it cant all be nothing or nobody would live there sostratos said that must be engedi how do they make things grow if the lake is salty and if theres all this salt around teleutas demanded i dont know yet finding out will be interesting i think sostratos said maybe they have freshwater springs well see teleutas still looked dissatisfied but he held his peace down on the salt flat the sun beat down on sostratos with a force hed never known before he had to squint to escape the dazzle of helios rays off the salt the very air felt uncommonly thick and heavy it had the salt tang he associated with the sea and hadnt expected to smell so far inland here in fact that salt tang was stronger than hed ever known it before a raven flew past overhead moskhion said in this part of the world i bet even the birds have to carry water bottles sostratos laughed but not for long a traveler who ran out of things to drink in these parts wouldnt last long sun and salt might do as good a job of embalming him as natron did for the corpses egyptian undertakers treated heading on toward engedi sostratos wished he hadnt had that thought menedemos took the bolt of the eastern silk hed got from zakerbaal son of tenes out of the oiledleather sack where it was stowed and held it up to the sun diokles dipped his head in approval thats mighty pretty stuff skipper he said well get a good price for it too when we go back to hellas yes i think so too menedemos answered but im not just thinking about the silver look at the cloth look how thin it is the finest koan silk might as well be wool next to this wonder how they do it the keleustes said so do i menedemos dipped his head and i wonder who they are people beyond india zakerbaal said not even alexander found out whats beyond india diokles said alexander decided there wasnt anything beyond india menedemos agreed that way he could head back toward hellas saying hed conquered the whole world he looked at the silk again he was wrong he was a godlike maneven a hero a demigod if you likebut he was wrong i wonder if any more of this stuff will ever come out of the east diokles said menedemos shrugged who can guess id bet we never see another gryphons skull because nobody in his right mind would pay anything for one but this this is different its beautiful anybody who sees it would pay for it and pay plenty so maybe morell come from wherever it comes from but who knows when next year ten years from now fifty a hundred who can say he imagined strange barbarians sitting at their looms turning out bolt after bolt of this wonderful silk what would they be like beyond india they might look like anything at all the folk of india itself were said to be black like ethiopians did that mean everyone beyond india was black too this is only imagination menedemos told himself and tossed his head i can make these distant barbarians any color i please why i can make them yellow if i want to he laughed at that whats funny skipper the oarmaster asked when menedemos told him he laughed too thats pretty good it sure is you think theyd have yellow hair too the way the kelts do who knows menedemos said in my mind they had black hair but you can make them look however you want what i want to imagine now is selling this silk and the dye as we go back to rhodes itll do even better in the aegean diokles remarked the farther from phoenicia we go the better the prices well get thats probably true menedemos said maybe we can make for athens next sailing season he laughed again that would break my cousins heart wouldnt it oh yes hed be ever so disappointed diokles snorted finding the snort not strong enough he laughed out loud i wouldnt mind getting up there myself menedemos allowed you can have a good time all kinds of different ways in athens if we make port early in the season we can go to the theater for the tragedies and comedies they put on during the greater dionysia nothing tops theater in athens yes theaters a nice way to pass a day every so often the keleustes agreed and theyve got all kinds of wineshops there and pretty girls in the brothelspretty boys too if youd rather do that for a change its a good town a boys all right every once in a while menedemos said ive never been one to chase every youth in bloom through the streets though noyou chase wives instead but diokles said it indulgently he didnt sound reproving as sostratos always did i think wives are more funmost wives anyway menedemos made a sour face the innkeepers wife is chasing me i dont intend to let her catch me either sour old crone no wonder you dont stay there much no wonder at all if it werent for the bed menedemos sighed i didnt feel like sleeping on planks all the time we were here never bothered me diokles said i know but then youre comfortable sleeping sitting up i couldnt do that if my life depended on it the oarmaster shrugged all what youre used to thats what i got in the habit of doing when i pulled an oarlean up against the gunwale close my eyes and doze off after you do it for a while it seems as natural as stretching out flat maybe to you menedemos glanced down toward the base of the pier if thats not a hellene coming this way im a yellow barbarian myself he raised his voice hail friend how are you today not bad the other man answered his doric drawl not much different from the one that menedemos spoke hows yourself ive been worse menedemos allowed what can i do for you are you the fellow who was selling books at the barracks a while ago menedemos dipped his head thats me o best one i havent got many left why didnt you decide to buy sooner i couldnt thats why the stranger said im a horseman and i just got back in from a sweep through the hills after bandits he had a horsemans scars sure enoughon his legs and on his left arm a hoplites large round shield protected that arm but a horseman couldnt bear anything so big and heavy i hope the sweep went well menedemos said you wont find a merchant with a good thing to say about bandits we smoked out a couple of nests the other hellene said but its more a matter of keeping them down and making them cautious than it is of getting rid of them those hills will spawn robber bands for the next thousand years too many hiding places for em to use too many towns and roads close to em cant be helped he changed the subject back toward what interested him have you still got any books left a couple menedemos answered ones the book of the iliad where godlike akhilleus and glorious hektor fight it out the others from the odyssey the book where resourceful odysseus meets polyphemos the cyclops id like em both the cavalryman said wistfully nothing like a book to make the time pass by but youre going to put some great whacking price on em because where else can i buy if i dont get em from you you cant make me feel guilty most noble one menedemos said im not in business to lose money any more than soldiers are in business to lose battles you can have em both for thirtyfive drakhmai no haggling no cheatingthats the same price the garrison soldiers were paying papai the cavalryman said thats a lot of money just the same menedemos didnt answer he just stood and waited the other hellene frowned menedemos thought he knew the expression that of a man who was talking himself into something and sure enough the fellow said all right all right ill take em you count two drakhmai for one sidonian siglos yes menedemos answered that gave the other man a very slight break on the rate of exchange maybe sostratos would have worked it out to the last obolos but menedemos didnt feel like bothering he took the silver got the last two books in his store out of their sack and gave them to the horseman thanks the man said ill carry these till they fall to pieces id pay even more for the books from herodotos where the persians and hellenes go at it you dont happen to have those do you sorry no menedemos hoped he hid his bemusement not even sostratos had thought he could sell history books in phoenicia customers never failed to be surprising this one went on down the pier menedemos called after him lykian ham fine oil no thanks the soldier answered ive spent all the silver im going to some men would rather eat fancy me id rather read he kept on walking to diokles menedemos said a pity sostratos is off in the back of beyond he would have made himself a friend for life thats the truth the keleustes agreed i know my alphabeta but ive never had much cause to use it most of the time you can find out whatever you need to know just by talking with people i enjoy homer and i think i do like him better because i can read him for myself menedemos said same with aristophanes maybe even more so because you dont hear him read in the agora all the time the way you do homer but i dont dive into a roll of papyrus headfirst like sostratos he knows all sorts of funny things i will say diokles remarked and whats really strange is every once in a while they come in handy i know menedemos drummed the fingers of his right hand on the outside of his thigh it happens just often enough to keep me from teasing him too hard about everything he reads his fingers went up and down up and down too bad before he went back to sedekyathons inn that evening menedemos bought a sausage half a cubit long the gutwrapped length of chopped meat smelled strongly of garlic and cumin he also got himself a small loaf with olives baked into it sitos to go with his opson he chuckled when that thought crossed his mind could sostratos have known of it he would have chided menedemos for a selfconfessed opsophagos a man who put the relish ahead of the staple the sausage was supposed to go with the bread not the other way round sedekyathons wife dropped the sausage into hot oil for menedemos the oil was the same cheap stuff the innkeeper always used not only that but it had done a lot of cooking before that sausage went into it the smell filled the taproom at the front of the inn it wasnt precisely unpleasant but it was strong emashtart fished the sausage out of the oil with a pair of wooden tongs she set it on a plate and carried it over to menedemos putting it on the table in front of him she smirked and said phallos thats not how you say sausage in greek menedemos answered the word for sausage physke was close enough that she might have used the other one in honest error she might have menedemos hoped she had the way her smirk got widerand to his eyes less lovelyargued she hadnt phallos she repeated and then went on in her horrible greek you to have biggerest phallos already eh her eyes went to menedemos crotch his went to the formidable length of grayishbrown meat on the table in front of him by the gods i hope not he exclaimed what do you take me for a donkey he thought emashtart a perfect donkey but for different reasons she shook her head no just man she put a slavering emphasis on the word her gaze still hadnt risen to menedemos face a couple of other men were eating in the taproom they were phoenicians though and gave no sign of understanding greek emashtart could be shameless in front of them without their knowing hoping to quell her menedemos asked wheres your husband she gave him a scornful look hed seen that expression on the faces of more than a few women whod been interested in him and hadnt cared about their husbands at all it was the last one he wanted to see on emashtarts she said he drinking she mimed lifting a cup with both hands bringing it to her mouth and then staggering around as if with too much wine menedemos chuckled it was involuntary but he couldnt help himself she made a fine mimic she added not to coming home at alls oh menedemos said tonelessly how nice he drank some of his own wine then yawned im going to go to bed early tonight i am im very very tired he yawned again theatrically emashtart watched him she didnt say a word menedemos didnt like that he wanted her to believe him that way she wouldnt come scratching at his door sometime in the middle of the night hed been glad to have women scratch at his door before he expected he would be again once he could forget about this annoying oath hed sworn to sostratos he couldnt imagine being glad if emashtart did not even if she stood in the courtyard nakedmaybe especially not if she stood in the courtyard naked finally despite looking back over her shoulder as she went she left him alone he had to eat in a hurry yawning every so often so she wouldnt think hed been lying about how tired he waswhich he had the sausage though not quite like any hed eaten back in hellas proved tasty as he brought it up to his mouth emashtart ran her tongue over her lips in a silent obscenity that struck him as far grosser and more disgusting than anything the cheerfully bawdy aristophanes had ever come up with as soon as menedemos finished eating he hurried out of the taproom and into the cramped stuffy little chamber where hed sleep tonight he didnt even bother lighting the lamp he just took off his chiton made sure the door was barred from the inside and lay down naked on the narrow bed to his surprise he quickly fell asleep not very much to his surprise he was awakened some unknown stretch of time later by someone softly tapping on the door maybe shell go away if i lie here quietly and pretend to stay asleep he thought he tried it emashtart didnt go away she kept right on tapping louder and louder at last he doubted whether a dead man could have ignored her muttering to himself he got out of bed and went to the door who is it he asked there being one chance in a myriad it was somebody besides the innkeepers wife but she answered i are it what do you want menedemos asked and what hour is it anyway not knowing hours emashtart said want hinein menedemos coughed he gave back a pace he supposed he shouldnt have been surprised she knew the nastiest lewdest verb in the greek language but he was the word had implications of taking by force that usually made it implausible when used by a woman to a man with her speaking though it somehow seemed anything but in the name of the gods go away he said im too tired want binein she said again want binein she was almost shouting careless of what the other luckless lodgers at the inn might think had she spent all this time pouring down wine and thinking of assaulting menedemos no he said not now go away to let in the phoenician woman said want binein to be happies was this what women felt when some obnoxious man wouldnt leave them alone menedemos had had some idea of what that was like as a youth in rhodes hed had plenty of suitors sniffing after him but what hed known then was chiefly scorn for the silly men who chased him now he felt real annoyanceand fear too for in a city of her own people emashtart might be able to cause him a lot of trouble he didnt dare let her in now lest she claim hed tried to rape her instead of the other way round she started to say something else before she could a man in a nearby room yelled in aramaic menedemos didnt understand a word of it but he would have bet the other man was telling her to shut up and let him get some sleep in the other fellows place that was what menedemos would have said emashtart shouted back anger in her voice the man in the other room gave as good as he got he and the innkeepers wife went back and forth at the top of their lungs menedemos couldnt follow their argument but it sounded spectacular aramaic with its gutturals and hisses was made for quarreling the racket emashtart and the first man made disturbed others at the inn before long six or eight people were shouting at one another they all sounded furious for the next quarter of an hour menedemos hadnt the slightest hope of sleeping but he was entertained at last the bickering died away menedemos wondered whether emashtart would start scratching at his door again to his vast relief she didnt he twisted and turned on the narrow lumpy bed and finally went back to sleep when he came out the next morning he found sedekyathon sitting on a stool in the taproom drinking a cup of wine the innkeeper looked somewhat the worse for wear menedemos wondered how much hed drunk the night before but that didnt matter sedekyathon spoke more greek than his wife that did menedemos said im sorry best one but i have to move back to my ship today you say you stay till new moon the innkeeper said you already pay to stay to new moon not get silver back normally that would have infuriated the rhodian here he only shrugged fine he said he would have paid more than a few drakhmai to escape the inn he gathered up his belongings and headed back to the aphrodite in some ways he wouldnt be so comfortable in others in others he couldnt wait to return to the merchant galley growing up in rhodes sostratos had never seen snow fall till he went to athens to study at the lykeion even in athens snow had been rare hed thought he knew everything there was to know about heat engedi on the shore of the lake of asphalt proved he hadnt known so much as he thought whenever he went out of doors the sun beat down on him with almost physical force he wore his broadbrimmed hat every moment of the day and imagined he felt the weight of the sunlight pressing it down onto his head even the air seemed heavy and thick and suffused with sunshine and yet despite that suffocating heat despite the poisonously salty lake and the wasteland all around engedi lay in the midst of a patch of some of the most fertile soil hed ever seen as hed guessed springs bubbling up from underground let life not only survive but flourish here outside the walls of engedi persimmon trees and henna plants grew among other crops sostratos knew the balsammakers turned their sap into the medicinal sweetsmelling product for which the town was famous just how they did it he didnt know no one outside of engedi did he tossed his head since coming to ioudaia hed learned that wasnt quite true one other place a town called jericho also produced the balsam he shrugged the stuff was always called balsam of engedi if he bought it here he could truthfully say he had the authentic product more persimmon trees grew in front of the house of eliphaz son of gatam the leading balsammaker in engedi in the savage weather the land here by the lake of asphalt knew their shade was doubly welcome a skinny blackbearded slave opened the door when sostratos knocked peace be unto you my master he said in aramaic with an accent slightly different from that which the ioudaioi used and to you also peace mesha sostratos replied mesha was a moabite one of the nomads who sostratos had learned since coming to engedi dwelt in the desert east of the lake of asphalt sostratos didnt know by what misfortune hed ended up a slave getting captured on a raid struck the rhodian as likely mesha had the look of a man who would rob for the sport of it may khemosh favor you ionian mesha said khemosh was a moabite god sostratos would have liked to find out more about him but mesha named him only furtively eliphaz didnt approve of anyones calling on any god in his house save the invisible one the ioudaioi worshiped in a lower voice yet the moabite added may you swindle the beard off my masters chin he might be a slave but he wasnt resigned to serving the balsammaker another persimmon tree and a palebarked fig spread shade over eliphazs courtyard the ioudaian waited in that shade he was tall and solidly made and within a few years of forty sostratos could see the first few white threads in his dark beard inclining his head to sostratos he said peace be unto you ionian and to you also peace my master sostratos said politely my thanks eliphaz son of gatam clapped his hands fetch us wine mesha nodding the slave hurried away eliphaz muttered something under his breath it sounded like lizardeating savage maybe he had no more love for mesha than the moabite did for him the wine was good enough without being anything special sostratos unaccustomed to wine without water drank carefully after polite chitchat he said here is a jar of the fine rhodian perfume i mentioned when we met yesterday with use his own aramaic got more fluent by the day let me smell of it eliphaz said gravely sostratos handed him the small jar he pulled out the stopper sniffed touched the rim of the jar and rubbed his thumb and index finger together it is made with grease i see what is the grease olive oil my master nothing else sostratos replied ah a smile appeared on the balsammakers face we may freely use olive oil you understand if it were animal fatespecially if it were pig fati could not think of trading for it no matter how sweet it smells i understand that it is so yes sostratos said i do not understand why it is so if you could make this plain i would be in your debt it is so because the one god commands us to shun the pig and all other beasts that do not chew their cud and divide their hooves eliphaz said even that was more than sostratos had known before but it was not enough more to satisfy him why does your one god command you so he asked why now eliphaz son of gatam stared at him in amazement who are we to ask why the one god orders this or forbids that it is his will we can only obey and obey we do he sounded proud of such obedience that struck sostratos as very strange it was as if a man declared he was proud to be a slave and had no desire for freedom since he saw no diplomatic way to say that to the balsammaker he let it go he did say you can travel all over the world my master and you will find no sweeter no stronger no longerlasting perfume than what we make on the island of rhodes it could be it is good perfume eliphaz said but you ionian you will find no finer balsam than what we make here by the dead sea is that what you name the water sostratos said eliphaz nodded sostratos said i have also heard it called the lake of asphalt call it whatever you please the ioudaian said but we trade our balsam for silver weight for weight how do we make the scales balance with perfume all around the inner sea phoenician merchants traded balsam of engedi for twice its weight in silver sostratos wanted some of that profit for himself he said i do not sell perfume by weight but by the jar for each jar i would hope to get twenty sidonian sigloi eliphaz laughed you might hope to get so much but how likely is it if you think i will give you twenty shekels weight of balsam for one of those paltry little jars i must ask you to think again perfume jars are small because what they hold is boiled many times to make it stronger sostratos said all this takes much labor so does gathering the roses to make the perfume do you think there is no labor in making balsam eliphaz demanded not only is there labor there is the secret no one but we of engedi knows how to do what needs doing what of the men of jericho sostratos asked frauds fakes phonies the lot of them eliphaz said our balsam the balsam of engedi is far finer than theirs well my master all trades have secrets sostratos said you grow roses here do you make perfume i think not our secret is harder and more important the ioudaian insisted you would say so of course sostratos answered politely eliphaz muttered in aramaic you are worse than a phoenician he told sostratos who smiled as if what was meant for an insult were a compliment that smile made eliphaz mutter some more he said even if i were to give you ten shekels of balsam for one jar it would be too much my master it grieves me to tell a man so obviously wise that he is wrong sostratos said but you must know you are speaking nonsense if you truly believed a jar of perfume was worth less than ten sigloihe still had trouble pronouncing the sh sound that began shekels a sound greek didnt useyou would throw me out and that would be the end of our dicker not necessarily eliphaz said i might simply want something to amuse me and i tell you straight out it has been a long time since i heard anything so funny as the idea of paying twenty shekels of balsam for a jar of your perfume you must think that because you come from far away and i stay in engedi i have no notion of what anything is worth certainly not said sostratos who had hoped for something exactly like that but think my master how often does rhodian perfume come here to your town none has ever come here before eliphaz told him and if the price you want for it is any indication i can understand why not patiently sostratos said but when you have the only fine perfume in these parts for how much will you sell it do not think only of prices remember think also of profit after you buy eliphazs smile bared strong yellowish teeth i am not a child ionian i am not a blushing virgin brought to the marriage bed i know about buying and i know about selling and suppose i said all right i will give you ten shekels weight of balsam for a jar yes suppose i said that you would only scorn me you would say it is not enough you are a thief sostratos smiled too he thought he recognized an opening gambit there ten sigloi are not enough he agreed and he let the smile get broader you are a thief my master in greek he would have been sure he sounded like a man playacting in aramaic he only hoped he did when eliphaz son of gatam laughed out loud he grinned with relief hed done it right you are a dangerous man sostratos son of lysistratos the ioudaian said i do not want to be dangerous sostratos said i only want to trade ha so you say so you say eliphaz shook his head even if i said ten shekels and a half for one of those nasty little jars still would you laugh you would not come down at all not even by one of those tiny coins the governors issue that was an opening gambit sostratos realized he would have to move that he would lose any chance of a deal if he didnt i will come as far as you have come if you pay me nineteen and a half sigloi of balsam the jar the perfume is yours mesha eliphaz shouted when the moabite slave came up the balsammaker said fetch more wine fetch it at once we have work to do here and wine will grease the way muttering the slave went off to get the wine he was still muttering when he came back with it when he was a free man had he had ioudaioi serving him raids across a longestablished border could produce ironies like that eliphaz haggled as if he had all the time in the world plainly dickering was among his favorite sports sostratos knew hellenes who took the same pleasure in the act of making the deal he wasnt among them though he wanted the best price he could get the best price he could get turned out to be fourteen and a half sigloi of balsam per jar of perfume eliphaz son of gatam stubbornly refused to go to fifteen i do not need perfume so badly as that the ioudaian said it is too much i will not pay it that left sostratos muttering to himself he knew what he could get for the balsam once he took it back to hellas and he knew what he could get for the perfume in ports around the inner sea he would make more for the balsam yes would he make enough more to justify this long dangerous trip to engedi maybe on the other hand maybe not but having come so far could he justify turning around and going back to sidon without balsam he doubted hed get a better price from any of the other balsammakers like any other group of artisans they would talk among themselves and he was sure he wouldnt get a much better price did you think this would be easy he asked himself did you think eliphaz would say oh twenty sigloi of balsam the jar isnt enoughlet me give you thirty he knew perfectly well hed thought nothing of the sort whether he had or not though it would have been nice fourteen and a half shekels eliphaz said again is it yes my master or is it no if yes we have a bargain if no i am pleased to have met you some ionian soldiers have come here before but never till now a trader fourteen and a half sostratos agreed unhappily far from sure he was doing the right thing it is a bargain whew the ioudaian said if that wasnt a sigh of relief it certainly sounded like one you are a formidable foe i am glad most of your people stay far from engedi id much sooner dicker with phoenicians was that true or was he just saying it to make sostratos feel better it did the job no doubt of that you are a hard bargainer yourself sostratos said and meant every word of it he held out his hand eliphaz took it his grip was hard and firm a good bargain he declared neither one of us is happyit must be a good bargain yes sostratos said and then a different question may i bathe in the lake of asphalt does it hold up a bather so he cannot sink it does eliphaz answered and of course you may it is there he pointed east toward the water how could anyone stop you may i bathe naked sostratos persisted this is the custom of my people but you ioudaioi have different rules you may bathe naked eliphaz said you would be polite to bathe well away from women and to dress as soon as you come out of the water and do not get any of it in your eyes or in your mouth it burns it burns very much thank you i will do as you say sostratos told him he got aristeidas to come with him to make sure no lightfingered ioudaian lifted his tunic after he doffed it when he walked into the water he exclaimed in astonishment it was as warm as blood as if it were a heated bath the oceanic smell overwhelmed him he walked out till the water covered his privates to satisfy ioudaian notions of modesty then he lifted his feet and leaned back to float he exclaimed all over again eliphaz had been right and more than right he could keep his head and shoulders and feet out of the supremely salty water with the greatest of ease indeed when he tried to force more of his torso down into the lake of asphalt other parts of him rose out of it so long as that included only more of his long legs he didnt worry about it when his groin bobbed up out of the water though he set a hand over it lest he offend any ioudaioi who happened to be keeping an eye on what a foreigner did whats it like aristeidas called to him i think it may be the strangest thing ive ever felt sostratos answered its like reclining on a couch at a supper or a symposion only there is no couch and it doesnt resist me if i lean back more and its wonderfully warm too do you want to try after i come out maybe i will the sailor said i wasnt going to but coming all this way and then not going in would be pretty silly wouldnt it i certainly think so sostratos said others may think otherwise after perhaps a quarter of an hour sostratos emerged from the lake of asphalt he put on his chiton as fast as he could to keep from scandalizing the locals half a plethron down the shore a ioudaian dawdled much more than he did over redonning clothes he found that amusing the ioudaian he saw before the fellow dressed was circumcised he wished the man had been closer he would have liked a better look at the mutilation why anyone would subject himself to anything so painful and ugly was beyond him the ioudaian himself would probably say it was at the command of his god that seemed to be the locals explanation for everything but why would a god want such a mark on his people it was a puzzlement aristeidas did strip off his tunic and walk out into the lake of asphalt as sostratos had he exclaimed in surprise at the way the water bore him up you can push yourself around with one finger he said you wont ever drown either no but you might turn into a salt fish if you stay in there too long sostratos answered the fierce sun had quickly dried the water on his arms and legs but a crust of salt crystals remained his skin itched far more than it would have after bathing in the inner sea when he scratched the salt stung he said well have to rinse off with fresh water when we get back to the inn no doubt youre right aristeidas said then what then we go back to jerusalem sostratos said and from there we go back to sidon and from there he and aristeidas both said the same word at the same time rhodes for the first time in his travels menedemos found himself bored hed done everything hed set out to do in sidon most summers that would mean the aphrodite could go on to some other port and give him something new to do not here though not now he couldnt very well leave before sostratos and his escorts got back and he couldnt do what he would have done in most ports to hold off boredom hed given his cousin his oath not to go looking for a love affair with some other mans wife this sailing season hed known nothing but dismay when emashtart came looking for a love affair with him a visit to a brothel proved not to be the answer he was looking for it wasnt that he didnt have a good time he did but hed spent some silver and hed spent some time and he had nothing but the memory to show for them considering how often hed done the same thing and in how many cities all around the inner sea he doubted whether in a few years or even in a few daysthat memory would mean much to him it was harder to amuse himself in sidon than it would have been in a polis full of hellenes the phoenician town boasted no theater he couldnt even go to the market square to pass the time as he would have in a polis among hellenes everyone went to the agora people met and gossiped and hashed out things of more consequence than mere gossip he couldnt imagine a hellenic town without its agora things werent the same in sidon hed seen that shortly after arriving here the market square among phoenicians was a place of business nothing more even if it hadnt been his ignorance of aramaic would have shut him out of city life here and of course he couldnt exercise in the gymnasion for sidon had no more gymnasion than theater sostratos had been right about that a gymnasion was a place to exercise nakedand how else would a man exercise but phoenicians didnt go naked as far as menedemos could tell they didnt exercise either not for the sake of having bodies worth admiring the ones who did physical labor seemed fit enough more prosperous more sedentary men ran to fat menedemos supposed they would have been even less attractive if they hadnt covered themselves from neck to ankles eventually menedemos found the taverns where antigonos macedonians and hellenes drank there at least he could speakand as important hearhis own language that did help but only so much theyre funny people he said to diokles one morning back at the aphrodite i never realized how funny they were till i spent so much time listening to them talk what soldiers the oarmaster snorted i couldve told you that skipper i suppose its just shoptalk when one of them explains how to twist the sword after youve thrust it into somebodys belly so you make sure the wound kills menedemos said killing the enemy is part of your job but when they start going on about how best to torture a prisoner so he tells you where his silver is he shivered in spite of the building heat thats part of their job too diokles observed half the time their pay is in arrears only reason they get paid at all sometimes is that theyd desert if they didnt and their officers know it i understand that menedemos said it was just the way they talked about it that gave me the horrors they might have been potters talking about the best way to join handles to the body of a cup theyre bastards diokles said flatly whod want to be a soldier to begin with if he wasnt a bastard he wasnt wrong he was seldom wrong he had good sense and was far from stupid nevertheless menedemos thought by the gods i miss sostratos he couldnt talk things over with diokles the way he could with his cousin even though the soldiers made him wish they were barbarians not that macedonians didnt come close he kept going back to the taverns they frequented the chance to speak greek was too tempting to let him stay away once he happened to walk in right behind antigonos quartermaster oh hail rhodian andronikos said coolly did you ever unload that ridiculously overpriced olive oil of yours yes by zeus menedemos answered with a savage grin almost all of it as a matter of fact and i got a better price than you were willing to pay some people do care about what they eat andronikos only sneered my job is to keep the soldiers well fed for as little silver as i can i have to do both parts of it you certainly do it for as little silver as you can o marvelous one menedemos replied but if you kept the men well fed they wouldnt need to buy from me would they ive sold all my hams and smoked eels too a soldier said ham smoked eels we wouldnt see those from andronikos not if we waited the next hundred years the quartermaster was unmoved no you wouldnt he said theyre needless luxuries if a soldier wants them he can spend his own money to get them barley and salt fish and oil are what he needs to stay in fighting trim no wonder were losing soldiers to desertion somebody said probably an officer by his educated attic accent if we give them only what they need and ptolemaios gives them what they want which would they rather have which would any man with an obolos weight of brains in his head rather have a soldier who has to have luxuries to fight isnt a soldier worth keeping andronikos insisted what soldier doesnt want a little comfort now and then the other officer returned antigonos doesnt care to see his money thrown away the quartermaster said from everything menedemos had heard that was true antigonos doesnt care to see his men tempted to desertion either the other officer answered a soldier whos unhappy isnt a soldier wholl fight well menedemos finished his wine and waved to the man behind the bar for another cup another soldier this one plainly a macedonian by his speech started laying into andronikos and then another and then another before long half the men in the tavern were shouting at the quartermaster andronikos got angrier and angrier you people dont know what youre talking about he shouted his pinched features turned red we know we get the leavings that nobody else would want to eat a soldier said how much money do you salt away buying us cheap garbage and sending out receipts that say we eat better than we really do not a hemiobolos by zeus thats a lie andronikos said furies take me if it is the soldier answered who ever heard of a quartermaster who didnt feather his own nest every chance he got how much silver would andronikos cough up if we held him upside down and shook him somebody else said plenty i bet dont you try that antigonos quartermaster said shrilly dont you dare try that if you fool with me ill have you crucified upside down by the gods do you think i wont do you think i cant youd better not think anything like that or its the worst mistake youll ever make in all your days menedemos raised his cup to his mouth he quickly drained it then he slid off his stool and slipped out of the wineshop he knew a brewing fight when he saw one sostratos might consider him imperfectly civilized but at least hed never made tavern brawling one of his favorite amusements as so many sailors from the aphrodite did he hadnt got ten paces from the door before a crescendo of shouts the thuds of breaking furniture and the higher crashes of shattering pottery announced the start of the brawl whistling gleefully at his narrow escape he strolled back to the harbor and the merchant galley he did hope andronikos got everything that was coming to him and a little more besides this time sostratos and his traveling companions approached jerusalem from the south are we going back to ithrans inn young sir moskhion asked id intended to stay there for a day or two yes sostratos answered having an innkeeper who speaks some greek is very handy for me and especially for you men since you havent learned any aramaic who hasnt moskhion said and let loose with a guttural obscenity that sounded much fouler than anything a man might say in greek sostratos winced if thats all you can say in the local language youd do better to keep your mouth shut he said moskhion guffawed at the effect hed had i can ask for bread i can ask for wine i can ask for a woman aristeidas said past that what more do i need his attitude was practical if limited hed learned a few phrases that came in handy and didnt worry about anything more how about you teleutas sostratos asked have you picked up any aramaic at all not me im not going to sound like im choking to death teleutas said then he asked a question of his own when we get back to old ithrans inn you going to try laying zilpah again think youll get it in this time sostratos tried to stand on his dignity saying i dont know what youre talking about he hoped he wasnt turning red or if he was that his beard would hide his flush how had the sailors known teleutas laugh was so raucous so lewd as to make moskhions aramaic obscenity seem clean beside it no offense but sure you dont you think we didnt see you mooning over her come on i think youll do it this time too she likes you plenty you bet sometimes theyre shy thats all youve just got to push a littleand then youll push all you want he rocked his hips forward and back moskhion and aristeidas solemnly dipped their heads sostratos wondered if that meant his chances were pretty good or simply that all three sailors were misreading the signs the same way im going to find out he thought i have to find out the game seemed worth the risk all of a sudden he understood menedemos much better than hed ever wanted to how can i rail at him when i know why he does it he wondered unhappily he did his best to tell himself that unlike his cousin he wasnt risking anything or anyone by trying to learn whether zilpah would go to bed with him but also unlike menedemos hed been to the lykeion hed learned how to root out selfdeception he knew perfectly well that he was telling himself lies they were soothing lies pleasant lies but lies nonetheless what if for instance zilpah had gone to ithran and told him sostratos had tried to seduce her what would the innkeeper do when the rhodian showed up at his door again wouldnt he be likely to try to smash in sostratos skull with a jar of wine or perhaps to stab him or spear him with whatever weapons he kept around the inn suppose things were reversed suppose ithran in rhodes had paid undue attention to sostratos wife assuming i had a wife sostratos thought what would i have done if he fell into my hands after that something he would remember to the end of his days whether that was near at hand or far away and yet knowing what ithran might do on setting eyes on him sostratos led the sailors from the aphrodite back toward the inn theyd quitted only a few days before this is madness he told himself picking his way through the narrow winding rocky streets of jerusalem every so often he had to spend a few tiny silver coins on a passerby to get steered in the right direction no one grabbed him by the front of the tunic and exclaimed dont go back there you must be the womanmad ionian ithran swore hed kill sostratos chose to take that as a good sign though he recognized he might be deceiving himself again this is the street aristeidas said when they turned on to it we just passed the brotheland theres ithrans inn up ahead so it is sostratos said in a hollow voice now that he was here his heart pounded and his bowels felt loose he was sure hed made a dreadful mistake in returning he started to say they ought to go somewhere else after all too late for thatithran himself came out the front door of the inn with a basket full of rubbish which he dumped in the street not far from the entrance he started to go back inside but then he caught sight of the four rhodians heading his way sostratos tensed he wondered if he should reach for menedemos bow not that he could have strung it let alone shot before ithran charged but then the innkeeper waved hail friends he called in his bad greek you does good by lake of asphalt pretty well thanks sostratos answered breathing a silent sigh of relief whatever else had happened zilpah hadnt said anything you to stay a few day ithran asked hopefully i have my old rooms back sostratos realized he was trying to say you have your old rooms back thank you he said and nodded as people did in this part of the world switching from greek to aramaic he added i thank you very much indeed my master i am your slave ithran said also in aramaic name any boon and it shall be yours aramaic was made for flowery promises no one would or intended to keep i wonder what would happen if i said give me your wife to keep my bed warm till i go back to sidon sostratos thought and then no i dont wonder that would show the differences between polite promises and real ones and show it in a hurry while such musings filled the rhodians head ithran turned and shouted into the inn zilpah pour wine the ionians have returned from the lake of asphalt have they the ioudaian womans voice a mellow contralto floated out into the street they are very welcome then yes ithran nodded vigorously he returned to greek so all the men from the aphrodite could understand you is all very welcome go in drink wine slave will see to your beasts teleutas aristeidas and moskhion looked eager to do just what hed said in a dry voice sostratos told the sailors get the goods off the donkey before we start drinking weve come a long way to get what weve got if we let somebody steal it we might as well have stayed in rhodes a little sulkily the men obeyed it was only a few minutes before they did sit down in the taproom to drink the wine zilpah had poured the room was dark and shadowed light sneaking in only through the doorway and a couple of narrow windows that gloom and the inns thick walls of mud brick left the taproom much cooler than the bakeoven air outside is hekataios still here sostratos asked zilpah when she refilled his cup she shook her head no he left the day after you did bound for his home in egypt her shrug was dismissive he is a clever man but not so clever as he thinks he is i think you are right sostratos said he wondered if she would say the same thing about him after he left for sidon he hoped not anyhow because the sailors from the akatos had learned so little aramaic he could speak to her as freely as if they werent there he took advantage of that adding i think you are beautiful i think you should not say these things zilpah answered quietly out in the courtyard ithran started hammering away at somethingperhaps at a door for one of the rooms a burst of guttural curses in aramaic proclaimed that he might have hammered his own thumb too aristeidas gulped down his wine what do you say we pay a visit to the girls down the street he said in greek moskhion and teleutas both dipped their heads all three men hurried out of the inn where are they going zilpah asked to the brothel sostratos said ithran kept pounding in the courtyard as long as he did that no one could have any doubts of where he was sostratos went on i was sorry to go i am glad to be back and soon you will go again zilpah said sostratos shrugged and nodded the gesture was almost starting to feel natural to him yes that is so i wish it were different but it is so he reached out and touched her hand just for a moment we have little time should we not use it she turned away from him you should not say such things to me you make me think things i am not supposed to think do you think that i think you are beautiful do you think that i think you are sweet sostratos said do you think that i want to love you you should think that because it is true still not looking at him zilpah spoke in a very small voice these are things i should not hear from you i have never heard these things before she laughed i have heard from men who want to sleep with me what innkeepers wife has not but you you mean what you say you are not telling lies to get me to lie down with you yes i mean them no i am not lying sostratos said people who mean these things should not say them zilpah insisted i have never heard things like these from someone who means them never sostratos raised an eyebrow you spoke of this before these are things your husbandwho kept on hammering out in the courtyardshould say ithran is a good man zilpah said as if the rhodian had denied it sostratos said nothing at all he let her words hang in the air let her listen to them again and again in her own mind she brought her hands up to her face her shoulders shook sostratos knew a moment of raw fear if she started crying loud enough for ithran to notice what would the ioudaian do to him he didnt know not in detail whatever it was though it wasnt likely to be pretty i think zilpah said i think you had better go to your room now i would rather sit here and drink wine and talk with you and look at you so i can see how beautiful you are sostratos said the ioudaian woman swung back toward him her black eyes flashed i said i think you had better go to your room she snapped do you understand me when i tell you something i understand what you say i do not understand why you say it sostratos replied once again a why question seemed allimportant here though it got no answer go zilpah said and he could hardly tell her no not when this was her inn this was her city this was her countryand that was her husband out there in the courtyard he gulped his wine and hurried out of the taproom ithran waved to him as he hurried back toward his room he waved back the innkeeper might have suspected something if he hadnt part of him felt ashamed at treating the ioudaian in a friendly way when he wanted to make love to the mans wife the rest of him though when he saw a goodsized stone in the courtyard that other part of him wanted to pick it up and bash in ithrans head still seething he went into his room and closed the door behind him it didnt drown out the noise of ithrans hammering he paced back and forth in the cramped little chamber feeling trapped what could he do in here nothing except lie down and go to sleep which he didnt want to do or pace and brood he didnt want to do that either but did it even so after what seemed forever the hammering stopped sostratos kept right on pacing he wished hed gone to the brothel with the sailors but if he went there now theyd know hed failed with zilpah he didnt feel like humiliating himself right this minute later would do someone tapped at the door when sostratos noticed the tapping he had the feeling it had been going on for some little while he wondered what the sailors were doing back from the brothel so soon but when he opened the door no sated hellenes stood there instead it was zilpah oh sostratos said foolishly you yes me she ducked inside past sostratos who stood frozen as if seeing a gorgon had turned him to stone are you daft she said shut the door quick now oh he said again yes he did as she said he found he could move after all if only jerkily ithran is gone for a while the slave is gone for a while and so zilpah didnt go on for a moment in the gloom inside the little chamber her eyes were enormous with a gesture that seemed more angry than anything else she threw off her mantling robe and then the shift she wore under it tell me you love me she said tell me you think im beautiful make me believe you at least for a little while her laugh was harsh and rough as dry branches breaking it shouldnt be hard no one else is going to tell me anything like that no sostratos said zilpah shook her head he sighed you spoke of that before it is too bad for someone misses a perfect chance you are very beautiful and i will love you as best i know how talk to me too she said tell me these things i need to hear them most women wanted sostratos to keep quiet while he was making love to them talk before or after might be all right during never before had anyone asked him to talk during he only wished he could do it in greek in aramaic he couldnt say a tenth part of what he wanted to tell her but he did his best in between kisses and caresses he assured her that she was the loveliest and the sweetest woman hed ever met and that anyone whod missed the chance to tell her the same thing was surely an ass an idiot a blockhead while he said it he believed it that his tongue teased her earlobe the side of her neck the dark tips of her breasts that his fingers stroked between her legs and that she arched her back and breathed hard while they didthat might have had something to do with his belief she hissed when he went into her hed never known a sound like that from a woman she took her pleasure almost at once and twisted her head so that his pillow muffled most of her moan of joy he kept on and kept on and she heated again and the second time she gasped and wailed she forgot all about trying to keep quiet he might have warned her but his own ecstasy burst over him then irresistible as an avalanche i love you he said again as soon as pleasure didnt quite blind him zilpah started to cry she pushed him away from her i have sinned she said i have sinned and i am a fool she dressed as fast as she could as she did she went on you will leave tomorrow if you dont leave tomorrow i will tell ithran what we have done i have sinned oh how i have sinned i dont understand sostratos said what do you need to understand zilpah said i was angry at my husband for not speaking sweetly to me and i made a mistake i sinned so the one god will punish me for it sostratos had heard ioudaioi talk of sin before it was something like religious pollution among hellenes but stronger he got the feeling zilpah thought her badtempered god was angry at her i will do as you say he told her with a sigh you had better she hurried out the door she didnt slam it but only he judged so she wouldnt make a scene he sighed again hed had her and pleased her and she still wasnt happy am i he wondered part of him was anyhow the rest he wasnt at all sure about the rest i know people say phoenicians burn their babies when things are going badly for them menedemos told a soldier with whom he was drinking wine but is that really true do they really offer them to their gods that way yea verily the mercenary answered his name was apollodoros he came from paphos on cyprus and used the oldfashioned island dialect in sooth rhodian they do nothing less reckoning it an act of devotion any whod refuse or hide his babesd be torn in pieces did word ofs iniquity seep forth madness menedemos muttered aye belike apollodoros agreed but then could we look for civilized behavior mongst the barbarians theyd be barbarians no more but rather hellenes i suppose so by then menedemos had drunk enough to make his wits a little fuzzy or maybe more than a little when my cousin gets back from ioudaia i wont be sorry to say farewell to this place and youll hie you homeward the paphian said menedemos dipped his head apollodoros waved to the phoenician tavernkeeper for a refill the fellow nodded and waved back to show hed understood then came over with a jar of wine the mercenary turned back to menedemos have you thought of staying here instead only in my nightmares menedemos answered most of those these days revolved around emashtart he feared the innkeepers wife would haunt his nights for years to come screeching binein binein hed never known a woman with whom the prospect of physical congress seemed less appealing i meant not as a trader o best one not as a merchant apollodoros said but as a soldier a warrior a fighting man for antigonos certes for antigonos the mercenary answered a great man the greatest of this sorry age for whom would you liefer swing a sword id gladly fight for rhodes as any man with ballocks under his prong would fight for his polis menedemos said but i never thought to hire myself out that would do till a bigger understatement came along ah my dear theres no life like unto it apollodoros said food and shelter when not on campaignand pay too mindand all those chances for loot when the drum beats and you fare forth to war no thanks menedemos said im a peaceable sort i dont want any trouble with anybody and i dont get into fights for the fun of it by my troth the more fool you apollodoros exclaimed how better to show the world you make a better man than your foe by taking home silver he should have kept menedemos replied by knowing youve made him into a fool a fool the mercenary gestured scornfully make him into a slave or a corpse an you seek silver take it by selling the wretch youve beaten this life suits you menedemos said thats plain i couldnt live as you do though its not what i want to do a pity you could make a soldier i see youre strong and quick those count for more than size nor never let any wight say otherwise whether they do or not i dont want to carry a spear and a sword and a shield menedemos said here drink you more wine apollodoros said and waved to the taverner to fill menedemos cup again even though it was still a quarter full menedemos had already drunk enough to grow a little muzzy yes but his wits still worked hes trying to get me very drunk very drunk indeed he thought why is he trying to do that the grinning tapman came up with the winejar wait menedemos said and put a hand over the mouth of his cup he turned to the mercenary do you think you can get me blind drunk and turn me into a soldier before i come to and figure out whats happened to me apollodoros affected shock and dismay in the course of many many dickers menedemos had often seen it better done wherefore should i essay so wicked a deed as that most noble one the fellow asked voice dripping innocence i dont know why but i can make some guesses menedemos answered how big a bonus do you get for each new recruit you bring in he kept a close eye on the soldier from paphos sure enough apollodoros flinched though he said i know not what you mean my friend for in sooth i thought but to make symposiasts of us both that we might revel the whole day through id not bethought me to come upon so fine a boon companion in such a low dive as this that sounds very pretty menedemos said but i dont believe a word of it he drained his cup then set it back on the table i dont want any more wine he told the taverner in greek then for good measure he trotted out two words of aramaic wine no sostratos would be proud of me he thought as he got up to go wait friend apollodoros set a hand on his arm by my troth you do mistake me and in the mistaking do me wrong i dont want to wait for anything menedemos said farewell but when menedemos started to leave apollodoros hung on tight stay the mercenary urged stay and drink he didnt sound so friendly any more let go of me menedemos said the soldier still clung to him he used a wrestling move to try to twist free apollodoros made the most obvious counter menedemos had thought he wouldapollodoros had little in the way of subtlety in him another twist a sudden jerk a grab o–∫ apollodoros yowled as his wrist bent back and back menedemos needed only a very little more pressure to break it and they both knew as much apollodoros spoke very fast you do but misperceive my intentions friend and i think i perceive them just fine thanks menedemos bent the mercenarys wrist a tiny bit more something in there gave under his grip not a bone but a tendon or something of the sort apollodoros gasped and went fishbelly pale menedemos said i can use a knife too if you come after me youll be very very sorry do you believe me eh yet more pressure yes apollodoros whispered furies take you yes good menedemos let go he didnt turn his back on the soldier but apollodoros only sank down onto a stool cradling the injured wrist farewell menedemos said again and left the tavern this place didnt explode in a brawl behind him he looked back over his shoulder after he walked out to make sure apollodoros hadnt changed his mind and decided to come after him and that the paphian didnt have any friends in the place who might want to do the job for him no one emerged from the wineshop menedemos grinned my bet is apollodoros hasnt got any friends he thought around the corner from the tavern he passed a wineshop of a different sort one that sold wine by the amphora rather than by the cup remembering the fine wine zakerbaal the cloth merchant had served him he stuck his head into the place and called does anybody here speak greek the proprietor was a man of about his fathers age with a bushy white beard even bushier black eyebrows and an enormous hooked nose speak little bit he said and held his thumb and forefinger close together to show how little that was for what menedemos had in mind the man didnt need to know much of his language he asked have you got wine from byblosa here good wine from byblos from byblos wine the phoenician seemed to want to make sure hed heard correctly menedemos dipped his head then remembering he was in foreign parts he nodded instead the phoenician smiled at him wine from byblos yes i having you he didnt seem able to remember how to say taste or try instead he mimed drinking from a cup yes thank you menedemos nodded again good i give i mattan son of mago the wine merchant said menedemos gave his name and that of his father he watched as mattan opened an amphora and noted its shape each city had its own distinctive style of jar some round others elongated when the phoenician handed him the cup he sniffed sure enough the wine had the rich floral bouquet that had struck him at zakerbaals home he drank as before the wines flavor wasnt quite so fine as its aroma but it wasnt bad either he asked how much for an amphora when mattan said six shekelssigloi you say menedemos had to fight to keep his jaw from dropping twelve rhodian drakhmai the jar for a wine of that quality was a bargain even without haggling menedemos didnt intend to let mattan know that was what he thought he put on the most severe expression he could and said ill give you three and a half mattan said something pungent in aramaic menedemos bowed to him that made the phoenician laugh they haggled for a while as much for the sake of the game as because either of them was very worried about the final price at last they settled on five sigloi the jar after they clasped hands to seal the bargain mattan son of mago said you not tell how much of jars you want how many have you got menedemos asked i look mattan counted the amphorai of byblian resting in their places on the wooden shelves that lined the walls of his shop then he went into a back room behind the counter when he came out he said fortysix to make sure he had the number right he opened and closed his hands four times and showed one open hand and the upthrust index finger of the other have you got a counting board menedemos asked he had to eke out the question with gestures before mattan nodded and took it out from under the counter menedemos flicked pebbles back and forth in the grooves after a little while he looked up at the phoenician and said i owe you two hundred thirty sigloi then mattan son of mago had watched as he worked out the answer the phoenician nodded yes that right he said good then menedemos said ill bring you the money and ill bring sailors from my ship to take away the wine is good i here mattan said had the full crew been aboard the aphrodite they could have done the job in one trip with so many of them off roistering in sidon it took three by the time they finished hauling the heavy amphorai to the merchant galley the men were sweaty and exhausted a couple of the ones who could swim jumped naked off the ship into the water of the harbor to cool down menedemos gave all the sailors whod hauled wine jars an extra days paythat wasnt part of their regular work smart skipper diokles said approvingly theyll like you better for it they earned it menedemos replied they worked like slaves there weve got a good cargo for the trip home though the keleustes said that fancy silk you found the crimson dye now this good wine were only missing one thing menedemos said diokles frowned whats that with all weve picked up here i cant think of anything menedemos answered in one word sostratos sostratos peered back at jerusalem from the ridge to the north from which hed first got a good look at the chief town of the ioudaioi he sighed next to him teleutas laughed was she as good in bed as all that he asked aristeidas and moskhion both chuckled they also crowded closer to hear sostratos reply i dont know he said after a bit of thought he didnt see how he could keep quiet not when the sailors already knew so much more than he might have wished i really dont know but its different when youre not buying it isnt it aristeidas dipped his head its sweetest when they give it to you for love menedemos had always felt that way which was why he liked to chase other mens wives instead ofor in addition togoing to brothels now after bedding zilpah sostratos understood he sighed again he wouldnt forget her but he feared she would spend the rest of her days trying to forget him that wasnt what hed had in mind but it was how things seemed to have worked out teleutas laughed again a coarse altogether masculine laugh you ask me its just fine whenever you manage to stick it in there the other two sailors laughed too moskhion dipped his head in agreement in one sense sostratos supposed teleutas had a point the pleasure of the act itself wasnt much different for a man regardless of whether he bedded a whore or his own wife or someone elses but what it meant what he felt about himself and his partner afterwardsthose could and indeed almost had to vary widely had menedemos been there sostratos would have taken the argument further with teleutas he let it drop the less he had to talk to the sailor the better he liked it he said lets keep moving thats all the faster we go the sooner well get back to sidon and the aphrodite aristeidas moskhion and teleutas all murmured approvingly at that moskhion said by the gods itll be nice to speak greek again with more people than just us thats right aristeidas dipped his head by now were all sick of listening to each other anyhow he glanced over at sostratos then hastily added uh meaning no offense young sir dont worry about it sostratos said i know youre sick of me he didnt mention the obvious corollary aristeidas did it for him youre sick of us too eh once again sostratos faced the dilemma of choosing between an unpalatable truth and an obvious lie in the end he chose neither with a wry smile he asked how on earth could you dream of such a thing that made the sailors laugh which was better than offending them or treating them like fools they tramped on after a while teleutas said i think we ought to look to our weapons weve come this far without any trouble itd be a shame if we got robbed when we were so close to getting back to sidon sostratos wanted to tell him he was worrying over nothing he wanted to but knew he couldnt what he did say regretfully was thats a good idea hed never let menedemos bow get far from him while he was on the road now he took it out of its case and strung it the case itself which also held his arrows he wore at his left side slung over his right shoulder with a leather strap you look like a skythian nomad aristeidas said the case looks like a skythian nomads sostratos said tossing his head for we use the same style they doi suppose we borrowed it from them but tell me my dear when have you ever imagined a skythian nomad aboard a plodding mule that made the sailors laugh again sostratos a thoroughly indifferent rider even on a mule thought it was pretty funny too toward noon half a dozen ioudaioi came down the road toward the hellenes the strangers were all young men all on the ragged side and all armed with spears or swords they gave sostratos and his companions long thoughtful looks as the two parties drew near the rhodians looked back not in a way suggesting they wanted a fight but as if to say they could put up a good one if they had to both little bands got halfway off the road as they edged past each other neither seemed to want to give the other any excuse for starting trouble peace be unto you sostratos called to the ioudaioi in aramaic and to you also peace a man from the other band replied one of the other ioudaioi muttered something else something sostratos was even gladder to hear more trouble than theyre worth a couple of the young mans friends nodded despite that sostratos looked back over his shoulder several times to make sure the ioudaioi werent turning around to come after his companions and him once he saw a ioudaian looking back over his shoulder at him and the sailors we made them respect us he told the other rhodians a good thing too moskhion said for i always respect bastards who outnumber meyoud best believe i do if we run into six bandits or eight or even ten were probably fine sostratos said because a little band like that can see we have teeth they might beat us but wed cost them half their men one of those fellows called us more trouble than were worth thats how most bands would feel about us what about a band with forty or fifty men in it though aristeidas asked worriedly a bandit troop that big could roll right over us and hardly even know we were there the thing is there arent very many bandit troops with forty or fifty men in them teleutas spoke before sostratos could answer a troop like that is more like an army than your usual pack of robbers it needs a village of its own pretty much on account of keeping that many men fed isnt easy and its the big bands that soldiers move against too most bandits turn back into farmers when soldiers come sniffing after em a big troop cant do that or not easily anyhowtoo many people know who they are and where they roost it either splits up into a bunch of little bands or else it stands and fights aristeidas thought it over then dipped his head makes sense he said it did indeed make sense it made so much sense sostratos sent teleutas a very thoughtful look how had the sailor acquired such intimate knowledge of the way robber bands worked had he been part of one or more than one himself that wouldnt have surprised sostratos not a bit there were technical treatises on things like cookery and how to build catapults but hed never heard of never imagined a technical treatise on how to become a successful bandit even if such a monster of a book existed he didnt think teleutas could read moskhion must have been thinking along with him i got out of sponge diving because pulling an oar was a better job he said what did you get out of to turn sailor teleutas oh this and that teleutas answered and gave no details the hellenes took a more westerly route up to sidon than they had on their way down to jerusalem they spent the night in a village called gamzo the place was so small it didnt even have an inn having got permission from the locals sostratos built a fire in the middle of the market square he bought bread and oil and wine and feeling extravagant a duck he and the other men from the aphrodite roasted the meat over the fire and feasted childrenand more than a few adultscame out of their houses to stare at the rhodians as elsewhere in ioudaia sostratos wondered if these people had ever seen a hellene before he got to his feet bowed in all directions and spoke in aramaic peace be unto you all even though hed already dickered with them for food some of them seemed surprised he spoke their language by their expressions some seemed surprised he spoke any human language but three or four men answered and to you also peace that was the right response even though it was it didnt feel hearty enough to satisfy sostratos he bowed again this time he said may your one god bless gamzo and all its people that did the trick broad smiles gleamed on the faces of the ioudaioi all the men bowed to sostratos may the one god bless you as well stranger and your friends a graybeard said the rest of the villagers nodded stand up sostratos hissed in greek to the other rhodians bow to them be friendly one after another the sailors did aristeidas even proved able to say peace be unto you in aramaic that made the people of gamzo smile moskhion refrained from trotting out his frightful aramaic obscenity that made sostratos smile another graybearded man this one wearing a robe of fine wool said you are ionians not so sostratos remembered to nod the ioudaian said we have heard evil things of ionians but you seem to be good enough men even if you are foreigners may the one god bless you and keep you may he lift up his countenance unto you and give you peace thank you sostratos said and bowed once more a little more slowly than they should have the sailors bowed again too sostratos added and we thank you for your generous hospitality you are welcome in gamzo the ioudaianplainly a village leader declared he strode up clasped sostratos hand and kissed him on both cheeks then he did the same with the rest of the rhodians the men in the crowd came up after him they greeted sostratos and his companions the same way even the women drew near though the hellenes got no handclasps or kisses from them remembering the kisses hed had from zilpah in jerusalem sostratos sighed somehow hed pleased her and made her desperately unhappy all at the same time deciding the rhodians were safe enough the folk of gamzo withdrew back into their homes even so sostratos said well divide the night into four watches everybody will take one you never know the sailors didnt argue with him hed half expected that they or at least teleutas would on the grounds that one sentry couldnt keep the locals from doing whatever they were going to do maybe theyre starting to take me seriously sostratos thought with no small pride when morning came teleutas was all for an early departure sostratos pride only grew even the sometimes difficult sailor was acting responsible sostratos wondered if teleutas was following his example it was about the third hour of the day when sostratos noticed teleutas was wearing a golden bracelet he didnt recall seeing before where did you get that he asked the sailor grinned a sly grin back in that miserable little dump where we stayed last night that was likely to mean only one thing sostratos clapped a hand to his forehead papai you stole it so much for responsibility nothing to get upset about teleutas said soothingly well never see that place again in all our days they made us guestfriends and thats how you paid them back sostratos said teleutas only shrugged the ritual duties of guestfriends plainly meant nothing to him sostratos tried another tack what if all the men in gamzo come after us and want to cut our livers out teleutas looked back toward the south and shrugged again ive been watching no sign of a dust cloud or anything like that were far enough ahead of em by now that they cant catch us by hermes the fool i lifted it from probably still hasnt figured out its gone missing no wonder you swear by the god of thieves sostratos said teleutas grinned again singularly unrepentant sostratos might have said a good deal more but decided the road in a foreign land was no place to do it he also decided that if the men of gamzo came after the bracelet and teleutas he would hand them the ornament and the sailor without a qualm he kept that to himself he didnt know how aristeidas and moskhion would react and he didnt want to risk destroying his ability to lead unless he had to but he vowed he would talk with menedemos about leaving teleutas behind when he got back to sidon a man who would steal from barbarians he was unlikely to see again might not try stealing from his own shipmates then again he might for the rest of the day sostratos kept looking back over his shoulder he saw no sign of the villagers in a way that relieved him in another way it disappointed him he might have used them as an excuse to be rid of teleutas farmers tended vineyards and olive groves shepherds and goatherds followed their flocks through the hills hawks circled overhead looking for the mice and other small animals frightened out of cover when the flocks went by sostratos saw one swoop down and rise with something struggling in its talons the struggle didnt last long as the sun sank toward the inner sea another band of young ioudaioi came toward the rhodians there were eight of them sostratos saw they were all armed he didnt like the way their heads came up when they spotted his comrades and him it put him in mind of a pack of dogs spotting a sick sheep they hoped to be able to pull down lets get off the road and let them go by he said looktheres a clump of boulders where we can make a stand if we have to he hoped the sailors would laugh at him and tell him he was starting at shadows instead they all dipped their heads teleutas said good idea they look like a nasty bunch and ill be glad to see their backs if he thought the ioudaioi looked dangerous they were only too likely to mean trouble by the time they came up to the hellenes sostratos and the other men from the aphrodite had already taken cover among the boulders by the side of the road the sailors and sostratos got their helmets from the pack donkey and jammed them down onto their heads the ioudaioi kept on toward the south some of them trailing the butts of their spears in the dirt they did not seem to own any body armor one of them waved to the hellenes as he went past peace be unto you he called a couple of his pals laughed sostratos didnt like the sound of that baying mocking laughter he didnt answer maybe theyll decide were a tough nut to crack and theyll go on by moskhion said thats what you said they do most of the time maybe i hope so sostratos watched the young men head on down the track in the direction of gamzo all the same though i dont think we ought to leave this place for a while yet they may try doubling back to catch us out in the open he thought about the hawk and about the little animal that had writhedfor a bitin its claws aristeidas peered out from a southfacing crevice between two goodsized stones after perhaps a quarter of an hour had passed he stiffened here they come oh a pestilence sostratos exclaimed hed been cautious yes but he hadnt really believed the ioudaioi would come back and try to rob his companions and him but when he peered south himself he saw that aristeidas was right the ioudaioi were loping across the fields toward the boulders among which the rhodians sheltered shoot the godsdetested catamites moskhion said sostratos put an arrow in the bow and drew a bead on the closest ioudaian the fellow wasnt quite in range yet but he would be soon sostratos drew the arrow back to his breast and then in persian fashion back to his ear the wouldbe robber ran straight at himprobably hadnt seen him there among the rocks well too bad for him sostratos thought and let fly the bowstring lashed his wrist real archers wore leather guards sostratos knew as much but didnt have one but he felt very much like a real archer a moment later for his arrow caught the ioudaian square in the chest the man ran on for another couple of paces clawing at the shaft then his legs might suddenly have gone from bone and flesh to wet clay they gave way beneath him he crumpled to the ground the ioudaioi shouted in surprise and dismay euge well shot the rhodians were shouting too give em another one ill try sostratos nocked a second arrow the onrushing foes werent trying to dodge the only way they could have given him easier marks would have been by standing still he drew the bow and loosed in one smooth motion a second ioudaian toppled this one with an arrow through the thigh he let out a horrible scream of pain sostratos didnt think that wound would be mortal but it would take the man out of the fight he couldnt ask for anything better not now he couldnt knock em all down teleutas said ill do my best sostratos answered already hed cut the odds against his side from twotoone to threetotwo but the ioudaioi he hadnt shot were getting dreadfully close he let fly at another man a shot he should have made in his sleepand missed now he scrabbled for an arrow with desperate haste hed have time for only one more shot before the fighting went handtohand he loosed again at the same bandit and hit him just above the bridge of the nose the ioudaian fell dead before he hit the ground no one cheered this time the surviving ioudaioi were scrambling toward the rhodians a couple of them flung rocks to make sostratos and his comrades keep their heads down curses upon them one of the robbers said already theyve cost us too much we have to pay them back another ioudaian said come on be brave they couldnt know that sostratos understood aramaic he hadnt hailed them when they went by before it didnt matter not yet but it might a rock banged off a boulder just above his head then hit him in the back on the rebound he yelped a ioudaian with a sword came toward him the fellows face wore a furious snarl sostratos had only an eating knife on his belt he stooped and picked up the rock the robber had flung at him he hurled it back with all his strength it caught the ioudaian on the shoulder he howled out an obscenity sostratos had to fight to keep from giggling like an idiotthe curse was the same as the one moskhion had brought out on the road a few days earlier the rhodian grabbed another rock and threw it it thudded into the robbers ribs with that the ioudaian decided hed had enough he turned around and ran away one hand clutched to his chest sostratos hoped the rock had broken something he whirled to help his comrades moskhion and teleutas were both fighting hard sostratos didnt see aristeidas among the rocks and didnt have time to look for him eleleu eleleu he shouted dashing toward the pair of ioudaioi besetting teleutas either the war cry or the sound of running feet was enough to discourage them they ran like their companion i never thought wed pay so dear one of them cried as he fled we must have angered the one god his friend said robbing travelers whove caused you no harm might do that sostratos thought he and teleutas turned on the pair moskhion was holding off with his pike suddenly hellenes outnumbered ioudaioi the last robbers ran off too one of them also loudly wondered why their god had forsaken them sostratos understood him but knowing aramaic hadnt mattered at all in the fight as quickly as that it was over aristei sostratos began he heard the groan before he finished the sailors name most likely aristeidas had been moaning behind a boulder a few cubits away ever since he went down but in the heat of the fight sostratos hadnt paid any attention now with his own life not immediately in danger he gave more heed to things around him so did the other rhodians that doesnt sound good teleutas said he was bleeding from a cut on one arm and a scraped knee but didnt seem to notice his hurts no sostratos said and scrambled over the rocks till he came upon the aphrodites lookout his breath hissed from him in dismay oh by the gods he whispered aristeidas lay on his side still clutching with both hands the shaft of the spear that pierced his belly his blood ran down the smooth wood and pooled on the stony ground under him it also poured from his mouth and from his nose every breath brought another groan he was dying but not fast enough from behind sostratos teleutas said pull out the spear and thatll be the end of it either that or cut his throat one way or the other get it over with but sostratos gulped killing enemies from a distance with a bow was one thing ending the life of a shipmate the bright sharpeyed sailor whod been on the way toward turning into a friend was something else again he cant live teleutas said patiently if you havent got the stomach for it young sir move aside and ill take care of it its nothing i havent done before though teleutas was obviously right sostratos might have argued further but aristeidas through his pain managed to bring out a recognizable word please do you want to do it or shall i teleutas asked again i will sostratos said its my fault he came here ill tend to it despite his words he gulped again he knelt by aristeidas and tried to get the dying sailors hands away from the spear that had drunk his life but aristeidas wouldnt let go sostratos realized a death grip was something real not a clich–π of bad tragedy pull it out teleutas urged again he cant last more than another couple of minutes after you do no sostratos tossed his head he knelt beside aristeidas lifted the sailors chin with his left hand and cut his throat with the knife in his right some of the blood that spurted from the wound splashed his fingers it was hot and wet and sticky sostratos jerked his hand away with a moan of disgust aristeidas thrashed for a little while but not long his hands fell away from the spear he lay still sostratos turned away and threw up on the dirt no bloodguilt to you young sir moskhion said you were only putting him out of his torment he asked you to do it teleutas and i both heard him along with you thats right teleutas said thats just right you did what you had to do and you did it proper you put paid to three of the robbers too all by yourself and i guess you drove the fourth bastard away thats pretty good work for somebody whos not supposed to be much of a fighter sure is moskhion agreed youll never have trouble from me anymore sostratos hardly heard him he spat again and again trying to get the nasty taste out of his mouth he knew he would before too long whether he ever got the blackness out of his spiritthat was a different question he looked at aristeidas body then quickly looked away his guts wanted to heave up again but he wasnt done and he knew it we cant bring him back to sidon he said and we cant get enough wood for a proper pyre well have to bury him here cover him with stones you mean teleutas said i wouldnt want to try digging in this miserable rocky dirt especially without the proper tools he was right as he had been with putting aristeidas out of his pain before beginning the work sostratos cut off a lock of his hair and tossed it down on the sailors corpse as a token of mourning moskhion and teleutas did the same teleutas yanked the spear out of aristeidas belly and flung it far away then the three surviving rhodians piled boulders and smaller stones on the body covering it well enough to keep dogs and foxes and carrion birds from feasting on it by the time they finished their hands were battered and scraped and bloody sostratos hardly noticed let alone cared he stood by the makeshift grave and murmured sleep well aristeidas im sorry we leave you on foreign soil may your shade find peace moskhion let a couple of oboloi fall through the gaps between the stones toward the corpse theres the ferrymans fee to pay your way over the styx he said good sostratos looked west the sun stood only a little way above the horizon lets get moving and keep moving till it gets too dark to travel or till we find a campsite thats easy to defend and then tomorrow well push on toward sidon menedemos busied himself about the aphrodite fussing over where the jars of crimson dye hed bought from tenashtart were stowed he moved them farther aft then farther forward he knew they wouldnt affect the akatos trim very much but he fussed over them anyhow the amphorai of byblian wine posed a more interesting problem he had fewer of them but each was far heavier than a jar of dye and he couldnt properly test the merchant galleys trim till he got out onto the open sea any which way diokles said seems to me skipper youve got too much time on your hands youre looking around for things to do well what if i am menedemos said admitting what he could hardly deny i dont feel like going out and getting drunk today as long as im messing around here i may get something useful done or i may change things again tomorrow he thought if he did it wouldnt be the first time the oarmaster tactfully didnt point that out maybe diokles assumed menedemos could see it for himself he did say time kind of wears when you stay in one port all summer long it does doesnt it menedemos dipped his head i had the same thought not so long ago one of the sailors pointed toward the base of the pier look isnt that by the dog of egypt it is menedemos exclaimed theres sostratos and moskhion and teleutas with him papai wheres aristeidas though dont care for the look of that diokles said neither do i menedemos ran along the gangplank from the aphrodite to the quay then down the planks to his cousin and the sailors hail o best one wonderful to see you again at last after youve tramped the wilds of loudaia but where s aristeidas dead sostratos said shortly hed lost weight on his travels his skin stretched tight over the bones of his face he looked older harder than he had before setting out for engedi robbers day before yesterday spear in the belly i had to put him out of his pain he slashed a thumb across his throat oh by the gods menedemos said thinking no wonder he looks older he put an arm around his cousins shoulder thats a hard thing to do my dear none harder im very sorry aristeidas was a good man yes it would have been hard with anyone sostratos eye slid toward teleutas who fortunately didnt notice with the lookout it was doubly so but with the wound he had all i did was save him hours of pain see what would have happened if youd gone alone menedemos said who knows sostratos answered wearily maybe i would have taken a different road back to sidon traveling alone maybe i would have been earlier or later on the same road and not run into the bandits at all theres no way to tell not for certain why dont you just let that be he sounded older too as impatient with menedemos as a grown man might be with a child whod asked him to pull the moon down from the sky all right excuse me for breathing menedemos said stung how did the business go did you get to engedi have you got the balsam yes and some other things besides sostratos said beeswax embroidered cloth ill show you everything if youll let us get on down to the ship your inn will have a stable for the mule and donkey wont it im not staying there anymore menedemos said the innkeepers wife tried to seduce me so i came back to the ship he held up a hand to forestall sostratos the oath had nothing to do with that though ive kept it i wouldnt want her on a bet well find somewhere else to put the beasts then sostratos said it doesnt matter after everything ive been through the past couple of days i have trouble seeing what does matter aside from getting home safe to the crows with everything else menedemos started to ask him about profit he started to but then checked himself here for once he saw no point in making sostratos say something he would regret later that was all very well for a joke but not just after a good man died regardless of whether sostratos did aristeidas shade deserved more respect than that his cousin said when we got back here i was going to surprise you i was going to quote from the odyssey were you menedemos said what the bit where odysseus has slain the suitors and made love to penelope whos stayed home all those years and then he tells her of his adventures in about thirty lines yes thats the very passage i had in mind as a matter of fact sostratos answered i dont suppose i ought to be surprised you could guess i hope you shouldnt my dear menedemos said and i dont thank you for putting me in the womans role i wasnt idle here in sidon you know i never said you werenot that penelope was idle in odysseus palace sostratos scowled after what happened to poor aristeidas though i havent the heart for any sort of playfulness moskhion said skipper hes a host in himself your cousin is eight thieving ioudaioi set upon useight sostratos shot two of em dead before they could close he wounded a third and he went and drove off another one with rocks if he didnt show himself a second teukros there we all wouldve died amongst those boulders thats the truth teleutas agreed euge menedemos stared at sostratos as if hed never seen him before hed known his cousin could shoot pretty well but to hear him described in such terms was startling sostratos was among the mildest and most inoffensive of men or at least he was most of the time with his freedom and his life in the balance that might be a different story that evidently was a different story i wish id done better he said now if id shot the bastard who speared aristeidas hed still be with us now you cant blame yourself menedemos said weve been telling him the same thing teleutas said he doesnt want to listen well he should menedemos looked straight at sostratos you should for four to drive off eightthats no mean feat my dear all by itself you cant expect everything to have gone perfectly everything had near enough till we ran into those polluted robbers on the way back here sostratos said were another couple of days of luck too much to ask of the gods you cant ask such things of meill tell you that menedemos said lets get the goods off your donkey and onto the akatos balsam and beeswax and what all else did you tell me embroidered cloth sostratos answered business seemed to recall him to himself how did you do here could have been worse could have been a lot worse in fact menedemos said i got rid of almost all your brotherinlaws olive oil and at a good price too worn and sorrowful as sostratos was he sat up and took notice of that did you and what escaped madman came along to buy it some went to the soldiers of antigonos garrison here after their godsdetested quartermaster wouldnt pay a decent price menedemos replied a phoenician dealer bought the rest for the luxury trade the books are all goneyou had a good idea there and the koan silkand i got something better for it just thinking of the silk hed got from zakerbaal set excitement bubbling inside him what more cloth sostratos asked when menedemos dipped his head his cousin looked dismayed sostratos in fact looked downright disgusted he said what were you drinking my dear when the wily phoenician convinced you of that there is no finer cloth than koan silk we do have some jars of byblian wine aboard and crimson dye too menedemos said but youre wrong about the koan silk before we got here i would have said you were right but i know better now this i have to see for myself sostratos declared come aboard then o best one and see you shall menedemos steered sostratos back toward the aphrodite he went on by what you and the sailors say you were the best one with the bow no one could have done better than you did it wasnt good enough sostratos said bleakly otherwise we all would have come back from engedi as always sostratos looked for perfection from himself being only human he didnt always get it and when he didnt he blamed himself more fiercely than he should have for falling short menedemos almost said so to his face but then knowing his cousin as well as he did he thought better of it instead he simply guided sostratos down into the merchant galley guided him along to the leather sacks storing the silk and opened one of them to draw out a bolt sostratos eyes widened menedemos had known they would sostratos stared at the fine fine fabric then reached out to feel it he dipped his head decisively well when youre right youre right the koans never dreamt of anything like this where does it come from how is it made curiosity came close to bringing him back to his usual self i dont know how its made menedemos replied its from out of the east zakerbaal saidhes the phoenician i got it from from somewhere beyond india maybe north maybe east maybe both like the gryphons skull sostratos said yes that occurred to me too menedemos agreed but i think well see more of this silk coming west into the lands around the inner sea where the gods only know if another skull like that will ever turn up plainly sostratos wanted to argue with him just as plainly he couldnt he asked what did you pay for this and how much did you get when menedemos told him he muttered to himself then dipped his head again thats not bad thanks i think were going to squeeze a pretty fair profit out of this run though well take a while to do it because so much of what we earn will depend on selling things weve got here back in hellas menedemos said yes im pretty sure youre right sostratos said i know where we can get a good price for some of this silk or maybe all of it in salamis do you really think so menedemos asked dont you want to take it farther from phoenicia normally id say yes sostratos replied but remember my dear menelaos is in salamis and if ptolemaios brother cant pay top price for something strange from far away who can now it was menedemos turn to say when youre right youre right id thought you meant wed sell it to some rich salaminian but menelaos is a special case sure enough yes well definitely have to call on him when we get back to cyprus how soon can we leave sostratos asked now or as soon as diokles pulls all the men out of the wineshops and brothels menedemos answered ive been waiting for you to get backthats all thats been keeping me here youll want to sell the mule and the donkey too i suppose but that wont take long diokles has always been good at getting the crew out of their dives so we should be ready to go in a couple of days i wont be sorry to head home believe me i dont look forward to calling on aristeidas family sostratos said menedemos grunted there is that isnt there no youre right i dont look forward to it either but weve got to do it how did he and the others do while you were wandering through ioudaia sostratos looked around to see where moskhion and teleutas were before he answered once hed made sure they couldnt hear him he said i havent got a bad word to say about poor aristeidas or about moskhion either teleutas teleutas did everything he was supposed to do as far as helping me went he fought bravely against the robbers tooof course it was fight or diebut he stole from the ioudaioi on the way back here from jerusalem did he menedemos eyed teleutas who was talking to some of the other sailors probably telling them of his adventures why am i not surprised i dont know why arent you sostratos said i wasnt all that surprised either i was just glad the ioudaioi didnt come after us with murder in their hearts we could have had a lot worse trouble than just robbers we didnt but we could have yes i see that menedemos agreed but its not the biggest question not now the biggest question is will teleutas steal from his own shipmates i know i wondered about the same thing sostratos looked very unhappy i dont know what the answer is this is the third year hes sailed with us and no ones complained about theft on the aphrodite i will say that even so i dont like what happened i dont like it at all and i dont blame you a bit menedemos studied teleutas again he always tries to find out how close to the edge of the cliff he can walk doesnt he when somebody acts like that he will fall off one of these days wont he who can say for certain sostratos sounded as unhappy as he looked that seems to be the way to bet though doesnt it yes what shall we do about it do you want to leave him behind here in sidon regretfully sostratos tossed his head no i suppose not he hasnt done anything to a hellene that i can provethough the way he offered to cut aristeidas throat for me chilled my blood he said hed had practice and i believe him but i think we should take him back to rhodes whether i want him sailing with us next spring thats liable to be a different question all right i suppose you have a point menedemos said if he gives us trouble on the way home we can always put him ashore in pamphylia or lykia yes and do you know what will happen if we do sostratos said hell turn pirate sure as were standing here talking one of these days well sail east again and there hell be swarming out of a hemiolia with a knife clamped between his teeth id like to go east in a trihemiolia menedemos said lets see the lykians come after one of those in their miserable polluted pirate ships by the gods that would be pretty fine sostratos agreed it could happen you know theyre building one nowprobably have built it by this time i know menedemos said but even so even if it was my idea they probably wont name me skipper how can they when i have to sail away every spring to make a living no itll be some kalos kagathos who can afford to spend his time serving the polis like that not fair sostratos said in one sense of the word no for i do deserve it menedemos replied in another sense though well who can say a rich man is able to give his time in a way that im not so why shouldnt he have the chance he muttered under his breath not wanting to think about whether it was fair or not to keep from having to ponder it he called diokles what do you need skipper asked the keleustes whod hung back to let menedemos and sostratos talk by themselves menedemos grinned at him what do i need i need the whole crew back aboard as fast as we can get em here now that sostratos is back weve got no reason to stay in sidon anymore ah diokles dipped his head i thought you were going to say that i hoped you were going to say that as a matter of fact time for me to go huntingis that what youre telling me thats just what im telling you menedemos said the sailors know they cant hide from youor if they dont by now theyd better now the oarmaster grinned too thats right skipper ill bring em in never you fear shouldnt even be that hard its not like this was a hellenic polisthey cant just disappear in amongst the people he was as usual as good as his word a lot of sailors came back to the aphrodite of their own accord once they heard the merchant galley would head back to rhodes be nice to find more than a handful of people who speak greek was a comment menedemos heard several times a few others were less eager to go home one man they didnt get back hed taken service with antigonos many goodbyes to him menedemos remarked when he found out about that anyone who wants to eat the food andronikos cooks serve up he tossed his head another sailor had taken up with a courtesan diokles came back to menedemos emptyhanded philon says hed sooner stay here skipper the oarmaster reported says hes in love and he doesnt want to leave the woman oh he does does he menedemos said does the woman speak any greek some i dont know how much diokles answered all right go back there make sure you find em both together menedemos said then tell him his pays cut off as of now tell him he gets not another obolos from me if the woman doesnt throw him out on his ear after that maybe they really are in love in that case you ask me they deserve each other philon came back aboard the aphrodite the next day he looked ashamed of himself no one chaffed him very hard though how many sailors kept from falling in love or imagining they were in love at some port or another around the inner sea not many the day after that menedemos had his crew back again but for the one fool who thought antigonos a better paymaster a good many men looked wan having thrown away their silver on a last carouse but they were there sostratos grumbled about the price hed got for the two animals hed taken to engedi but the difference between that and what hed paid was still less than what hiring them for the journey would have cost menedemos steeringoar tillers in his hands once more grinned at the sailors and called well boys are you about ready to see your home polis again they dipped their heads as they looked back at him from the rowers benches good he told them do you think you still remember what to do with your oars they dipped their heads again some of them managed smiles of their own he waved to diokles then ill give you to the keleustes and hell find out if youre right first thing is wed better cast off diokles said wed look like proper fools if we tried to row away while were still tied up lines snaked back aboard the aphrodite sailors came back aboard down the gangplank then stowed it at the stern diokles raised his voice at my order back oars rhyppapai rhyppapai the merchant galley slid away from the pier how does she feel sostratos asked quietly heavy menedemos answered as diokles smote his little bronze square with his mallet to set the stroke its to be expected when shes been sitting here soaking up seawater for so long he pushed one tiller away and pulled the other one in the aphrodite spun in the sea till her bow faced westnorthwest at my order diokles said again and the rowers knowing what was coming held their oars out of the water till he called normal stroke they reversed the rhythm of what theyd been doing now when their oars dug in they pushed the akatos forward instead of pulling her back little by little sidon and the promontory on which the phoenician city sat began to recede behind her menedemos adjusted her course ever so slightly he laughed at himself knowing how inexact navigation was cyprus he told sostratos he was confident hed bring the aphrodite to the island whereabouts on its east or south coast that was a different question and much harder to answer cyprus his cousin agreed sostratos stood on the foredeck feeling out of place and all too conscious of his own inadequacies as lookout aristeidas should have been here he of the lynxlike eyes sostratos knew his own vision was average at best but he still lived while aristeidas lay forever beneath boulders in ioudaia he had to do the best he could he peered ahead looking for land rising up above the infinite smooth horizon of the inner sea he knew cyprus should come into sight any time and he wanted to be the first to spy the island aristeidas surely would have been if sostratos was doing the dead mans job he wanted to do it as well as he could having some sailor spy cyprus ahead of him would be a humiliation above and behind him the sail made strange sighing noises now bellying full now falling flat and limp in the fitful breeze from the northeast the yard stretched back from the starboard bow to take best advantage of what wind there was to keep the merchant galley going regardless of whether that wind blew hard or failed altogether menedemos kept eight men rowing on either side he changed rowers fairly often so they would stay as fresh as they could if he needed them to flee from or fight pirates pirates sostratos muttered he had to keep watch for sails and hulls too not just for the jut of land out of the sea sailing west toward cyprus the aphrodite had met a couple of ships bound for sidon or the other phoenician towns from salamis everyone had been nervous till they passed each other by any stranger on the sea was too likely to prove a predator waiting only for his chance to strike he peered ahead again then stiffened was that if he sang out and it wasnt he would feel a fool if he didnt sing out and somebody beat him to it he would feel a worse fool he took another longer look land ho he shouted land off the port bow i see it a sailor echoed i was going to sing out myself but the young sir went and beat me to it that made sostratos feel very fine indeed from his station at the stern menedemos said thats got to be cyprus now the only question is where along the coast are we see if you can spy a fishing boat sostratos fishermen will know but they proved to need no fishermen as they came closer to the shore sostratos said to the crows with me if this isnt the very landscape we saw when we sailed out of salamis for sidon you couldnt have placed us any better if youd been able to look across every stadion of sea euge o best one euge the sailors echoed menedemos shuffled his feet on the poop deck like a shy schoolboy who had to recite thank you friends id thank you more if we didnt all know it was just luck that put us here and not two or three hundred stadia up or down the coast modesty sostratos asked are you well my dear ill gladly take credit where credits mineor even when i can get away with claiming it his cousin answered not here though if i say i can navigate from sidon to salamis every time straight as an arrow flies youll expect me to do it again and youll laugh at me when i dont im not fool enough to say anything of the sort because id likely make myself a liar the next time we had to sail out of sight of land before long a five flying ptolemaios eagle pendant roared out of salamis harbors narrow mouth and raced toward the aphrodite an officer cupped his hands in front of his mouth and shouted what ship are you across the water the aphrodite out of sidon bound for rhodes and home sostratos yelled back resigning himself to another long suspicious interrogation but no the officer on the war galley waved and said so youre the rhodians are you pass on we remember you from when you came here out of the west thank you most noble one sostratos exclaimed in glad surprise tell me if youd be so kind is menelaos still here in salamis yes he is ptolemaios officer replied why do you want to know we found something at sidon we hope he might be interested in buying sostratos said ah well i cant say anything about thatyoull have to find out for yourselves the naval officer waved once more good fortune go with you thanks again sostratos said as the aphrodite made for the harbor mouth he went back to the poop deck that was easier than i expected he told menedemos his cousin dipped his head it was wasnt it nice to have something go right for us by the gods and if menelaos likes this fancy silk of ours heres hoping sostratos said how can we even be sure hell look at it well show some to his servants to the highestranking steward theyll let us see menedemos answered if thats not enough to get us brought before him i dont know what would be sostratos admired his confidence a merchant needed it in full measure and sostratos knew he had less than his own fair share heres hoping youre right he said with a shrug menedemos said if im not we just dont sell here thats all i hope menelaos will want what weve got hes someone who can afford to buy it but if he doesnt well i expect someone else will yes he had confidence and to spare and he and sostratos also had that marvelous silk from the land beyond india when they presented themselves at what had been the palace of the kings of salamis and was now menelaos residence a supercilious servant declared the governor does not see tradesmen no sostratos said not even when weve gotthis he waved to menedemos like a conjurer his cousin pulled a bolt of that transparent silk from the sack in which he carried it and displayed it for the servant that worthy immediately lost some of his hauteur he reached out as if to touch the silk menedemos jerked it away the servant asked is that koan cloth it cant beits too fine but it cant be anything else either no its not koan silk sostratos answered what it is isnt any of your business but it is menelaos to soften the sting of that he slipped the servant a drakhma in a lot of households he would have overpaid here if anything the bribe was barely enough it didnt suffice to get the rhodians an audience with ptolemaios brother but it did get them to his chief steward who blinked when he saw the silk they displayed yes the master had better have a look at this himself the steward murmured a few minutes later sostratos and menedemos stood before menelaos son of lagos hail rhodians menelaos said he not only looked like his older brother he sounded like him too which was in sostratos experience much more unusual simias says youve got something interesting for me to see so lets have a look eh ptolemaios also had that way of coming straight to the point sostratos said certainly sir and showed him the silk as he and menedemos had shown it to simias menelaos whistled by the dog thats something he said and dipped his head yes indeed thats really something its not koan it cant be koan the koans couldnt match this if their lives depended on it wheres it come from you got it in sidon but you cant tell me the phoenicians made it no sir this was menedemos story and he told it zakerbaal the cloth merchant who sold it to me says it comes from a country beyond indiahe doesnt know whether to the east or to the north he knows koan silk too and said the same thing you did next question is how much do you want for it yes menelaos did cut to the chase zakerbaal said it was worth its weight in gold menedemos answered but its worth more than that just because its so very light and filmy i paid him in koan silk at five times its weight for the weight of each bolt of this sostratos sent him a sharp look hed really paid only about half that of course how would menelaos know and menedemos knew what he was doing too for ptolemaios brother said so youre telling me each bolt of this is worth five times as much as a bolt of koan silk that seems fair enough i think sostratos and menedemos both tossed their heads at the same time an almost identical motion that looked odd because sostratos was so much taller than his cousin sostratos said not quite o most noble one were telling you thats what we paid ah menelaos grin displayed strong yellow teeth and youre telling me you want a profit are you some hellenesusually those who didnt have to worry about it looked down their noses at the mere idea of profit menelaos didnt sound as if he was one of those sostratos hoped he wasnt anyhow menedemos said sir that silk didnt swim across the sea to salamis by itself we have to pay our crew we have to take care of our ship we have to live too and youre thinking besides menelaos has all the money in the world arent you menelaos rolled his eyes thats because you dont know what a skinflint my brother is as a matter of fact we do sostratos said we dealt with him last year on kos if you were to give him some of this silk he might not worry so much about what you spend on it menedemos said his voice sly how much have you got menelaos asked a dozen bolts all of size and quality like this dyed several different colors menedemos replied menelaos rubbed his chin youre a sneaky one arent you rhodian yes that might do the trick he raised his voice simias the steward appeared on the instant yes your excellency what would a bolt of good koan silk cost about a mina sir menelaos looked to sostratos and menedemos is he right they glanced at each other sostratos answered id say it might cost a little more but hes not far wrong though so you paid five minai more or less for each bolt of this eastern silk the rhodians looked at each other again probably be closer to six best one menedemos said and how much more than that would it take to make it worth your while to sell the silk to me menelaos asked twice as much sostratos said what youd want a dozen minai by your reckoning per bolt by zeus rhodian thats too much ill give you half again as much not a drakhma more counting on his fingers sostratos worked out how much that would be nine minai the bolt we have twelve bolts in all so youd payhe muttered to himself as he did the arithmeticone hundred eight minai all told almost two talents of silver drakhmai that was by anybodys standards a lot of money menelaos turned to his steward is that what it would come to simias my head turns to mush when i try to figure things without a counting board yes sir he calculated it correctly simias answered whether you want to pay the price is a different question of course isnt it just menelaos agreed still if i share the silk with ptolemaios he cant very well complain about it he dipped his head in sudden decision all right rhodiansa bargain your fancy eastern silk all twelve bolts for one hundred eight minai of silveror would you rather have it in gold gold would be a lot easier for you to carry egypt was a land rich in gold where most hellenes used silver as their main monetary metal what rate of exchange would you give sostratos asked that makes a difference you know ten to one no more menelaos said this isnt philip of macedons day when a gold drakhma would buy you twelve silver ones he wasnt wrong ten to one was the most common exchange rate nowadays a century before the ratio had been thirteen or even fourteen to one if youll wait till we can bring a couple of men here i think id sooner have it in silver sostratos answered as you say golds fallen over this past generation and it may fall further however you please ptolemaios brother said with a shrug ive got the silver sostratos was sure he had it how big was his army on cyprus he probably spent more than a couple of talents every day on his soldiers pay menedemos said ill go over to the aphrodite to get the sailors can you give us some guards when were taking the money back to the ship most noble one certainly menelaos answered worried about getting knocked over the head between here and the harbor are you dont blame you a bit salamis can be a tough town thank you sir menedemos said if youd told me no idve come back with a lot more than just two men ill tell you that he waved and hurried away that left sostratos alone with menelaos and simias he usually hated such situations as he was a man of little small talk now though he asked sir did you hunt tigers in distant india as ptolemaios did did i i should say i did menelaos exclaimed and he was off on a hunting story that not only fascinated sostratos and told him two or three things about tigers that he hadnt known but also relieved him of the obligation to say much more till his cousin got back with the sailors not bad he thought for a double handful of words menedemos pulled in on one teeringoar tiller and pushed the other one out the aphrodite rounded cape pedalion the highland that marked the southeastern corner of cyprus diokles said that headland is supposed to be sacred to aphrodite so theres a good omen for our ship if you like i like good omens just fine thanks very much menedemos answered ill take em wherever i can find em too why is this part of cyprus sacred to the love goddess sostratos asked didnt she rise from the sea at paphos paphos isnt near here is it no young sir paphos is way off to the west the oarmaster said i dont know why cape pedalions sacred to her i just know that it is sostratos still looked discontented menedemos shot him a glance that said shut up for a wonder his cousin got the message menedemos wanted the sailors to think the omens were good the happier they were the better theyd work if diokles hadnt given him a real one he might have invented a good omen to keep them cheerful the beaches west of cape pedalion were of fine white sand the soil inland from them a red that promised great fertility though fields lay fallow under the hot sun waiting for fall and the rains that would bring them back to life but the promontory did strange things to the wind which went fitful and shifting now with the merchant galley now dead against her by the gods im glad im in an akatos menedemos said i wouldnt care to sail this coast in a round ship you could spend days going nowhere at all and if the wind did blow in one direction like as not itd drive you aground instead of taking you where you wanted to go you dont want that sostratos said you dont want that anywhere you especially dont want it on a shore where nobody knows you diokles dipped his head no indeed and you really especially dont want it on this shore where most of the people are phoenicians not hellenes at all kition the next city up ahead is a phoenician town from what we saw in sidon phoenicians arent any worse than hellenes sostratos said im not saying theyre worse im saying theyre foreign the keleustes replied if i were a phoenician skipper id sooner go aground here than up by salamis where the people are mostly hellenes id sooner not go aground anywhere menedemos said id sooner not and i dont intend to he did put in at kition the next day to buy fresh bread it looked like a phoenician town with tall buildings crowding close together and with men in caps and long robes the gutturals of aramaic dominated over greeks smooth rising and falling cadences i can understand what theyre saying sostratos exclaimed when we first set out i wouldnt have followed even half of it but i can understand almost all of it now youve been speaking the language yourself menedemos said thats why i can even understand a little myself but i expect ill forget it as soon as we get back to rhodes i wont need to know it anymore i dont want to forget sostratos said i never want to forget anything i can think of a few things id just as soon forget menedemos said starting with emashtart he laughed and tossed his head i didnt have any trouble keeping my oath on account of her how about you o best one outrage any husbands in ioudaia you never swore you wouldnt to his surpriseindeed to his amazementhis cousin coughed and shuffled his feet and generally acted flustered how did you know sostratos asked were you talking with moskhion or teleutas did they blab they never said a word my dear and i never thought to ask them about that menedemos answered but now im asking you who was she was she pretty you wouldnt have done it if you hadnt thought she was pretty would you her husband ran the inn where we stayed in jerusalem sostratos said slowly her name was zilpah he bared his teeth in what wasnt quite or wasnt just a smile while i was going after her i thought she was the most wonderful thing in the world menedemos laughed out loud oh yes i know all about that i kept trying to tell you but you didnt want to listen i understand better now by the way sostratos said it he wished he didnt laughing still menedemos said so you finally got her did you yes on the way back from engedi sostratos didnt sound particularly proud of himself if she hadnt been angry at her husband i never would have they all say that menedemos told him maybe they even believe it it gives them an excuse for doing what they want to do anyhow well how was it better than with a whore certainlyyoure right about that sostratos admitted told you so menedemos said you tell me all sorts of things sostratos said some of them turn out to be true and some of them dont she started crying afterwards though and wished shed never done it everything was finebetter than fineup till then as soon as wed finished though he tossed his head oh one of those just your luck to run into one like that the first time you play the game menedemos said sympathetically and put his hand on his cousins shoulder it happens im afraid obviously since it happened to me sostratos said and it did feel like a game i didnt like that why not what else is it menedemos asked in honest puzzlement best game in the world if you ask me but still only a game sostratos groped for an answer it shouldnt be only a game its too important to be only a game for a little while there i was in love i suppose i dont know what else to call it that can happen menedemos agreed sostratos hadnt sounded happy about it menedemos didnt blame him love was as dangerous a passion as the gods had inflicted on mankind menedemos went on i dont suppose you can do anything halfway can you doesnt seem that way does it sostratos spread his hands theres my story such as it is im sure its nothing you havent done before thats not the point the point is its something you havent done before i know no menedemos cousin didnt seem happy at all now i understand the fascination of your game i wish i didnt why menedemos asked because now you have a harder time looking down your nose at me relentlessly honest sostratos dipped his head yes thats the main reason why and i wont tell you any different and because i dont know if ill be able to keep from doing something like that again one of these days i hope so but how can i know for certain dont worry about it so much menedemos told him you got away youll never see the woman or her husband again nobody got hurt why are you in such an uproar you dont need to be sostratos was relentlessly precise as well as relentlessly honest i wouldnt say nobody got hurt if youd seen zilpah afterwards his mouth tightened he was looking back on a memory that didnt please him at all but menedemos repeated dont worry about it women get funny sometimes thats all the day after you left the inn shed probably forgotten all about you i dont think so sostratos said i think she thought she loved me the same way i thought i loved her then we lay with each other and that made her decide her husband was really the important one i think she how do i put itblamed me for not being who or maybe what she thought i was he sighed well what if she did menedemos asked how is that your fault it isnt my dear and thats all there is to it thats all there is to it sostratos echoed in a hollow voice easy enough for you to say o best one not so easy for me to persuade myself menedemos started to tell him not to be a fool considering how many times sostratos had told him the same thing he looked forward to getting some of his own back but before the words could pass the barrier of his teeth a sailor called out a warning from the bow skipper a soldiers coming up the pier to look us over thanks damagetos menedemos answered with a sigh kition might have been a phoenician town but like the rest of cyprus it lay under ptolemaios rule these days the garrison here had to prove itself alert the aphrodite wasnt likely to be part of an invasion fleet ordered out by antigonos but at first glance she easily might have seemed a pirate scorching sostratos would have to wait what ship are you the inevitable question floated through the air as soon as the officer got within hailing distance were the aphrodite out of rhodes menedemos answered resisting the impulse to yell back whose man are you hed asked it before and discovered what he should have known anyhow cracking wise with a fellow who could cause you trouble wasnt a good idea even so the temptation remained where have you been and whats your cargo ptolemaios officer asked sidon and lately salamis menedemos answered weve got byblian wine crimson dye balsam of engedi and a few jars of rhodian perfume and olive oil olive oil the soldier said you must have been daft to carry olive oil in a scrawny little ship like that everyone who heard about that part of the cargo said the same thing for a long time hearing it had made menedemos grind his teeth now he could smile you might think so best one but we unloaded almost all of it he said would you care to try one of the jars we have left no thanks the officer replied with a laugh but youre traders all right welcome to kition he turned and walked back into the city a sharp metallic clicking in the sky made menedemos and a good many others look up he stared what in the world are those he said bats sostratos answered calmly but ive seen bats beforeeverybody has menedemos protested theyre little things like dormice with wings these arent little theyve got bodies like puppies and wings like a crows theyre still bats sostratos said theyve got noses not beaks theyve got ears theyve got bare wings and fur not feathers what else would they be theyre too big to be bats menedemos insisted if they were any bigger theyd be like vultures by the gods so you say big bats are impossible sostratos asked fine have it your way my dear theyre big birds that happen to look exactly like bats menedemos ears burned to make matters worse sostratos spoke in aramaic to a phoenician longshoreman the fellow answered volubly pointing back into the long rolling hills behind kition sostratos bowed his thanks exactly as a phoenician might have done he turned back to menedemos they are bats he said they live in caves and they eat fruit thats what the fellow said anyhow i always thought bats ate bugs i wish we could stay and learn more about them may we no menedemos said you would be the one to care more for learning about bats than for learning about women wouldnt you sostratos winced i didnt say that and so he hadnt but menedemos having been embarrassed over the bats was delighted to take a little revenge if he ruffled his cousins feathers or seeing that those creatures were bats his fur too bad the trouble with being angry at someone aboard an akatos as sostratos had long since discovered was that you couldnt get away from him the ship wasnt big enough and so even though he thought the crack menedemos had made was grossly unfair he couldnt go off by himself and sulk the only possible place for him to go off by himself was up on the tiny foredeck but he didnt have the luxury of sulking there if he stood on the foredeck he had to do lookout duty that he did staring out at the water of the inner sea in lieu of looking back at his cousin but the first thing that crossed his mind then was how had everything gone well aristeidas would have stood here instead he blamed himself because the sharpeyed sailor wasnt blaming himself he forgot all about blaming menedemos more big bats flew overhead the next evening as the aphrodite neared the town of kourion sostratos pretended not to notice them menedemos didnt say anything about them either a strange sort of truce but a truce even so menedemos even made an effort to be friendly asking what do you know about kourion you know something about almost every place where we stop not much about this one im afraid sostratos answered king stasanor of kourion went over to the persians during the cypriot rebellion almost two hundred years ago thanks to his treachery the persians won the battle on the plains near salamis and the rebellion failed sounds like something a townd rather not be remembered for menedemos remarked what else do you know sostratos frowned trying to flog more bits from his memory kourion is a colony sent out from argos he said and they worship an odd apollo here diokles dipped his head thats right young sir apollo hylates apollo of the woodyes thanks sostratos said i couldnt recall the details you know more than i do here diokles go on if you would i dont know much more the oarmaster said suddenly shy ive only been here a couple of times myself but i do know the god has strange rites and anyone who dares touch his altar gets thrown off those cliffs yonder he pointed to bluffs west of the town as cliffs went they werent very impressive sostratos had seen far higher and steeper ones in lykia and in ioudaia still a man flung from the top was bound to die when he hit the bottom which made them high enough to punish sacrilege menedemos asked what struck sostratos as a couple of eminently reasonable questions why would anybody want to touch that altar if people know what happens to those who do and how often is anybody going to be mad enough to do it i couldnt begin to tell you skipper diokles replied all i know is what i rememberor what i think i rememberfrom when i did put in here that was years ago now so i may have it wrong no war galleys patrolled outside kourion or none sostratos saw he hadnt spied any around kition either ptolemaios seemed to be keeping his whole fleet at salamis that being the port closest to the phoenician coastline from which antigonos might launch an attack against cyprus and if the ruler of egypt had garrisoned kourion as sostratos assumed he had the local commander was most incurious no one asked any questions of the aphrodites crew except the longshoremen who moored the merchant galley to a quay whence come ye a naked man inquired in the oldfashioned cypriot dialect as he made a line fast whither be ye bound as usual menedemos told him were the aphrodite out of rhodes were heading home from sidon the doric drawl sostratos cousin spoke seemed all the stronger after the longshoremans archaic speech rhodes say you good sir and sidon in sooth youve traveled far and seen many things passing strange what think you the most curious amongst em ill answer that if i may sostratos said and menedemos waved for him to go on he did in loudaia inland from the phoenician coast theres a lake full of water so salty a man cant drown in it hell float on the surface with head and shoulders and feet sticking out into the air tush go to the cypriot exclaimed think you to gull me so you rank cozener why waters water be it salt or fresh an you throw a man int if he swim not hell sink down and drown tis but natural that it be so who told you such lies no one told me sostratos said i saw this with my own eyes felt it with my own body i went into this lake i tell you and it bore me up from the great amount of salt in it try as he would though he couldnt make the longshoreman believe him by apollo hylates ive met folk like you aforetimes the fellow said always ready with a tall tale the which no man hereabouts may check go to i say again youll not catch me crediting such nonsense and moonshine sostratos wanted to insist he was telling the truth he wanted to but he didnt bother he knew he would only waste his time and end up out of temper people who often clung to the most absurd local superstitions wouldnt trust a foreigner to tell them the truth about a distant land the cypriot had asked him for a strange story and then refused to believe it once he got it moskhion came up onto the poop deck dont worry about it young sir he said some people are just naturalborn fools and you cant do a thing about it i know sostratos said arguing with somebody like that is nothing but a waste of breath he wouldnt have believed you and teleutas either thats why i kept quiet moskhion said dipping his head i didnt see any point in quarreling thats all it wasnt on account of i wouldnt back you of course not sostratos said id never think such a thing not when we fought side by side there in the rocks north of gamzo we owe each other our lives were not going to split apart over a foolish argument with somebody whos probably never gone fifty stadia from kourion in his life menedemos said we still have a little while before sunset shall we go into the agora and see what theyre selling there well why not sostratos answered you never can tell i wouldnt bet on finding anything worth buying but i might be wrong and walking around in any market square will remind me im back among hellenes his cousin dipped his head yes i had the same thought he ran the gangplank from the poop deck to the quay lets go kourion wasnt a big city but it was an old one even its larger streets meandered in every direction one of these days sostratos supposed someone might rebuild the place with a neat hippodamian grid of avenues such as rhodes and kos and other newer foundations enjoyed meanwhile the locals knew their way around while strangers had to do their best eventually he and menedemos did find the agora men wandered from stall to stall examining produce and pots and leather goods and nets and carved wood and cloth and a hundred other things sellers praised their goods buyers sneered men with trays ambled through the square selling figs and wine and fried prawns and pastries sweetened with honey knots of men gathered here and there arguing and gesticulating it was the most ordinary scene imaginable in any town full of hellenes along the inner sea tears stung sostratos eyes by the gods i never dreamt i could miss this so much neither did i menedemos agreed lets see what theyve got eh of course my dear sostratos said you never know what we might find they strolled the agora together sostratos knew what he hoped to find another gryphons skull that one was most unlikely to turn up in this outofthe way little polis bothered him not at all he had his hopes and would keep on having them as long as he lived he saw no sign of any such wonder in kourion though he saw no sign of any wonders in the market square the agora was almost staggeringly dull at least for someone looking for cargo for a merchant galley a local miller or farmer would surely have found it delightful as soon as he realized he wouldnt see anything much he wanted to buy he started listening to the talk in the agora talk after all was the other main reason men came to the market square thanks to the cypriot dialect he had to listen harder than he would have back in rhodes the more he listened though the more easily he followed it people kept talking about a gamble or a risk they all knew what it was and they wisely discussed this fellows chance of bringing it off or that ones or someone elses they also talked about the price of failure without saying what that was either finally sostratos curiosity got the better of him he walked up to a local and said excuse me o best one but may i ask you a question the man from kourion dipped his head certes stranger say on thank you kindly as had happened before on cyprus the accent here made sostratos acutely conscious of his own doric dialect which came out more than usual he persisted even so what is this gamble i hear you all talking about why to touch the altar of apollo hylates unbeknownst to the priests serving the god of course the man from kourion replied sostratos stared but isnt it death to touch that altar dont they throw you off the cliffs he pointed westward in good sooth sir tis indeed an a man be caught he suffereth infallibly that very fate tis the price of failure the local said menedemos said in that case why on earth would anybody be crazy enough to want to do it shrugging the man from kourion replied it hath of late become amongst the youth of this our city a passion a sport to make their way to yon temple by twos and threesthe odd young men being witness to him who darethto lay hold of the altar and then to get hence with all the haste in em why sostratos asked as menedemos had before him again the local only shrugged when he saw the rhodians had no more questions for him he politely dipped his head again and went on his way sostratos kept scratching his own head and worrying at the question like a man with a bit of squid tentacle stuck between his teeth at last he said i think i understand more than i can say menedemos replied look at athens more than a hundred years ago when alkibiades and some of his friends profaned the mysteries of eleusis and mutilated the herms in front of peoples houses sostratos said they probably didnt mean any real harm they were drunk and having a good time and playing foolish games thats what the young men are doing here i suppose its not a foolish game if the priests catch you menedemos pointed out i wonder what sort of watch they keep sostratos said if it is only a game they might look the other way most of the time though alkibiades came to grief when people who should have kept their mouths shut didnt well be out of here tomorrow menedemos said well never know i wish you hadnt put it like that sostratos said now it will keep on bothering me for the rest of my days not if you dont let it menedemos said what bothers me are the goods in this agora i cant see a single thing id want to take away from here he snapped his fingers no i take that backthere was one very pretty boy oh go howl sostratos told him boys beauty drew his eyes but in the same way as a fine horses beauty might have he admired without wanting to possess when he thought about such things he wondered if that was because hed been so completely ignored while he was a youth maybe the sting of that humiliation remained with him yet menedemos by contrast had had his name and the usual epithets menedemos is beautiful or menedemos is best or the boy menedemos is most lovelyscrawled on walls all over rhodes he knew sostratos hadnthe hardly could help knowing most of the time as now he was tactful well my dear i did happen to notice him but hes probably got no honorjust another little wretch with a wide arsehole perversely that made sostratos want to defend the boy you dont know the first thing about him he said no but i know the type menedemos answered some people go through their beauty like thathe snapped his fingers againbecause theyve nothing else to spend heh sostratos said what do you think im joking menedemos asked no my dear not at all sostratos answered when they were both youths when menedemos was swimming in attention while he had none sostratos had told himself his cousin had only beauty to go through and would be worthless by the time he grew up hed been wrong but that didnt mean he hadnt consoled himself so they walked back to the aphrodite one of those enormous bats flew overhead menedemos said its got a pointy nose just like the pretty boy i saw do you suppose bats call one another beautiful sostratos contemplated that then tossed his head what i suppose is youre very peculiar to come up with a question like that why thank you menedemos said as if sostratos had praised him they both laughed some of the sailors went into kourion to get drunk diokles had no trouble rounding them up though i didnt figure i would he said when the job was done nobody wants to get stuck in a miserable little place like this that perfectly summarized sostratos view of kourion he was glad when the merchant galley left the town early the next morning of course she would stop for the night at some other small cypriot city perhaps one even less prepossessing than kourion but he chose not to dwell on that diokles was clanging out a slow lazy stroke for the men at the oars there was no breeze to speak ofwhen a sailor pointed toward the shore a few plethra away and said what are they doing there sostratos looked in the direction of the bluffs west of kourion a procession marched along the heights nonot everybody marched for one man bound went stiffly and unwillingly dragged toward the cliffedge ice ran through sostratos his voice shook when he called do you see menedemos his cousin dipped his head i see he sounded thoroughly grim continuing well now we know how seriously the priests of apollo hylates take the game of touching their altar yes dont we sostratos watchedcouldnt stop watching much as he wanted to turn awaythe procession reach the place where land gave way to air the akatos lay far enough out to sea that everything on the shore happened not only in miniature but also in eerie silence only the sound of waves slapping against the ships hull and the regular splash of oars going into and out of the water came to sostratos ears what were they saying there at the top of the bluffs were they cursing the bound man for profaning the gods altar or were theyworse commiserating with him saying it was too bad hed got caught but now he had to pay the price as with thoukydides whod written down speeches he hadnt heard sostratos had to decide what was most plausible most appropriate to the occasion then suddenly without sostratos quite seeing how it happened the bound man went over the cliff for a heartbeat the scene there ashore wasnt silent any more the mans shriek of terror and despair reached the aphrodite across a stadion of seawater it cut off with horrid abruptness at the foot of the cliffs his broken body lay as still as if it had never held life pleased with a job well done the men of kourion whod put him to death went back toward the temple to attend to whatever other important business they had that day sailors muttered among themselves even if some of them thought the man had brought it on himself by profaning the gods altar watching him die wasnt easy and couldnt possibly have been a good omen diokles fingered the amulet of herakles alexikakos he wore to turn aside evil sostratos walked back to the stern and up onto the poop deck in a low voice he said im glad we didnt buy anything in the agora at kourion menedemos had to look back over his shoulder now to see the corpse lying there under the bluffs close by the sea after a moment his gaze swung toward sostratos once more he slowly dipped his head yes he said so am i ahead of the aphrodite the anatolian mainland slowly rose above the horizon behind her cyprus sank into the sea between the one and the other she was alone in the midst of immensity menedemos had sailed for the mainland from paphos on the west coast of the island that made for a longer journey over the open sea than if hed crawled up to the north coast of cyprus but it also shaved several days off the journey back to rhodes euge sostratos told him everything seems to be going well yes it does doesnt it menedemos said but i can already hear my father complaining i took a chance going this way he sighed now that they were well on the way to rhodes the things of home crowded forward in his mind once more he didnt look forward to dealing with his father part of him didnt look forward to dealing with his fathers second wife either but part of him was eager ever so eager to see baukis again and he knew exactly which part that was too sostratos came up onto the poop deck he pointed dead ahead nicely sailed he said with the headland of lykia there youve skipped a lot of the waters that pirates haunt i wish i could have skipped them all menedemos answered if i thought i could have got away with sailing straight across the sea from cyprus to rhodes id have done it then we wouldnt have had to worry about pirates at all maybe not sostratos said but if you were able to cross the open sea like that easy as you please dont you think pirates would be too menedemos hadnt thought of that he wished his cousin hadnt thought of it either there are times my dear when you make seeing both sides of the picture seem a vice not a virtue what is the world coming to when i cant even tell a plain truth without getting carping criticism back sostratos looked up to the heavens as if expecting zeus or athena to descend and declare that he was right neither zeus nor athena did any such thing maybe that proved sostratos was wrong maybe it proved the gods were busy elsewhere on some business more important than sostratos or maybe it proved nothing at menedemos shied away from that speculation before it fully formed still he wished that just once he would see a god any god manifest himself on earth or openly answer a prayer that would make his own piety which while sincere didnt run especially deep much easier to maintain still not quite letting that question take shape in his mind menedemos asked what was the name of the wicked fellow who said priests invented the gods to frighten people into behaving the way they should kritias sostratos answered at once hes ninety years dead now but youre righthe was as wicked as they come and not just on account of that he was one of sokrates little pals wasnt he menedemos said his cousin flinched he did study with sokrates for a while yes he admitted but they broke when he did something shameless and sokrates called him on it in public oh menedemos hadnt known that he enjoyed teasing sostratos about sokrates but the answer hed just got killed his chances for the time being he watched sostratos eyeing him too his cousin knew the games he played which meant he would be wiser not to play this one right now half the sport disappeared when the other fellow knew the barbs were coming menedemos concentrated on sailing the aphrodite instead he took his hand off a steeringoar tiller to point as sostratos had at the lykian highlands that rose so steeply from the sea they make a lovely landmark but i wish they werent there i should hope so my dear sostratos replied understanding him perfectly if they werent the lykians wouldnt be half so much trouble those heights hide bandits the way river mouths and little capes and promontories hide pirate ships his face clouded id never had trouble with bandits before this trip thats because you never did a lot of traveling on land menedemos replied who does if he can help it travel by seas not safe either sostratos said we found that out last year when the pirates stole the gryphons skull they didnt intend to steal the skull it just happened to be something they got away with menedemos pointed out i know the loss pains you but it wasnt what they had in mind let me remind you what they did have in mindstealing our money and our valuables and killing us or selling us into slavery or holding us for ransom losing the gryphons skull is a fleabite next to what might have been his cousin had the grace to look shamefaced yes thats true of course he said i dont believe ive ever claimed otherwise if i have im sorry for it but i will say its a fleabite that rankles i know you willyou will at any excuse or none menedemos said after a while hearing about it over and over rankles too he wondered if that was too blunt sostratos could be sensitive and could also sulk for days after having his feathers ruffled now he said im so sorry my dear i wont bore you with my presence anymore and stalked off the poop deck like an indignant egyptian cat menedemos sighed sure enough hed hit too hard now hed have to figure out a way to jolly sostratos back into a good mood meanwhile he had the ship and the sea and the approaching lykian coast to worry about which meant his cousin got short shrift for a while sostratos had been right about one thing just as no army had ever cleared brigands from the lykian hills no navy had ever cleared pirates from the coastline menedemos wished the aphrodite were a trihemiolia let the lykians beware then in a merchant galley though he was the one who went with caution by the end of the day the highlands had bulked their way out of the sea tall and dark with forest he might have tried to make a town he might have but he didnt he had enough food hed taken on as much water as the aphrodite would carry in paphos he could afford to spend one more night at sea he could afford to and he did not a sailor grumbled not off this coast maybe the men would have put up with striking straight across from cyprus to rhodes after all if the other choice was running the gauntlet of lykian pirates he wondered whether the akatos could have carried enough bread and cheese and olives and wine and water for so long a journey maybe but maybe not there would be risks he chuckled under his breath at sea there were always risks as the sun went down anchors splashed into the inner sea sailors ate their suppers and washed them down with watered wine a waxing gibbous moon glowed in the southeastern sky as twilight deepened the stars came out zeus wandering star hung low in the southwest a little to the east of it shone ares wandering star now entering the scorpion and thus close to its ruddy rival antares kronos wandering star yellow as olive oil beamed down from the south a little west of the moon snores began to rise in the quiet darkness sostratos came back from the poop deck to wrap himself in his himation and stretch out beside menedemos he wasnt quite ready for sleep though pointing up toward ares wandering star he spoke in a low voice i wonder why its so much dimmer now than it was this spring then it would have easily outshone antares now he tossed his head menedemos was sleepy how can we know why he asked his voice grumpy it does what it does thats all do you expect to go up into the heavens and look if i could id like to sostratos said yes if but since you cant wont you settle for going to sleep instead oh all right good night good night menedemos said when he woke the next morning twilight streaked the eastern sky behind the aphrodite rosyfingered dawn he murmured and smiled he yawned stretched and got to his feet shivering a little he picked up the crumpled chiton hed used for a pillow and put it back on the day would soon warm up but the night had been on the chilly side he walked to the rail and pissed into the inner sea sostratos still snored he hardly seemed to have moved from where hed lain down the night before diokles was awake he looked back from the rowers bench where hed curled up for the night and dipped his head at menedemos as the day brightened more and more sailors woke finally just before the sun came up over the horizon menedemos waved to the men whod already roused and they set about waking the rest he woke sostratos himself stirring him with his foot his cousin muttered something then jerked in alarm his eyes flew open for a moment they held nothing but animal fear then reason returned and anger with it why didnt you just stick a spear in me sostratos demanded indignantly maybe next time my dear menedemos made his voice as sunny as he could the better to annoy his cousin by sostratos scowl it worked barley cakes and oil and more watered wine served for breakfast grunting with effort sailors hauled on the capstans to bring up the anchors they hauled them out of the sea and stowed them near the bow menedemos gauged the wind it was easy to gauge there was none to speak of he sighed the rowers would earn their pay today at his orders diokles put eight men a side on the oars plenty to keep the merchant galley going yet few enough to keep the crew fresh in case they needed everyone rowing to escape pirates or fight them off menedemos spat into the bosom of his tunic to avert the unwelcome omen as often happened fishing boats fled from the aphrodite they took one look at a galley centipedestriding across the waters of the inner sea and assumed they saw a pirate ship that always saddened menedemos still had he skippered one of those little boats he would have run from the aphrodite too anyone who took chances with his crews freedom and lives was a fool the wind did blow up fitfully as the morning wore along menedemos ordered the sail lowered from the yard he wondered why hed bothered now it would fill and shove the akatos forward and then a moment later when the breeze died again it would hang as loose and empty as the skin on a formerly fat mans belly after his polis was besieged and starved into surrender a pestilence he muttered when the wind failed for the fourth time in half an hour might as well be a girl who teases but doesnt intend to put out sostratos stood close enough to hear him trust you to come up with that figure of speech he said i wouldnt dream of disappointing you menedemos said he would have gone on in that vein but moskhion who was taking a turn as lookout shouted from the foredeck ship coming out from behind that headland no two ships by the gods two ships off the starboard bow he pointed menedemos eyes swung in the direction moskhion gave even so he needed several heartbeats to spy the ships they were galleys their masts down their hulls and even their oars painted a greenish blue that made them hard to spot against sea and sky no honest skipper painted his ship a color like that sostratos saw the same thing at the same time pirates he said as if remarking on the weather im afraid youre right my dear menedemos dipped his head he gauged the speed at which those long lean galleys were approaching gauged it and didnt like it a bit im afraid we cant very well run either not with the hull as soaked as it is theyd catch us quick and this polluted fitful breeze wont let us sail away either we have to fight then sostratos said yes menedemos dipped his head again im afraid we do he shouted orders raise the sail to the yard serve out weapons to everyone man all oars diokles as soon as we have a rower on every bench ill want you to up the stroke we cant outrun em but well need as much speed as we can get right you are skipper the oarmaster pointed toward the approaching pirate ships which stayed a couple of plethra apart theyre a little overeager you ask me if theyd waited a little longer before they came out of cover wedve had less time to get ready were a good ways out to sea maybe they wanted to make sure we didnt get away menedemos said if they did make a mistake its up to us to prove it theyre triakonters sostratos said only thirty rowers in each one but look how many extra men theyve packed in for boarding bastards menedemos said grab my bowcase o best one your archery will help us i hope so his cousin answered i cant shoot all of them though however much i wish i could i know i wish you could too menedemos said but the more you hit the fewer well have to worry about if they do manage to board us if they board us were ruined he thought as sostratos had he saw how full of men the pirate ships were the aphrodites crew might well have been able to fight off one both together not a chance he knew as much but he wouldnt say so out loud by the expression on his cousins face sostratos knew as much too up went the sail rowers hurried to their places sailors who werent rowing served out swords and pikes and axes and cudgels men stowed them where they could grab them in a hurry everyones eyes were on the pair of triakonters speeding toward the merchant galley the men also had to know they couldnt beat back that many boarders but theyd been through sea fights with menedemos before hed always managed to do something to keep them free and safe what are you going to do this time he asked himself he found only one answer the best i can aloud he said sostratos loose the boat from the sternpost then go forward to shoot if we win maybe well come back for the boat if we dont he shrugged and turned to diokles as his cousin obeyed up the stroke some more dont show them quite everything we can do though not yet let them think were a little slower and deeper laden than we really are i understand skipper the keleustes raised his voice so even the men at the forwardmost oars could hear put your backs into it you lugs if you want to pay the whores on rhodes again you do what the captain and i tell you come on now rhyppapai rhyppapai rhyppapai he beat out the rhythm with mallet and brass square too the aphrodite seemed to gather herself then to spring across the water toward the two pirates the akatos rowers couldnt see the foe of course they looked back at menedemos and diokles diokles had been wise to remind them to obey orders they relied on the oarmaster and the skipper to be their eyes and brains they staked their freedom maybe their lives on that reliance by the anxious expressions some of them wore they were well aware of it too then menedemos had no more time to spare for his own rowers he steered the merchant galley at the two triakonters as they made for the aphrodite the eyes at the bows of the pirate ships stared balefully across the water at the merchant galley their rams and the aphrodites too gnawed through the sea churning it to white foam their oars rose and fell rose and fell not quite so smoothly as the aphrodite s but at a remarkably quick stroke both ships were faster than the akatos but not by so much as you think menedemos told himself i hope ill give you something nice father poseidon he murmured if you let me come home to do it i promise i will he bargained with men almost every day why not with the gods as well things on the sea didnt always happen swiftly even though the aphrodite and the pirates were closing faster than a horse could trot they had twenty or twentyfive stadia to cover before they met close to half an hour menedemos had plenty of time to think so did the pirate captains no doubt he suspected he knew what they would do keep their distance from each other ply the aphrodite with arrows for a while and then close and board from port and starboard at the same time with numbers thus on their side they could hardly fail as for what he could do to counter that there his thoughts remained murkier than he would have liked those pirate ships swelled suddenly menedemos could hear shouts from the men aboard them see sunlight spark from swords and spearheads he didnt think the shouts were greek not that it mattered there had been plenty of hellenes aboard the pirate ship that attacked the merchant galley the year before in the aegean they counted as pirates first he steered the aphrodite straight for the nearer triakonter here the lefthand one of the pair no matter how she altered courseand her fellow with her in some nice seamanshiphe swung the steeringoar tillers so his bow and hers pointed at each other you going to try ramming her skipper diokles asked you want the extra from the rowers now i think they can still give it to you though theyve been working pretty hard ill watch what the pirates do and thatll tell me what i can do menedemos answered dont up the stroke till i yell no matter what all right the oarmaster didnt sound doubtful no matter what he was thinking that left menedemos grateful if diokles let worry show it would surely infect the rowers and that would make a bad situation even worse archers aboard the closer pirate ship started shooting their arrows splashed into the inner sea well short of the aphrodite menedemos dipped his head in wry amusement bowmen were always overeager before long though the shafts would start to bite more arrows arched through the air these fell short too but not by nearly so far where time hadnt mattered much before suddenly now heartbeats were of the essence menedemos swung the aphrodite hard to port aiming her ram straight for the side of the second triakonter the one hed ignored up till now everything theyve got diokles he called right the oarmaster said without hesitation he upped the stroke come on boys you can do it rhyppapai rhyppapai rhyppapai not even talos the bronze man could have held that sprint for long gasping thrusting faces gleaming with sweat and oil the rowers gave him everything they had in them the akatos suddenly seemed to bound forward over the sea menedemos only advantage was that he knew what he was doing and neither of the pirate captains did had the skipper of the closer ship been more alert more ready for something unexpected from the aphrodite he might have rammed her as she turned toward his comrade he tried in fact but he waited a couple of heartbeats too long before starting his own turnand the merchant galleys sudden burst of speed also caught him by surprise his triakonter passed a few cubits astern of the aphrodite two arrows hissed past menedemos from behind he couldnt even look back if he got hit he hoped diokles would shove him out of the way and drive home the attack on the other pirate ship he aimed the merchant galley at a point halfway between the triakonters ram and where her mast would go when it was up the man at the steering oars on the pirate ship should have started to turn toward the aphrodite or away from her to make sure the akatos ram didnt hit squarely the blackbearded ruffian should have maybe he even would have though taken by surprise he probably had time to do it but sostratos shot three arrows at him in quick succession two of them missed the other one hit him in the neck he shrieked and clawed at himself and forgot all about steering the triakonter euge menedemos roared exultantly another pirate pushed the wounded helmsman aside and seized the steering oars too late much too late heartbeats counted now and the men in the second ship had none to spare menedemos heard their screams saw their mouthsand their eyesopen wide wide wide as the ram slammed home one of them tried to use an oar to fend off the merchant galley which did him no more good than a straw would have in fending off an angry dog crunch the impact staggered menedemos the rams three horizontal flukes stove in the triakonters timbers breaking tenons tearing mortises open and letting the sea flood in between planks formerly watertight back oars diokles shouted the rowers whod known the command was coming obeyed at once menedemos heart thudded if the ram stuck the pirates could swarm aboard the aphrodite from their mortally wounded vessel and perhaps yet carry the day but then he breathed again for it came away cleanly he turned the akatos toward the other pirate ship a rower howled as an arrow from the stricken triakonter bit another sailor took his place menedemos thanked the gods that hadnt happened during the ramming run or it might have thrown off his timing and made him deliver a less effective blow he noticed yet another sailor not a man whod been pulling an oar down and clutching at a shaft through his calf that fellow must have been wounded in the attack but menedemos his attention aimed wholly at his target hadnt noticed till now archers aboard the surviving triakonter kept shooting at the aphrodite too sostratos answered as best he could one of his shafts hissed just in front of the face of the pirate ships helmsman he jerked back with a startled cry menedemos could hear across the couple of plethra of water between the two galleys he also heard cries for help coming from the ship hed rammed as she settled ever lower in the water she wouldnt sink to the bottom of the seashe was after all made of wood but already the oars were of little use when her hull filled completely they would be altogether worthless and she was a good many stadia out to sea menedemos a strong swimmer wouldnt have cared to try to get to shore from here by himself and not so many men could swim at all the other pirate ship might take her crew off her but that triakonter was already crowded besides if she came up alongside her stricken sister she would lie dead in the water waiting for another ramming run from the aphrodite a nice problem for her skipper menedemos thought he and the other pirate captain maneuvered warily neither of the ships was at its best anymore the rowers on both were worn still the triakonter remained faster menedemos couldnt catch up to her after a little while he stopped trying for fear he would altogether exhaust his men and leave them at the pirates mercy as they sparred the rammed ship continued to settle before long pirates were bobbing in the sea clinging to oars and to anything else that would float their cries grew ever more pitifulnot that they would have known any pity themselves had they rammed the merchant galley rather than the other way round the breeze began to rise it made the sea rougher the pirate ship filled faster yet the men whod abandoned her rose on wavecrests and slid down into troughs menedemos tested the wind with a wet thumb what do you think he asked diokles will it hold for a while hope so the oarmaster leaned into the wind he smacked his lips as if tasting it then dipped his head yes skipper i think it will so do i menedemos raised his voice let down the sail from the yard i think these polluted temple robbers have had all they want of us if they come after us with the ship theyve got left well make em sorry all over again cheers rang out weary but heartfelt diokles eased back on the stroke now the wind was playing a larger role in pushing the merchant galley across the sea menedemos looked over his shoulder sure enough the one triakonter hurried over to the other taking men off her no one aboard the sound pirate ship seemed to be paying the aphrodite any mind and even if the pirates were still thinking about her a stern chase was a long chase the extra weight of the several dozen men would make the surviving triakonter slower too sostratos came back toward the stern to help the sailor whod been shot through the leg he knew something about doctoringmenedemos suspected he knew less than he thought he did but even the best physicians could do only so much he drew the arrow and bandaged the wound the sailor seemed grateful for the attention so menedemos supposed his cousin was doing no harm and sostratos had done very well indeed from the foredeck euge menedemos called once more you shot the pirate at the steering oars at just the right time there i would have shot the abandoned wretch sooner if i hadnt missed him twice sostratos said i could practically have spit across the sea and hit him but the arrows went past he looked disgusted with himself dont fret about it menedemos said you did hit him and thats what counts they lost enough time so they couldnt turn into our stroke or turn away from it either and we hit em good and square the ram does a lot more damage that way do you think the other one will come after us sostratos asked i dont know for certain well just have to find out i hope not menedemos replied i promised poseidon something nice if he brought us through ill have to make good on that when we get back to rhodes fair enough my dear his cousin said the god earned it and you earned praise too for your seamanship he called out to the sailors another cheer for the skipper boys euge they shouted menedemos grinned and raised one hand from a steeringoar tiller to wave then he looked over his shoulder again still no sign of the other pirate ship not only was the triakonter not pursuing shed disappeared the sacred land below the horizon menedemos didnt say anything though not yet though he couldnt see her from his place on the poop deck her crew might still be able to make out the aphrodites mast and sail he was content to sail on and see what happened the breeze continued to freshen at last he took his men off the oars and went on under sail alone he thought the pirates would have to do the same either that or wear out their men altogether he kept looking back in the direction from which the merchant galley had come still no sign of a sail at last he allowed himself the luxury of a sigh of relief i truly dont think theyre coming after us he said euge the sailors yelled again how does your leg feel kallianax sostratos asked anxiously its still sore as can be young sir the sailor answered itll stay sore a while longer too i reckon his doric drawl was thicker than most you dont get shot without having it hurt by the gods i wish you did i understand that sostratos said but is it hot is it inflamed is there any pus in it no none of that there stuff kallianax said it just hurts as long as it doesnt swell or turn red or start oozing pus though its healing the way it should sostratos told him you keep pouring wine on it too kallianax made a face thats easy for you to say its not your leg wine makes it burn like fire yes i know sostratos said but it does help make you better do you want to lose a longterm advantage because of some pain now if a wound goes bad it can kill youve seen thati know you have well yes but i dont figure this here one would kallianax said please dont take the chance sostratos said with obvious reluctance the sailor dipped his head sostratos resolved to keep an eye on him to make sure he did as he was told some people did habitually place the short term ahead of the long he knew that knew it as a fact without altogether understanding it menedemos laughed when he said as much i can think of a couple of reasons why its so his cousin said enlighten me o best one sostratos said that only made menedemos laugh more i know you my dear you cant fool me whenever you get too polite for your own good that means you dont think i can enlighten you some people are fools plain and simple they wouldnt care about month after next if you whacked them over the head with it but are they fools by nature or only because they havent been educated to be anything else sostratos asked he expected a neat eitheror answer that was how hed been educated but menedemos said probably some of each some people are fools like i said theyll act like idiots whether theyre educated or not otherswho knows maybe you can show some people that folly is folly sostratos grunted his cousins reply wasnt neat but it made a good deal of sense fair enough he said and started to turn away but menedemos said hold on i wasnt done no sostratos said go on then thank you so much an ironical menedemos was a dangerous creature indeed go on he did if the reward you get now is big enough you wont care about trouble later on either after alexandros chose aphrodite above hera and athene he got helen to keep his bed warm do you think he worried about what might happen to troy later on account of that not likely there you go making comparisons about women again sostratos said menedemos didnt let go of the steeringoar tillers but he made as if to bow even so but sostratos after a little thought had to admit yes thats probably true too are you enlightened then menedemos asked i suppose i am good menedemos grinned you have any more of these little problems just bring them to me ill set you straight go howl sostratos said which only made menedemos laugh more the aphrodite put in at several towns along the lykian coast not so much to do business as because the coastal cities held by ptolemaios garrisons were the only safe halting places in that stretch of the world if none was near when the sun went down the merchant galley spent the night well offshore another reason the rhodians didnt do much business in the lykian towns was the hope they would get higher prices for their goods in the aegean the following spring than they could hereabouts phoenician merchants sometimes brought their own goods this far west few of them got to the poleis of hellas proper one of ptolemaios officers in myra bought a couple of amphorai of byblian for a symposion he was planning to put on this will give the boys something to drink they havent had before he said id think so yes sostratos agreed how do you like being stationed here how do i like it the soldier made a horrible face my dear sir if the world needed an enema theyd stick the syringe in right here that jerked a laugh from sostratos and menedemos both the officer went on the lykians are jackals nothing else but and if you killed every single one of them you wouldnt do yourself any good because these mountains would just fill up with other human jackals in no time flat this kind of country is made for bandits and pirates sostratos said and he and menedemos took turns telling of their fight out on the inner sea you were lucky ptolemaios officer said when they finished oh i dont doubt youre good sailors and you have a good crew but you were lucky all the same i prefer to think we were skillful menedemos had his share of faults but modesty had never been among them dryly sostratos said i prefer to think we were skillful too but theres no denying we were luckyand we caught the pirates by surprise were rhodians menedemos said if we cant outdo a rabble like that we hardly deserve our freedom our friend herehe dipped his head to the soldierwishes he could scour the mountains clean i wish we could do the same to the shore and burn every triakonter and pentekonter and hemiolia we find that would be good sostratos said that would be wonderful the officer said dont hold your breath menedemos puffed out his cheeks like a frog inflating its throat sac in springtime sostratos chuckled so did the soldier who served ptolemaios menedemos said sadly though its no wonder most of this town is set back fifteen or twenty stadia from the sea everyone in these parts expects pirates takes them for granted and even plans cities taking them into account and thats wrong dont you see he spoke with unwonted earnestness no its right if you want to keep your city from getting sacked ptolemaios officer said i understand what my cousin is saying sostratos told him he means people should fight pirates instead of accepting them as part of life i agree with him i hate pirates oh i agree with him too about what people should do the officer said what they will do thoughthats liable to be another story much as sostratos would have liked to argue with him he couldnt the rest of the trip along the lykian coast went smoothly one triakonter came dashing out from the mouth of a stream when the aphrodite sailed past but thought better of tangling with her a single pirate ship even if she carried a large boarding party along with her rowers was anything but certain of seizing the merchant galley cowards the sailors from the aphrodite yelled as the triakonter turned about and headed back toward shore whitelivered dogs spineless stoneless eunuchs to sostratos enormous relief those shouts didnt infuriate the pirates enough to make them turn back later he asked menedemos why do they yell things like that do they really want a fight with the polluted lykians i dont think so his cousin answered i certainly hope not anyway but wouldnt you yell your scorn if a foe decided he didnt care to have anything to do with you are you going to tell me youve never done anything like that in your life thinking about it sostratos had to toss his head no i cant do that but i can tell you ill try not to do it again it just isnt sensible well maybe it isnt menedemos said but so what people arent always sensible they dont always want to be sensible you have trouble understanding that sometimes if you want to know what i think people should want to be sensible sostratos said ptolemaios officer had it straight my dear what people should want and what they do want are two different beasts rhodes lay only a days sailor a bit more if the winds were badwest of patara sostratos and menedemos picked up a few more hams there to sell at home menedemos said i was thinking of going up to kaunos for a last stop but to the crows with it i want to get back to my own polis again i wont quarrel with you my dear sostratos answered well have a nice profit to show and itll get better still once we sell everything were bringing back from phoenicia no one can complain about what we did in the east ha menedemos said darkly that only shows you dont know my father as well as you think you do sostratos had always thought menedemos troubles with his father were partly his own fault but he knew telling his cousin as much would do no good at all and would make menedemos angry at him so he sighed and shrugged and dipped his head murmuring maybe youre right the sailors cheered when they learned menedemos intended to sail straight for rhodes they wanted to go home too when the northerly breeze went fitful they clamored to take a turn at the oars breeze or no the aphrodite cut through the waters of the inner sea like a knife through meat boiled tender with his wounded leg kallianax still found rowing painful using a spearshaft as a stick hed taken his place on the foredeck as lookout the merchant galley was only a couple of hours out of patara when he called sail ho sail ho dead ahead better not be another godscursed pirate not so close to rhodes menedemos growled his hands tightened on the tillers till his knuckles whitened that same thought had just crossed sostratos mind he stood on the poop deck not far from menedemos and diokles like both of them he peered toward the new ship having the sun at their backs helped and shes really closing the distance hand over fist isnt she sostratos murmured a few minutes later she sure is his cousin sounded worried ive never seen anything honest move so fast he shouted serve out the weapons by the gods whoever she is she wont have an easy time with us but then from the bow kallianax called shes got a foresail skipper belay the weapons menedemos called any galley big enough to carry foresail as well as mainsail was also big enough to carry a crew that could overwhelm the aphrodites without breathing hard was in fact almost surely a war galley not a pirate ship shading his eyes with the palm of his hand sostratos said whats that emblem painted on her sails isnt it isnt it the rhodian rose he hesitated for fear of being wrong but menedemos whose eyes were probably sharper than his dipped his head it is by the gods he shouted again this time in joyous relief shes one of our own boys the sailors whooped and clapped their hands but after a moment in more nearly normal tones he went on but which one of our own is she shes not a regular trireme or youd see marines stomping around up on her decking and her oarbox would be fully timbered to keep arrows and catapult bolts from tearing up the rowers but shes too big and too fast for anything else what in the name of the gods could she be a lamp went on inside sostratos head my dear to the crows with me if shes not your trihemiolia do you think so menedemos rarely sounded awed but this sostratos thought was one of those times do you really think so what else could she be sostratos asked shes very new look how pale and unweathered her planking is whatever she was she was curious about the aphrodite as she drew near sostratos saw she did indeed have three banks of oars her crew had stowed the rear benches of the upper thalamite bank so she could lower mast yard and mainsail in a hurry but those hadnt come down yet an officer at the bow called the inevitable challenge what ship are you were the aphrodite out of rhodes and bound for home from phoenicia menedemos yelled back and what ship are you youre a trihemiolia arent you you must be a rhodian or you wouldnt know the name the officer answered yes were the dikaiosyne justice sostratos murmured a good name for a pirate hunter the officer on the dikaiosyne went on the aphrodite you say whos your skipper there is that menedemos son of philodemos thats me menedemos said proudly youre the chap who had the idea for a ship like this arent you i heard admiral eudemos say so thats me menedemos repeated even more proudly than before he grinned at sostratos and now i know how it feels to look at my baby and i didnt even get a slave girl pregnant sostratos snorted and grinned back menedemos walked with sostratos through a poor quarter of rhodes the southwestern part of the polis not far from the wall and not far from the cemetery south of it with a sigh menedemos said this is the sort of duty i wish we didnt have i know sostratos answered i feel the same way but that only makes it more important we do a good job i suppose so menedemos sighed again skinny naked children played in the street even skinnier dogs squabbled over garbage they eyed the children warily maybe they were afraid the children would throw rocks at them maybe they were afraid they would get caught and killed and thrown into a pot in this part of town they probably had reason to worry a drunk staggered out of a wineshop he stared at menedemos and sostratos then turned his back on them hiked up his tunic and pissed against a wall o pat menedemos called pointing to one of the children he would have said boy to a slave just the same way what do you want the boy who was about eight asked suspiciously where is the house of aristaion son of aristeas the boy assumed a look of congenital imbecility not knowing whether to sigh one more time or burst out laughing menedemos took an obolos from between his cheek and his teeth and held out the small wet silver coin in the palm of his hand the boy rushed up and snatched it he popped it into his own mouth his friends howled with rage and jealousy me me they clamored you should have asked me youve got your money now menedemos said in a friendly voice tell me what i want to know or ill wallop the stuffing out of you there was language the youngster understood go over two blocks then turn right itll be on the lefthand side of the street next door to the dyers place good thanks menedemos turned to sostratos come on my dear and mind the dog turd there we dont want to step in it barefoot no indeed sostratos agreed they had no trouble identifying the dyers the reek of stale urine gave it away next to it stood a small neat house that like a lot of homes in a neighborhood such as this doubled as a shop several pots nothing especially fancy but all sturdy and well shaped stood on a counter menedemos wondered how much the stink from the dyeworks hurt the potters trade it couldnt help help you gents the potter asked he was a man of about fifty balding with what was left of his hair and his beard quite gray except for the beard he looked like an older version of aristeidas to be sure menedemos asked are you aristaion son of aristeas thats me the man replied im afraid youve got the edge on me though best one for i dont know you or your friend menedemos and sostratos introduced themselves aristaions workworn face lit up oh of course aristeidas captain and toikharkhos by the gods my boy tells me more stories about the two of you and your doings i didnt know the aphrodited got home this year for youve beaten him back here menedemos winced this was going to be even harder than hed feared he said im afraid thats why weve come now most noble one sostratos dipped his head i dont understand aristaion said but then suddenly his eyes filled with fear he flinched as if menedemos had threatened him with a weapon or are you going to tell me somethings happened to aristeidas im sorry menedemos said miserably he was killed by robbers in ioudaia my cousin was with him when it happened hell tell you more sostratos told the story of the fight with the ioudaian bandits for the benefit of aristeidas father he changed it a little saying the sailor had taken a spear in the chest not the belly and died at once im sure he felt no pain he said not a word about cutting aristeidas throat but finished we all miss him very much both for his keen eyeshe was the man who spotted the bandits coming after usand for the fine man he was i wish with all my heart it could have been otherwise he fought bravely and his wound was at the front that was undoubtedly true aristaion listened without a word he blinked a couple of times he heard what sostratos said but as yet it meant nothing menedemos set a leather sack on the counter here is his pay sir for the whole journey he took with us i know it can never replace aristeidas but it is what we can do like a man still half in a dream aristaion tossed his head no thats not right he said you must take out whatever silver hed already drawnotherwise you unjustly deprive yourselves dont worry about that menedemos said for one thing he drew very littleas youll know he saved his silver and for another this is the least we can do to show what we thought of your son when he died everyone on the aphrodite was heartbroken sostratos added and that was nothing but the truth too when he died aristaion finally seemed not only to hear but to believe he let out a lowvoiced moan then reached under the counter and brought out a knife grunting with effort and with pain he used it to haggle off a mourning lock the gray hair lay on the counter menedemos took the knife and added a lock of his own hair so did sostratos the lock hed cut off in loudaia was beginning to grow out again he sacrificed another without hesitation he was my only boy that lived aristaion said in a faraway voice i had two others but they both died young i hoped hed take this place after me maybe he would have in the end but he always wanted to go to sea what am i going to do now by the gods o best ones what am i going to do now menedemos had no answer for that he looked to sostratos his cousin stood there biting his lip not far from tears plainly he had no answer either for some things there were no answers i mourned my father aristaion said that was hard but its part of the natural order of things when a son mourns a father when a father has to mourn a son though i would rather have died myself you know the sun glinted off the tears sliding down his cheeks im sorry menedemos whispered and sostratos dipped his head no for some things there were no answers at all thank you gentlemen for bringing me the news aristaion said with haggard dignity will you drink wine with me of course said menedemos who wanted nothing more than to get away again sostratos dipped his head without speaking if anything he probably wanted to escape even more than menedemos did but this was part of what needed doing wait then aristaion said and ducked back into the part of the building where he lived he came out a moment later with a tray with water wine a mixing bowl and three cups he must have made the bowl and the cups himself for they looked very much like the pots he was selling after mixing the wine he poured for menedemos and sostratos then poured a small libation onto the ground at his feet the two cousins imitated him aristaion lifted his cup for aristeidas he said for aristeidas menedemos echoed for aristeidas sostratos said if he hadnt spotted the bandits coming we all might have died there in ioudaiaand other times before that out on the sea he was a good man to have on our ship and ill miss him everyone who sailed with him will miss him thank you kindly young sir youre generous to say such a thing aristaion raised the cup to his lips and drank menedemos and sostratos also drank to their shipmates memory the wine was better than menedemos would have expected it to be like the ware aristaion made it suggested the best taste not a great deal of money could buy i wonder why these things happen sostratos said why good men die young while those who are not so good live on and on menedemos knew he was thinking about teleutas his cousin took another sip of wine then continued men who love wisdom have always wondered such things it was the will of the gods aristaion said in front of troy akhilleus had a short life too but people still sing about him even now he murmured the opening of the iliad ragesing goddess of akhilleus sostratos had often wrangled with menedemos about whether the iliad and odyssey deserved to hold their central place in hellenic life he wasnt always the most tactful of men there were times especially in what he saw as pursuit of the truth when he was among the least tactful menedemos got ready to kick him in the ankle if he wanted to argue philosophy today but he only dipped his head once more and murmured just so most noble one nor will aristeidas be forgotten so long as any one of us who knew him still lives menedemos took a long pull at his own wine he silently mouthed euge at sostratos his cousin only shrugged a tiny shrug as if to say he hadnt done anything worth praise hed remembered the occasion to menedemos that was plenty only later did he wonder whether that was unfair to sostratos the two of them let aristaion fill their cups again then they made their farewells thank you both again young sirs for coming and telling me telling me what had to be told aristeidas father said it was the least we could do menedemos said we wish we didnt have to do it thats all yes sostratos said softly by the distant look in his eyes he was back among those ioudaian boulders again oh yes they gave aristaion their sympathies one last time and left the potters shop they hadnt gone far before a woman started to shriek behind them wincing menedemos said aristaion must have told his wife yes sostratos agreed they walked on for a few more paces before he went on lets go back to your house or mine and get drunk shall we theres nothing more we really have to do today is there nothing that wont keep menedemos put an arm around sostratos shoulder thats a good ideathe best one youve had all day im sure will we think so in the morning sostratos asked menedemos shrugged that will be in the morning well worry about it then sostratos opened his eyes and wished he hadnt the earlymorning sunlight leaking in through the shutters pained him his head hurt his bladder seemed about to burst he reached under the bed and found the chamber pot after easing himself he went to the window opened the shutters called coming out to warn anyone walking by below and flung the contents of the pot into the street then still moving slowly he went downstairs and sat down in the cool shadowed courtyard a few minutes later threissa the familys redheaded thracian slave girl poked her snub nose into the courtyard sostratos waved to her he saw her wondering if she could get away with pretending not to see and deciding she couldnt she came over to him what do you want young master she asked in accented greek every so often he took her to bed she put up with that rather than enjoying it one reason he didnt do it more it wasnt what he had in mind now he said fetch me a cup of wellwatered wine and a chunk of bread to go with it relief flowered on her face i do that she said and hurried away some requests she minded much less than others sostratos didnt even eye her backside as she went off to the kitchen proof hed drunk too much the day before she soon returned with the wine and a barley roll here you is roll just baked sure enough it was still warm from the oven thanks sostratos said he made as if to push her away go on im sure youve got plenty to do she nodded and left him by himself he took a bite from the roll it was nice and bland just what his stomach needed he sipped the wine a little at a time bit by bit his headache eased hed almost finished breakfast when his father came downstairs hail lysistratos called how are you better now than when i first got up sostratos answered the wine helped pity its not springtime lysistratos said raw cabbage is good for a thick head but this is the wrong season he walked over and sat down beside his son i understand why you and menedemos did what you did losing a man is hard sometimes telling his family hes gone is even harder yes sostratos dipped his head his father was such a gentleman and then as we were leaving his mother began to wail he grabbed the winecup and gulped the last couple of swallows a bad business a very bad business lysistratos hesitated then went on i hear you made something of a hero of yourself in the same fight with a shrug sostratos said my archery isnt hopeless i should have shot more of the bandits though if i had we wouldnt have had to pay a call on aristaion yesterday he wished he had more wine what hed already drunk had taken the edge off his headache but another cup might take the edge off his thoughts he looked around for threissa then decided it was just as well he didnt see her a man who started pouring it down early in the morning wouldnt be worth much as the day wore along lysistratos said what do you plan on doing today ill go over to see damonax and settle accounts with him sostratos answered the olive oil worked out better than i expected but im not going to fill the aphrodite up with it if we go to athens next spring that would be like taking crimson dye to phoenicia if he cant see as much for himself ill make it as plain as i have to i understand his father smiled i dont think youll have to beat him about the head and shoulders or anything of the sort uncle philodemos and i made it plain to him that he pushed his luck this past spring we let him get away with it once because of his own familys debts but were not going to let him be a permanent anchor weighing down our familys profits euge sostratos said how did he take that pretty well lysistratos replied he is a charming fellow no two ways about it yes but especially when hes getting his way sostratos said which made his father laugh he went on i hope i see erinna when im there is she happy with damonax she seems to be lysistratos said and did you hear last night shes going to have a baby in a few months sostratos tossed his head no i didnt thats wonderful news i know how much she wants a family he hesitated then asked if it happens to be a girl will they keep it or expose it i dont know his father said i hope theyd keep it but thats damonaxs choice not mine he looked troubled it would be hard very hard for your sister finally to give birth and then to lose the baby i know thats just what i was thinking sostratos said but his father was right that wasnt anything where the two of them had a say he ate the last bit of barley roll then got to his feet ill head over there now ive got the figures written down on a scrap of papyrus with a little luck ill catch damonax before hes gone to the agora or the gymnasion farewell father farewell lysistratos got up too and clapped him on the back you did very well in phoeniciaon the whole voyage from all ive heard dont be too hard on yourself because you werent perfect perfection is for the gods everyone told sostratos the same thing hed told it to himself a good many times too that he had to keep telling it to himself showed he still didnt believe it he wondered if he ever would shrugging he headed for the door damonaxs house lay in the western part of rhodes not far from the gymnasion it was far larger and finer than aristaions and presented only a whitewashed wall and doorway to the outside world damonax who made his money from lands outside the polis didnt need a shop at the front munching on some raisins hed bought from a street peddler sostratos knocked on the door he remembered coming here during erinnas wedding celebration and before that when hed shown damonax the gryphons skull he sighed if hed taken six minai of silver from the man who would become his brotherinlaw the pirates in the strait between euboia and andros wouldnt have had the chance to steal the skull he knocked again im coming a slave shouted in good greek a moment later the fellow opened a little barred shutter set into the door at eye level and peered out oh hail master sostratos he said and opened the door itself come in sir the master will be glad to see you thank you sostratos said i hope damonax is well and my sister too i hear from my father shes expecting a baby yes thats right the slave answered theyre both as well as anyone could hope here sir its a nice day why dont you sit down on this bench in the courtyard ill let damonax know youre here he raised his voice to a shout master erinnas brother is back from overseas erinnas brother sostratos thought with wry amusement that was probably how hed be known here for the rest of his life well fair enough he perched on the bench the slave had suggested and looked around the first things his eye lit upon were the flowerbed and herb garden in the courtyard he smiled they looked much more like those back at his familys house than they had the last time he was here erinna was an enthusiastic gardener and was making her mark felt the slave came back to him hell be here in just a bit would you like some wine sir and some almonds or olives almonds please sostratos answered thanks very much damonax and the slave returning with the snack came into the courtyard at the same time sostratos rose and clasped his brotherinlaws hand hail damonax said with a smile that showed off his white teeth he was as handsome and well groomed as ever hed rubbed a scented oil into his skin so that he smelled sweet had it been a little stronger it would have been annoying as things were it just marked him as a man who enjoyed fine things hail sostratos echoed and congratulations i thank you very much damonaxs smile got broader he sounded pleased and reasonably contented with life and with his marriage sostratos hoped he was that would be likely to mean erinna was contented too do sit down again best one make yourself at home kind of you sostratos said the slave served the two of them and withdrew sostratos ate an almond he inclined his head to damonax roasted with garlic tasty im fond of them that way glad you like them too his brotherinlaw replied he made polite small talk his manners had always been almost too perfect only after a quarter hour of chitchat and gossip about what had gone on in rhodes while sostratos was away did damonax begin to come to the point i hope your voyage was successful and profitable well end up doing quite well for ourselves i think sostratos said though much of what we boughtbalsam and crimson dye and the byblian especiallywell have to resell before we can realize the profit im sure well make i understand damonax said i trust my oil was well received he was tense but trying hard not to show it here was the meat of the business sure enough the quality was good sostratos answered we sold most of it in sidon here is what we made for it he took out the scrap of papyrus on which hed worked out just how much silver the olive oil had earned when damonax saw the number at the bottom his face lit up but this is wonderful he exclaimed its quite a bit more than i expected ill be able to pay off a good many debts im glad to hear it best one sostratos said even so though as i hear my father and uncle told you i dont expect well want another cargo of olive oil when we go out next spring im letting you know now so you cant say were pulling a surprise on you then but why not when you did so well his brotherinlaw said you made money with it yes but not so much money as with other goods that have more value and less bulk sostratos replied and i must say i think we were lucky to do as well as we did this past sailing season i doubt we could come close to matching what we made if we go to athens as looks likely athens exports oil you dont bring it there damonax whistled a low unhappy note youre very frank arent you i have to be wouldnt you say sostratos replied youre part of my family now i did business for you and im glad it went so well you need to understand why i dont believe it would go that well again i have nothing against you or your oil in bulk on a round ship without the great cost of paying an akatos crew every day it would do splendidly but the aphrodite truly isnt the right ship to carry it menedemos feels the same even more strongly than i do does he damonax said sostratos dipped his head damonax grunted and hes the captain and hes not married to your sister both those things are also true sostratos agreed trying to soften the disagreement he went on this isnt malice most noble oneonly business silver doesnt spring from the ground like soldiers after kadmos sowed the dragons teeth oh yes i do understand that his brotherinlaw managed a wry grin my own reverses these past couple of years have made me all too painfully aware of it how angry was he not too or he would have shown it more openly hellenes looked down their noses at men who felt one thing but feigned another how could you trust anyone like that simpleyou couldnt sostratos said may i see my sister for a few minutes id like to congratulate her myself as erinnas husband damonax could say yes or no as he chose certainly nothing scandalous about it not when youre her brother he murmured well why not he called for a slave woman to bring her down from the womens quarters by the haste with which erinna appeared in the courtyard she must have hoped sostratos would ask after her hail she said taking his hands in his its good to see you good to see you my dear he answered you look well im glad and im very glad youre going to have a child i was happier than i can say when father told me her eyes glowed when she smiled she freed her right hand setting it on her belly when she did that sostratos could see the beginning of a bulge there under her long chiton so far everything seems to be well she said youll have a nephew before you sail next spring she didnt even mention the possibility of a girl thatll be fine sostratos said and then stuck fast as he cast about wondering what to say next he and erinna couldnt talk the way they had back at his familys house not with damonax standing there listening to every word hed been foolish to imagine they could by his sisters expression she was realizing the same thing he sighed id better be going its wonderful youre going to have a baby ill help spoil him for the two of you damonax chuckled at that in an indulgent husbandly way erinna smiled but looked disappointed as sostratos turned and headed for the doorway for a moment he wondered why he could tell she too knew they couldnt talk the way they had in the old days what point to pretending they could then he thought you can go out that door you can do what you please in the city erinnas a respectable wife that means she has to stay here such restrictions had chafed at her back when she was living in her fathers house they were even stronger even harsher for a married woman take care of yourself erinna called after him and you my dear sostratos answered and you he hurried away then not wanting to look back philodemos sat in the andron drinking wine and eating olives when menedemos started out of the house he wanted to pretend he didnt see his fathers wave he wanted to yes but he didnt have the nerve he stopped and waved back hail father he said what can i do for you come here philodemos sounded as peremptory as usual you dont need to go drinking or whoring right this minute do you menedemos hackles rose his father always assumed he was in the wrong sometimes he was of course but not always im coming he replied with what dignity he could as a matter of fact though i was going to the agora not out drinking or whoring thats easy enough for you to say philodemos rolled his eyes up to the heavens i cant prove youre wrong by his tone the matter of proof was just a detail after helping himself to an olive from the bowl on the table in front of his father menedemos tried a thrust of his own youre the one with the wine cup here yes and its properly watered too his father snapped do you want a taste so you can tell for yourself no never mind menedemos said why did you call me except to carp at me he added but only to himself that would have made things worse why did i call you philodemos echoed he took a pull from the cup himself perhaps to disguise his confusion menedemos wondered if hed called for any real reason at all or just for the sake of exasperating him at last philodemos said about the eastern route yes thats it about the eastern route do you think we can use it every year that was a legitimate question menedemos could hardly deny as much he said we can sir but i dont think wed be wise its not just pirates the war between antigonos and ptolemaios looks to be heating up any ship at all heading for phoenicia is taking a chance these days philodemos grunted if you talk that way we never should have sent the aphrodite perhaps we shouldnt have menedemos agreed his father didnt just grunt this time he blinked in astonishment you really do say that you the fellow who took the ship through a carthaginian siege into syracuse a couple of years ago ears heating menedemos dipped his head yes father i do say that taking the aphrodite to syracuse was one risk as soon as we got past the carthaginian fleet we were fine but theres risk every digit of the way between here and phoenicia from pirates and from the macedonian marshals we got into trouble and i think almost any ship heading that way would we came out the other side all right whether another ship would well who knows maybe you really are starting to grow up a little philodemos muttered more to himself than to menedemos who would have believed that father menedemos broke off he didnt want to quarrel if he could help it that being so he kept talking about the struggle between the marshals did alexander the greats sister ever get out of sardis when we headed east there was talk she wanted to get away from antigonos and go over to ptolemaios did old oneeye let kleopatra get away with it we never heard anything after that going to sidon or coming back kleopatras dead does that answer your question philodemos replied oimoi menedemos exclaimed though he wasnt really much surprised so antigonos did her in he says not philodemos answered but when she tried to leave sardis his governor there wouldnt let her go later on some of her serving women murdered her they wouldnt have done it if the governor hadnt told them to and he wouldnt have told them to if antigonos hadnt told him to he made a show of putting them to death afterwards but then he would yes menedemos clicked his tongue between his teeth sostratos called that one when we first heard kleopatra wanted to get away from antigonos she wouldnt marry him and she was too valuable a prize for him to let any of the other marshals have her he sighed so now none of alexander s kin is left alive these macedonians are bloodthirsty bastards arent they that they are philodemos dipped his head and your cousin is a clever fellow which means you arent menedemos heard the addition even though his father didnt say it it stung it always did and then philodemos quivered like a dog taking a scent or are you telling me we shouldnt go back to sidon because you made it impossible for any ship from our family to go back to sidon whose wife did you debauch while you were there the garrison commanders maybe nobodys by the gods menedemos said is that the truth but philodemos checked himself before menedemos became really angry you dont lie about your adulteries i will say that if anything you revel in them all right then thats good news i didnt have any adulteries to revel in as i say menedemos replied sostratos didan innkeepers wife down in ioudaiabut not me sostratos your cousin seduced another mans wife his father said menedemos dipped his head philodemos clapped a hand to his forehead papai what is the younger generation coming to probably about the same as yours did and the one before yours and the one before that and the one before that menedemos said with a cheerful grin aristophanes complained about the younger generation a hundred years ago well what if he did philodemos retorted he was an athenian and everybody knows about them you and your cousin are rhodians good people sensible people what about nestor in the iliad menedemos said he complained about the younger generation too that gave philodemos pause he loved homer no less than menedemos did menedemos had got his fondness for the iliad and odyssey from his father philodemos returned the best answer he could you cant tell me we hellenes havent gone downhill since the days of the heroes maybe menedemos said speaking of going downhill how many speeches did xanthos give in the assembly while i was away his father sent him a sour stare xanthos was a man of philodemos generation was in fact a friend of philodemos he was also a great and crashing bore philodemos could hardly deny that to his credit he didnt try probably too many he answered then to forestall menedemos he added and yes he gave them all over again first chance he got whenever he saw me and hows sikon menedemos asked ive hardly had the chance to say good day to him but those were some very nice eels last night dont you think ive always liked eels philodemos said and sikon is as well as a cook can be he rolled his eyes again cooks hadand deserveda reputation for tyrannizing the households in which they lived is he still quarreling with your wife menedemos asked cautiously the less he spoke about baukis around his father the better he was sure of that but he couldnt ignore her feud with sikon the way the two of them stormed at each other the whole neighborhood had trouble ignoring it they still dont get along as well as they might philodemos said you really ought to do something about that father menedemos again seized the chance to take the offensive wait till you have a wife wait till youre running a household with a temperamental cookand theres no other kind philodemos said better they should yell at each other than that they should both yell at me to menedemos that seemed a cowards counsel he said better they shouldnt yell you ought to put your foot down ha his father said how many times have i put my foot down with you how much good has it done me i wasnt the one who chased women this summer menedemos said his father snorted at the qualification but he pressed on and i wasnt the one who loaded so much olive oil onto the aphrodite either noi was the one who not only sold it but got a cursed good price for it too i told you beforewe wont have to worry about that again philodemos said damonax and his family needed the silver that oil brought sometimes theres no help for something sometimes theres no help for the kinsfolk one has by the way he looked at menedemos he wasnt thinking of damonax alone if youll excuse me father menedemos said and left the andron before he found out whether philodemos would excuse him he stormed out of the house too if philodemos tried to call him back he made himself not hear why do i bother he wondered whatever i do it will never satisfy him and knowing it will never satisfy him why do i get so angry when it doesnt but the answer to that was all too obvious hes my father if a man cant please his own father what sort of man is he sparrows hopped around pecking in the dirt for whatever they could find menedemos pointed at one of them which fluttered off for a few cubits but then lit again and went back to pecking is your father angry at you because you dont gather enough seeds to suit him the bird bounced this way and that whatever worries it hadkestrels snakes ferretsits father wasnt among them ah little bird you dont know when youre well off the day was warm and bright the shutters to the upstairs windows were open to let in air and light they let out music baukis was softly singing to herself as she spun wool into thread the song was one any girl might have sung to help make time go by while she did a job that needed doing but wasnt very interesting her voice though true enough was nothing out of the ordinary listening to her though made menedemos wish his ears were plugged with wax as odysseus had been when he sailed past the sweetly singing sirens he clenched his fists till his nails bit into his palms its always worse when im angry at father and im angry at him so much of the time he fled his own house as if the furies pursued him and so maybe they did sostratos bowed to himilkon in the phoenicians crowded harborside warehouse peace be unto you my master he said in aramaic and to you also peace the merchant replied in the same language returning his bow your slave hopes the poor teaching he gave to you proved of some small use on your journey indeed deliberately sostratos nodded instead of dipping his head your servant came here to give his thanks for your generous assistance himilkon raised a thick dark eyebrow you speak better much better now than you did when you sailed for phoenicia not only are you more fluent but your accent has improved i suppose that comes from hearing and speaking the language so much sostratos said still in aramaic i could not have done it though if you had not started me down the road you are kind my master more kind than you need be himilkons face still wore that measuring expression he scratched at his curly black beard most men could not have done it at all i think this is especially true of ionians who expect everyone to know greek and do not take kindly to the idea of learning a foreign language that is not altogether true sostratos said though he knew it was to a large degree even menedemos learned a few words while he was in sidon truly himilkon raised that eyebrow again he must have met a pretty woman there eh well no or i dont think so sostratos was too honest to lie to the phoenician as a matter of fact i was the one who met a pretty woman therein jerusalem not sidon did you that surprises me himilkon said i would not have guessed the ioudaioi had any pretty women he didnt bother hiding his scorn did you see how strange and silly their customs are they are wild for their god no doubt of that sostratos said but still my master why worry about them they will never amount to anything not when they are trapped away from the sea in a small stretch of land no one else wants you can say thisyou are an ionian himilkon answered your people have never had much trouble with them we phoenicians have tell me more my master sostratos said there was the time for instance when a petty king among the ioudaioi wed the daughter of the king of sidoniezebel her name was himilkon said she wanted to keep on giving reverence to her own gods whilst she lived amongst the ioudaioi did they let her no when she kept on trying they killed her and fed her to their dogs her the daughter of a king and the wife of a king they fed her to the dogs can you imagine such a people shocking sostratos said but it didnt much surprise him he could easily picture the ioudaioi doing such a thing he went on i think though that they will become more civilized as they deal with us ionians maybe himilkon said the maybe of a man too polite to say nonsense to someone he liked i for one though will believe it when i see it sostratos didnt care to argue either not when hed come to thank the phoenician for his aramaic lessons bowing again he said your slave is grateful for your hearkening unto him and now must depart may the gods keep you safe himilkon said bowing back to him sostratos made his way out of the warehouse past shelves piled high with treasures and others piled even higher with trash himilkon no doubt would be as passionate about selling the trash as he would the treasure he was a merchant down to the very tips of his toes after the gloom inside himilkons lair the bright morning sun sparkling off the water of the great harbor made sostratos blink and rub his eyes till he got used to it he saw menedemos talking with a carpenter over at the base of a quay a plethron or so away waving he walked over toward them his cousin clapped the carpenter on the back saying ill see you later khremes and came toward him hail how are you not bad sostratos answered yourself i could be worse menedemos said i could be better but i could be worse were you making horrible growling and hissing noises with himilkon i was speaking aramaic yes you cant say my learning it didnt come in handy no i dont suppose i can menedemos agreed after all you never would have been able to seduce that innkeepers wife if you hadnt been able to speak her language that isnt what i meant sostratos said i was talking about the beeswax and the balsam and the embroidered cloth and the help i gave you in sidon i think of those things and what do you talk about what else but a woman im entitled to talk about her i didnt go to bed with her menedemos said i didnt go to bed with anybody this sailing season unless you count whoresand i wouldnt believe me you were the one who had the good time it wasnt that good a time sostratos said it was strange and sad his cousin started to sing a melancholy love song the object of the lovers affection in the song was a pretty boy but that didnt stop menedemos oh go howl sostratos said it wasnt like that either the lovemaking itself had been fine he would have remembered it fondly if zilpah hadnt changed her mind about him the moment the two of them finished but she had and he couldnt do anything about it now well what was it like menedemos asked with a leer to keep from having to answer sostratos looked out to sea he pointed hello he said what ship is that such a question would always draw a merchant skippers attention menedemos turned and looked out to sea too shading his eyes with the palm of his hand to the crows with me if thats not the dikaiosyne coming back from her cruise he replied shall we go over to the naval harbor and get a good close look at her why not best one sostratos said though he couldnt help adding we almost got a closer look at her than we wanted while we were coming back to rhodes oh nonsense menedemos said a trihemiolias made to hunt piratesthats the whole point of the type of course shes going to come up to any galley she spots and sniff around like a dog at another dogs backside you always did have a gift for the pungent figure of speech sostratos said whereupon his cousin held his nose chuckling they walked up to the naval harbor which lay just to the north of the great harbor like the latter it had long moles protecting its waters from wind and weather shipsheds lined it so the rhodian naval vessels could be hauled up out of the sea keeping their timbers dry and them light and swift the narrower sheds sheltered piratehunting triremes the wider ones warded the fives that would fight against any navy presuming to move against rhodes pointing to the dikaiosyne which had entered the harbor by way of the northfacing entrance menedemos said they wont have had to build anything special for her shell fit into the same shed as any trireme true sostratos dipped his head the trihemiolia put him in mind of a trireme stripped of everything that added even a drakhmas worth of extra weight triremes these days had their projecting oarboxes through which the upper or thranite oarsmen rowed covered over with planking to protect them from arrows not the dikaiosyne hers was open nor was she fully decked to let her post a maximum complement of marines only a narrow stretch of decking ran down her midline from foredeck to poop backing oars the dikaiosynes crew positioned her just in front of a shipshed a couple of naked slaves came out of the shed and fitted a stout cable to the ships sternpost one of them turned his head and shouted back toward the shed more slaves inside hauled at an enormous capstan the line went taut little by little the work gang hauled the trihemiolia out of the sea and up the sloping ramp inside the shipshed the beech planking of her protective false keel scraped on the timbers of the ramp as soon as the ships stern came out of the water the slaves at the capstan paused sailors and marines began leaving the dikaiosyne lightening her so the haulers would have an easier time easier though was a relative term sostratos wouldnt have cared to bend his back and push against one of the great bars of the capstan he and menedemos waved to the trihemiolias crew hail best ones menedemos called how was the hunting good answered a sailor who wore only a loincloth he laughed as we were heading away from rhodes we scared the piss out of one of our own merchant galleys coming home she looked like a pirate till we got up close we were all set to sink her and let her crew try and swim back to rhodes but they had the right answers so we let em go he spoke with a certain rough regret sostratos could laugh about it toonow he bowed to the sailor at your service sir were the toikharkhos and captain from the aphrodite is that so the fellow laughed some more as he returned the bow well i bet youre glad we did stop and ask questions then oh you might say so menedemos allowed yes you just might say so how did things go once you got to the lykian coast pretty well the sailor from the dikaiosyne replied shes fast as a galloping horse the justice is we went after one hemiolia that couldnt have been anything but a pirate most of the time those bastardsll show their heels to anything even a trireme but we didnt just keep upwe gained on her finally the fellow in charge beached her the pirates aboard her ran for the woods and got away but we sent men ashore and burned the ship euge sostratos said to the crowsto the crosswith pirates pity you couldnt have burned them too menedemos added we sank a couple of others and many goodbyes to the whipworthy rogues they carried the sailor said whoever came up with the notion for the dikaiosyne was a pretty clever fellow let me tell you and now farewell friendsim off for some wine and a go or two at a boy brothel with a wave and a smile he hurried away well you pretty clever fellow what do you think of that sostratos asked i like it menedemos said let the pirates beware by the gods heres a ship they cant hope to fight and one that can hunt them down even when they try to run i hope we build a fleet of trihemioliai a big fleet itd make things a lot safer for merchant skippers what do you think my dear im with you sostratos answered with any luck at all your name will live foreverand deserve to he expected his cousin to strut even more after that he didnt praise menedemos every day when he did menedemos had to know he meant it and to be sure such praise was well deserved but menedemos as it happened wasnt thinking about him just then with a sigh he said i could be as famous as alexander and it wouldnt be enough to suit my father hed stay convinced nobodyd ever heard of me you must exaggerate sostratos said it cant be so bad as that as a matter of fact it can be worse than that it can beand it is menedemos said thats unfortunate sostratos said and you didnt give him anything to complain about this sailing season see what a handy thing your oath was oh yes but that was sarcasm from his cousin not agreement he started railing at the whole younger generation not just at me why did he start railing at the sostratos broke off you told him about zilpah he asked in dismay im afraid i did o best one im sorry part of me is sorry anyhow he was holding you up for a paragon and i wanted to show him you were made of flesh and blood too not cast from bronze or carved in marble but that wasnt the lesson he drew i suppose i should have known it wouldnt be yes you should have for a moment sostratos was furious he discovered he couldnt hold on to his anger though never mind it cant be helped and its not as if you told him about anything i didnt do he kicked at a pebble with the side of his foot i understand the temptation now where i never did before to have a woman want you enough to give herself to you regardless of the riskthats a powerful lure no wonder you enjoy fishing in those waters no wonder at all menedemos agreed in fishing though you eat what you catch with women if you like what you catch eats you sostratos made a face at him i should have known better here i was trying to tell you id found some sympathy for what youve been doing and what do i get for it a lewd pun thats what i think all your aristophanes has gone to your heador somewhere why whatever can you mean my dear menedemos asked archly sostratos made another face menedemos went on in a more serious vein youre right though thats what makes wives more fun than whores they really want it anybody can buy a whores twat wives are different some wives are anyhow true enough some wives stay loyal to their husbands well yes but those arent the ones i meant menedemos said some wivesll give it away to just about anybody too they arent worth having that horrid harpy of an emashtart he shuddered you had the luck with women this trip believe me mine wasnt all good sostratos said mine was just about all bad menedemos said i could make it better but he tossed his head what do you mean sostratos asked nothing nothing at all not a thing menedemos answered quickly he was lying sostratos had no doubt of that but whatever the truth was his cousin wouldnt give it to him a delicious smell came from the kitchen menedemos drifted toward it sniffing like a hunting dog on the trail of a hare he stuck his nose in the door what is that he asked the cook whatever it is youve outdone yourself thanks young master sikon answered nothing fancyjust prawns baked with a little oil and cumin and some leeks nothing fancy he says menedemos came all the way in if the gods had you for a cook theyd be betternatured than they are thats kind of youmighty kind sikon scooped a prawn still in its shell off the clay baking dish and handed it to menedemos here why dont you try one supper wont be for a little while yet and i expect youre hungry starving menedemos agreed as it often did flattery had its reward holding the prawn by the tail he left the kitchen he paused just outside to peel off the shell and take a big bite then sighed ecstatically it tasted as good as it smelled he could imagine no higher praise another bite got him down to the tail he took the prawn by the very end bit gently and pulled it away from his mouth the flesh stuck in the tail came free savoring the last delicious morsel he tossed the empty tail to the ground next to the rest of the shell i hope you enjoyed that by the way baukis sounded she hoped menedemos would have choked on the prawn oh hail he told his fathers young wife all of a sudden the treat didnt seem nearly so sweet and succulent he went on i didnt notice you come into the courtyard im sure of that she sounded chillier yet you had your eyes closed while you slobbered over your seafood that stung i dont slobber menedemos said and it was good youll see for yourselfsupper wont be long im sure sikon gave you that prawn from the goodness of his heart menedemos wondered where baukis who was very young and who like any woman of good family had led a sheltered life had learned such irony well why else he asked to keep you sweet thats why baukis flared as long as you get little tidbits every now and then you dont care how much they cost your tongue is happy your tummys happy and to the crows with everything else thats not fair he said uncomfortably was sikon devious enough to do such a thing easily the next question menedemos asked himself was harder am i foolish enough to fall for a ploy like that he sighed the answer to that looked to be the same as the one before easily youre rightthats not fair but what can i do about it baukis looked and sounded on the edge of tears if the slaves in my own house wont obey me am i a wife or just a child and if no one else in the family will back me against a slave am i even a child or only a slave myself her words held a painful amount of truthcertainly painful to her but menedemos said my dear youll find yourself without allies if you pick the wrong fight im afraid thats whats happened here we really can afford to eat well so why shouldnt we she stared at him then did start to cry oh you hate me everyone hates me she stormed she spun away from him and rushed toward the stairs up she went a moment later the door to the womens quarters slammed oh a pestilence menedemos muttered now he was liable to end up with not only baukis but also his father angry at him philodemos could find any excuse for getting in a temper against him but baukis he muttered some more having her dash away from him was the last thing he wantedeven if it may be the best and safest thing for you he told himself that slamming door brought his father out into the courtyard by the gods what now philodemos asked scowling despite that scowl menedemos knew a certain amount of relief that he could be the first to tell his father what had happened if philodemos listened to baukis first he probably wouldnt heed anyone else afterwards menedemos summarized what had led to baukis abrupt departure when he finished he waited for philodemos to start railing at him but all philodemos did was slowly dip his head well maybe its for the best he said sir menedemos gaped hardly believing his ears maybe its for the best philodemos repeated her quarrel with sikons been going on far too long i didnt want to stick my nose into it one or the other of them would have bitten it off but maybe shell pay attention to you she takes you seriously though im sure i cant imagine why thank you so much menedemos murmured his father couldnt possibly praise him without stirring some vinegar in with the honey even so he was glad to learn baukis did take him seriously she didnt come downstairs for supper sikon sent some of the prawns up to her along with fine white barley rolls for sitos and a cup of wine when the slave woman brought back the dish without a prawn left on it the cook looked almost unbearably smug menedemos was tempted to smack him even philodemos noticed and said gloating isnt a good idea however harsh he was with his own son he was usually mild to the cook sikon got the point all right masterill remember he promised see that you do philodemos said clouds drifting down from the north not only warned of the beginning of the autumn rains but also brought darkness sooner than it would have come with good weather menedemos was just as glad to be back in rhodes he wouldnt have wanted to try steering the aphrodite through rain and fog and light murky at best he tossed his head no he wouldnt have wanted that at all too easy to end up aground before you even knew you were in trouble yawning he went upstairs to bed these longer nights made him want to curl up like a dormouse and sleep and sleep but he hadnt drifted off when his father came upstairs too philodemos went into the womens quarters a few minutes later the bed there started creaking rhythmically menedemos pulled his himation up over his head to smother the noise no good after a while it stopped after a much longer while he slept he woke before sunrise the next morning and tiptoed down to the kitchen for some barley rolls olive oil and wine to break his fast then sat down on a bench in the courtyard to eat he managed a wry chuckle when his gaze went to the stairs after the exertions of the night before how late would his father sleep that thought had hardly occurred to him when he heard footsteps on the stairs but it wasnt his father coming down it was baukis she paused in the doorway when she saw menedemos up before her for a moment he thought she would withdraw after a brief pause though she came out hail she said and after gathering herself good day good day he answered gravely how are you well baukis thought about that then made a slight correction well enough im glad menedemos said as if he hadnt heard the correction he didnt want to keep up a fight with her the rolls from yesterdays baking are still very good he offered no matter what she thought about sikons choices for opson she couldnt very well complain about the sitos could she she came close are they she said tonelessly menedemos dipped his head she let out a small sigh all right she murmured and went into the kitchen to get her own breakfast when she came out again menedemos shifted on the bench to give her more room to sit down she hesitated but did she poured out a small libation from her cup of wine before tearing off a chunk from a barley roll dipping it in oil and eating it sikon came out of his little downstairs room just then good day young master he said good day mistress whatever he thought about baukis he remembered philodemos warning and kept it to himself hail menedemos said he wondered if baukis would scold the cook for not being up before her and hard at work she seldom missed a chance to fuel their feud but all she said this morning was good day sikon looking both surprised and relievedhed evidently expected a snarl from her too sikon hurried into the kitchen pots clattered firewood thumped baukis let out what was unmistakably a snort of laughter hes showing off how busy he is well yes menedemos agreed the cook didnt have to make half that much noise baukis thought the same thing he really is an old fraud you know wellyes menedemos said again but he really is a good cook too you know i suppose so baukis said grudgingly she sipped from her wine i dont like quarreling with you ive never like quarreling with you menedemos said which was nothing but the truth good baukis ate some more of her barley roll this is good too she admitted licking crumbs and a smear of oil from her fingertips with a couple of quick strokes from the tip of her tongue menedemos watched entranced yes it is isnt it he said a heartbeat slower than he should have he might have been talking about the barley roll on the other hand he might not have been baukis to his relief chose to answer as if he was sikon is almost as good with sitos as he is with opson you shouldnt tell me that menedemos said she raised an eyebrow in surprise by the gods baukis you shouldnt he insisted you should go right into the kitchen and tell sikon to his face she didnt have to think about that but dipped her head at once youre righti should i should and i will she got to her feet and strode into the kitchen as a hoplite might have gone into battle menedemos though wouldnt have watched a hoplite striding into battle in anything like the same way he had trouble reading her expression when she came out again well he asked he asked me how much wine id had and if id bothered putting any water in it at all that man baukis looked as if she didnt know whether to be furious or to burst out laughing after a moment laughter won whats so funny philodemos called from the bottom of the stairs menedemos got to his feet hail father good day sir baukis added prim as a young wife should have been whats so funny menedemos father asked again baukis explained philodemos listened then chuckled let me understand you my dear he said after a moment you went in to sikon and told him this and then he said that to you thats right sir baukis answered it was menedemos idea was it menedemos father gave him a long look well good for you he said at last good for both of you in fact high time everyone remembers were all living in the same house here he went into the kitchen to get his own breakfast thank you menedemos baukis said quietly why he said i didnt do anythingyou did he smiled at her she smiled back looking as happy as hed seen her since she came into the household philodemos walked out munching on a roll a cup of wine in his other hand did i tell you son im going to a symposion at xanthos tonight he said youre invited too if you care to come along no thanks menedemos said at once miming an enormous yawn philodemos chuckled again i told his slave i was pretty sure you had another engagement he said but i did think id let you know about it the wine and the food and the entertainers will be good no doubt sir but the price is listening to one of xanthos windy speeches or maybe more than one menedemos replied thats more than i care to pay thank you very much and with sikon in the kitchen the food here will be good too so it will baukis agreed sounding as if she really was working hard to give the cook proper credit menedemos wondered how long that would last but was willing even eager to enjoy it while it did philodemos looked pleased too hed seemed cheerful ever since he got up unusually so menedemos recalled the creaking bed the night before all right then his father said ive done my dutyive told you about the symposion past that its up to you thank you for giving me so much sea room menedemos meant it his father more often preferred to bark orders than to let him make his own choices ordering him to xanthos would have gone a bit far even for philodemos but it wouldnt have been out of the question knowing as much menedemos tried to be thoughtful too i wish it were the season for cabbage to help you with your headache tomorrow the only thing that really helps one of those headaches is a little more wine if your stomach can stand it his father said but then as he seldom did he realized he was turning down kind words from menedemos and checked himself thanks he added gruffly raw cabbage is better than nothing i will say that dressed in his best chiton but still barefoot as befit a man whod spent a good many years at sea himself philodemos went off to xanthos house late that afternoon menedemos knew hed come reeling home sometime in the middle of the night a beribboned wreath on his hand songs on his lips and a torchbearer or two lighting his way through the dark streets of rhodes and here i am staying home menedemos thought which of us is the old man and which the young then he reminded himself where his father was going hed used the right word in describing those speeches more winds lurked in xanthos house than in the oxhide sack king aiolos had given to odysseus to help him make his way homewardand they would all come out tonight too menedemos laughed sure enough he liked his choice better than his fathers he was pretty sure he had a better supper than his fathers too no matter what xanthos cook turned out sikon brought a fine stingray back from the market he baked it sicilian style with cheese and silphium from kyrene hed also baked some light fluffy bread of wheat flour for sitos replete menedemos said this is luxury the great kings of persia couldnt top the cook leaned toward him and said and your fathers wife didnt grumble about the fish either you ask me thats the best luxury of all after supper with night already fallen menedemos went up to his bedroom but a full belly didnt make him sleepy as it often did he tossed and turned for a while then put on his chiton again and went back downstairs to the courtyard to wait for his father he could tease him about how drunk he was and boast of the lovely ray philodemos had missed everything was dark and cool and quiet sikon and the other slaves had long since gone to sleep blowing clouds drifted past the moon hiding it more often than not though the rain still held off a nightjar flew past overhead its croaking call put menedemos in mind of a frog an owl hooted in the distance even farther off a dog barked and then another menedemos yawned now that he was out of bed he felt like getting back into it laughing at himself he started toward the stairs then he stopped in surprise for someone else was coming down to the courtyard seeing his motion baukis stopped in surprise too right at the foot of the stairway whos there she called quietly and then as the moon came out from behind one of those clouds oh is that you menedemos i was going to wait for your father so was i he answered we can wait together if you like well keep each other awakei was getting sleepy out here by myself all right baukis walked over to the bench in the courtyard arent you cold in just your chiton she asked im chilly and ive got a mantle on not me he said sitting down beside her you can always spot a sailor in a crowd hell be the barefoot fellow who never bothers with a himation the only reason i take a mantle aboard the aphrodite is to use it for a blanket when i sleep aboard ship oh she said that owl hooted again another cloud slid in front of the moon she looked toward the entrance i wonder how long it will be before philodemos comes home probably a good while yet said menedemos who had considerable experience of symposia xanthos isnt the type to order a strong mix to the wine so people will have to do a lot of drinking before they get properly drunk and before he brings out the flutegirls and the dancing girls and the acrobats or whoever else hes hired from the brothelkeeper baukis voice stayed quiet but she couldnt keep a snarl from it well yes menedemos knew he sounded uncomfortable thats what men do at symposia i know baukis packed the two words with devastating scorn any answer would have been worse than none menedemos didnt even shrug the moon came out again its pale light showed baukis angrily staring down at the ground between her feet something small skittered over by the andron her head swung toward it so did menedemos just a mouse he said i suppose so she said and then hunching her shoulders a little i am cold before he thought he slipped an arm around her she sighed and slid closer to him the next moment they were kissing his hands stroking her hair her hand caressing his cheek the soft firm flesh of her breasts pressed maddeningly against him and the moment after that they flew apart as if each found the other redhot we cant baukis gasped we dont dare menedemos agreed his heart thudded hard in his chest but oh darling how i want to so do baukis tossed her head she wasnt going to admit that perhaps not even to herself she changed course i know you do dear mene she tossed her head again i know you do but we cant we mustnt the scandal im trying to bei want to bea proper wife to your father and if anyone sees us if anyone saw us she looked around in alarm i know menedemos said grimly oh by the gods how i know and i know it isnt right and i know he sprang to his feet and ran up the stairs taking them two and three at a time even in the dark careless of a stumble he shut the door to his room and barred it as if to lock temptation away but it was there inside with him inside him and now that he knew it dwelt in his fathers wife too he lay down again but he didnt sleep quite a while later philodemos came home baukis greeted him as if nothing at all were wrong menedemos knew he would have to do the same in the morning it wouldnt be easy he also knew that knew it all too well from now on nothing in the world would be easy historical note the sacred land is set in bc menedemos himself is a historical figure sostratos and the other members of their families are fictional other real people who appear in the novel are ptolemaios brother menelaos areios the kitharist and hekataios of abdera historical figures mentioned in the novel but not actually on stage include ptolemaios antigonos lysimakhos kassandros philip of macedons daughter kleopatra king nikokreon of salamis and his victims stratonikos the kitharist and anaxarkhos of abdera hekataios of abderas account of the jews survives though just barely diodorus siculus quoted him fairly extensively in his universal history written in the first century bc that part of diodorus work does not itself exist in the original but was in turn excerpted by the byzantine scholarpatriarch photios in the ninth century ad how closely photios excerpt of diodorus excerpt of hekataios work resembles the latter remains a subject of scholarly debate and it obviously will never be answered in full without a miraculously fortunate papyrus find hekataios worked in egypt he probably did not in fact go up into palestine itself but a novelist is entitled to bend history a bit now and again as usual in this series ive spelled most names of places and people as a greek would have thus lykia not lycia kassandros not cassander ive broken this rule for toponyms that have wellestablished english spellings rhodes cyprus and so on ive also broken it for alexander the great and philip of macedon the two great macedonians dominate this period even though alexander was about fifteen years dead when the sacred land begins also as usual translations from the greek are for better or worse my own
